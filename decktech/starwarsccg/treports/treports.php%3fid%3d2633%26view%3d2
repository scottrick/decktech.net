Havent played in a tourney since states two months ago (before Tatooine). Only have 10 packs of Tatooine to my name. Feel like playing some SWCCG. Check out Decipher&#146;s site. See a tourney posted at This Island Earth aka This Hole in the Wall in pittsburgh. Decide to make the drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PART ONE - THE INTRO<br />
NO GAME DETAIL HERE<br />
<br />
<br />
So I wanted to play in this tournament, considering my cards have been rotting away for the past two months save a few random AIM games (props chris). I check decktech for decks and build some of the top ten decks and they are all good and boring, so i decide to make my own. i almost used put your @#$% on the table but i couldnt find my only yoda =/<br />
<br />
i put together a bhbm sac deck with twixes for activation, yeah wys kills both of those but so what. dark is just a toss-up now anyway. i also have speed deal built in case i want to play a blah deck.<br />
<br />
then for light i make a hidden mains deck, still has staging areas cuz who plays the counter for that? nobody thats who. its a pretty good, pretty fun deck. not broken like the best light decks are right now but good and fun.<br />
<br />
i show up to this hole in the wall around 1230, tourney is scheduled to start at 1. borrow a qui&#146;s saber from director dean degrazia and he gives me an AI version. then later he left and forgot to take it back. dammit. also peel a dont do that again from him because well i didnt even own the card.<br />
<br />
dean is out of command cards so i give him the last 6 i had on me and we get started shortly after 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
PART DEUX - THE REAL DEAL<br />
ACTUAL GAME DETAIL INCLUDED<br />
<br />
Tourney was 4 games, 18 guys showed up. As you can tell by browsing the ratings of the guys i played, nobody that showed up really had a prayer of beating me (save one guy who knows who he is). Dont take that the wrong way - that&#146;s just the way it is.<br />
<br />
Here we go<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
me: BHBM vs<br />
Patrick Johnson (sub-1500): RTP<br />
<br />
he starts the 3rd anth leia and signals for echo base garrison. Im playing two Alters and praying I draw one opening hand. And i do.<br />
<br />
first turn i activate 6 (!) and put palpy at his death star docking bay, alter garrison (huge) and drop janus from hand. yippee. i think i drew a twix and deployed it too.<br />
<br />
his turn he goes and DEMOTES JANUS and i am livid. then he draws.<br />
<br />
i drain, pull force lightning, blah blah. im looking for another alter to take out the stupid DEMOTION.<br />
<br />
he activates and draws.<br />
<br />
i spend the next five turns looking for an ALTER and i just cant get one but oh well, at least i drew one opening hand when it counted. he just putzes around looking for 8D8 i guess. he eventually drops epp obi (barriered) and epp han on my janus and palpy, doesnt battle because of the barrier. i drop iggy, fry obi with flightning used and capture him, beat the piss out of han for some overflow (and a card under insignificant).<br />
<br />
then he puts epp luke in front of palpy/janus along with some other scrub, i get the IHYN action going so i draw 3 BD and he swings at iggy and misses, that clears his side and i get away with losing only my DEMOTED, POWER = 0 JANUS......<br />
<br />
I sensed every interrupt he played all game.<br />
<br />
I put lord vader and a saber on the yavin docking bay to try and speed his demise, he puts cok there with his bowcaster but i levitate that @#$% and beat the piss out of the wookiee. he loses 8D8 off top somewhere in the battle damage of these three fights and curses as that is of course his only way to rescue leia. shes still there when i count up my differential. FW by 30ish<br />
<br />
Thumbs up: first-turn ALTER on the garrison. EPP Obi being defense value = 1 thanks to YCHF and FLightning<br />
<br />
Thumbs down: DEMOTION ON JANUS, Cok taking on vader??<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2<br />
me: hidden mains vs<br />
Jason Tomko (1699): ralops overseeing<br />
<br />
Of course i didnt put friggin Ounee Ta in my deck. He starts IAO, Mob Points and tint/oe so i start insurrection, staging, and Dont Play Mob Points Again.<br />
<br />
His first turn he activates a humongo 2, gets a site and the DS2 dbay, and draws.<br />
<br />
I get Dagobah, Yoda&#146;s hut, and the homo one dbay and draw a little. I have Qui and Saber in hand so I am happy.<br />
<br />
Second turn we each set up a little more, then third turn he puts Palpatine down at his Prefect&#146;s Office and deploys Overseeing it Personally on him. well screw that down comes Qui with his saber (Jason tells me he is deploy +2 and i tell him he&#146;s a putz), i swing and miss (damned) and draw low battle destiny and he draws high so i think he lost one card? yeah cuz Palpy is power +1 at prefect&#146;s office.<br />
<br />
Then he goes and drops Officer Evax and Commander Igar to the Prefect&#146;s office, no big deal you say? initiate, play Dark Jedi Presence and of course I dont have one of my two Throw me Anothers in hand so Evax is power 2 + 1 for prefect&#146;s office x 2 = SIX and Igar is EIGHT and palpy is 5 and his BD was high so i had to lose Qui and like 5 more. Plus i failed to hit the emperor again (wtf?) so all he lost was evax. Sheeeeeyit now im behind. Plus I lose the CC dockbay to battle damage so no off edging for me =(<br />
<br />
I have Capn Han and EPP Leia in hand along with Menace Fades tho so im thinking i should be ok, if i can just find a Falcon. Well not to ruin anything for you, but I did NOT draw a Falcon the ENTIRE game. I ended up tossing BOTH my Capn Hans from hand to drains and the Falcons were both in my reserve at the end of the game...... oops maybe i ruined too much there ;-)<br />
<br />
ok so i do some drawing and suck some drains. Tomko thinks Overseeing works at same site as palpy and i again tell him hes a putz. he makes us call the director over anyway. whatever.<br />
<br />
he spreads out on ralltiir, colonel davod jon is at the @#$%ing &lt;&gt; forest all by his lameass self, then there&#146;s an at-st with lord vader at the &lt;&gt; dockbay while palpy holds down the prefect&#146;s office and igar and lt. cmmndr Arden are at the &lt;&gt; spaceport street. I got LSJK and his stick so i drop him at the homo one dbay and put epp obi for 7 to the &lt;&gt; dbay. then lsjk comes over. we battle and vader dies (obi too). at that point he has 6 cards in lost pile and i have an OOC/TT in hand. I play it. I pick a card. It&#146;s Vader.<br />
<br />
Yay.<br />
<br />
but he still has 3 sites with guys and is still ahead thanks to the DJP beatdown on Queer-Gon. plus i can only drain for one with luke thanks to flipped ROps and I cant draw a FALCON &gt;=0<br />
<br />
he gets a drain of 5 in with Overseeing it and pulls a card and all that crap. doesnt draw much, but saves a bunch.<br />
<br />
i do get the spiral tho so i put it with no pilots to Corulag and move it over to Ralltiir to flip him back. i have a barrier to protect it. then i move LSJK in front of Igar and Arden at the &lt;&gt; Street. i also put out menace fades but ralltiir isnt a BG system now is it?<br />
<br />
he drains for 3 and drops some other schmuck on lsjk, the three chumps battle him and the jedi kills them all with tracked destiny. and he&#146;s immune to the attrition so i only lose like 3 from hand. this puts me back further but i needed to keep luke alive.<br />
<br />
i drop epp obi with more tracked destiny and kill palpy (yes)<br />
<br />
he drops the chimaera with no pilots on the spiral and i just lose the spiral.<br />
<br />
i get some drains in and find my other qui-gon and order to engage.<br />
<br />
he still has davod jon at the freaking forest draining me and he puts some chump imperials on a skiff at the &lt;&gt; dbay and maul at a &lt;&gt; site and moves some guys around and flips again. and he moves the chimaera to drain at corulag (no falcon, remember?)<br />
<br />
i drop order to be gay and put qui-gon in front of davod jon. then move luke in front of the two guys on the skiff at the &lt;&gt; dockbay. I have tracked destiny and a fallen portal.<br />
<br />
he drains then battles at the &lt;&gt; dbay, i portal all but a 2/2 guy who gets hit by a saber. BD is a 5 and he loses everything plus lots of overflow. colonel davod jon thinks he has huge nuts and battles qui-gon, oops im still tracking destiny and he gets beat up. flip back! maul moves over in front of qui but whatever, i am now in control.<br />
<br />
i on the edge luke once for five and drain with him and qui, he put some more guys on ralltiir but jedi and order to engage took care of them. I had another EPP Obi for him too. just wish i had found the falcon....<br />
<br />
i @#$%ed with this guy all game but the highlight of the game was when he put U3PO to the same site as LSJK and Corran (oh yeah i had corran down there for a while), that blocked the drain for one turn and then i broke U3PO with corran. well then a couple turns later he tried to move U3PO, totally forgetting about corran or something. Im like &quot;dude, you cant move U3PO, hes mine now.&quot; he thought i was JOKING and, saying not a word, moved U3PO again. I put him back and was like &quot;hes MINE, you cant move him&quot; then he moved 3PO AGAIN and im like &quot;stop already&quot; and hes like &quot;you stop&quot; and then i realize he doesnt know what the hell&#146;s going on and i explain it to him all slow-like so he understands. this was late in the game and we had drawn quite a crowd and everyone was laughing and he was kinda embarrassed but it was funny as all hell, him moving 3PO then me moving him back, then him moving him again....<br />

thumbs up: to come-from behind victories and OOC&#146;ing vader 1 in 6 shot.<br />
<br />
thumbs down: colonel davod jon, not having ounee ta, and not finding the falcon<br />
<br />
<br />
lunch break ensues and i eat some of the greasiest pizza i have ever had in my life. there were literal PUDDLES of grease on these pizzas. yeesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
me: BHBM vs<br />
Eric M (sub-1500): hidden base without hidden base with 84 xwings<br />
<br />
Somehow this kid got lucky and won his first two games really big. So i have to play him third game =/ he starts rendezvous point and signals for rebel fleet (!) im thinking repeat of the first game with a first turn alter.<br />
<br />
i draw my 8 and BOOM there&#146;s an alter so i activate, pull endor dockbay, put Palpy down there and ALTER the fleet but this kid has a @#$%ing dagobah control for me. @#$%. i asked him later and he said its the only one in his deck. @#$%in a.<br />
<br />
he drops 5 (no joke) xwings free to the rendezvous point and draws.<br />
<br />
i drain with palpy and drop janus. start using his text to look for ships or alters (never found another).<br />
<br />
he just draws the next 3 turns while cancelling my drains with the fleet and dropping more xwings to the point. i pull evader/monnok and play it lost when he has 9 cards in hand. 5 of them were xwings (?) i janus, search, etc until i have all three of my ships in hand and all my anti-retrieval: secret plans, chybc, and yes ladies and gentlemen: IMBALANCE. i deploy the two effects and get no reaction.<br />
<br />
he finally whips out kessel system and moves all his xwings (8 of them) there. well i get the cantina out with MJ and saber for a drain of three which he cancels but at least my janus drain is getting through. so we are trading drains for a couple turns and im saving force and tracking destiny. I put my three ships (bossk, fett, and zuckuss) at kessel finally and leave them there to block the drain. i have an overload in hand to stop xwing cannon junk. he battles and plays orgy attack but i sense. my BD takes out two xwings, yippee. i lose fett. next turn he clears my side off with no overflow.<br />
<br />
then he tries to all wings once per game when he has no force pile and the only BG he occupies is kessel. remember when i deployed secret plans and chybc? i put them there for a REASON. he goes to retrieve like 93 and i say no way jose.<br />
<br />
then i figure he probably doesnt even have a luke in his deck and i put vader down on endor .. of course he doesnt have luke in his deck! your destiny speeds up the inevitable. wish i had a counter assault.<br />
<br />
FW by teens/20ish<br />
<br />
thumbs up: first turn alters on starting effects both games.<br />
<br />
thumbs down: 84239752380498 xwings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last Game, i promise<br />
me: hidden mains vs<br />
same kid: endor is my starting location and i build the death star 2 but i dont start with operational as planned.<br />
<br />
i dont know HOW this kid got to play me in both of my last games. but it pissed me off. not to mention this kid had his cards all mixed up, none were facing the same way which bothered the hell out of me at first. i even fixed them for him when i counted his deck but he INTENTIONALLY mixed them back up. then i realized: this kid doesnt have a prayer against me anyway. but then he started turning my cards the wrong way when cutting my deck, and THAT really riled me. so i PUT MY @#$% ON THE TABLE and that stopped him in his tracks.<br />
<br />
oh yeah and before the game we had this little conversation, went like this:<br />
<br />
me: &quot;i really dont want to play you again. why dont we just say i win by .... 22? and cut the foreplay&quot;<br />
<br />
him: &quot;no way&quot;<br />
<br />
me: &quot;cmon&quot;<br />
<br />
him: &quot;no&quot;<br />
<br />
me: &quot;fine. im going to beat you by WORSE than 22; you will look back and wish you had made a deal!&quot;<br />
<br />
anyway i really wish i had strike planning in my deck because it would have been great to start that against this kid and give him ONE force first turn. but i didnt, so i started insurrection/staging/insight instead. I got an @#$% draw, only character was epp leia. he started three effects: squadron assignments, the weapon forfeiting effect and some other worthless card.<br />
<br />
his first turn he activated 3 and deployed fighter cover. I&#146;m like &quot;get that @#$% outta my face&quot; cuz he didnt occupy a battleground system.<br />
<br />
the next few turns were him activating 5 and drawing. for my first two turns, i searched reserve and all EIGHT jedi were there =( but i got the superfalcon together pretty quick.<br />
<br />
i finally get LSJK down to the homo one dbay and lev for his saber, then i transit him over to cloud city. about the same time he gets dagobah bossk out to endor on dagobah hounds tooth (both from hand) then he tries to pull fett from deck with slave 1 in hand but he doesnt have enough force. bleh. he also deploys his stupid admiral&#146;s order.<br />
<br />
i get a couple drains in with LSJK and he loses a vader from somewhere. he has 7 cards in there and i have OOC/TT in hand. i play it. i pick a card. It&#146;s Vader. YEAHHH<br />
<br />
i drop the superfalcon on bossk and play order to be gay. dont battle because i want him to lose force.<br />
<br />
he drops IG in ship and tries to squad @#$% for baron fel but hes not there either so bossk and iggy square off against the falcon. homocles tries to add 1 to attrition with dagobah bossk and im like &quot;eat a @#$%&quot; but i would be immune to the 3 and 2 he drew anyway thanks to his AO. I draw insane destiny and clear those @#$%es out.<br />
<br />
i drain with luke and the falcon for a few turns while he draws this monster @#$% hand.<br />
<br />
finally he drops death star 2 and two of the sectors, milwaukee, SFS, and one of the emperor&#146;s squads to the DS2 for 3 retrieval. I move the superfalcon over next turn.<br />
<br />
he pulls fett from deck with slave 1 and we battle, but slave 1 w/fett piloting and emperor&#146;s squad against superfalcon = dead slave 1 and emperor&#146;s squad. not to mention i had i know adding two BD. I drain him for 7 a turn and on/off edge after that to wrap this one up.<br />
<br />
fw by 30 (hell yeah)<br />
<br />
<br />
thumbs up: beating the kid by 30<br />
<br />
thumbs down: playing a sub-1500 player BOTH of the last two games of a 4-game tourney.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PART THREE - THE WRAP UP<br />
POST-TOURNEY DETAIL, PROPS<br />
<br />
My undefeatedness and large differential win the tourney for me and i peel a twilek foil. second place went to drew &quot;i want to be brian hunter&quot; ferguson, the second-highest-rated player there, whom i didnt even get to play because he won all his games by like 3. and he was same side as me in the last round =/<br />
<br />
he and i did play a &quot;final duel&quot; after the tourney and his light won by 15, then my light won by 13 due to me putting LSJK on CLOUD CITY instead of a destiny-1 character so i could actually OFF THE EDGE.<br />
<br />
ok here we go:<br />
<br />
PRRRRRRRRRRRROPS<br />
Dean Degrazia aka Red 82 aka Big Daddy Dean for directing<br />
my first opponent for a fun game<br />

dave monteiro for the hell of it<br />
twilek foil<br />
OOC&#146;ing vader in both my light games<br />
drew ferguson for opening a pack of tat for me and pulling a maul. i now own 14 packs of tatooine and have 2 quis (one AI) and a maul. not bad.<br />
