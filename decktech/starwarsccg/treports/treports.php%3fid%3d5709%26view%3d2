Bespin Regional, Saturday.<br />
<br />
DS: Senate<br />
LS: Senate<br />
<br />
Game 1, LS senate vs Tyler Vastag. (Mystril)<br />
<br />
Tyler is a player who has been around for a while and has a very respectable history in state/regional tournaments in the last few years, and given the fact that he knows a lot more about the meta than I do, I figure this was one of the tougher matchups I could&#39;ve drawn.<br />
<br />
I contemplate how to lay out my sites upon seeing his start.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it&#39;s better to keep the senate off to the side, to make it less likely that he will attack me there; Or if it was better to keep the senate between the exterior sites and the JCC, so that he would have a much harder time reaching JCC to drain.  I ended up deciding to put JCC in the middle, so the sites are <imp. city> <jcc> <senate>.<br />
<br />
First turn he drops the 1/1 Coruscant db and moves Shadda over, and starts putting cards back to his used pile, while I&#39;m having flashbacks of a 29 point buttwhooping at a PA states eons ago at the hands of Tennet&#39;s Gay Deck (tm).  I don&#39;t think I flipped first turn, but just drew a couple cards.  His second turn I take 2 to drain and 1 to objective, and he moves Shadda over to the JCC.<br />
<br />
My turn I flip with Mothma and a random senator, pull endor, pull hologram.  He drains at JCC, it gets canceled, but he dropps quietly observing, meanwhile no objective damage because he&#39;s not at a battleground, but he stays flipped.  I take one more turn to get out a full complement of political effects and draw some more cards, his next drain at JCC can&#39;t be canceled, but gets reduced to 2 by ultimatum shield.<br />
<br />
My turn finally Obi joins the party at JCC, easily kills Shadda, not sure what was going on but I don&#39;t remember Tyler playing any evasion cards this battle, or any battle.  However, with him getting 2 destiny and no senator palpy out, I don&#39;t do too much overflow.  So with six cards in his lost pile, I try to end the game by playing the OOCs in my hand, every one of the three missed Shadda.  I think Tyler must have grabbed something earlier, maybe Might, or the AJR that I played to get Obi back after the battle, because OOC didn&#39;t get grabbed all game.<br />
<br />
To make things even dumber, not only did I not get Shadda with any of my 3 OOCs, but she ended up on top of his lost pile, so no escape next turn brings her back to Tyler&#39;s hand, and at some point Shadda and Guri come out to play at the 1/1 DB.  <br />
<br />
I think I setup in space with corran on r2 in red 5, and then go after Shadda again with another EPP.  Once again everyone for Tyler dies, so now Shadda #1 is buried.  Tyler never did get to play Shadda #2 because I track the OOCs and play them fairly frequently, and Shadda eventually gets taken out of play.  The rest of the game involves me draining at endor and maybe a site on coruscant, Tyler dropping guys to fight me so he can retrive from his scum and my dtf.  But it&#39;s senate vs Mystril without Shadda, so eventually he succumbs to the drains.  <br />
<br />
FW by 21.  2 (+21)<br />
<br />
Highs: picking the right way to stack my sites at the start.  With ultimatum limiting the JCC drain to 2, and him not occupying a battle ground while he tries to drain there, I realized that I definitly prefer someone playing mystril to go to the JCC rather than stay at the 1/1/ db.<br />
Lows: 6 card lost pile, 3 OOCs in hand, 0 Shadda selected.<br />
<br />
Game 2, DS senate vs Alden Peterson (Jedi Training, Mains)<br />
<br />
Alden is a very good player, but hasn&#39;t played in almost a year, he says he just threw together some junk without knowing much about the meta.  I owe Alden a lot since he lent me two decks that together went 6-0 at wisconsin states two years ago, and a LS deck that went 3-0 at MN states (or was it bespin regionals?) last year.<br />
<br />
I start Naboo and flip first turn, and start setting up ships at Naboo.  Meanwhile he&#39;s getting plenty of force also and gets out Jedi Test 1 second turn for daughter and yoda.  I drain 2 and yeb yeb a card, but his turn he completes JT 1 and retrives all three.  I haven&#39;t the slightest clue what to do now.  Eventually I get out the senator that lets me do 1 direct damage a turn at Naboo, but I&#39;m doing a total of 4 damage a turn even if I use yeb yeb, and he&#39;s retriving 3 virtually every turn for completing jedi tests.  Mostly I skip even doing any damage, since I figured all it does is let him cycle cards from his hand back to his reserve.<br />
<br />
I end up just stacking stuff at Naboo and waiting for him to complete the tests.  My senate deck plays slightly more ships than your normal ktod senate build, so I have a nice setup at Naboo with enough stuff that I thought I should be able to hold the location even when he flips and get a destiny 6 on test 5.  No subtracting 3 from his draws for me, but I got a lot of power and was holding on to stuff in my hand to draw a ton of destiny when he does go to Naboo.  There are no other battlegrounds in play.<br />
<br />
I also play Premiere Vader (v) in this senate, for the synergy between that -3 to draws and the senate -3 to draws.  Since I have you are beaten in hand, I don&#39;t fear a fury and drop Vader to the stuff at Naboo also.  I figure when he comes at me, I have plenty of forfeit, and 4-lom and fett bh in hand to strike back.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I forget about Jedi Test 6, which makes me lose 2 a turn until Vader is at a BG site.  There being no BG sites, I&#39;m kinda screwed.  He never comes at Naboo all game... after test 5 I start draining at Naboo, but he comes at me at the senate and tells me that the -6 does apply to his weapon draws when he uses the destiny on test 5.  Time ends up getting called.<br />
<br />
I had 21 cards in life force, Alden had 22.  The game was kind of flowing his way also and I think if we played it out, maybe 2 hours later he would&#39;ve won :-)  So I drawing up. <br />
<br />
FL by 22, 2 (-1)<br />
<br />
Highs: We joked around, talked some smack, just generally had a good time the entire game.<br />
Lows: I&#39;m an IDIOT!!!!  If you were reading this game report and thinking What the hell is wrong with you Jim Li!!!??, well I concure.  What I should&#39;ve done is flip first turn, and start looking for 2 cards with lott dot.  Zuckuss in ship, and Maul.  If I get Maul over to Dagobah Jungle prior to him finishing jedi test three, game over.  Assuming I couldn&#39;t get zuckuss that fast, I could&#39;ve waited at Dagobah until he starts test 5, then land at whatever site test 5 is at, and once again, game over.  I dunno why I didn&#39;t even think about that, the path to victory was so simple.<br />
<br />
Game 3, LS Senate vs. Someone (umm. Fear with Ties and sienar fleet)<br />
<br />
There were 30 people, and I haven&#39;t played in a long time, so I apologize for not remember who this guy was.  <br />
<br />
I thought this might actually be a real Fear deck, which would make for an interesting matchup, but his first turn he uses cross fire for a sienar fleet system, which clued me in to the fact that he wasn&#39;t playing a very good deck.  I go drain at the 3/2 Naboo site, he tries to fear with people at waukeelmui and alderaan... but even I knew that wasn&#39;t gonna fly.  I also end up kicking him out of kiffex with someone on the virtual plusar skate.  The game wasn&#39;t that interesting.<br />
<br />
FW +34, 4 (+33)<br />
Highs: umm... building diff I suppose<br />
Lows: I let him replace three ties with a squadron, and retrive for SFS, which apparently ain&#39;t kosher.<br />
<br />
Game 4, DS vs Brady Moore (WYS)<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t really know Brady at all until we drove down together to WI States 2 weeks ago.  He&#39;s a very cool guy, intelligent and has a job in the oil industry, so we listened to some good insights on how the oil refining process works during the drive to and from WI States.  Unfortunately, he looks to Raveling for deck building advice for some reason, that&#39;s just bad... plus I think he might be a republican :-)<br />
<br />
I start Maul&#39;s landing site and flip early, and so does he with guys at Kessel and Tatooine.  I cancel the drain at Kessel and wait a while to setup, he&#39;s only doing 1 damage a turn.  After a few turns I come down hard on his guys at tatooine, Baron w/ gun, DV(v) piloting black 2, and maybe a capital ship or zuckuss, and clear him out of tatooine.  He never did come to ground with the threat of a maul beatdown on whatever little guys he puts out.  <br />
<br />
FW +something in the 20s.  6 (+lost track at this point)<br />
<br />
Highs: the way Senate vs. WYS is supposed to go.<br />
Lows: not a whole lot, good guy, fun to play, good to beat :-)<br />
<br />
Game 5, LS vs. Daniel Lynn? (Lind?) (DS Combat, but not combatting and only dueling)<br />
<br />
Another guy I don&#39;t know.<br />
<br />
He starts DS saber combat, seems straightforward enough.  Except he starts Bad Feeling (v), so I&#39;m kind of confused.  I ask him uhh, so you can&#39;t combat me? and he says yeah, but I can still duel you... interesting.  His first turn, Maul comes down and pulls his double bladed saber from reserve.  I know I should pretty much expect that from DS Saber Combat, but it&#39;s still a little bit intimidating.  I look at his cards, so it&#39;s a drain of 4 I can&#39;t cancel, and with only one dark jedi on Naboo, the combat shield wasn&#39;t doing me much good, so okay, I gotta take care of that drain some how.<br />
<br />
With all that force, I have no problems flipping first turn, I get out corran on a ship at Naboo again for drains early.  I would&#39;ve preferred to get Luke on the ship so that I could still use Corran to go at his mains on Naboo without fear of dueling, but Corran was all I had early so he had to do.  He&#39;s pulling combat cards every turn from his deck, and cancelling my drain of three with some card that let&#39;s him stack the card under Maul for combat, and then lose it to cancel a drain.  I can&#39;t go after him with any of my guys &#39;cos i&#39;ll just get dueled.  <br />
<br />
I&#39;m draining, putting cards back, and drawing for EPPs and AJRs, but one turn I top deck two of them to my lost pile.  Luckily I have a might in hand, and three senators out, so I get the AJRs back.  Meanwhile he gets prophetess out with Maul, keeps paying for 3 to drain, and keeps burning force to pull dueling cards.  He never deployed a location other than his two starting ones, so he&#39;s getting force choked pretty hard.<br />
<br />
Finally, after way too many turns of eating drains of 4 goes by, I get the cards I need in hand.  The plan is to drop an epp with maul, grab the dueling card, then resilience if the duel doesn&#39;t go my way.  I figured I shouldn&#39;t deploy Obi, since Obi has two dueling cards that can target him, where as Qui-gon and Luke each only have 1 that can target them.  I decide to drop Qui-Gon with Maul and Prophetess, despite the fact that he could just not duel Qui-Gon, but play Maul Strikes in battle instead, and it&#39;d be interesting to see if I&#39;d have to take overflow, and how much.  But he does play Maul Strikes to duel, he wins the duel, I AJR and he has no more dueling stuff, and Qui-Gon takes out both of his guys and gets my AJR back with DTF.<br />
<br />
From here on the game goes my way easily.  He&#39;s eating a drain of three at Endor, and being force choked badly.  He keeps dropping his Vader&#39;s and Mauls, but he can never draw enough to prevent the drain of 3 and then the pull 2 from leaving him with no hand.  When he has no hand, my EPPs can go and easily kill whatever he puts out, and the game is over and I actually retrive a decent amount of my lost pile with DTF.<br />
<br />
FW +29, 8 (+something)<br />
<br />
Highs: Formulating a plan, then executing it and seeing it work out.<br />
Lows: Drain of 4 from Maul for a bunch of turns at the start of the game.<br />
<br />
Game 6, DS vs Tom Frafjord (WYS Racing)<br />
<br />
He starts WYS racing, and squassin.<br />
<br />
Game pretty much proceeds the same way as Game 4 against Brady.  He sets up at Kessel and Tatooine, I cancel the drain at Kessel and take some time to set up.  He wins the race fairly early with good draws.  At this point we both have only 2 cards in lost pile.  Clearly the right play was to drop racing shield, let him retrive his two while I have to lose nothing.  However, I go searching thru my shields and I guess I took racing shield out!  I ended up playing secret plans and then eating the force loss of 6.  In retrospect I don&#39;t know if I even should&#39;ve played secret plans, it may have been wiser to save the shield and just let him retrive two.  Also during this time he plays harvest (v) and drop han&#39;s toolkit, so my blast door controls and hovercam are suspended.<br />
<br />
Somewhere along the way Tom also drops scrambled transmission, and loses 2 to make me burn my drain cancelling effect, bury it under a drain of 3 at kessel, and then makes me burn my +3 to bd effect.  I haven&#39;t seen a squabbling up to this point, so I can&#39;t get either effect back.  He lets me keep the other two the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
I could never really get a good hand going, with stuff I want getting topdecked at times from his drains and the original 6 force loss.  I&#39;m aware of Correlian Retort and what it can do against baron, so I don&#39;t make much of an effort to search for the sole Tie Cannon in my deck.  Eventually I go after his guys at Tatooine with baron w/ ship and Vader v on black 2, he loses someone and runs dash away to malastair.  Meanwhile he has Capt. Han, Melas, and Luke in R5 at Kessel.  <br />
<br />
Since I can no longer cancel the Kessel drain, I drop a dreadnaught,, and moves everyone over to kessel.  I think about how to disembark my ships from the dreadnaught, whether I should have vader on the dread, so all my ships have immunity and I may have everyone survive the battle, or if I should put vader on the black 2 again so he can&#39;t play short range fighters, I end up going with Vader on the dread, and black 2 docked.  His turn he battles and plays the card where falcon is power +2 and is totally immune to attrition.  That turned things his way because even tho&#39; I played I Have You Now and drew 4 destiny, I didn&#39;t overpower him by that much, and only luke in ship has to die to satisfy battle damage.  Meanwhile, he draws high enough with his 3 destinies that even tho&#39; I get to subtract three from two of his draws, I have 7 attrition, my immunity is moot and Vader dies.  His turn he moves Capt. Han over to Tatooine.<br />
<br />
Once again this game gets to time, Tom has about 20 cards left, while I have something in the mid teens, I draw up and give him the full win even though it didn&#39;t matter to him, he was the only undefeated whether I drew up or not.<br />
<br />
FL something in the 20s, 8 (+something)<br />
Highs: umm, nothing<br />
Lows: Seems to me the game might have went differently if I dropped Maul at the cantina at the earliest opportunity so I could drain there... but then again, once the maul beatdown threat was gone, he might have gotten guys out on the ground also for battle order.  Also, not packing a racing shield.<br />
<br />
I end up finishing 4th, the three players higher than me were Tom, Tyler Vastag, and Mike Raveling.  Tom and Mike already had byes, and since there were two byes on the line for this event, I get the second one.  I beat out Alden by 2 differential for the last bye.  (Sorry Alden)<br />
<br />
So LS senate went 3-0, and I felt comfortable playing it.  While DS senate went 1-2.  I decided to screw senate and re-build the HD deck I played for WI states.  It&#39;s your standard Back Door variety.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
MN States, Sunday<br />
<br />
LS: Senate<br />
DS: HD<br />
<br />
Game 1: <br />
<br />
I had a tough matchup against Mr. Bye, after a game that swung back and forth, I pulled out a close victory.<br />
<br />
2 (+0)<br />
<br />
Game 2, DS vs Dave McCune? (Rescue the Princess)<br />
<br />
No Vader in opening hand, I did have Blizz 4 but he played the professor, so I didn&#39;t have enough force to drop Blizz 4 and go get Vader, so no first turn flip.  I accelerate to get the flagship.  I see that I have both fondor and back door in reserve, but I also have a empy in my force pile.  I don&#39;t go searching for Fondor and just draw to get palpy... I hear force lighting on Leia is good against RTP :-) we both lose 1.<br />
<br />
His first turn he drops drops virtual Artoo to y4 db, eopie there, lift tube at D* db, db transit artoo to D*, and then lift tube him over to leia&#39;s site, we both lose 1.  My turn I think about where to drop empy, I think you&#39;re supposed to drop him at Y4 DB to try to kill Leia, but I saw no reason why I couldn&#39;t kill Leia at the prison site, so I drop empy there, fish out back door and fondor.  End of my turn we both lose 1.<br />
<br />
His turn he plays whatever that interrupt is that let&#39;s him get devices from sideboard and gets restraining bolt, and frees Leia with artoo... this is when we had to call Garrett for a ruling question.  He wants to free Leia to the lift tube, where I couldn&#39;t FL him.  I thought that when a prisoner was freed, he had to go to the site and not to a vehicle at the site... Garrett rules my way, but it didn&#39;t matter since I drew a 1 on my FL.  I forget to drop coward shield so he can&#39;t retrive, but he forgets to retrive for rescuing Leia anyways.  His deploy phase he drops restraining bolt on Artoo to cancel the text, then moves leia to db on the lift tube, get on the eopie and transit over to y4, and then move leia over to war room and he flips... okay, so second turn flip for RTP, time to figure out what to do.  End of turn we both lose 1. <br />
<br />
My turn I drop Janus w/ Empy, Blizz 4 at the D* db and play vader for 3.  pay 2 to move empy and Janus to d* db, and transit them all over to the Y4 DB.  His turn he drops an EPP at the site I think, no force to go search for IHYN, he hits empy and I have to lose blizz 4 to attrition, Blizz 4 and Empy goes to out of play pile.  Right now I&#39;m activating a pretty decent amount due to his sites and back door and fondor being out, while he has very few cards in hand and doesn&#39;t activate enough to scare me.  I elis Vader and Janus over to Leia battle, play I have you now... but I forget about the text for the Y4 war room, so I only draw 2 destiny instead of 3, while he draws one for Leia.  My battle, so I lose first and vader goes out of play, he loses some overflow, and then Leia last.  He uses wokling to retrive Leia, but she&#39;s buried somewhere in his reserve deck.  I think I might have forgotten something along the way, &#39;cos I know Maul was out of play too before Leia died.<br />
<br />
So now I have empy, blizz 4 and vader and Maul all out of play, but on his turn he has to draw to replenish his hand, while I get to drain for 2 at the war room, drop dr. e with janus, and zuckuss in ship to fondor.<br />
<br />
I drain him like this for a couple turns, he drops wyron serper and epp obi to my holotheater to cancel visage, but coward shield stops the drain.  After a few turns he drops another EPP with Janus and Dr. E and everyone dies, but my turn I just drop sidious and move him over to the drain +4 Y4 site.  He never did get Leia again to flip his objective, and I manage to drain him out before anything bigger happened.<br />
<br />
FW +20s, 4(+something)<br />
<br />
Game 3, DS vs. Peter Jacobson (WHAP)<br />
<br />
I sort of remember what to do against WHAP, but wasn&#39;t entirely certain.  As we were shuffling, I asked Peter should I go to your throne room? Or just go to my back door?  Peter told me I should go to his throne room... I&#39;m not quite sure if he was on the level and offering sound advice to a friend, or trying to trick me into something :-)<br />
<br />
I get 7 my first turn, so I activate, search for something with conduct your search and throw out blast door controls, spend 1 to get fondor, and drop vader to the throne room, he loses 1.<br />
<br />
His turn he plays panaka, some guy and amidala at the throne room, and battles me.  I go and choke amidala and draw a 7, saweet!!  battle destiny I think we both draw a one, which is also sweet &#39;cos I lose the battle by 1 and just lose a card, meanwhile he couldn&#39;t lose both his guys, so the scrub dies to attrition, panaka moves to the adjacent site and he has to top deck another card for visage.<br />
<br />
Speaking of sweet, my activation isn&#39;t too shabby at this point either, I get back door out also in case I need to drain there later, Maul with Panaka, kill him and make him lose like 9 overflow or something, Maul then moves over with Vader, visage damage is still hitting him.  I keep up the drains at the throne room, and the next turn Empy goes there, I also get a ship to fondor to drain him.<br />
<br />
Peter gets out Yoda with a Jedi LS, and some more scrubs and gets them together at the adjacent site, along with honor, while I haven&#39;t seen no escape.  So now he&#39;s paying to drain me for 2, while I&#39;m not paying to drain him for 3, but he&#39;s hitting me for damage with my own visage.  None-the-less, the early damage I put out means he&#39;s gotta come to me if he wants to win... I also have the advantage of being able to deploy some guys to back door to drain in case I need it, but for now we don&#39;t have anyone there.<br />
<br />
Peter finally moves his characters over to the throne room, albeit sans Amidala which means many of his scrub republic characters have text that aren&#39;t active.  My turn I drop Fett BH to the throne room to join Vader, Maul and Empy, and start a battle, but he plays It&#39;s a Trap.  He then plays disarmed on my maul, some card that cancel&#39;s vader&#39;s text so I can&#39;t choke, drops more guys, and battles me on his turn, and also glancing blows vader with yoda so he&#39;s power 0.  But even with those tricks, my dark jedis and Fett out power him, and somehow the destiny works out so that he once again can&#39;t forfeit everyone, and since he blew all of his wad this turn, he had no force left to move anyone away.<br />
<br />
My turn, game ending beatdown<br />
<br />
FW +20s, 6 (+something)<br />
<br />
Game 4, LS vs Mark Walseth (BHBM)<br />
<br />
Walseth is playing the anti senate BHBM... however I know he&#39;s already lost to Garrett and Raveling with the same deck against senate, so I figure I can do the same thing.<br />
<br />
His deck is basically full senate hate, he starts ability x3, but his first turn he doesn&#39;t pull the anti-amidala shield... he waits until my turn to pull it, which means he can&#39;t deploy astromech shortage... so umm okay, I drop mothma to JCC, and pull endor to up my generation.<br />
<br />
I drop Corran on one of the ships to endor to drain, epp quigon goes and kills off empy (v) #1 who was camping out at the senate, quigon goes back to my hand.  He&#39;s doing no damage what so ever, empy get&#39;s buried in some drains at endor below other characters. He plays empy #2, and moves him over to JCC to drain... At this point I flip, and the game is over.<br />
<br />
FW +20s, 8 (+something)<br />
<br />
Game 5, LS vs Tom Frafjord (TTO)<br />
He starts endor ops and operational as planned, with IAO/SP as his effect. His first turn he missed a pull.  He went searching for a DB and didn&#39;t see an Endor Shield in his deck.  This delayed him a turn and gave me one turn of full activation from Endor.  My turn I flip with Mothma and Palpy, and since I had the naboo site in hand, I went and pulled Endor just so I could get the 0 out of my deck.  At some point I also grabbed hovercam.<br />
<br />
His second turn he does get endor shield, and moth jersomething or other goes to the D*2 db w/ ozzel and starts pulling the sectors from his deck.  Tom was talking about missing draws or something, but from this point on I don&#39;t really think he missed any of the sectors or the final epic event card during his turns... but I guess i&#39;m not 100 % sure on that.<br />
<br />
My turn naboo 3/2 site comes out, EPP Qui Gon goes there to drain, and I drain there the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
He completes D*2, gets a star destroyer at endor, and one at tatooine, each with a couple of pilots.  The D*2 is orbiting tatooine.  Somewhere along the way he drops blizz 1 with veers at his endor db, but they get cleared out by an EPP the next turn.  At this point horax has also joined my party at the senate, his ship at tatooine is slightly better defended than the one at endor... I have EPP Luke, r2 in r5, and virtual pulsar skate in hand, so I contemplate what to do.  I could drop Luke in pulsar skate, or I could drop luke in r5.  I know I can clear out both pilots, but probably not the star destroyer, and if luke stays alive one turn, I can drop pulsar skate next turn and be able to hold a system easily.  <br />
<br />
So I drop Luke in R5 in front of his ships in endor, battle, kill off both of his pilots.  I didn&#39;t think he had enough cards in hand, or enough activation, to do anything seriously bad to me, but I was wrong.  His turn he had enough force saved, and activated enough, to drop 2 more star destroyers for a total of 3, lat damage r5.  I only had one senator, so I added 3 to my draw, added his draw to my power, and had to lose luke and 9 more.  This wouldn&#39;t have happened if I just deployed Luke on virtual pulsar skate the previous turn. Without the lat damage, I still lose Luke to battle damage, but just bounce him back with AJR and drop him in r5 the next turn.<br />
<br />
At this point the game turns into a drain race.  I still had opportunities to drop luke again (he came back to my had via AJR) and booster skate... but now he was well fortified at both battleground space locations.  So I end up just draining at the naboo site and the senate, and keep pulling cards from his hand.  He never did get the card that gives him +1 damage from TTO, and he also never got No Escape, which helped me out because toward the end, I found my honor and used it to cancel the TTO damage.  He never came to ground again.<br />
<br />
FW +11, 10 (+74)<br />
<br />
Game 6, DS vs Tom Frafjord (WYS racing)<br />
<br />
I draw my opening hand, and it is simply sick.  Vader, Palpy, Maul and his ship were all there.<br />
<br />
First turn Choke Vader to his cantina, flip, he loses one, his turn he draws, loses 1.<br />
<br />
Second turn, he drops BP shield, I drain for three, then Empy to his docking bay, threaten to fish for a force lighting if he drops smugglers to fight me, I now get awesome activation from my estab. Control, he loss 1.  His turn he drops a ship and two guys to kessel, lose 1, draw.  My turn I think about dropping guys to fight him at kessel, but figured I&#39;d take the safe route, drop maul with ship, cloak, he loses 1 at the end of the turn.<br />
<br />
He wins the podrace, I decide to not play the racing shield, and instead play secret plans so that my early pressure isn&#39;t negated by his retrieval.  However, the 6 force I lost hurt, they included my only extra visage and janus from reserve.  I drop sidious at the pod race arena for another drain of 1, and I lose back door because I wanted to limit the number of battle ground sites that were available.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s doing better in the drain race than a normal WYS, since he can also drain at malastair.  But he&#39;s paying 6 to drain for 3 at tatooine and malastair, and making me lose 2 force to maul every turn, while I pay nothing to drain for 4 on tatooine, and I had a huge jump to begin the game.  He does manage to nuke visage mid game, and my other one had already been buried by the pod racing damage.  I drop lone zuckuss in ship on turn to his wedge at tatooine, but I draw a measly 1, and end up landing zuckuss at the db. <br />
<br />
Eventually it comes to a point where he simply has to take a bg site to have a chance in the game.  Out of the three sites on tatooine (pod race arena, db, cantina) the arena is the most easily accessible since only sidious was there.  He drops Melas and a scrub there, battle, and draws low.  I&#39;m only down 3 force, while he has to lose one of his characters but not both.<br />
<br />
My turn p-59 and blizz 4 comes down, kicks the crap out of melas... he starts turning over cards from reserve until he gets to the houjix.  But at this point it matters little, the game ends shortly after<br />
<br />
FW +14, 12 (+something)<br />
<br />
So I&#39;m the MN state champ, regardless of the names of the tournaments, I won the highest attended one of the weekend :-)<br />
