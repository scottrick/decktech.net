Director Brett Kingery. Barely scraped up 8 participants.<br />
<br />
Well after running last week's tourney and having 16 guys show up, I was hoping for a big turnout to this one so I could play some people. Unfortunately, we only drew 8 people, the worst turnout at Millennium in a long time. No biggie though, there was still some decent competition ...<br />
<br />
My LS deck: 'I love Clint Hays' - his speeder ops deck with like two small changes (dropped a Clash for an extra Terminated, and an op for a second Nar Shadaa).<br />
<br />
My DS deck: 'The Notorious T.I.E.' - my TIE/ln deck that had spent the past month and a half in retirement due to excessive meta'ing against it and local players learning the deck. I switched it around a little and got it primed for its re-entry into the tournament scene ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Without further ado, let's start on -<br />
<br />
Round 1, Game 1<br />
Notorious T.I.E. vs. Jason 'Ears' Stewart (1801)'s Elom swarm.<br />
<br />
Well right off the bat I get some decent competition ... or so I think. I start Death Star/Oppressive Enforcement, he goes with the Audience Chamber and Bargaining Table. He gets Bo Shuda and Tessek to the AC right quick, then some Eloms to back him up and add to the drain there. No problemo, however, I draw my Tatooine system (a recent addition to the deck to counter Profit) and Twilek for Bright Center ... little Tessek isnt such a hotshot anymore. I get Wakeelmui and Sienar Fleet Systems out pretty early as well ... then I get Battle Order so he pays 3 for a drain of 1. Combine that with the fact that I'm not givin him much force and he's got some chokage problems.<br />
He spreads to the Jundland Wastes with BoShek and some more Eloms, but U3PO comes down to keep them occupied. Meanwhile I PotF the Tat system and drain there for two a turn (every now and then he will be without an Elom so he cannot use Bargaining Table).<br />
I spread to Endor and Kiffex as I draw them, getting Dreads and TIEs to each system, always with an All Power in hand should he attempt to knock out any of my strongholds. He spreads to Mos Eisley and the Cantina with more junky Eloms, but I've got Dreaded Imperial Starfleet and a couple trackable copies of Tarkin's Orders to deny him those drains. Even when a drain or two of his does leak through, I retrieve whatever I lose with SFS.<br />
I don't see any ships as he loses cards to my drains, tho I do catch multiple Ben Kens and Massa Lukes, so it's obvious he's not going to drop the big guns on me. I hold an Overwhelmed all game on account of Landing Claws, but he never deploys a single card to the skies. I drain him out and retrieve nearly everything I lost with SFS and Short Range Fighters.<br />
After the game he tells me he wouldn't think about deploying to space because I would just recycle my TIEs and retrieve more. I suppose he was right, I was also holding a Pride of the Empire all game in case he fought me in space ..... &gt;=)<br />
Full win by 27<br />
2 (27)<br />
<br />
The good: Beating Ears, tho I would rather have gotten paired against a chump and played Ears later in the tourney. No big deal tho.<br />
<br />
The bad: I couldnt understand why he had no protection against U3PO, especially since he usually plays with Undercovers a lot himself.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Perhaps the matchup was a little bit geared in my favor ...<br />
<br />
I go trade some guy a Redemption for an EPP Obi, then get on with ...<br />
<br />
Round 1, Game 2<br />
I love Clint Hays vs. Charles Clarkson (1891)'s generic Hunt Down crap.<br />
No Battle Order = game over. I start Clakdor and Farm, Signal for Yarna, he goes with the full HDADTJ complement and Twilek for Dark Path.<br />
He draws first turn, I drop an op/speeder to Swamp, get a couple sites out. He comes down with Vader to the Swamp, flips, and beats my op/speeder outta there with a Dark Pathed 6. I've got a Signal and a Lost in the Wilderness, and I know he's playing S/A, so I Signal on my turn, he Senses, gets it. I drop another speeder/op at the Docking Bay (far away from Vader), but I dont have any other ops in hand, so I draw (lose to Visage). He then activates and drains. I play Lost in the Wilderness ... guess who DOESN'T have a Sense? ;-) I draw an op, Vader loses his way out there in the Swamp, Hunt Down flips back (as per the new ruling). He starts drawing for stuff to go find Vader with, and I get a chance to get more op/speeder combos set up and flip the objective. Meanwhile I drain for like 4-6 a turn and he's doing nothing but drawing for guys to go find Vader with (we're both losing to Visage). Eventually he gets Tarkin and Mara there, but he has to wait a turn to search since that happens during control phase. I Terminate Visage before he finds Vader and he doesn't Sense because he'd have to draw a site. I also get Flaps out and EPP Luke on a speeder to protect them. Finally he gets Vader back and flips again, redeploys Visage, and I'm lookin at a drain of 2 (sabers, Mara and Vader) and constant Visage loss. I'm still draining for 6-8 a turn tho so I figger it'll be over pretty soon ... then he Elises Vader/Tarkin over to the site next to Luke, moves em on in, and non-Epic Obsession's Luke. He Focuses and draws some decent destiny, I draw two 3's, and he beats me by 11. I lose Luke and 11, he retrieves 11. A 22-Force swing in his favor ... ouch.<br />
I recover though, with operative deployment retrieval and Nar Shadaa later on, plus a Terminated on the second Visage which he never redeploys since it would cost him 2 force loss. I drain him out to win ...<br />
Full Win by 10<br />
4 (37)<br />
<br />
The good: No Battle Order! Woohoo!<br />
<br />
The bad: The friggin duel of course ... I shoulda just let him Alter Flaps and kept Luke in hand.<br />
<br />
The ugly: I was never able to amass enough speeders in hand to drop a smackdown on his Mara ...<br />
<br />
<br />
So now I'm in second, behind some kid who got some really easy first-round matchups. I play him ..<br />
<br />
Round 2, Game 1<br />
Clint Hays is a sex machine vs. lucky kid (1500?)'s trooper beatdown. (hehe)<br />
He starts Tat: Jabba's Palace and ... nothing (hehe). I think about not Signaling but I figger there's prolly a chance he'll Monnok me so I bring Yarna out. He drops some worthless enhanced characters at JP, but I flip fast and he doesn't drain at all. Meanwhile I'm draining for 6-8 a turn, and drawing nothing but speeders (awwwwwww yeah) while trying to keep my hand below 13. He deploys an Elite Squad Trooper and 4 WB Premiere Stormies to one of my unoccupied sites (hehe) and I activate the Flaps and bomb on him. ASP droid, 4 Sandspeeders, 4 Rebel Speeders, EPP Luke ... no Draw Their Fire so he gets to Trooper Assault. I still end the game in that battle with 40+ battle damage ...<br />
Full Win by 27<br />
6 (64)<br />
<br />
The good: FUN FUN FUN game. Wow was that FUN.<br />
<br />
The bad: Nothing. I deserved an easy game after getting paired against Ears and Chucky in the first two.<br />
<br />
The ugly: 99 zillion speeders led by Luke romping all over a handful of troopers. YOUCH.<br />
<br />
So I gain first place and head to lunch with fellow Team UR player Nick Bongio. We get some subs at Amiel's, where all the hot chicks work. Then it's back to the grind ...<br />
<br />
Round 2, Game 2<br />
Notorious T.I.E. vs. (guess who?) Nick Bongio (15??)'s HB Spamwings.<br />
Well ... we had playtested this matchup just the night before, so I was pretty confident. I also knew his hidden base (Kessel). And I had Security Precautions, so he pretty much couldn't flip - if he did, I would drop a TIE at every system except Kessel and probe, and he'd be unable to cope with such spreading out.<br />
So he never flipped. I started Death Star/Oppressive, he did HB stuff and Yarna. We got our systems out, Wakeelmui and SFS were out fast. He never went to Milwaukee because of the extra cost to move there and the fact that he would have to pay separately for each XWing.<br />
We fought back and forth in space for a while since he didnt flip, but I had the advantage with SFS, All Power, a Hell To Pay on his Organized Attack, and Pride of the Empire. I kept retrieving stuff with SFS, meanwhile his only retrieval was All Wings once for 9 (paid for with Secret Plans). He had S-Foils out but the game was very transient so he couldn't afford to give up his movement capabilities (plus he Hyper Escaped on me more than once - where were my friggin Tarkin's Orders?). I kept waiting for him to go over 12 cards in hand so I could Monnok him (had done it in playtesting for a good 4 XWings and 3 Organized Attack) but he never did so I only got him once for 2 Org Attacks. Retrieved the Monnok with SFS =) He actually Grimmed me for four TIEs once (I don't play Well Guarded, and he hadn't had any Grims in his deck the night before) but I got em back with SFS and Tarkin's Orders lost (that's where they were ;-).<br />
Our little skirmishes finally wrapped up when I drew and deployed DiPO. We each had a huge mass of ships at Kashyyyk, I dropped DiPO and drew a tracked Short Range for battle destiny. He had 12 ships there so Dengar made my destiny 17 ... that's gotta be a record of some sort! Anyway he lost a whole bunch to that battle and DiPO owned Kashyyyk for the rest of the game.<br />
Eventually I wore down his forces in space and got drains set up at Kashyyyk and his Tatooine. Those and the battle damage did him in. Good game Nick.<br />
Full Win by 35<br />
8 (99)<br />
<br />
The good: Dengar! Battle destiny of 17 on one draw ... even RalOps can't get that =)<br />
<br />
The bad: Playing your teammates/playtesters in a tourney is never fun ...<br />
<br />
The ugly: I gave Nick a lot of crap for putting up such a fight ;-) The game was long. And I still can't believe he put in that friggin Grimtaash!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Still in first, off to ...<br />
<br />
Round 3, Game 1<br />
Notorious T.I.E. vs. Chucky Clarkson's Obi's Station with heavy SAC and Revo.<br />
Not the matchup I wanted. I had played against this deck before, and it's pretty much the poison deck to my TIEs. He Revos Milwaukee, and if I don't occupy, he Alters SFS. If I do occupy, all my TIEs are deploy +2 with the Revoed gametext. So I'm screwed either way. What's worse is that I had taken the Crush/Evader combo out of my deck in hopes that I could get along without them. Against many Revo decks, I prolly could. But against heavy Revo AND heavy SAC .... I got probs.<br />
Anyway I start good ol' Death Star/Oppressive, he goes with Hut/Tosche and gets Premiere Obi to the station first turn. I draw ZIP, just a bunch of useless red cards. I have to draw. Eventually I get Endor, Milwaukee, and SFS, but by that time Obi has his saber and Luke is draining at a Revoed Hut = 5 a turn. I drop Milwaukee, a TIE there so he can't Alter SFS, then SFS along with like 5 more TIEs (good thing he wasn't playing Grim). I start moving the friggin Death Star because I'm not drawing ANY systems and I'm thinking I'm gonna have to fly the TIEs on a Dread from Milwaukee to Endor. I do drop a Dread and a TIE to Endor, but the SuperFalcon comes down and wipes them out. Finally I draw Kiffex (the turn the Star makes it to parsec 5) and get my TIEs from Milwaukee there, drop Ability, Ability, Ability and he obviously is not playing with any characters besides Obi/Luke (down on Tatooine) and Han/Chewie/Leia (on the Falcon at Endor) so he loses two a turn to that. U3PO goes to Obi's Hut but Luke pimp-slaps him fast. Dreaded Imp Fleet gets Altered as soon as it hits the table (goes to used but so?). I Short-Range for 8 but it's just not enough. I finally draw the cards I had been looking for all game - Tat system and Bright Center - but it's too little too late, most of my stuff is gone and he still has a drain of 1 at Endor, 1 at Tosche, and 2 at the Hut. I try to wreck as much damage as possible with Ability^3, but he still has me by a solid 25.<br />
Full Loss by 25<br />
8 (74)<br />
<br />
The good: Uhhh.....Ability^3? Maybe ... that's about it ...<br />
<br />
The bad: Just about everything. My hand sucked, he had the perfect counters to my deck, I couldn't find any of the cards I needed ....bah.<br />
<br />
The ugly: I guess it wasn't all bad, I was the only player to hand Chucky a loss ...<br />
<br />
Finally ...<br />
Round 3, Game 2.<br />
I love Clint Hays vs. Nick Bongio's wacky Hunt Down high destiny stuff.<br />
This was a really good game, easily one of the best I've played in a long time. He got Vader and Tarkin out to the Farm pronto, and I just couldn't seem to find any ops early on. I Terminated Visage around second turn, and I guess he couldn't find another cuz it never hit the table again. I got Draw Their Fire out and kept sending suicide speeders to the Farm so I could retrieve and make him lose 1. Also set up a drain far away from Vader/Tarkin, but I was wary of Counter Assault, especially since he was Dark Pathing a lot. Eventually I got Flaps out and that eased my mind about draining (a Sandspeeder is power 5 with them). I didn't get Lost in the Wilderness this game so V/T were pretty much untouched until I saved up a bunch of speeders and an ASP droid and dropped 'em all on V/T to wipe 'em out.<br />
Full Win by 41<br />
10 (115)<br />
<br />
The good: The huge beatdown to end the game ... lots o' fun =)<br />
<br />
The bad: Playing Nick twice in the tourney, though I guess that's gotta happen with two good players in a 8-man tourney. 'Tis a shame I only played Ears once.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Grr...Counter Assault.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I end up at 10 (115), which is 4 points higher than Charles Clarkson [10 (111)]. I take first, $15 in store credit, and 4 packs of WB premiere (nothin of course). Clarkson got a really easy last-game matchup against a scrub and whipped him by 43, so it's a good thing I was ahead of him going into the last game. Ears Stewart took 3rd, and Nick was in 4th.<br />
<br />
Crokinole was in full effect all tourney as well. In between SWCCG games, that's all we did =) And we stayed after shortly so I could try my Dune Sea Sabacc/Profit deck (with Rkik the Pimp chillin at a Bo Shuda'ed Audience Chamber) against Brett the TD's Raithal Ops (I got crushed). Meanwhile Nick played some kid in a sealed deck game using all the cards they had drawn from prize support. Hehe. It was a good time. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php?id=539&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
