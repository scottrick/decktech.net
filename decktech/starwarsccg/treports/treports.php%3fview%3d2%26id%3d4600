During May/June I needed to throw a couple of decks together since I promised my players that I would play in any Road To States event that I was eligible for to eliminate byes wherever necessary, so I put together slightly-tweaked versions of the LS Lightsaber Combat deck that Justin Desai used and the DS Lightsaber Combat deck that Clint Hays used at the Chicago DPC.  I haven&#39;t had time to change those decks since June, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m using for this event.  I&#39;m comfortable with the decks, and they&#39;ve both been relatively successful for me when used in this capacity over the past months.  I&#39;ve been more successful with the LS combat deck, but that&#39;s a meta thing.<br />
<br />
For those of you who care, I&#39;m lifetime-rated 1777 coming into this event with a 26-20 record over 12 tournaments and 46 sanctioned games in 2003, with two tournament 1st place finishes this year.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s get to it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS vs. Justin Zimitsch&#39;s (1500) Profit.<br />
<br />
Justin is brand new to our tournaments, which is great and makes him the 76th active MN tournament player this year, but it also means that I&#39;m going to be the first of four rough games for him on the day.  I always have mixed feelings when paired up against a newbie.  I&#39;m happy because I&#39;m going to be able to help them learn about the game and become comfortable as a part of our playing community, which makes them more likely to return, but no matter how hard I try, they&#39;re going to get thrashed; that&#39;s just the way it works...<br />
<br />
I start my usual Prepared Defenses for Imperial Arrest Order & Secret Plans, Blaster Rack (V) and You Cannot Hide Forever.  Justin starts Heading For The Medical Frigate for Insurrection, Sai&#39;torr Kal&#39;Fas (V) and Cell 2187 (V).  Justin doesn&#39;t have a Starting Effect, which, as a newbie, isn&#39;t surprising.  Knowing that Josh Eberle built his deck and that Profit should be playing A Gift anyway, I prepare myself to see a Gifted Artoo early; that&#39;s fine.  Han Solo is frozen at the AC, and I elect not to deploy two aliens via his objective.  My opening hand has a Lord Maul, which immediately makes it good, Force Field, Broken Fett, Dr. E and Ponda and some other stuff.  I&#39;m happy.<br />
<br />
Turn one, I ditch YCHF to pull Security Precautions (V) and activate.  Maul goes to the Generator for six and BR(V) pulls his double-your-pleasure boom stick.  I deploy SP(V) to the Generator, grab Coruscant Dbay with IAO, draw my two remaining Force (EPP Vader and We Must Accelerate) and tell Justin to start his first turn of his first tournament game.<br />
<br />
Justin starts out carefully, which is to be expected, but also seems to have a very good grasp of what his cards do, which I find fairly rare for a newbie.  He deploys Spaceport Docking Bay from his hand to Tatooine and uses Insurrection to pull Docking Bay 94.  He deploys Artoo from his hand to Jabba&#39;s Palace and pulls A Gift from his Reserve Deck, but does not move Artoo that turn to the Audience Chamber to bring Gift into play.  He elects to draw a few cards and save some Force instead.  Not a bad first turn for a first-timer.<br />
<br />
Turn two, I activate and Maul drains for four, unfortunately with my Theed Palace Docking Bay coming off the top of my Reserve Deck for that extra damage.  I search with IAO anyway to see if Blockade Flagship Bridge is in there and explain to Justin how verification works as he browses through my Reserve Deck to verify that no docking bay was in there.  I Accelerate My Plans and pull the Bridge as my next action, so despite losing my other docking bay, I&#39;ll be activating 15 Force next turn, which makes me very happy.  Justin&#39;s activation isn&#39;t bad either, he has a bunch of Force saved and a bunch of cards in his hand, so I draw some (including Iggy and Set For Stun), save a few, and it&#39;s his turn.<br />
<br />
Justin activates, deploys Tawss Khaa to the AC, frees Han and flips his objective.  I explain to Justin how his retrieval mechanism works, and that he has more than enough Force to pay for it, but he elects not to retrieve, against my advice.  He deploys Mercenary Armor on Han, moves Artoo to the AC and deploys A Gift, draws some, saves some, and it&#39;s my turn.<br />
<br />
Turn three, I active and Maul drains for four.  I decide to deploy EPP Vader, Broken Fett and Dr. E and Ponda to the AC, instead of just Vader and Fett followed by Set For Stun on Artoo, and battle.  EPP Vader draws two 1s on his swing at Tawss, so the battle isn&#39;t nearly as painful as it might be.  He loses Han, flipping his objective back, and a few more, and I lose Dr. E and Ponda.  I pay for Fett and it&#39;s Justin&#39;s turn.<br />
<br />
Justin activates and draws.  I ask him if he really wants to keep Tawss at the AC in front of Vader and Fett, so we back up and he moves Tawss to JP.  Justin resumes drawing.<br />
<br />
Turn four, I active and Maul drains for four, and I forget to drain for one at the AC.  I deploy Blizzard 4 and Iggy to JP and battle.  I try to capture Tawss to illustrate that mechanic to Justin (and avoid vicious battle damage) but fail, so Tawss dies and Justin takes some heavy overflow (Tawss forfeits for a lousy 3).  I lose B4 to attrition, pay for Fett, and it&#39;s his turn.<br />
<br />
Justin deploys Scout Luke (who gets slapped with a barrier) and Owen and Beru in front of Iggy at JP, and then remembers that he can&#39;t battle Iggy anyway.  On top of that, both his objective and mine say that he can&#39;t drain there, and with his Life Force diminishing, Justin is hurting in a bad way.  But he&#39;s fighting it out to the bitter end which, especially in a newbie, demands a lot of respect.<br />
<br />
Turn five, I activate just a few, Maul drains for four and Vader/Fett drain for one.  I toy with the idea of letting Iggy take on Scout Luke and Owen and Beru, but I haven&#39;t been tracking and that wouldn&#39;t really be a bright idea on my part.  I pay for Fett and Justin&#39;s up again.<br />
<br />
Justin deploys Obi Padawan Learner to one of the docking bays, pretty much just because he can at this point.  I SFS Artoo and A Gift back to his hand so he has more cards to lose next turn.<br />
<br />
Turn six, Maul drains for four and Vader/Fett drain for two.  Justin is now down to just a couple of cards and doesn&#39;t/can&#39;t do anything on his next turn, so I drain him out on turn seven.  We chat a bit about the game and some of the things that happened and what both he and I could have done differently and a few points in the game.  He&#39;s having fun, which is important.<br />
<br />
FW +33<br />
Highs: Solid starting hand.<br />
Lows: Thrashing a newbie; it&#39;s never fun, even when they learn a lot from it.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were a few other big wins during the first games, but none bigger than my 33 on DS and Michael Raveling&#39;s 34 on LS, so that&#39;s the top match-up for Game 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS vs. Michael Raveling&#39;s (2042) Imperial Occupation (V)<br />
<br />
This hasn&#39;t historically been a good match up for either my deck, my skills, or a combination of the two.  I&#39;ve lost the two or three matches my LS has had against IO(V), including one game to Raveling shortly before he took WI States with it.  The only advantages I feel that I have going into this game are a bit of learning experience and a little knowledge of how Raveling plays the deck.<br />
<br />
My very simple strategy going into this game is to set up quickly at my two Naboo sites with as few cards as possible (Qui-Gon and another Jedi, preferably Yoda or Obi, leaving Uber Luke and Lando available to harass Mike at his site(s) when the opportunity arises).  I know that I need to find my Senses and Alters quickly to counter Walker Garrison and Image Of The Dark Lord (V), along with any SAC he might be playing.  I&#39;m also concerned about Force generation since Mike won&#39;t be giving me much, I&#39;ll be paying for Battle Order all game and I will have to sacrifice a turn or two of drains to send anyone after Mike at his sites.  It&#39;s not a really good situation from me, and the game hasn&#39;t even started yet, but I know what I need to do.<br />
<br />
I start Heading For The Medical Frigate for Sai&#39;torr Kal&#39;fas (V), Wokling (V) and For Luck (V).  For Luck (V) is easily my single most favorite virtual card released in the first five virtual expansions, and it&#39;s going to let me manipulate my hand and destiny draws all game against IO(V).  Mike starts a whole mess of cards including Imperial Domination (V), Imperial Decree, Prepare For A Surface Attack and You May Start Your Landing; pretty much the standard IO(V) stuff.<br />
<br />
Mike starts out deploying an Imperial Walker, Blizzard 4 (which grabs Thrawn) and an AT-AT cannon on the Imperial Walker, and also pulling the 3rd Marker and Walker Garrison somewhere in there.  Thrawn moves to pilot the IW and it&#39;s my turn.<br />
<br />
I was very happy with my starting hand, since it gave me a lot of what I was going to need right off the bat.  Qui-Gon, Lando, Sense, Alter, Bith Shuffle combo (anti barrier/tracking), Another Pathetic Lifeform, Barrier and Goo Nee Tay.  Qui-Gon gets down to the Naboo Generator after a little For Luck manipulation during my control phase, I deploy Goo and draw, say hello via my inner monologue to one of my four Jedi Lukes, and Mike&#39;s up.<br />
<br />
I activate one with APL after Mike starts to activate, and also pull out a couple of shields, including the grabber.  Mike uses his objective to pull Target The Main Generators and takes a shot, drawing low and missing (unfortunately for him, the first of many).  Mike plays Imperial Command, which I grab so that he can&#39;t track it for TTMG, and pulls General Veers.  He also deploys Pellaeon for free as a passenger aboard the Imperial Walker.  Mike toys with the idea of deploying the third marker, but doesn&#39;t yet.<br />
<br />
I activate, utilize For Luck (V), which grants me an EPP Obi, and pay to drain.  Obi hits the Generator Core and I draw a few (Threepio, Dodge), keeping in mind my activation and that I&#39;d need 14 Force to afford Luke, Lando and a battle in one turn.<br />
<br />
Mike activates, and I activate one with APL, and he pulls TTMG with his objective.  He tries to blow away the MPGs again and draws EPP Vader (too low) and tries to redraw with Imperial Domination (V), which I point out is suspended since I occupy more locations than he does.  Mike says he knows, but figured he&#39;d try it on me anyway.  I jokingly call him a cheater and am pleased with myself for remembering the suspension clause, and Mike and I discuss that there could be a lot of players forgetting that piece of text at Worlds (an event at the front of both of our minds, since we&#39;re flying out there a week from Thursday).  Mike shells out some Force for Chimera with Ozzel aboard at the Hoth system, where he&#39;ll be paying to drain for one until he blows away the MPGs and occupies the 3rd Marker (unless by some slim chance he comes to Naboo).  Mike deploys the 3rd Marker and moves his AT-ATs over.<br />
<br />
I activate, manip with For Luck (V) and do not drain, since I have the intention of dropping Luke and Lando at the 3rd Marker, having been given the opportunity to do so.  I belive this is the turn I also have enough Force to deploy Threepio, so he comes out at a Naboo site to give me some additional manipulation.  Mike tries to barrier Luke and I contemplate a Sense, but decide to cancel it straight up with the Bith Shuffle combo I&#39;ve been holding onto, figuring that since I&#39;ve grabbed his trackable 4 and he has to shuffle every control phase to pull TTMG, I don&#39;t need it to mess up his tracking anymore.  I also deploy Projection Of A Skywalker on the 3rd Marker.  I battle and draw high, he draws low and loses B4 and Thrawn to cover, leaving Pellaeon as a passenger aboard the Imperial Walker with the AT-AT Cannon.  I lose Lando and Luke stays put.<br />
<br />
Mike activates, and I do not activate one with APL, since I know what my destiny is, and it&#39;s good.  Mike pulls TTMG with his objective, and doesn&#39;t have a chance at blowing away the MPGs this turn since Pellaeon can&#39;t become the AT-AT&#39;s pilot until his deploy phase, so he pays to drain instead.  Mike tries to deploy Blizzard 1 to the 3rd Marker, which I point out must go to the 5th since the shield is still up, so B1 drops there with General Veers (V) as a pilot.  I play Blue Mike to activate a Force and think better of it.  Mike lets me take that back since we both know that I know what the destiny I would have moved is.  B4 also reappears and pulls EPP Vader.  B1 and B4 move to the 3rd Marker, and Vader jumps out.  Luke tries to look brave in the face of three walkers and Big Poppa Vader.<br />
<br />
I active, manip with Threepio, manip with For Luck (V) (order here is important, because you get 2 of 3 cards and the knowledge of what destiny is sitting on top of your RD, instead of 2 of 2 and no knowledge), and pay to drain at both sites.  I contemplate staying put at the 3rd Marker to use Dodge to run, but figure that&#39;d be a bad idea because of the current site layout.  Luke moves to the 5th Marker instead.<br />
<br />
Mike activates, and I activate one with APL.  He tries to blow away the MPG with Pellaeon&#39;s walker and misses again.  *Author&#39;s note:* I may have meshed a couple of turns together here.  I can&#39;t remember if Luke was still at the 3rd Marker when Pellaeon missed.  Either way, after I get in a couple more drains, Luke is at the 5th Marker and Mike finally blows away the MPG, at which point he starts doing a lot of direct damage.  The 8th card I lose to the MPG damage is Han, Chewie and the Falcon, and I contemplate placing Wokling (V) out of play to retrieve it before Mike gets his marker site damage in, but decide not to.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a damage race at this point; I&#39;m paying to drain and Mike is not, and if I can&#39;t get Luke some backup, he&#39;s a liability waiting to happen.  I Dodge Luke away to the 3rd Marker from a battle at the 5th Marker and subsequently drop my other Projection on the 5th Marker, which Mike promptly Alters.  Luke move from the 3rd to the 1st Marker where Tempest 1 is sitting by itself, and I take a load of damage from Raveling next turn.  However, I&#39;ve finally found my other Lando, who jumps in to give Luke a little backup at the 1st Marker after I drain.  I battle, figuring one of the few cards Mike has left in his hand is a Ghhhk.  I draw two solid destinies, and Mike takes a heavy amount of overflow (no Ghhhk), putting me in a position to win the game.  I don&#39;t think Mike was counting on me having anything left to throw at him, and he even made a comment to that effect during one of the last turns.  Mike&#39;s ability to mislead is greater than almost any player I know, so I didn&#39;t know if he honestly thought that.  Either way, it worked to my advantage.  Mike does some damage next turn, and then I drain him out.<br />
<br />
FW +12<br />
Highs: Beating IO(V) and Raveling at the same time, playing a solid game.<br />
Lows: None.<br />
<br />
<br />
Myself, Josh Eberle and Derek Van Beusekom and the only undefeated players, ranking in that order, after two games.  The coin toss for the new round determines that my LS will face Josh Eberle&#39;s DS in Game 3...<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS vs. Josh Eberle&#39;s (1752) Senate<br />
<br />
I hate Senate with a burning passion hotter than the fires of all hades.  That said, it&#39;s a good deck, and Josh plays it a little (lot) differently than the NPEs I usually go up against, so I&#39;m looking forward to a good game.  I also like this matchup more than I would my DS LSC against his LS Senate.<br />
<br />
I start the same as I did against Raveling, choosing to go with one Senate counter (For Luck (V)) over another (Scrambled Transmission (V)).  This deck does have three direct Senate counters in it: the aforementioned effects and Leia (V), so I figure if I can manip to get the others into play, I can shut down a lot of that annoying junk.  Josh is podracing with this deck, which I chide him for, so he deploys the arena and sebulba&#39;s racer next to Maul&#39;s Hut, and pulls Senate Hovercam as his effect.  I get a decent starting hand but no evasion, which will hurt me initially.  Josh starts racing his first turn and deploys Edcel Bar Gane alone to the Senate, remaining unflipped.  He can&#39;t do much else, so he draws looking for cards to pound me with.<br />
<br />
I deploy Qui-Gon to the Generator and look for his saber, but none is to be found.  I run two in the deck and managed to activate both of them on turn one.  Great.  Without evasion or early backup, Qui-Gon is enough of a sitting duck; without his saber it&#39;s even more of a lousy situation.  I am able to drop Goo Nee Tay, however, which should help just a bit.  I draw hoping to find some evasion, but no.  I do get Leia (V) in the process however, so all hope is not lost.<br />
<br />
Josh is activating like mad, and drops Uber Fett and Iggy to the Generator to take on Qui-Gon.  He draws rather low, and Qui-Gon draws rather high, so he loses Fett and I lose Qui-Gon.  That&#39;s fine, I have another in hand, and I&#39;ll be able to get his saber this time, which I do after a little For Luck (V) manip during my next turn.  His saber is there this time (obviously), and I draw.  Still no evasion until a Barrier, but on my last Force, and me without having found Another Pathetic Lifeform yet.  Very sad.<br />
<br />
Josh drops EPP Maul next turn, flipping my objective, and battles.  He swings and misses, and Qui-Gon swings back and hits, and his funky saber makes Josh take 1 in direct damage.  Maul swings again and misses, so I&#39;m feeling pretty good about Qui-Gon staying put, until he plays No Match For A Sith (me without a Sense).  We each draw a 3, so Qui-Gon is all of a sudden power = 0 for remainder of battle.  Great.  I draw a 5, which will force him to lose Iggy along with Maul, flipping my objective back, but I&#39;m down 7.  Face with a decision of losing Qui-Gon (and his saber) without having another one in hand or taking the damage directly, I opt to lose Force to keep Qui-Gon alive.  Not necessarily the brightest move, but I didn&#39;t want to start running out of my best Jedi against Senate, especially when I started seeing Stormtrooper Garrisons and Trooper Assaults floating around in his deck...  I really regretted losing the 7 when I used For Luke (V) and peeked at another Qui-Gon and his saber...  Oh well, those are the chances ya take...<br />
<br />
Qui-Gon is still at the Generator (for a heavy price) and I drop Jedi Luke and his saber for some serious backup.  I deploy Projection on his Senate so I&#39;m draining and he&#39;s not, which is always a good thing.  I draw into some good cards, and Josh is up.  He gets Aks Moe to the Senate to flip his objective, and drops P-59, Uber Fett and Stormtrooper Garrison to the Generator Core.  Not so much a fan of being drained for three at my own site, I drop Lando there, with a Dodge in hand, to block the drain and retrieve a Force and run when he tries to crush me next turn, which buys me some damage against him, some time, and also messes with his head a little bit.  I also deploy Yoda to the Generator and pull another copy of Sense to supplement the one I had either drawn or manipulated into.  Somewhere in here he did play the anti-combat shield, so I&#39;m keeping that in mind as well.<br />
<br />
Josh wins the podrace somewhere in here, which I had pulled the virtual shield to counter any damage.  He retrieves six, and dumps a bunch of 2s and 3s back into his deck.<br />
<br />
Josh&#39;s hand is depleted right now, so he battles to crush Lando, I retrieve and run and am happy.  During my turn, I use For Luck (V) and see Threepio and Another Pathetic Lifeform, so I take Threepio and then deploy and use him to grab APL.  Leia (V) finally makes her appearance at the Senate and removes Edcel, flipping Josh back.  I drop EPP Obi-Wan to the Generator Core to whip on Josh&#39;s crew there.  Fett is hacked away to the Used Pile, and I end up losing Obi plus two more, thanks to the political effect he finally deployed that lets him add 3 to a just drawn battle destiny.  He loses the Stormtrooper Garrison.  I draw into another Obi, and am happy.<br />
<br />
On his next turn, Josh deploys a Garrison to the Generator and moves P-59 over for backup.  This is fine, since I use my objective&#39;s touch of death on P-59 and the Stormtrooper Garrison is facing Qui-Gon, Luke, Yoda, Lando and Threeopio all my himself.  Josh comments on how forgetting that I could still get droids will hurt, as he is Ghhhkless.  EPP Obi joins the fray again, and the Stormtrooper Garrison is smacked around for a serious amount of overflow.<br />
<br />
Josh is pretty much done at this point since he cannot deploy en masse anymore, and both of my sites are locked down.  He deploys EPP Maul, flipping my objective, to the Generator to go out on some interaction, so I give Qui-Gon a Jedi Luke for a combat card.  Josh doesn&#39;t battle, so during my next control phase I use For Luck (V) to set up an Artoo in Red 5 on top of my Reserve Deck (anti-combat shield limits me to using 1 combat card) and combat Maul to the tune of four Force off the top of his Reserve Deck and the loss of Maul, flipping my objective back.<br />
<br />
Josh is officially done at this point.<br />
<br />
FW +14<br />
Highs: Solid, fun win against Josh and Senate.<br />
Lows: Losing 7 instead of forfeiting Qui-Gon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Derek Van Beusekom lost his game, so I after three games I am the only undefeated player.  Raveling is the top player on the opposite side, and he and I would be paired up for a second time in Game 4 if it weren&#39;t for the fact that Mike had to leave.  He had informed me of this prior to the tournament starting so it was no surprise, but it did force me to drop as well so that my playing would not create a bye situation.  With the top match dropped, Peter Nelson and Brett Nordeen were the top pairing, and Derek and Josh were both within striking range of the best record.  I got the remaining six games started for Game 4, bought prize support from Twin City Comics (1 box of Reflections, 4 packs of Reflections II), and set that up to be given away to the remaining 12 players once all of the games were completed.<br />
<br />
Peter Nelson defeated Brett Nordeen by a comfortable margin and distanced himself from the other players who went 3-1 and will be credited with the tournament win on mnswccg.com.  I&#39;m disappointed that I had to drop since I was playing so well through the first three games, but that&#39;s my responsibility as a tournament director and I only played in the first place to prevent a bye from being issued.<br />
<br />
