<br />
Pre-Tourny<br />
Well Where do I begin.  After last week I knew for a fact I needed a new ls.  The Good in Him Racing was a huge Pile.  So during the week as school and homework wasnt so hefty I built many decks thinking of what it would lose to and what it could beat.  I tried a regular WYS deck with celebration which did really well but I didnt think it could beat the now popular DS racing deck.  So as Friday rolled around and school finishes I head home to get some testing in with the normal crew.  I played a few games with the regular WYS but it didnt seem good enough.  So as the day ended we headed back to my house so we could talk tech and go to sleep.  I changed my deck to WYS racing which I played before and could be even more powerful if I had 2 of that New Signal that pulls out Podracer stuff.  As we get to my house we talk outside for a while and start talking about Rush Hour 2 and that 1 gay guy in the Clothes store that they were in.  Paul then said that, that was the same guy in 2 guys a girl and a Pizza place.  So as we were saying how wrong he was he bet me $50 that it was.  So me and Steph(Pauls ex-gf plays SW) went online to go check.  And low and behold he was wrong so guess what... kyle wins $50 and something else that I wont list because it is bad.  So everyone leaves and I tune and tweak my decks for tomorrow.  They come by a little late but thats ok and we head off.  We arrive and Andre Kornell is there(cough) along with a few others.  But no Alfred, Feldman, Rowell, or any of Frisco Crew.  So we fill out and trade a little and We start.<br />
<br />
Decks: <br />
DS:  HD Racing<br />
LS:  WYS Racing<br />
<br />
19 people showed up so were not so stripped for chairs this time or table space.  <br />
<br />
Game 1<br />
DS vs Paul McKelveys WYS Racing<br />
<br />
WTF is this crap.  First game and Im already playing someone in my car and the only other player that could win.  We start off with a flash and me drawing high.  We lose to Visage a few turns as I set up my Holotable and Vader action going.  He clears out vader with a few guys but hes coming back next turn.  He tries to cancel Visage a few times but I have holonet and or This is some Rescue.  He wins the race but doesnt have any force to pay for his retrieval.  With my fast damage going it has prevented him from flipping and space drains.  He plays Lando and Luke flipping me back and flipping him to the podrace area with Chewie, Artoo/Threepio and Phylo Gandish already at Tatooine Dbay.  I drop Mara with saber against them and battle.  Chop Luke and play Dark Strike.  He shoots misses and plays Slight on me but draws a 1 as I draw a 5 losing Lando and 1 more.  Next turn Luke comes down as we kill each other off.  I have Vader draining in the Cantina for a while and Image at the Holotable.  He takes this for about 3 turns before he flips with Melas to Tat Dbay and Theron and Wedge to Arena.  We drain like that for a while and we start moving around but Visage and drains end him.  FW(+14)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Winning i guess<br />
Lows:  Losing the Race<br />
<br />
Well I guess Andre wins by huge and is in the top spot as I have low diff.<br />
<br />
Game 2<br />
LS vs John Garcias ISB spies/holotable Madness<br />
<br />
We start off with the race and me drawing hella crap.  He has a 3 to my 2 with no podracer.  I suck I know.  He grabs the Holotable with masterful and saves some for a few turns.  I set up the hand but a used Monnok slows me down.  We keep racing as Im drawing crap and hes drawing descent.  I set up in space as he still saves more force.  Next turn he drops Holotable with presence of the force there with Image of D Lord.  We draw and I play Step Backwards to get cards outa my hand.  I flip next turn in the Cantina with Luke and Han and Mirax in Space.  I TT his hologram and win the race paying 6 to get 4 back.  I set up the I did It and drains at Kessel and at the Dbay with Ill take the leader.  He plays undercover spies which I cant do anything about cause I dont have a gun at the Dbay.  I play Lando to there and wait.  He drains at Holotable for 2.  I shot down 1 of the spies as the drains are getting bigger.  He plays another spy.  I play it out of play to kill that one and draw for my second Mess.  He drains at holotable.  The game goes on like the for a little while longer untill i drain him out.  FW(+21)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Winning by more than 20 <br />
Lows:  Not Much<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
DS vs Chris Greens True HB<br />
<br />
This is gay... Car Person #2.  This game was alot like last week if you read it.  I win the Race as he sets up in space.  I get the holotable going with Visage Damage and Vader at the Arena.  I play Sec Precautions and Probe his HB losing 9 more.  Tries to TT my Visage but i Cancel it with Holonet.  We Dont have too much interaction.  I drain him at arena and Holotable and some in space as hes only hitting me for 3.  FW(+23)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Winning<br />
Lows:  I want to play against his Brangus Porn Star<br />
<br />
After I finish I hear Andre yelling at Nick even though hes not running it.  So he calls Steve over and Steve agrees with Nick and it goes like this.  Andre plays You are beaten on Chewie and then wants to battle him.  His arguement is that you can start a battle but its canceled because of You are Beaten.  Nick says No, Steve says no.  So no.  The funny thing during all of this is that he said the he called up Juz at Decipher and said that he talked to Juz about it and Juz said yes that it was right but Juz I belive this weekend is at DragonCon or Dan is too something like that.  <br />
We take a Lunch break as I get my Choco Taco which is luck as always and we head back for the 4th game.  <br />
<br />
Game 4<br />
LS vs Alex Stefankos SYCFA Flip and drain <br />
<br />
I looked on his card and saw he beat Andre by 4.  Good Stuff I wanted to play him though.  <br />
He doesnt play a racer so I can have the race my way.  I get a really slow start with battle order out.  He blows away Alderran and flips his obj and saves up force.  I get Luke and Han into the Cantina and Theron Nutt to Kessel Flipping and Putting Meanace fades into Effect.  He drains for around 3 a turn as I set up at the docking bay for more Generation.  Dominator goes to Kessel to block the drain and Motti joins.  I play it can wait on him and he drops DS-61-2 on it and moves Exe with Piett and Chinerau to Kessel.  I drop Mirax to Tatooine and move Theron to Fondor.  He drains.  Motti comes back and backs up Emperor with Janus at D* dbay.  Exe moves to Tatooine for drains.  I go for a beatdown against Dominator, Motti and DS-61-2.  I drop Dash, Talon and Artoo/Threepio agains that.  With Draw their fire for no Imperial Command cause of I Did It.  Battle.  Double the damage and -8 from his power.  I draw 2 5s and play no battle destiny for you.  I have 18 to his 4.  So He has to lose 28 total.  So thats everything and about 13.  We have a few ground battles but after that 13 he cant recover.  FW(+18)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Good Game with Alex <br />
Lows:  Not Much<br />
<br />
Well Final Round and I think I can take it.  <br />
<br />
Game 5 <br />
DS vs Philly G(Phillip Green)s Slave Quater Mains<br />
<br />
Oh Man This game was ugly and a half.  He start Insights and Insurrection Combo and I forget what else.  We race and I flash his anakin.  I get out the Holotable and we lose from Visage.  He waits a turn untill he brings out Shimi.  We race and he draws crap.  I get high again.  He decides to bring out Shimi and Threepio to the Dbay  I drop Emperor down and Zap him to stop his engine.  I get a low race destiny but hes not doing any better.  I get Image to Holotable and draw up some.  He saves up some force as Im ready to pay for my 11 to retrive 6 or 7.  I win the race on this turn.  I play Mara and her stick against Shimi.  Battle hack got her draw a 5 but its a 4 and he loses her and about 8.  Then loses 11 from the race and 1 to Visage as I move Mara over.  Now my deck is about 40 cards and his looks like 10.  He comes down with Ben and Qui-Gon against Mara and Emperor.  He misses both hacks.  I hit ben and he loses him and 1 as I dont lose anybody.  I bring down Vader next turn and battle.  Hack Qui-Gon and draws low.  I draw a 5 he loses him and like 9.  After this its preety much over as he doesnt have much fight left in him.  FW(+32)<br />
<br />
Highs:  Killing Shimi and then Winning race for 19 points in 1 turn<br />
Lows:  Nothing Much<br />
<br />
Well  since the sides are uneven I get to play Phillip again.<br />
<br />
Game 6<br />
LS vs Phillip Greens Senators on Naboo<br />
<br />
He has a racer this time and it was kinda &quot;too close for comfort for me&quot;.  We race with a flash as he sets up preety fast with some sites and a few guys into the Senate.  Like always kinda slow start but I get Mirax in Skate to Tatooine.  Hes manipulating my race destiny with the senator who looks at top card of my deck so Im drawing crappy and so is he though so its ok.  He sends Maul to the Cantina cause of the I will find them Quickly on table.  I come down with Luke and Han but I miss the hack and he clears out Han.  I forget to flip for that time but thats ok.  For the race on his turn hes at 24!!! OH CRAP.  This is kinda bad how Im only at 18.  I try to find my step backwards because of this.  He plays a Sith Probe to Naboo Dbay.  I drain and drop Phylo Gandish and Artoo Threepio there and kill the droid off.  I Step Backwards his 5 which he grabs and draws a 1.  Phew!! So I end up winning even though he couldve been using his Obj to put back some of my cards.  A few political effects come out to cancel my drains and Maul with Saber goes against Phylo and Artoo Threepio and a Senator to Senate Chamber.  He Battles.  I play Too Close for Comfort on his hack and play 0 destiny card and draw a 5 to kill Maul off.  I win the race and pay to get 6 back.  I drain and drop Chewie with Blaster for backup.  He drops Lord Vader and a Sith Probe droid to Naboo Battle Plains.  I drain leaving him with a few left.  I drop Lando with Gun, RFC and Talon Kradde against them.  I battle and Double the Damage.  I shot Vader with a Blaster Pro adding 3 and draw my 2 which he has to lose 22 more for the game.  FW(+26)<br />
<br />
Highs:  I WIN!! I WIN!!<br />
Lows:  Nothing Much<br />
