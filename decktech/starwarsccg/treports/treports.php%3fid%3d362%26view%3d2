TD Brett Kingery.<br />
<br />
So I heard Brett was runnin this one and was hoping that meant I'd get a chance to play the local SM, Rick Buckner, but he didn't play after all (had to work - whatever).<br />
I'm playing my EPP Yoda w/Orange Snake deck for LS - on my member page, with 3 changes - took out 2 Tunnels for 2 Visored Visions, dropped an Anger Fear for Uncontrollable Fury. And playing a revised The People's Court for DS - the new version is more of a Big Blue choke deck with a Court start, I may post it soon. If anyone wants my decklists, message me, I can copy em off deckmaker in no time.<br />
<br />
Let's go ...<br />
Round 1, Game 1<br />
My LS vs. my friend, playtester, and fellow UR Brain Trust member Nick Bongio's Hunt Down.<br />
Bah. I was not happy to be paired with Nick - I had just played his deck the previous night in playtesting. It was his first ever Hunt Down deck, and, although it had some decent counters for my deck, I didnt expect it to be much of a challenge.<br />
I start MWYHL/Signal for Goo, he Twileks for Secret Plans.<br />
I draw a Terminated in my opening hand, wipe out his foil VotE during his first draw phase. I go about my Jedi tests, and Projection the Endor Forest Clearing when he sets up there. Meanwhile I'm inserting Anger Fears and dropping Stone Piles all over Dagobah (well ok, only at two sites, they are restricted y'know). He tries to impress me by persona replacing his EPP Vader on Endor with his foil Vader, but it just makes me want to beat him even more (you lucky SOB! =) I get out Uncontrollable Fury on that Foil Vader and he can't pick him up cuz the objective's flipped. He loses his only other Visage (foil again) of the top to that, so I know I wont have any more Visage problems. He does start spreading out on Endor however, getting the Dark Forest down (Projection on it =), then the Back Door (dang) where he drains for 2 a turn for the rest of the game because I know he's got too much UC spy protection for me to even bother blowing force on Boussh (I just toss her to a drain). He also sets up at Hoth 3rd marker, and he's draining for 3.<br />
By this time, though, I'm almost through with the tests, and he's still losing a steady two a turn to Fury. He keeps it close towards the end - when I complete Test 5 I don't have enough life force left to deploy guys to fulfill CHYBC (or enough to pay for 10 retrieval), so I just draw my tracked 7 and sit with a Surprise Assault in hand (muhuhahahaaa). Next turn he drains me at a site with a bunch of chumps like Djas, Mara, etc. - I super Surprise Assault to finish him (oh yeah). FW by 4.<br />
(2 (4)<br />
<br />
The good: Winning, that's about it. And that was the closest Nick has ever come to beating EPP Yoda - good game Nick.<br />
<br />
The bad: Playing Nick in the first game, us knowing each other's decks and all. Bah bah bah.<br />
<br />
The ugly: As Nick was losing to the final Surprise Assault, I noticed him toss a You Are Beaten from hand. Considering he had lost like 10 force to Fury that game, I asked him about it - he just shrugged - musta forgot. That game prolly shoulda been yours Nick. =(<br />
<br />
Round 1, Game 2.<br />
So, since I had just barely eeked out the win from Nick, I get paired up against him again in the second game (of course).<br />
My People's Court revised vs. his HB craziness.<br />
Nick knows his HB deck isn't so hot. And considering I had just played against it at 2 o'clock that morning, I knew his HB also (unless he had changed it ... bloody unlikely).<br />
Anyway he starts Haven, I got Court and Sec Precs on the Dungeon (people that deploy it on the Rendezvous Point are stupid =)<br />
I get Mara to the Chamber with her saber first turn, deploy a twix site from hand too. He starts getting systems out and deploying random ships (Red Squads, Corvettes, GLiG1) to the Rendezvous Point for next-to-nothing. By third turn I have Evax piloting Tempest 1 at the Pit and Search and Destroy out. He's losing to S&amp;D, the objective, and my drains of 3 a turn - not healthy.<br />
It takes him a full five turns to get all his systems out, and when he does, Fett in Slave goes straight to Kessel to probe (that was his base). I then move Fett to his Tatooine to drain (and cuz he had a crapload of ships at Kessel). I end my turn, and he starts his. During his deploy phase I realize I forgot to make him lose to Sec Precs (he would lose 8 cuz I had Coruscant out). Normally I wouldn't say anything, I'd just kick myself really hard and bite my tongue, but I'm playing my friend - maybe he'll be gracious. I make a cautious remark about my stupidity, and he says he'll lose 8 force. Nick, all I gotta say is, you're the man! Thanks a mil bro. So I'm really really really nice to Nick for the rest of the day =)<br />
Anyway, he drops Boussh to the Chamber, and I can't seem to find any of my spy protection, so his force loss is now cut to my drains at the Pit, Tat system, and S&amp;D. He decides that's too much for him also, and loads up Farmboy, R2-D2, and Red 5 with an XWing Cannon (awwwwww yeah!) at the Rendezvous Point (I think the whole combo cost him maybe 5 force), then flies em off to Tatooine. Unfortunately for him, I've got Bossk in Bus, Vader, Tarkin, and Kast in my hand, and I'm activating plenty to drop em all there and wipe out poor Lukie. That's pretty much game, I lose some junk from hand to his drains at Kessel for a couple more turns. Good game(s) Nick. FW by 23<br />
4 (27)<br />
<br />
The good: Nick is the man, what can I say. Still losing force to Sec Precs a turn after the fact was very very sporting of him. I owe ya one dude.<br />
<br />
The bad: I never shoulda forgot about Sec Precs in the first place!! I'm a freaking moron.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Playing a friend of mine in the first two games of the tourney (sheesh).<br />
<br />
At least I know I wont be playing Nick anymore!<br />
Round 2, Game 1.<br />
EPP Yoda w/Snake vs. Mike G.'s Big Blue (I guess) Death Star start.<br />
Word must be gettin around about EPP Yoda, cuz I had never played Mike with it before, but he says 'I know what to start against this deck,' and, while I fear the worst, he Twilek's for Resistance. Big deal, I got 3 AFA's in my deck. I Signal for Battle Plan, not knowing what to expect.<br />
I go first, get Yoda to his Hut ASAP. By second or third turn he's got Kessel out and Fett in Slave and a Dreadnaught there. No biggie, I Claw it. Meanwhile I'm zipping through the tests, inserting AFA's (he only loses 2 to them cuz I dont occupy a BG and if I detach he'll battle), Stone Piling, and Visored Visioning (I honestly dont think this kid played with any interrupts). I saw like 15 Vaders while searching his used, but he never deployed one (musta been afraid of Fury). He did stack up like 3 Dreads at the Death Star (ok ... you can have that drain of zero pal) and deployed the DS War Room for activation.<br />
The turn before I finish Test 5, he drops the Audience Chamber with Mara there (but no stick, and his RD is pretty slim so he doesn't search). I send Obi there to fulfill CHYBC (I had the Carbo Chamber in hand so I coulda deployed it for CHYBC too), give him his Saber, detach GLiG1, and flip the objective - I only have 5 cards to retrieve, and 3 of them are AFA's (sheesh). Anyway I drew a 7 for Test 5 of course.<br />
So he decides he doesn't want Mara to stick around and get trounced by invincible Obi, and draws like a madman for an Elis. As soon as he draws it, he plays it, and zips Mara off to the War Room. No biggie, I send Boussh there, break her, and kick Mara out easy (he draws a 1 for BD, I subtract with Test 3). He U3POs the Chamber, so Obi is twiddling his thumbs.<br />
This belongs a long string of assaults on the Death Star War Room by him. Boussh is there draining for two (CHYBC complete w/Obi at Chamber and GLiG1 hangin in space), and this kid decides to fight her. Remember those 15-odd Vaders I mentioned earlier? Here they come, each accompanied by a Tarkin, a lightsaber, or some other garbage. He battles me 5 times in a row, each time swinging, choking or whatever at Boussh, but he just can't touch her (and she's immune to attrition &lt; 6 w/Yoda at the Hut and Test 3). Plus he has to lose 7 in attrition every battle. Finally I wear him down, and he gives up. My drain at the War Room finishes him, and I On the Edge for the random cards I had lost (AFA's, Grimtaash) since flipping. I end the game with one card in lost and 32 in life force. FW by 32.<br />
6 (59)<br />
<br />
The good: Totally shutting down this guy's deck. He was doing basically nothing while I trained.<br />
<br />
The bad: Friggin U3PO. I seriously may have to put a SAtM in this deck ...<br />
<br />
The ugly: Boussh whipping Vader, Tarkin, Mara, etc. Hahahahaaa ...<br />
<br />
Nick and I go to lunch at Arby's. I'm doing pretty well and hoping I don't screw up.<br />
Round 2, game 2.<br />
The People's Court revised against Mike G's Throne Room mains.<br />
Another rematch grrr &gt;=0<br />
Anyway, he throws out the 3 Throne Room sites, I start Court and Twilek for Crush - just in case. He then tries to Signal for an effect, and I'm like, 'WHAT THE HECK????' After delivering a serious tongue-lashing I make him put the Signal back and show me his Careful Planning (which he hadn't done). Heh hehh I love being mean - I shoulda made him lose his Signal for illegally playing it - muhuhahahaaaa j/k.<br />
Anyway he only gets one Nudj out his first turn, so I get one from him and can setup Mara w/Saber at the Chamber on mine. So then he gets smart and decides he's gonna drop EPP Obi on my Mara second turn. Well, Obi gets SPANKED. He swings, and draws a 1 and a 0. I swing, and just barely miss with a 5 and a 1. Then we draw BD - his is a 2, mine is a big fat 6 - Torture. Awww yeah, Obi goes packing and he never tries to take on Mara again.<br />
I fortify the Chamber with Boelo and Jabba and am draining happily for two there, plus he's losing to the objective each turn. He gets smart and drops CC:Lower Corridor with Orrimaarko alone there, but I decide to let it go and stay on Tatooine. I deploy Coruscant, he converts it and drops GLiG1 there - alone also. I bring Fett in Slave and wipe GliG1 out, then drop Battle Order so he has to pay for his drain on Cloud City.<br />
So it looks like this - Mara and friends in the Chamber draining for two, Fett at Coruscant for one, and one force loss from the objective each turn for him - - a drain of two on Cloud City for me (which he pays 3 for). Then he gets the ultimate wiseguy notion in his head and deploys Tawss Khaa alone to the Pit - goes into his move phase (to get around the objective) and tries to Narbun Tawss to join Orrimaarko on Cloud City. SENSE! Mara on table means I say no Nabrun, and Tawss is stuck at the Pit for a jacking. Next turn I drop Blizz 2, EPP Vader, and Dannik Jerriko on her head and whip her good. He decides he may as well fight me, and starts bringin out the big guns (EPP Obi, Luke, etc.) to the Pit. But I have plenty of backup in hand, and after a couple turns of Young Jedi-like deploying and battling at one site, he has lost Tawss, Obi, Luke, Melas, and ECC Lando; Dannik has made a bowl of Melas soup; and I've had to forfeit an EPP Vader and a Tempest 1. I end up controlling the site with Premiere Vader, Blizz 2, and Tarkin. That pretty much does it for him - Orrimaarko's still on CC draining like a dork, but I dont care cuz he's paying for it and I'm not. Plus he's losing to the objective and I'm draining for 4 a turn (free). That finishes him, I Sense/Alter my own stuff at the end to add to my diff. FW by 21<br />
8 (80)<br />
<br />
The good: Most battling I'd had all day, though it was rather one-sided. Jacking Obi early on was fun.<br />
<br />
The bad: Playing the same guy twice in a row - AGAIN. At least it wasn't a friend of mine.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Maybe I shoulda gone and killed Orrimaarko ...<br />
<br />
Round 3, game 1.<br />
EPP Yoda vs. Zander's DS Tatooine drains.<br />
Zander's another playtester and UR Brain Trust member. Bah, third game today I've played against a friend of mine. Anyway I'm pretty sure I'm gonna lose this game cuz Zander knows my deck well and has beaten it soundly in testing before. He starts Jundland Wastes and CReadiness for Jabba's Palace, I Signal for Battle Plan.<br />
I draw jack in my opening hand, and look across the table to see Zander rejoicing over his draw - but I know him, he's just screwin around ;-)<br />
Anyway he gets the AC out his first turn. I get Yoda and start setting up to test. By his third turn he has EPP Vader and Mosep (yuck) at the Jundland Wastes for a drain of 2 from reserve. Luckily I complete Test 1 quickly and knock that drain down to 1. I also send Boussh there to block the drain, but she gets Snipered right away. I Projection the Wastes, he puts a PotF on it (he's determined to drain there!). Meanwhile I'm testing, inserting AFA's, and Stone Piling (I found out after the game that I Stone Piled two Disarmeds in one shot once!). He deploys Kashyyyk and Fett in Slave there to fulfill Battle Plan, and PotF's it a couple turns later so he drains for two. He also spreads to the AC w/EJP Dengar and Dr. E, but I Surprise Assault him for 6 there without even tracking any destiny. Shortly after I Projection that site so he can't drain there (it was adjacent to Mosep and I didnt want to be losing much from RD). So he deploys Endor Forest Clearing and Elises Dengar/Evazan there, also deploying some othe bum with em (IG?).<br />
He keeps trying to Alter Yoda's Hope (?), but MWYHL keeps him off for a couple turns. He finally does it, a turn before I deploy Wise Advice (bah).<br />
I get Uncontrollable Fury on EPP Vader, and Zander loses to that for one or two turns before he draws a YAB. I'm also Visored Visioning him for one or two here and there.<br />
The turn after I complete Test 4, he drops Mara to the AC with Saber, and I decide I may as well go jack her since I have Obi and Saber in hand and Test 5 will be done soon. So I go take her out, and I'm hoping I can keep Obi there until Test 5 is done and he becomes invincible, but Zander drops a whole crapload of cards on him and I have to lose him. Ah well.<br />
I complete Test 5, draw a tracked 7, and pay 10 to retrieve 10 (SPlans is out, CHYBC isn't). I pretty much have unlimited retrieval from then on because I set up EG-4 at my CC:Carbo Chamber for Off The Edge and I can On The Edge Luke. I Surprise Assault Zander's drain on Endor (Dengar, Evazan, and IG) and that pretty much finishes him (loss of 13). FW by 25.<br />
10 (105)<br />
<br />
The good: I was honestly expecting to get trounced against Zander as I had Thursday night in playtesting (phew). Good game Mike.<br />
<br />
The bad: Playing against my droogs in 3 of 6 games this tourney.<br />
<br />
The ugly: Surprise Assault on Dengar and Evazan - ouch.<br />
<br />
So we do a little calculating and figure out that for me not to win the tourney, I have to lose the next game by 24 or more.<br />
Round 3, Game 2.<br />
People's Court revised vs. Adam's Endor scout crap.<br />
He starts Chirpa's Hut, Planning for the RLSite, I Twilek for Bad Feeling.<br />
Well he's givin me a force so I figger I can get Mara/Saber to the Chamber first turn. Wrong. I activated both, so I have to deploy Jabba instead. At least it sets me up for the objective and a drain of 1/extra activation. I also deploy the Death Star first turn for some force. He plays Balanced Attack on my turn to get Crix Madine.<br />
He goes, deploys Crix to the RLS, searches for a scout, gets Chewie of K. Loses a force to the objective, I go.<br />
I reinforce my position at the AC with Djas, and draw for some more characters. He activates and deploys EPP Obi to the Pit, after me reminding him that he's deploy +2. Then he tries to Alter Bad Feeling. I had drawn 2 Senses and an Alter in my opening hand, so I figger, let's go at it! I Sense his Alter, he Senses that Sense, I Alter his Sense, That's all he's got, he loses his Alter and Sense and Bad Feeling stays (yeah baby). He ends his turn, I go and start saving force so I can jack Obi. I deploy a twix site (Wampa Cave?), Sec Precs on the Dungeon, and Battle Order (since I'm generating much more force than he is, I get force for draining w/Jabba, and Bad Feeling is out), and draw just a little till I have EPP Vader, Tarkin, and a walker in hand. He's only activating 7 (his two sites, AC, Pit) so he's having problems. He tries to deploy CoK w/his saber to the Pit, but I say no way Jose w/Bad Feeling. Next turn Obi gets trounced (Vader, Tarkin, Blizz 2) and he pretty much gives up. He doesn't deploy another location all game, just some guys on Endor where he drains for 1 a turn at the RLS while losing to the objective and my drains on Tatooine (I get Mara out w/Saber eventually and R3PO chases her around for a bit). I Sense/Alter pretty much every red card he tries to play (Nabrun, OOC, Traffic) and drain him out.<br />
FW by 27<br />
12 (132)<br />
<br />
So I'm the only undefeated and I take the tourney, winning $20 in store credit. I get 4 packs of Reflections and draw zip.<br />
<br />
The tourney was lots o' fun tho, when I wasnt playing against my homies. I'm glad to have only had to deal with one Hunt Down deck. There were quite a few good games of crokinole in between SW rounds, as well.<br />
<br />
