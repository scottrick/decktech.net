<br />
<br />
I&#39;d been to a Coruscant regional once before, back in 2002 when the SWCCG world was a bit larger and starting to take notice of what Justin and I were doing in the northeast with a couple of guys named lott dodd and soontir fel. After Justin won the Kashyyyk Regional that year it was my turn to take a shot at it in Coruscant as I couldnt make the Kashyyyk regional.<br />
<br />
Justin and Hayes Hunter made the trip down with me (truly one of the great trips we ever took) and things went well. I came in first after the swiss after beating Johnny Chu with the dark senate and it was time to play the final against him. I won the first game with Dark senate by 18 so all I had to do was lose by less than that and I had my first championship win. Here&#39;s an exerpt from my TR on decktech.<br />
<br />
Finals game 2<br />
he deploys executor and gets him at endor draining, i drdop han/chewie/falcon and bravo fighter, hes like theyre each plus one, so i pay the two, an battle.. dont break executors immunity... but... frimbazelc becuase of the +1 deploys... i onyl have two cards left.... bye bye han chewie falcon... bravo fighter vs. the world... he drops chirnoonoo and thrawn, battles i dont even know if he imp commands all i konw is that i lost 23 cards after the bravo fighter.. after that i still had a shot if i pulled quigons saber out of lost, which i forgot to do, and he just combatted me out because i was trying to pull off an edge instead of track sevens for combat and i lost by 19 frimbazelC!<br />
<br />
<br />
Justin and Chu and I still talk about that Bravo Fighter debacle when talking about our playing history and how it cost me a regional win 6 years ago. We were even talking about it on the way to the regional on Saturday.<br />
<br />
Back to the 2008 timeline, I was really liking a tanks deck of tatooine with watto to prevent battle destiny at one site and the moisture farm to make all my cannon shots +2 (total) in and out of that site, a heavy space package and occupation with some trickery. And this was BEFORE v16 when the deck got two HUGE boosts to it. Possibly the two best cards in the deck came from v16. I&#39;ve been testing this deck since before the Kashyyyk Regional that I ran last month and played it at the cash event (2-0 against profit) the week before so with the new cards, some new tech and some strategizing I felt good bringing this to the Regional. <br />
<br />
For light justin and I were going to play combat but after testing it things looked bad. it would beat huntdown but might lose to absolutely everything else. So we went to bed with zero ideas and woke up with even less. I called steve about a possible tigih list but that felt poor so we went with mainstays. I played ktod profit but lately steve had changed it a bunch so I kind of went back to the way we built it originally and threw in luke&#39;s ulitmatum which chu showed us and is awesome. Justin played wys tweaked a card or two differently than mine. Justin had come off wys entirely too quick. I had a rough go with it at the cash event and needed to step away. I&#39;ve been playing wys since worlds (before worlds if you count a month of testing it) and just needed a different deck.<br />
<br />
Chu went with profit a couple cards different than mine and his old school agents with some really nifty tech that can really hose mains decks with jeedai.<br />
<br />
One interesting note, I decided to pack one bravo fighter V to go take out zuckuss at a system if i had to (you can auto forfeit him to zuckuss after clearing the system even if they decline destiny) and it also gave me an excuse to play strikeforce V under my SE... but i have had bad luck at using bravo fighter at coruscant regionals in the past sooooo we&#39;ll see.<br />
<br />
After the normal pre-tourney goings on of decklists, paying etc it was time to play the games and here they are. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 1, my Profit vs. JW Millett&#39;s HDADTJ<br />
<br />
at least I think it was jw millett. JW was playing Docking bay HD and started two aliens, epp mara jade and boba fett bh. that really locked up what he could do first turn as he really was unable to back up the audience chamber well. he didnt do anything turn one. I got 3po down with saitor and said go. He dropped myn kneugh V with vibro ax from under the shield and said go. He didnt play the restricted access shield. <br />
<br />
I had obi and saber and massa luke in my hand so they came down with two sabers, I missed the bounce on fett but clashed mara and then played satm/bp lost to get fett out of there leaving just myn and his 4 power and no destiny to my hit squad. After that it was still a while before he got vader out. I went and killed him with yoda and then he got vader at one dbay adn bliz4 at another dbay late but he wasn&#39;t able to do much damage to me and I won by 25 forces.<br />
<br />
FW 2+25<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2, my Tatooine Tanks vs. Some dude&#39;s CPV Tatooine start<br />
<br />
well at first I was like CPV this dude is probably a scrub then I was like wait, I&#39;m doing CRV so maybe I&#39;m a scrub. Shiza. he converted my tatooine which kind of Effed with my activation but needless to say this was a nutty game. He went up to space turn two with luke in red 5. I came down my turn 3 with Vader v, tarkin, personal shuttle v, and a tank commander for forfeit fodder. After that those guys never left the table. He came down with corran in ship,t hen jek in ship (not jek v though?) then han chewie falcon, none of those guys could get around tarkin cancelling one destiny and making the other -3. I, however, couldnt get through all his forfeit fodder before he had mace at one site with a saber and then quigon at another site with his saber. some how ben kenobi (old school) was able to clear a tank off a site with a 6 BD and he had 3 sites to my one site. so he was retrieving 3 with celebration while i was pinging for 1 (yes occupation and celebration were on the saem system. I had arica blocking one drain and then moved to block quigon&#39;s with a tank and cannon. he battled me there and i defensive fired that motherfrimbazelero ff the table and moved in front of ben kenobi. eventually i cleared him off the site and the system so he only had mace out who&#39;s drain was blocked and my drains/occupation damage was just too much for him to handle when I could recycle a 5, activate to it and make my drains +1 with watto (outskirts drain for 3 ftw). This dude played super slow and at one point had no hand, had to take 5 damage, and sat there thinking for like 2 minutes before losing the force and it was kind of pissing me off but a full win by 13 was fine with me after it looked like i was going to take a loss.<br />
fw 4+36<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3, my Tatooine Tanks vs. Vikram Bali&#39;s TRM<br />
<br />
So he goes first and I start imp decree and i get nice activations from him after he revos my bridge. I drop tank commander gun watto to the jyard and he comes down with leia, blaster, lando screaming and epp luke for backup. he plays flash adn shows a 3 so he can&#39;t hit the tank. then he battles and tries to shoot and play BP to add 3 to hit the tank but he had zero force so he couldnt shoot, and i had watto so he couldnt battle. I drew 2 destiny and it kept leia around. I dropped epp maul on my turn but was so focusing on not shooting him lost that i forgot to swing and overflowed leia for 18 instead of 25 because i wouldve easily hit her with the destiny i&#39;d drawn. after that there wasn&#39;t much he could do, he came down with some other dudes and I&#39;m pretty sure I battled them off and won another game by 25.<br />
FW 6+63<br />
<br />
<br />
Justin and I are both 3-0 at this point so we have to play each other, which sucks but what can you do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4, my Profit vs his KTOD Huntdown<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t remember how I took the AC in this game but I&#39;m pretty sure it was just the normal clash+satm/bp that did it. He stupidly played the reactor terminal shield bc he thought it was restricted access, though I pointed this out before I dropped a free luke on him and blew him out (I did play my threepio for free though) that really cost him as it locked him into three shields and was unable to play coward to stop me from flipping at will. After that I just held the AC and drained while projectioning his site. This game is seriously blending together with the game we played in the... SPOILER ALERT (final)... but it was a total grind but I was able to win by 3 forces.<br />
<br />
So now becuase Justin&#39;s diff is still so high and i&#39;m the only 4-0 we have to play again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5, my Tat Tanks vs. Justins WYS<br />
<br />
I got a exhaust hand for space and resigned to just go up there and cloak with maul. I set up watto/tank turn 1 and emperor to the farm turn 2. Turn 3 I ripped occupation with watto so instead of draining just went upstairs and cloaked ashe was there doing fast damage to me trying to put pressure on. After losing vader v off the top he went over to kessel knowing it&#39;d be tough for me to take a system. I did end up challenging at tatooine for a bit with boba fett and bossk in ship but it was short lived and at best held me from cloaking for a couple turns but in the end it was I who got shield busted and unable to play code clearance allowing him to edge twice for 5 each and in the end He was able to win by 13.<br />
<br />
So justin and I are both 5 and 1 and need to win to get into the final. I think justin couldve gotten in with a small loss but after seeing taco bill&#39;s diff when I sat down across from him for game 6 I knew I had to win and I was a little bit worried about his BHBM<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6, my Profit vs. Taco Bill&#39;s BHBM<br />
<br />
Bill started arica, dr.e then backed upw ith emperor and vader. I stacked up at the exterior site but he started IAO so I couldn&#39;t nabrun in. I eventually dropped yoda and il9 to the AC and moved obi, boussh, corran, artoo BLD V and threepio inside. right away he zaps threepio. during his turn he zaps artoo. and drops p59. at this point he can zap on my turn and prevent DFTD so i wokling artoo back and redploy him on my turn. he zaps him again (so he doesnt have to lose p59 with the new BLD text) but I still have il9 to use with DFTD. I have no other guys in hand so i just battle with what i have. I swing and hit vader and satm/bp him to free luke, I bounce boba fett. I swing and hit p59 and then he force fields my final swing at emperor. His force fielding allowed me to play both gift and rebel leadership to draw 4 destiny and I clear the site and do one overflow (would&#39;ve been four more overflow but i forgot about luke&#39;s ultimatum v).<br />
<br />
I free han and eventually spread out to two sites to increase the damage. he puts the <> dbay at tatooine with vader emperor janus and I move luke over to try and ping him for a bit. He decides to emperor zap luke on my turn so that I lose 3 for his objective. this works once and then I stop giving him luke. In the end my damage was just more than his with two drains of 2 and a ping of two, two his drain at the dbay that is projectioned and his drain of 2 at fondor with maul and presence there and I win by some forces.<br />
<br />
finish 5-1, 10+66<br />
<br />
Justin and I are beat and starving so instead of playing the final at the shop we head to brooklyn to the pizza shop of one of my closest/oldest friends who owns one there. we get some free slices (i had macaroni, cheese, bacon, ranch and a buffalo chicken bacon ranch, justin had the mac attack and an eggplant parm. chu went with buffalo ranch and a vegan choice I believe) then we headed back to Chu&#39;s to play the final with chu as the referee.<br />
<br />
<br />
Justin won so he elected to play dark first so that he could work on retrieving with the wys I suppose.<br />
<br />
Our game was very similar to the first only this time he put vader outside turn one. on my turn 1 i came down with obi saber and cleared him off. Next turn I backed up with boussh but i left her undercover after he put 4lom down in the ac and drew. He came down with maul and killed obi I saved the saber and resilianced obi. Then I went into the AC and cleared it pretty easily and he dropped emperor outside and force lightning&#39;d leia. I freed han and replayed her the next turn after I buried FL. Differently than our swiss game when I cancelled visage the first turn, we lost to visage every turn in this game and I elected not to cancel it because of his retrieval with wipe and my getting a head by leaving his image of the dark lord stuck outside when iw as inside draining for four and pinging for one. he went to space with zuckuss and eventually the back door with sidious and someone. My damage was just too much for him in the end and though I forgot to retrieve with wokling I was able to win by 6.<br />
<br />
Our tanks/wys game was a little different. he was actually able to get both projections out against me (he didnt get either in the swiss game) and spread out to kessel as soon as I got my occupation/cloak going. he moved out there with just dash though and so I went down with bossk/zuckuss ins hips and overflowed him for 9 since he elected to keep dash out to stay flipped. Unluckily for me he drew high and I stupidly didnt put the forfeit 7 tank on the hounds tooth for fodder with really i think cost me hugely. He eventually cleared me off kessel but was only doing the damage there as he couldnt get a ground force together. he eventually got to the cantina and would&#39;ve ended the game with the extra damage had I not drawn one card and it been u3po, but he blocked the drain, forcing justin&#39;s squad to move outside. I think if i just moved u3po with them I mightve won by moving a commander to the cantina and doing some other movement but as is, justin was down to five cards, I drew two and cloaked maul from reserve deck FTL and with justin forgetting to retrieve with wokling also (he beat me by 5) it could&#39;ve been a freaking tie. and we forgot to count lost piles.<br />
<br />
So six years after losing coruscant regionals by 1 force I win them by one force, both times playing the bravo fighter.<br />
<br />
So I get my third tournament win and my first glass trophy that I can&#39;t drink out of.<br />
<br />
I have pictures from the event but right now photobucket wont load so I&#39;ll get them up when I can.<br />
