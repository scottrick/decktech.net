Justin Warren, Mark Million, and Jeremy Losee and I headed down Friday night in Justin&#146;s pimped-out Sunfire. He&#146;s got it tinted, lowered, rims, neon underneath, and a boomin&#146; system making it the supreme Pimpmobile. Well, actually, he doesn&#146;t have tinted windows...and I&#146;m not sure about the neon...and actually, I think those rims are hubcaps...and maybe it&#146;s not lowered THAT much, if at all...and that radio does look stock...come to think of it, maybe it&#146;s not that much of a Pimpmobile in the first place. Oh well. It&#146;s better than what I&#146;M currently driving, thanks to the non-driving @#$% that totalled my Miata. <br />
<br />
   At any rate, we head down to south Houston and with me as navigator, get there no problem. About halfway along the trip, Justin claims he can get ALL of us FREE NON-TAINTED CHICKEN at this no-name fried chicken shack where his former life-parter, uh, &quot;friend&quot; works at. So we all head in, and after a hesitant nervous pause, Justin wimps out and orders chicken for ONE. I raise an eyebrow, and realize I&#146;VE got to supply the cojones for this if I want some FREE chicken. So I ask dude for a combo meal as well, and when he tells me &quot;That&#146;ll be $3.49&quot; I ask if I don&#146;t get the &#146;discount&#146; as well. &quot;Nope,&quot; he says, &quot;Justin&#146;s very special to me. We&#146;ve been through some hard times together, and he&#146;s bent over backwards to help me out time and time again. He can lick my drumstick clean anyday!&quot; So, not wanting to hear any more details, I concede, pull out my wallet, pay the alternate-lifestyle dude, and he sashays off to get our chicken. We continue our journey to Houston with Justin giggling like a little schoolgirl because I had to pay for my chicken, and finally get there about an hour later. We stop at some random No-tell Motel about a block away from the convention and get a few playtest games in, and finally crash around 2 or so.<br />
<br />
   Waking up around 8, we grab some McDonald&#146;s and head to the Radisson Hotel where this &quot;convention&quot; was held. I see some good players I haven&#146;t talked to in quite a while, like Mike Patterson who lives in Houston and Rich Glass@#$% from Dallas, among others. Cards get filled out, bribes get payed, and players get matched up for the first game. (Okay, I&#146;m kidding about the bribes.)<br />
<br />
I&#146;m playing a Dark Podding LSC and WYS for Light. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game One: WYS vs. Mike Patterson&#146;s Lightsaber Combat<br />
<br />
Well this is cool, I get to play Mike first game. I have no idea how long it&#146;s been since we last played, but we&#146;re prolly talking a good two years here. He&#146;s kinda been in retirement, and mainly playing for @#$%s and giggles. Since he starts Blaster Rack, he&#146;s got a first turn Maul and double stick down at Naboo. I grab Vergence with the DDTA shield, and play it after he drains for four his second turn. He moves over, and by that time I&#146;ve got my second Vergence thanks to a WWTBAO. He drains for four, and I play it. This pretty much leaves Maul just sitting at Naboo looking stupid. He comes over to Tatooine with Vader and other stuff, and is doing a good job messing with me, but I manage to hold him off and drain him out. <br />
<br />
FW by 6.<br />
<br />
(Note: Okay, details on these games are gonna suck ass, cuz I played EIGHT friggin&#146; games, and a had a few beers in between a few games, and few more during some. Hey- it was a long day...) <br />
<br />
Highs: Playing Mike after a decade long gap or so.<br />
Lows: Not a damn one. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game Two: Dark LSC vs. Jim Sharp&#146;s Rebel Strike Team<br />
<br />
Well, this game has the possiblity of two huge swings, one of 16 and one of 22. I want my swing to be the SECOND one, of course. I start things off with the race, and get a first turn Maul and stick to the 3/2 Naboo Generator site. He gets a few scouts down to the Bunker, and builds up his forces there with some Explosive Charges as well. I think it was around the fourth or fifth turn that he blew the Bunker. I lose 8, he gains 8. Next turn, I win the race. I pay to retrieve 11, and he loses 11. I&#146;ve got EPP Vader and Iggy harassing him at the Rebel Landing site, and with Maul steady draining for 4, he doesn&#146;t hold out too much longer. Not too much to this game, actually. <br />

Highs: Uh, winning.<br />
Lows: Umm...none?<br />

<br />
Game Three: WYS vs. Brad Todd&#146;s Ral Ops!!!<br />
<br />
Damn, this takes some cojones. Ral Ops? I haven&#146;t played against this since the Virginia Beach Grand Slam...and that was a long time ago. Brad tells me that it&#146;s pretty much a given that I&#146;ll win and that he&#146;s just playing Ral Ops for fun. I hope he enjoyed the tourney...he drops a Biker Scout with a Bike to the Swamp first turn along with a bike Cannon. My turn, drop Projection on his Swamp, show Dash, Squass for the Outrider, deploy to Tatooine, and move over for free to Raltiir. This, of course, keeps him from flipping for quite a while. I set up all my gimmicks on Tatooine, and with the Falcon guarding the planet, set up Celebration. Brad has Biker Scouts at all three of his Raltiir sites now, with Projections at two of them. He finally draws a Dreadnaught and his objective finally flips. He initiates, and Dash heads off to the Bacta Tank. Next turn he comes back, and together with Mirax wipe out the Dreadnaught with the lone remaining Biker Scout &quot;pilot&quot; on it. (He had thrown two on there after deploying the ship.) He was also running inserts, but never deployed a single one, as I never pulled my third shield, reserving it for YISYW after seeing his assload of 3,720 to 1&#146;s in his deck after verifying a lack of sites early on. The game ends shortly after, as I&#146;ve retrieved my entire lost pile and only have one card out of play, and he draws up realizing the futility of further playing since he can&#146;t really do anything. <br />

<br />
Highs: Playing against Ral Ops! And here I thought *I* was all about the Old-Skool...<br />
Lows: That annoying -1 to all your drains. That&#146;s still as annoying today as it was years ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Four: Dark LSC vs. Justin Warren&#146;s WYS<br />
<br />
Well, this was bound to happen, as all of Team Killeen was undefeated after three games I think. Justin is playing his classic WYS, which just doesn&#146;t lose, so of course, I do. I got a quick start with the Emperor to his Cantina, but Projection comes out quick. Unfortunately, he occupied 3 battlegrounds by the time the race was completed, and pulled the race shield to suspend Watto&#146;s Box. I tried to knock him off the third battleground with one of my Vaders, before the race was finalized during the move phase, but failed BADLY, taking overflow because I seriously overestimated my chances. He slowly turns the tide back and and pulls out his win by 14. I made at least 3 mistakes, which probably cost me the game. <br />

Highs: The only loss I&#146;ve had so far is to my former apprentice. :)<br />
Lows:  It&#146;s still a loss. :( <br />
<br />
<br />
Game Five: LSC vs. Jason Haritos&#146; (QMC? Senate? Damn!)<br />
<br />
Crap. I&#146;m ashamed to say I don&#146;t even remember what this guy played. I&#146;ve waited too long to post this damn thing, and now I&#146;m forgetting all kinds of crap. What I DO remember is that Jason was VERY cool and gave me the full win instead of timing out because it was getting close. <br />
<br />
FW by 10. <br />
<br />
Highs: Jason being cool and not timing out on me. <br />
Lows: Long, long game....<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Six: WYS vs. Anthony Hoang&#146;s Senate? <br />
<br />
Er, I *think* it was Senate....okay, what I do remember is that Anthony was CONSTANTLY asking about my cards and HIS cards as well, specifics about what they did and such. He was asking questions like he was a complete newbie, but playing like a champ, which really had me second-guessing him. I thought it was all some bull@#$% mindtrick, but he told me after the game that he just didn&#146;t go to tourneys often, and as such had a limited knowledge of the cards of the game. He definitely knew how to play it though, as I don&#146;t recall him making a single mistake with what cards he had out. WYS is good stuff tho, and I end up pulling out the win. <br />
<br />
FW by 27. <br />
<br />
Highs: Winning. <br />
Lows: That stupid alarm going off for about a @#$%ing HOUR while the games are being played. <br />
<br />
 <br />
SO....in between tourney details include Timothy Zahn coming over and signing cards, fielding questions, and just generally being Tim Zahn, some stupid fire alarm going off at random intervals for long periods of time that only soured the disposition of the convention attendees, especially the SW players as we were in the open court part of the hotel and as such had the best seats in the house for the hideously annoying alarm. Cool stuff included (not that Timothy Zahn wasn&#146;t cool, he actually gave me some good advice for my editorial) there being a dimly-lighted little pub of sorts inside the hotel, giving us quick and easy access to all kinds of alcoholic beverages, although I stayed with my favorite draft, Killian&#146;s Red. <br />
<br />
Justin has gone undefeated all day, and there is only 2 players that have gone 5 and 1, myself and Michael Richards. Alan Denny, the director, pulls us aside and tells us that we&#146;ll be playing a one-game semi-final to see who plays Justin. Michael and I are both like &quot;cool&quot;, and after I grab another brew, we sit down to play. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Alan Denny had made an announcement at the BEGINNING of the tournament that there would be a semi-final, IF there were players in close enough contention to deem it worthy. Since Michael and I were the only 2 people who had gone 5 and 1, Alan decided to go ahead and have a one game semi-final. I can&#146;t really complain, and since Michael didn&#146;t have a problem with it, I don&#146;t think anyone else can either. I know it&#146;s a bit unorthodox, but if both players agree? I don&#146;t know. I told Michael at the Regional this past Saturday (TR for that one will be quicker than this one...) if he wanted the uncut sheet I&#146;d give it to him no problem, but he laughed and said he had no interest in it, so it&#146;s all good. Michael&#146;s a cool guy for a Waco scrub. :) <br />
<br />
Meaningful (It&#146;s meaningFUL because A. I obviously don&#146;t give a @#$% about ratings, and B. This is for a sheet, designing a virtual card, and a bye into Day 2. I&#146;d say that makes it somewhat important.) Bonus Game #1: My WYS vs. Michael Richard&#146;s Broken Invasion <br />
<br />
This deck is all about the force choke. It&#146;s sick. Michael pulled some wacky stuff starting No Escape as his SECOND effect with Prep. Defenses to retrieve Naboo Occ. I think, which was his FIRST effect played w/ Prep. Defenses (apparently this is perfectly legal, although bizarre), and set up with droids everywhere, playing Imperial Domination to choke me off in space. I manage to get Han out on the Falcon to combat his Flagship, but both pilots get knocked out. I get another Han, along with another smugglers, and draw enough to get rid of his Flagship. That, It&#146;s A Hit, and the Battle Plan shield is basically what saved my ass. Michael&#146;s deck was extremely original and VERY deadly. I was lucky to turn the tide, plink away at him, and pull out a win. <br />
<br />

<br />
Highs: Winning against a sick, sick, sick original deck.<br />
Lows:  Having to play against a sick, sick, sick original deck. I needed another Killian&#146;s after THAT one. <br />
<br />
<br />
So now I have to face Justin in the final. Crap. Why the hell did I teach him to play this game, anyway? Oh yeah...there was like three people in Killeen who played Star Wars way back then...<br />
<br />
<br />
Meaningful Bonus Game #2: My LSC against Justin&#146;s WYS. <br />
<br />
Justin had taken me down earlier with his WYS, and figured his best shot was to go for a repeat with the same deck. Sound strategy, but I was planning on not making silly mistakes like I did in the first game, and trying to bleed him to death before he could recover. I get decent jump on him with a first turn Sidious to his Cantina just like Palpy did in the earlier game, but once again Projection makes an appearance. I stalled him of course, and draw a 5 for the race destiny. Things are looking good. I Maul Strikes for a stick, and on my second turn get Maul down to Naboo to drain for 4. Justin has Menace Fades in effect by now, so I can&#146;t get a drain for 4, even when I pay for it like a dumbass. (Which was my only mistake during the entire game, that is, if you don&#146;t count not pulling the Code Clearance shield, which I FINALLY just got the details on about recently, and had totally not bothered to get the details on it up to now...) With Menace Fades handicapping my drains to a reasonable level, Justin sets up at his docking bays, and by the time the race is done, he once again occupies 3 battlegrounds. No overflow this time though, as I realize I can&#146;t knock him off one of the three and just settle for him losing six. He loses six, which he retrieves later with a tracked 7 and On The Edge. I FINALLY find a Zuckass in Mist Spooter to try to deal with him in space, but of course by now it&#146;s way too late, and Justin wins the Open. <br />
<br />
Highs: Playing a near-perfect game.<br />
Lows:  Having the inferior deck and not getting to design a virtual card. I&#146;m kinda bummed about that one. <br />
<br />
<br />
Props: <br />
<br />
Justin, for kicking ass, taking names, and helping me get back on track. You&#146;re the man. <br />
Alan Denny, for running a KILLER Open and running the first DPC in TEXAS. You rule for that.<br />
Mike Patterson, for finally coming out of the real world and back into our fantasy land that is SW:CCG. <br />
Michael Richards, for being so cool about the semi-final that it didn&#146;t even occur to me that it could of been slightly unorthodox. <br />
Timothy Zahn, for signing all those cards and giving me writing advice. <br />
Mark Million and Jeremy Losee, for loaning me cards that I needed. <br />
<br />
Slops: <br />
<br />
The goddamn fire alarm system that decided to go haywire and random intervals for a 4 hour period. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regional TR next, hopefully before I&#146;m off on my next trip.<br />
<br />
ORIGINS, BABY!! <br />
