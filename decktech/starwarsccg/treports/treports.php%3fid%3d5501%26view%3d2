Nipping at my heels was Team Ohio captain Justin Stratton, who finished second as the day&#39;s only 5-1 player. Mike Pistone (3rd) and Steven Lewis (4th) rounded out the top 4 at 4-2 each.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of regional has a semifinal?&quot; - Brian Hunter<br />
<br />
Before we get to the semifinal game details, I promised yinz a treat. So here it is.<br />
<br />
+++BONUS GAME+++<br />
<br />
RSmith Scum vs SPENCER BALL of Canadia with WYS V<br />
<br />
As the last Swiss games were wrapping up, I found myself shooting the breeze with Spencer. He had struggle to a lackluster 3-3 finish on the day; which was at least an improvement from the last tournament we played in together, DPC Toronto, where he went 1-3. This was the second tournament we had both played in, and we had not yet been paired for a game, and who knows how many chances we might have to play each other live? So we sat down for a quick match.<br />
<br />
His WYS was pretty out-of-the-ordinary in that it started the Wokling V to get Nightfall on Corellia, then played a bunch of random.spies that deployed free to Corellia sites. He started Captain Han Solo piloting the Millennium Falcon with Leebo V. As if that wasn&#39;t goofy enough, the deck also included the Sharpshooter Rifle from Endor (virtual version) which I guess can fire during the control phase for no good reason. Great.<br />
<br />
I kinda just breezed through this game on autopilot since it didn&#39;t mean anything and I knew I needed my energy for the coming semifinal. Honestly, I was kinda rooting for Spencer because I knew that in some sick way just beating me in a game would make his whole trip to the USA worthwhile. I went about setting up my Scum stuff in the Palace, got the Tuskens out so I could use their sweet text, and yadda yadda yadda. Spencer seemed to be taking his time setting up on Corellia, which was fine with me. I was fortunate enough to get the majority of my space package out early, including the all-important Darth Maul in Sith Infiltrator.<br />
<br />
Spencer eventually flipped his objective with a bunch of spies (one of them got that Sharpshooter Rifle I mentioned), then consolidated them all to the Swamp. The only other site on Corellia was the Jungle. Spencer failed, however, to deploy a character with ability >3 to the Corellia system, which was the only other location he occupied.<br />
<br />
I deployed Security Precautions V on the Jungle, along with some good characters like P-59, Dr Evazan and Ponda Baba, and Prince Xizor. I dropped Arica (for free!) to the Swamp, and then in the move phase I &quot;cloaked&quot; the Sith Infiltrator and moved it to Corellia. This blanked Spencer&#39;s ability at the Corellia system, which meant he then only occupied one battleground (the Swamp), which meant his objective flipped back to the 0 side. Spencer would never be able to flip it back.<br />
<br />
He had still had a shot at the game, though. On his turn he played Double Agent to kill Arica, and deployed somebody with ability >3 to restore his ability at Corellia. With No Questions Asked V out, this meant he would get to drain me for 2 a turn at the Swamp. Plus he kept picking off my guys with that damn Sharpshooter Rifle (which also fires to adjacent sites apparently).<br />
<br />
I had the upper hand, however, thanks to my setup in the Palace. Tatooine Occupation + Gailid combined to deal a hefty amount of damage. I guess since Spencer had all the spies and jank in his deck he didn&#39;t have room for any good space cards, so I was able to keep him from controlling a system with Maul cloaked at one system, and a cadre of ships at the other. This kept Entrenchment V out of effect, and a few turns of draining/Occupation did him in.<br />
<br />
highs: PWND?<br />
lows: I&#39;ve always said that WYS V is so good, and so malleable, a deck that you can play it 100 different ways and it will still be powerful. Jared Lockwood had a good version with Corvettes and Quad Laser Cannons. Pat &quot;my&quot; Johnson had a good one with Back Door effects. One way you apparently cannot play WYS V successfully is with spies and Sharpshooter Rifles.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we wrap that up and the other 3 of the top 4 are discussing potential splits so we can close up shop and go home. I&#39;m more than happy to split evenly with Justin, but Pistone and Steve have to be factored into the equation somehow also. Pistone seemed eager to deal, but Steve didn&#39;t. The only deal Steve offered was this: pool all the money for the top 4, split it evenly amongst all 4 of us, and Steve gets the bye to day 2. That didn&#39;t sound like such a good deal to me, considering Justin and I TOGETHER lost fewer games than Steve did on the day. And in the back of my mind, I saw no reason why ANY deal should be negotiated. We all went into the tournament knowing what the rules were for the top 4 finishers. I felt confident from my thus-far-undefeated performance, and I knew that I could beat any of the other 3 players in any of the possible deck matchups. So I said, &quot;Let&#39;s play. And if Steve beats me, he deserves it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I opted to use my WYS V first against Steve&#39;s SYCFA FWKTIL. This was the same matchup I had played in game 5 against Steve&#39;s traveling companion, Brian. This game went a little bit differently:<br />
<br />
Steve started out by pulling the Death Star: War Room (via SYCFA) and Commander Merrejk (via Endor Shield V) to go there. Merrejk then began pulling systems. I flipped on my first turn with random.Corellian1 at the Swamp and random.Corellian2 at the Jungle (zzzzzzz).<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t remember who went to space first (aside from the obvious Outrider I start the game with), but I do remember this: within the first turn or two I had the Tantive IV V at the Death Star along with Luke Skywalker V piloting Artoo-Detoo in Red 5 threatening a drain of FOUR. Thus began a long and storied series of epic clashes over the fate of the Death Star. As the rest of the game unfolded, I could not help but muse how thematic the events that took place were. Here&#39;s what happened, in no particular order because there&#39;s no way anyone coul remember the exact order it all occurred in (man I need to get a camera crew or something):<br />
<br />
Steve began piling on the power. Star Destroyers, tons of them. The most he deployed in a single turn was three (as I lamented my inability to find my Grimtaash to play it lost and send those Destroyers to the lost pile instead). He had the Devastator there early, along with Grand Admiral Thrawn piloting, giving him two battle destinies. His non-unique ICSDs then cost him 3 Force apiece, thanks to Dreaded Imperial Starfleet V. In addition to this, he played Levitation Attack V to pull Deflector Shield Generators V onto two separate Destroyers, giving him even. more. POWER.<br />
<br />
I countered with humongous forfeit and attrition. Despite the fact that his ICSDs forfeited for 9 apiece, I was routinely causing him to lose more than one card a battle thanks to the A Few Maneuvers/Darklighter Dpin combo, and No Questions Asked V. He was dealing me very little attrition as his destiny draws were generally very low, and if he did manage to draw a high destiny I canceld it with Wedge Antilles, Rogue Squadron Leader. Oh yeah, Wedge was there. Along with (over the course of it all) the Spiral (deployed as a &quot;react&quot; one turn), Mirax Terrik (she forfeits for HOW much?), BoShek V, Romas &quot;Lock&quot; Navander ... shoot, just about every dude and ship in my deck ended up there at some point. Most of the time the guys weren&#39;t even on their matching ships (not that it matters with this deck).<br />
<br />
We both just kept throwing stuff at the Death Star. Steve knew that to move a Destroyer away could easily mean game over for him in the form of Legendary Starfighter. For example, say he were to move a Destroyer with Thrawn piloting to another system. If I were to counter, hypothetically, with Corran Horn piloting the Millennium Falcon, play A Few Maneuvers/Darklighter Spin, draw a destiny to power with NQA V, I could potentially end up at power 20+ to his 11 + two battle destinies. If he doesn&#39;t draw high enough to make up the difference (not likely with the low destinies in his deck), he would be forced to lose both Thrawn AND the ship to attrition. I would likely be able to get away with forfeiting Corran Horn (for 6), then slap down Legendary on an empty Falcon. How you say ... GG?<br />
<br />
Conversely, I could not attempt to spread out by evacuating my forces from the Death Star, for fear of a single card: Gravity Shadow. Had I not noticed that card in Brian&#39;s deck in Game 5, I would not have considered it feasible for Steve to be playing with such and outdated and near obsolete card. I would not have been surprised to see something like Laser Cannon Battery/They&#39;ve Shut Down The Main Reactor, and I certainly expected Lateral Damage and/or Overwhelmed. But Gravity Shadow? Come on. One turn I was preparing to move my ships away, and just as I had begun to physically move the first one, the &quot;Old School&quot; light bulb went on in my head and I reconsidered.<br />
<br />
What eventually won this game for me was my Force drains at Corellia. Drain 1, 2, 2 every turn. Meantime Steve was causing me 0 damage, as all of his resources were being devoted to the war at the Death Star. Eventually he reached 60+ power&#39;s worth of Destroyers, Lateral Damaged my Red 5, and forced me to lose all my cards with ability at the Death Star. Then he spread out. But I STILL had ships, and I was able to block him from causing me Fear damage at all but one system. Meantime my setup on Corellia went unmolested all game. At last those drains took their toll and Steve&#39;s life force was depleted; I had 9 cards remaining in mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
highs: more battles in this game than in all of my other games that day combined<br />
lows: Steve did a good job of causing me to use as much of my deck as possible to put him away<br />
<br />
<br />
Steve left the room for a quick break; I remained at the table. While he was out a thought occurred to me: since Steve&#39;s light side was a Careul Planning V Tatooine deck, and my dark side was a Combat Readiness V Tatooine deck, he could potentially use the old &quot;Tatooine Bounce&quot; trick on me when the time came to reveal starting locations. I called Douche-Baglets over and asked him if he could require Steve to start a site. I was not expecting a positive response, and I got what I expected. So I had to decide between starting the system, and potentially getting &quot;bounced,&quot; or starting Tatooine: Jabba&#39;s Palace and using Twi&#39;lek Advisor V as my starting interrupt.<br />
<br />
Upon his return, Steve requested that no one be allowed to observe our last game. That was fine with me, so long as Douche-Baglets remained to preside over the proceedings. Then Steve assuaged my concerns about the &quot;bounce&quot; by plopping down his entire starting setup before I presented mine. That was fine with me also. Thanks again Steve.<br />
<br />
And so it began. I knew going into the game what I would have to do to emerge victorious. Tatooine CPV mains is just like Endor CPV mains (a deck I invented and am fluent with), except TatCPV is worse. It just does not have the same quantity of straight-busted cards in it that Endor does. Everything Tat can do, Endor can do better.<br />
<br />
I also had hear some whispers of Steve playing mega-beatdown cards in his deck such as Courage of a Skywalker and Jedi Presence. I used to play with that combo in multiples in a Profit deck many years ago; it was always a lot of fun. I can&#39;t imagine it would be much fun being on the receiving end of such a maneuver, however.<br />
<br />
So here&#39;s what I must do: deploy a massive conglomeration of characters to the Audience Chamber. Go to space fast and hard and set up Occupation. Drain for a little bit with Gailid, Occupy for a little bit, and block the opponent&#39;s drains with Luke? Luuuuke! V and Arica. I also need to be prepared for Nabrun Leids (this is the card to grab in this matchup), Clash Of Sabers, and Sorry About The Mess & Blaster Proficiency. Those are all crucial cards in this matchup.<br />
<br />
I also paid notice to the fact that if I can somehow manage to establish and maintain a respectable presence at the Tosche Station that Steve started, I can prevent him from activating more than about 9 or 10 a turn. That would be good.<br />
<br />
The game started off the way I like it to. I got Jabba The Hutt V, Urorur, Urur, and the Gaffi Stick to the Audience Chamber, and I began using Urorur&#39;s awesome text every turn. Steve pulled Mace Windu V with the City Outskirts game text, gave him a Jedi Lightsaber V and Lightsaber Proficiency, and moved him to Tosche Station. Steve also got the Tantive IV V and Bright Hope V to the Tatooine system. That blows.<br />
<br />
I deployed another guy or two to the Audience Chamber, but nobody all that great. Boelo was there along with Bib Fortuna. Also I deployed Luke? Luuuuke! V on Jabba, targeting Mace Windu. I went to space with Darth Maul in his Sith Infiltrator, temporarily blanking Steve&#39;s ability at Tatooine system. I still had to &quot;cloak&quot; to keep Maul safe. Steve got Padme Naberrie V and another support character in space, and pulled Leia, Rebel Princess with Padme&#39;s too-good game text.<br />
<br />
I pulled Jabba&#39;s Space Cruiser V from reserve deck with Power of the Hutt and put Prince Xizor on it from hand as a pilot. This would create a stalemate in space where neither player would want to initiate battle since Steve did not have a way to prevent me from &quot;reacting&quot; with the Cruiser&#39;s game text. I don&#39;t recall if I had Occupation out or not. Probably not.<br />
<br />
Steve deployed Mercenary Armor non-V on Leia, Lando Scoundrel to Tosche Station, and Master Luke V to Tosche Station. Then he played Nabrun Leids. Did I see this coming or what? I grabbed Nabrun. Steve drew a 6 (Resilience), and paid it to move everyone from Tosche Station to the Audience Chamber, canceling LukeLukeV. Leia&#39;s game text blanked my ability there so the Security Precautions V I had started with went to my used pile. Steve then persona-replaced Leia with the EPP version. He had started with Battle Plan & Draw Their Fire, so he initiated battle for free. I fired the Gaffi Stick as a response, preventing Mace Windu from swinging his lightsaber. Steve did not have enough force to use Master Luke&#39;s game text on one of my aliens, but he did play Courage of a Skywalker on Master Luke to make him power 10. I used Jabba The Hutt V&#39;s game text to double the power of all aliens present. Steve played Jedi Presence to double the power of all his Rebels. He drew two battle destiny, one of which I canceled with Boelo. I don&#39;t recall the exact power total for either side, but we can guesstimate:<br />
Master Luke + CoaS + JP = 20<br />
Leia + Merc Armor + JP = 12<br />
Lando + JP = 12<br />
Mace + Proficiency = 9<br />
Looks like about 53, but I recall his power being over 60. I could be missing something. I had:<br />
Jabba = 3. all aliens doubled:<br />
Bib = 12<br />
Boelo = 6<br />
Urorur = 4<br />
Urur = 4<br />
Gailid = 2<br />
<br />
I think that&#39;s all I had there. Plus battle destiny. I remember my power total was in the mid 30s somewhere. The end result was that I had to lose everyone from the site to cover battle damage ... which was pretty much GG<br />
<br />
The rest of the game was spent with me deploying whatever dudes I could scrounge up to Tatooine sites and trying to eke out damage here and there, but I knew there was no way I would get him down to 9 cards in Life Force. When I threw in the towel he still had 21 left.<br />
<br />
SO here&#39;s a puzzle for you readers. You may have heard me say something about how I made ONE mistake all day at Yavin IV regionals and it cost me the tournament. Have you figured out what it was yet? Go back and check. Don&#39;t peek at the answer!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Need a hint?<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not really something I did, it&#39;s something Steve did, that he should not have been able to do, that I did not catch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last warning before the ANSWER<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here it is: Steve had Leia, Rebel Princess in the group of characters he Nabrun&#39;ed to my Audience Chamber. She was adorned with the Mercenary Armor, which adds 3 to her power. Steve then persona replaced her with another Leia. He could not have dont that. New versions of characters must be of equal or greater power and ability than the versions they are replacing, and you DO factor in any modifiers to either number from other cards. Steve should have been unable to persona replace Leia, which would have left my ability = 0, which would have prevented the battle from ever taking place.<br />
<br />
Now you might say, &quot;It was still deploy phase. Couldn&#39;t Steve have transferred the Mercenary Armor to another Rebel present and then persona replaced?&quot; The answer to that question is yes. He could have done that. But since he had drawn the 6 destiny for Nabrun Leids, he had only 2 Force remaining in his Force pile (hence the inability to use Master Luke V&#39;s game text AND play Jedi Presence in the battle). The Mercenary Armor costs 2 to deploy, and a player must pay all deploy costs when transferring weapons/devices. Transferring the Armor to another Rebel would have depleted Steve&#39;s Force pile which, because of Battle Plan combo, would not have prohibited him from initiating battle, but it would have prohibited him from playing Jedi Presence in that battle. And without that card getting played, I would have only needed to forfeit one piddly character to attrition.<br />
<br />
NOW you might say, &quot;Even so. Steve had infiltrated your Audience Chamber, turned all your guys into zeros, and sent a vital card (Security Precautions V) to your used pile. Do you really think you could have won the game after that??&quot; The answer to that question is also yes. I&#39;m fairly confident that I would have been able to drag the game out and cause enough bleed damage to get Steve down to the requisite 9 cards (or 8 cards, as Douche-Baglets apparently didn&#39;t know what he was talking aobut when it came to tiebreakers). Nabrun on the grabber is huge, especially considering it was Steve&#39;s only copy (he told me so after the game). Assuming I had prevented Steve from persona replacing, he would have had two Force with which to prepare for my next turn, on which I may very well drop a droid and another alien or two and out-power him. And if he wanted to retain the services of Lando, Scoundrel, he would have to use one of those two Force.<br />
<br />
If I were unsuccessful battling him, or if I didn&#39;t have a droid in hand to re-instate my ability, I could simply have played run-around for the rest of the game. Urur moving in the control phase to drain for 2 and Occupy is strong. I could then move everyone else to join him at the new site during the move phase. I might eat some Force loss from his drains, but I had Arica and my second copy of LukeLukeV to go. My biggest concern would then have become losing two Force a turn to Padme&#39;s game text (TOO GOOD). In any case, the game would not have been the anticlimactic bludgeoning it was if I had just caught that simple mistake.<br />
<br />
One other thing you may be wondering: where the hell was Ephant Mon?? His game text would not only have A) prevented whatever character held the Merc Armor from moving to the Audience Chamber, it would have B) soaked all that battle damage up! Well a funny thing happened on the way to the Audience Chamber today ... First turn I did not deploy anything with the game text of Power of the Hutt because I used all my Force to set up Tuskens and the Gaffi Stick. They&#39;re expensive, but worth it. The second and third turns I either couldn&#39;t get Ephant Mon because he was in my Force pile, or I had to use PotH to get the Space Cruiser. By then it was too late.<br />
<br />
So that&#39;s what happened there. I hate to play the luck card, but CPV mains (especially on Endor, but yes even on Tatooine) is nigh unstoppable when it gets both ships AND Padme AND Nabrun in the first 2 turns. But I will go to my SWCCG grave with the knowledge that this was one game I could have won.<br />
<br />
So I wound up in thrid (froth?) and Nitsuj and Steve split top honors. I can&#39;t complain about finishing 7-1 on the day, though.<br />
<br />
Then everybody went home.<br />
<br />
<br />
