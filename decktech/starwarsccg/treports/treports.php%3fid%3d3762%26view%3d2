So I had a lot of free time on my hands to write this thing, hence the Tolstoy-esque length. Enjoy!<br />
<br />
BTW, If you&#146;ve got no sense of humor or don&#146;t give a damn about what happened during our trip, then by all means skip the pre-tourney stuf. <br />
<br />
Also, be warned. Adult content is ahead.<br />
<br />
PRE-TOURNEY<br />
<br />
This year, Texas players had the treat of hosting an Open qualifier event for the time ever, and as the defending State Champion, I wasn&#146;t going to miss my chance at doubling my odds of qualifying for Day 2. So, plans were made in May to attend and compete. Decks were built, phone calls were made, days off from work were granted, and eventually a crew of four from Killeen emerged eager for the 3-hour odyssey to Houston. <br />
<br />
I of course was at the helm of the vehicle, while my passengers were Matt Lush, Jeremy Losee, and Mark Million, who was going to be playing in his first U.S. tournament since his return from a tour of duty in Germany. Jeremy also had not played a sanctioned game a while (since last year in fact), but both of them were pretty well &quot;up to speed&quot; on the current environment. We assembled for the trip on Friday afternoon, and headed out of Killeen with plenty of driving, music, jokes, spilled sustenance, and conversations about anal sex ahead of us. The usual. <br />
<br />
As the drive begins, talk centers around the game for a bit, but sooner than later, four grown men will shift their attention to the female anatomy. This somehow turns into a poll about which of us likes anal sex, and apparently Matt and Mark think it&#146;s cooler to receive than to give. So I quickly slam on the brakes, and Jeremy and I proceed to kick the two of them out of the vehicle. &quot;You can walk, fudgepackers!&quot; [Tires screech as I peel out] &quot;Hey, screw you for judging us! We&#146;re people too dammit!&quot; Okay, so that&#146;s not what really happened. Instead, everyone in the car (except for me of course) thought it would be hilarious to continually fantasize that an ex-girlfriend of mine was the proud owner of a set of male genitalia. &quot;Shut your pansy mouth, Hoostino! Who&#146;s got the BALLS in this relationship?&quot; <br />
<br />
After I manage to make only one comeback, toward Mark, calling him a pirate redneck or something or other (you would have to hear the guy&#146;s laugh to understand...YAR! I be here to seize yer treasure of pool sticks and Garth Brooks albums!), we arrive in a small town known as Caldwell, TX. I point out that I have a friend living in Caldwell that operates a small chicken restaurant, and I was confident that I could score some free food. The crew agrees to stop, and we head into the eatery. My friend is indeed there, and I order a combo meal and get charged nothing. So Matt thinks the field is clear, and orders himself something. Then my friend is like &quot;That&#146;ll be $3.49.&quot; Matt responds &quot;Don&#146;t I get the discount?&quot; To which my friend replies, &quot;Nah. Justin here is my boy, so I have to hook him up. But I don&#146;t give free food to freaks like you.&quot; Matt fires back with &quot;Hey, this silk dress is better than anything that has ever graced your hips, so don&#146;t be jealous.&quot; We then are attacked and kicked out of the restaurant by a dozen four-foot Mexicans armed with hairnets and cleaning utensils, and the road trip resumes with me eating delicious FREE chicken and Matt eating tainted PAID-FOR chicken. I remind Matt of this fact several times, and it&#146;s rubbed in further when Matt spills gravy on his dress. (Note to prodigies: Matt&#146;s transvestism is just a figment of my twisted imagination, but boy, those Mexicans and their sawed-off broom handles and the ensuing cascade of flaming sponges were as real as God!)<br />
<br />
Caldwell wasn&#146;t even the halfway point of our trip, so there&#146;s plenty more adventures to share. Well, not really. Only a couple. Matt and I caught Mark and Jeremy making out in the back seat twice, and Matt received a few phone calls from some of his whores. Jeremy irked him to answer with &quot;Yo biatch! Where&#146;s my f*cking money?&quot; But instead we had to settle for &quot;Hello, mistress ... Please! I meant well! NO! Please mistress! No more lashes from your horribly disfigured 12-foot clitoris! I beg you!&quot; Without much further ado aside from Mark and Matt constantly telling me how large my lack of driving prowess is, we arrive in Houston and find the site of the tournament. Next, we scour the surrounding area for a cheap room, and find one just a couple blocks away. $65 later, we&#146;re inside and playtesting for the following day&#146;s big event. <br />
<br />
Mark and Matt start a game, while I help Jeremy build a Dark Deal deck. I next face Matt&#146;s WYS using a Dark Senate I threw together with Jeremy&#146;s cards, and then I play my Light Senate against Mark&#146;s Combat Racing. It turns out that I decide to use neither of those decks the following day, even though I won both games. Jeremy plays Matt with his Light Senate before we all head to bed. However, none of us got much sleep except for Matt, whose snoring I had to continually interrupt by hitting the bed and waking him up. After I finally fall into a slumber after a few hours of tossing and turning, Mark decides he can&#146;t sleep and gets up and starts going through his decks. I manage to sleep through it though, but awake a couple minutes shy of 7:30 AM, the time our wake-up call was slated for. Mark, Jeremy, and I head to McDonald&#146;s for breakfast, and have to navigate our way back after Mark tells me he can figure out how to get us to the hotel without using the highway. But alas, we make it back, pick up Matt, check out, and head to the tournament. <br />
<br />
We each have to pay $20 to get into the place, because it&#146;s being held at a small Con, but all is good. We were pretty early apparently, as we saw only a couple other players there. TD Alan Denny arrives shortly after, and after filling out decklists and command cards, the tournament start draws near. I see some familiar faces and tough competition packing in, including Rich Glassc0ck, who I haven&#146;t seen in a good while. A total of 30 players showed, a turnout that was more than I had hoped for. <br />
<br />
END PRE-TOURNEY<br />
<br />
The final tally for our decks was:<br />
<br />
Me: WYS Raiders, Hunt Down Beats<br />
Jeremy: WYS Raiders, Dark Deal<br />
Matt: WYS Raiders, Combat Racing<br />
Mark: Light Senate, Combat Racing<br />
<br />
[Game 1]<br />
LS vs. Jason Haritos (1656) Dark Senate<br />
Ah, Dark Senate, the deck I&#146;m not supposed to beat with WYS. No problem. I set up Threepio quickly at the Home One DB, along with some ships to Tatooine and then a Raider/Craft with 3PO because that&#146;s the only place where I felt safe putting him at the time. Next turn, he responds with Mara Jade + Lightsaber, and battles. He hacks 3PO, while his attrition kills my Raider/Craft. On my turn, I flip and drop EPP Han and Enraged Chewie on top of Mara, and battle. Jason points out that I get only one destiny due to Edcel, but I remind him that Edcel&#146;s text is only in effect at battlegrounds, and the Home One DB doesn&#146;t qualify. So, after Chewie finishes with sloppy seconds, Mara lay in a heap of space jizz, with 10+ overflow damage following her to his Lost Pile. Shortly after, I spread out a bit and start draining. I don&#146;t think I ever managed to get the Bacta Tank out, but all the while Goo, reacts, Fallen Portal, and a Demotion on Edcel where making a mess of his attempts to battle. I clear his remaining ground forces with ease, and drain him out. <br />

<br />
[Game 2]<br />
DS vs. Andy Hui (1568) QMC<br />
In this matchup, Hunt Down is the priest and QMC is the altar boy, so this game gave me less concern than the last one. I don&#146;t have an opening-hand Vader, but while pulling a DB on turn one, I discover that one is in my active force, so I draw up. Next turn, I drop Lord Vader + Lightsaber to a Cloud City site, but Honor negates Visage. He reacts to Vader with EPP Han and EPP Leia, and initiates battle. I cancel it with Stunning Leader. Now that I think about it, he couldn&#146;t have initiated battle anyway due to my Objective, but whatever. On my turn, I play Sniper on Leia, and hit her without difficulty. I drop Blast Door Controls, Super Fett and IG-88, then battle the lone Han. He has no Dodge or Path, so after the smoke clears, he loses Han and 29 cards. The rest of the game consisted of me draining and him losing cards. <br />
Full Win by 28<br />
4 (+51)<br />
<br />
[Game 3]<br />
DS vs. Stephen Beckham (1790) WYS Standard<br />
WYS can be a hard match for Hunt Down at times, but usually not. Nevertheless, I play carefully. Again there is no Vader (or Blizzard 4) in my opening hand, so I have to settle for an Emperor in the Cantina on turn one. He drops Dash + Outrider to the &lt;&gt; DB on his turn I believe, but doesn&#146;t move up to the system if I&#146;m not mistaken. I get Vader out later, and Visage starts working, while I just wait for him to attack so I can retaliate. However, my plans go awry when he Grimtaashes 2x Super Fett and 2x EPP Maul out of my hand. Not what I had mind, but I&#146;m still causing significant damage between drains and Visage. He opts to not spread to Kessel, and pitches the system to Visage or something. This helped me tremendously, as my fleet of Chimaera x2, ZiMH, BiHT, 3x Command, Thrawn, and Chiraneau was totally avoiding my hand. Anyway, I continue to drain for more than he is, while Visage is still pressuring him. He comes down with EPP Luke and some smugglers, but I kill all of them. Luke is Resilienced, and goes to one of my battleground DBs on the following turn (I shouldn&#146;t have searched for a DB again after I pulled the Executor DB, but verifying my destinies was too tempting on a previous turn...that&#146;s what Crush is for! Dah!). So I flip back, and Visage is hitting me as well. Janus joins the Emperor in the Cantina, and my drains get pretty huge on Tatooine. Luke transits back to Tatooine after I chase him after him, and I think my third EPP Maul finally killed him, which essentially seals my victory. Wow, I topped a solid WYS without deploying a single ship. Maybe my Hunt Down isn&#146;t such a bad deck after all. Heh.<br />

<br />
[Game 4]<br />
LS vs. Matt Lush (1909) Combat Racing<br />
At this point, Matt and I are among just a handful of remaining unbeaten players, so this was a key game for both of us. A while back, right after the Atlanta DPC, Matt had built a Combat Racing deck that gave my WYS little difficulty in a game of playtesting, but I was positive that he had made quite a few changes since then. Both of us were on our toes for much of the contest. He stalls me first turn, and stacks a race destiny, while the Emperor visits my Cantina. I pull Wise Advice and Grabber shields on his turn, because I am confident that he&#146;s playing SAC, and I don&#146;t plan to flip for a couple turns. My opening hand isn&#146;t stellar, but it&#146;s not bad, either. I play All Wings combo before I activate and pull Artoo In Red 5. I deploy Goo, Virtual Luke in the ship, and Bacta Tank before ending my turn. He plays Unexpected Interruption and pulls an Alter, then kills my Bacta Tank, which goes to my Used Pile via Wise Advice. Hmmm, I&#146;d rather see that off the table than Goo. The race continues, but I don&#146;t make a realistic run for it. I drop a Projection to the Cantina quickly, while Maul + Double-Stick makes an appearance on Naboo. I next flip by deploying Dash + Outrider to Tatooine system and moving Luke over to Kessel. I also snagged a third battleground with EPP Han + Enraged Chewie. I started Menace Fades over Insight combo, but Matt doesn&#146;t notice next turn when he loses 1 to drain for 4. I point to Menace Fades, and he kicks himself for the error. The race is slated to end this turn, so I know he&#146;s looking to knock me off the third battleground so I don&#146;t suspend Watto&#146;s Box. So, he drops EPP Vader to attack Han and Chewie. I have a Portal sitting on the top of my Lost Pile, but I know Matt plays They&#146;re Still Coming Through in virtually all of his dark decks, so I don&#146;t play it. He swings at Chewie for some reason, and misses thanks to the +1 defense value he gets because of Vader. I miss the shot on Vader, but my destinies still cause 12 overflow on top of Vader. Han survives to occupy the third battleground and the race ends but not before I pull the Close Race shield. I lose six, but by deploying Vader (for 9 thanks to Goo + pilot text on the &lt;&gt; DB), Matt doesn&#146;t have enough Force left to retrieve his six. I replenish my forces on the ground over the next few turns, while he pretty much just drains and builds his hand. The Emperor illegally moves out of the Cantina to block a drain, but I don&#146;t catch it. A couple more ground battles ensue, including one in which he cancelled a Patrol Craft react with the Ghhhk combo, but Bacta Tank helped to thwart his offensives. I retrieve with Luke all game, but I see several copies of the Masterful Move combo, so Celebration doesn&#146;t happen until very late in the game. I drain for more, and the retrieval is widening the gap. Matt starts to get low on cards, and never does deploy a ship. I forget to drain on one of the last turns, but he cannot do much thanks to Battle Plan. He runs out of cards without much hassle. <br />
Full Win by 14<br />
8 (+85)<br />
<br />
[Game 5]<br />
LS vs. Rich Glassc0ck (1970) Dark Senate<br />
I believe Rich was the only remaining unbeaten at this stage. Although Rich hasn&#146;t been really active with SWCCG for a while, he&#146;s one of the best in the state, and is playing Dark Senate to boot. He starts EP1 DB puller, Colo, and Crush. On turn 1, Choke Vader hits the Cantina. Ouch. On my turn, I play WWTBAO after activating 3, and pull Projection. I deploy it (to the Cantina instead of the Senate) and Threepio before drawing. Goo hits and I flip in decent time, and Melas allows me to kill a Tatooine Maul. I run Virtual Demotion and 2x Effective Repairs, but I never find the Demotion to get much use out of it. Plus, I used my grabber for Squabble anyway. Rich loses a couple ships off the top of his deck, which hinders him quite a bit. But Rich&#146;s biggest enemy in this game was the choke, as he activated only 8-12 a turn all game. Between Goo and Battle Plan, not to mention Lott Dod killing his activation by 1 just by pulling a card each turn, Rich didn&#146;t have many options. The drain at the Landing Site forces him to battle there, which knocks a couple more of his mains out. He&#146;s cancelling most of my drains, as Kessel isn&#146;t out, but plinks of 1 here and 2 there eventually wear him down. <br />
Full Win by 21<br />

<br />
[Game 6]<br />
DS vs. Rich Glassc0ck (1970) QMC<br />
After I see the QMC start, I exhale a sigh of relief. Unless I make a terrible mistake, I can&#146;t fathom a QMC deck keeping me out of the finals. Again, no Vader in my opening hand, although there is a Blizzard 4. Too bad I don&#146;t use the Cloud City DB. So, I just deploy Sidious to the Guest Quarters first turn and decide to draw for a Vader next turn, as I don&#146;t want to have him stuck at a DB. Rich reveals the Outrider on his opening turn, but Dash has been activated. I look through his deck and see some SAC, which prompts me to pull the Oppressive Enforcement shield. I drop BFHI quickly, too. Rich deploys some sites, and comes down with EPP Luke on top of Sidious. He attempts to Alter BFHI, and miraculously draws a site to send it off the table. Hehe. Luke battles Sidious, hits him, and draws a 3 for destiny. I decline to draw my destiny, and just lose the 3 overflow. On my turn, I pull I Have You Now, and bring Lord Vader and Super Fett on top of Luke. I battle, and he has no avoidance card. After my 5 destinies, Rich must lose Luke and about 18 cards. I get more characters to Cloud City, and deploy a lone Chimaera to Bespin to pressure him. He brings EPP Obi down to flip me, and a couple more characters follow, like R3 Leia and Scoundrel Lando, but my drains combined with Visage continue to wither away at his Life Force. It becomes only a matter of time before his deck is exhausted. <br />
Full Win by 17<br />
12 (+133)<br />
<br />
So, I&#146;m in the finals as the only undefeated player. In second place is Michael Richards, with Matt Lush in third and Stephen Beckham in fourth (but with a timed win keeping him out of contention). Surprisingly, Jeremy ends the day at 3-3, as does Mark. Alan decides that since Matt is the only other player with 10 victory points, he and Richards will play a one-game playoff to determine who will move on face me in a decisive single-game final, for which I pick the side I want to play. Richards elects to play his seemingly broken Dark deck (which I had been hearing about all day) against Matt. Sorry, but I won&#146;t give any details on the mechanics of Richards&#146; deck other than it chokes the living hell of its opponents. So anyway, I don&#146;t watch the Richards-Lush playoff, but I hear that Richards got a huge jump on him, but was unable to keep Matt locked down, and in the end, Battle Plan was Matt&#146;s saving grace as he won by 8. <br />
<br />
I ponder if I want to take the risk of playing my Hunt Down against Matt&#146;s WYS for the final game, but I decide to stick with the deck I already beat him with. So, it&#146;s my WYS against his Combat Racing again, this time for all the marbles. <br />
<br />
FINAL CONFRONTATION<br />
<br />
The game starts out almost exactly like the last one, except my draw isn&#146;t nearly as good as it was the last time around. I have no characters in hand at all. In fact, the only non-red card was Artoo In Red 5. Oh well. He gets Sidious to the Cantina after stalling me and stacking a 5 for the race. I have a Barrier and Alternatives To Fighting in hand, so I drop Virtual Luke on my opening turn again. He pulls the Coward shield to stall the Luke retrieval for a bit, and also plays the Grabber and A Useless Gesture. He plays Maul Strikes on his second turn and pulls the Double Stick. We both stack race destinies, he drains in the Cantina, and deploys Lord Maul + Stick to Naboo. On my turn, I draw a bunch looking for characters. Projection hits the Cantina again, and I drop some Crafts and assorted smugglers to my docking bays. The race looks to end on his next turn, but I have the three battlegrounds occupied, so I figure he&#146;s going to come down and try to wipe me off one of them. He pays to drain first, and again loses the 1 to Maul&#146;s Stick in an attempt to drain for 4, but I remind of Menace Fades and lose two. He expresses disbelief that he fell for that again. Anyway, he brings an EPP Vader to one of the docking bays, but I Barrier and he doesn&#146;t have a TSCT. The race resolves, and I lose six, while he doesn&#146;t retrieve anything. On my turn, I drain and reinforce my sites. Kessel hits the table shortly, and I begin to drain for a bunch. He deploys the Emperor to the other Naboo site, so he&#146;s paying six to drain for 4 for most of the game. Sidious and Vader have a skirmish on Tatooine with EPP Han and Enraged Chewie, which clears both Dark Jedi. In the process, I manage to track my second Artoo In Red 5, and Edge for six the following turn. Luke continues to retrieve one a turn, while U-3PO blocks a drain of 2. Since I&#146;m devoting twice as many cards to the table than Matt is, my Life Force is roughly equal to his, if not less. But my drains are a little larger than his, plus Luke is getting a card back each turn. He starts drawing, and I expect an attack in space to follow soon. I don&#146;t think Matt remembered, but I had a Barrier and Alternatives To Fighting buried in my Lost Pile, so I just sit back and wait. It&#146;s not long before Zuckuss In Mist Hunter with 4-LOM aboard makes a run at Luke. I play the Barrier I think, and have my X-Wing Cannon tracked to the top of my deck. I Mirax it into hand on his turn. On my turn, I activate, drain for a couple, and then drop the Cannon. I battle, spend three, and shoot the Mist Hunter out of the sky. But he&#146;s not done. A second Zuckuss makes an appearance to Tatooine next turn where Dash is draining and keeping ITTL in effect. However, he makes this play before he drains. He asks to take the action back, but I tell him that he cannot take actions back between phases. He claimed that he didn&#146;t use any Force to deploy Zuckuss, so he can still go back to the control phase. He did in fact start to pay for the ship, using 1 Force before deciding to not deploy him. He then put the 1 Force back onto his Force Pile. A minute or two elapsed before he decided to go back and drain, so I think he simply forgot that he used the 1 Force. Nobody around us was paying close enough attention to see what happened, but I assured Matt that he did start to pay for the ship. Not that this was a pivotal play, since I could stand to lose 4 more cards if he went ahead and payed to drain, but those are the rules. He wasn&#146;t too upset about it, and proceeded to deploy the Mist Hunter, but to Kessel instead of Tatooine just to block the drain of 3 for a turn. Melas was in my hand, so I would&#146;ve killed the ship regardless of which planet he put it at. I tried to deploy Celebration to cushion against his drains a bit more knowing that I have no Grabber. It was quickly cancelled with the Move combo. I continue to drain, and play Effective Repairs from Lost Pile to pull the Celebration back into hand. I re-deploy it, but he manages to track his Move back around and cancel it again. I play a second Effective Repairs from my Lost Pile, and Celebration hits again. But once more, Matt finds a Move combo (apparently he still had more than one remaining, because he would have spent the original copy when he payed to drain) and Celebration is canceled. Luke retrieves it for me one more time next turn, but Matt cancels it for the fourth damn time before I can retrieve with it. Hehe. But, nothing is cancelling my drains, and he just cannot find a way to stop me from draining him out. For anyone who&#146;s curious, I won by 11. <br />
<br />
So, I qualify for Day 2 for the second straight year. Plus, I get to design a Virtual Card. Whee! Can you say Hunt Down helper? Heh. Actually, I&#146;m not sure at all what I&#146;m going to design. I&#146;ll have to think about it. There&#146;s two uncut sheets waiting for Matt and I as prizes, but I know Matt appreciates the sheets much more than I do, so I let him pick which one he wants. We say goodbye to everyone and head out. It was quite a challenge fitting both the sheets and all four passengers into my Sunfire, but Matt has experience with making the sheets fit into small cars, so we&#146;re on the road shortly after. <br />
<br />
My day&#146;s most daunting challenge still awaits, as I have to stay awake and successfully drive us home. We&#146;re all pretty hungry, and stop at the same McDonald&#146;s before departing town. I load up with a large caffeinated beverage to go with my food in an attempt to keep myself alert. I also smoke 298741852639 cigarettes throughout the drive, because nicotine is a stimulant and should help a little more. I don&#146;t get weary until everyone else conks out at about the halfway point. But I turn the AC up a notch, and listen to some music to keep my mind occupied. I manage to keep my eyes open, and we get home in pretty decent time. <br />
