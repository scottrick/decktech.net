I didnt make any notes and with 4 friendly games and 4 team games on Day 1 and another 8 games on Day 2 it really is mind boggling (not that Ive had much of a mind to begin with). So, I had to wait for my command card and only got it recently. Well, better late then never. <br />
<br />
Pre-Tournament stuff:<br />
I really, really wanted to go to Worlds this time. Early this year, I helped organize almost all of the European regionals, and flew to most of the countries to play as well. Although I had some good matches and results, I pretty much sucked at every single one of them. I had no updated decks, didnt know the meta, and had no time for training anything at all. My work is hell this year, and it wont be much better next year, so this was my last chance to play at any major events. After not qualifying at Belgium, Italian, Netherlands, German and Hungarian regionals, I decided to just skip Worlds and only do the TD at Europeans. Thanks to certain Belgium circumstances, I actually could play at the EC after all, and so I did just for fun. <br />
I had the wrong shields (gave mine to players), an 58 card LS deck that sucked (no Senate) and gave 2 games away, which could have ended as wins or losses for me, because I really didnt care anymore. Well, during the final round at the EC, I was just playing Bas and was kidding around with his 56 damage Jawa deck, when Nico came to me and said: You know that you can still qualify for Worlds, right?, and I was like wtf? It seemed I ended up 5th place with my crappy stuff, and since all the others in the top 5 were already qualified except for Angelo and me, I made it. Thanks to Bas for letting me win higher then necessary. <br />
<br />
So, I qualified, and over the course of the next 2 months we made plans with a couple of other Germans to fly over. Julian Fuss unfortunately had to skip out at the last minute (Im sure he would have made Day 3), but Dirk (Uber-Obi) Friedrichs joined Angelo Consoli, Sibille Schoentauf and me. After playing and tuning a DS Combat deck for the first half of the year, I was playing Nicos RallOps (EC winning) deck against Dirk the week before Worlds, and beat his LS Combat deck twice. The deck was absolutely my style, but I had no experience with it, no idea what to do against which match-up, and even when to flip. I didnt even had time to really build the deck, but again thanks to Julian! He send me a completely tuned, and sleeved deck for Worlds. I changed a couple of cards the day before, but that was that.<br />
My LS Senate was well tested and was the most recent V13 version. I still believe its one of the best versions out there (definitely the most balanced). It even gets around Imperial Justice (V) and other hate now. So, those were the decks.<br />
<br />
Dirk and I flew in on Friday afternoon, and were picked up by Angelo and Sibille. We dropped off the luggage at the hotel, and drove directly to the Past Times location to participate in the Day 1 Team event. That took forever to start, because the whopping 6 player Day 1 event was still going on, and so I just said hello to some old friends, like Michael Pistone and Jonny Chu. I also played a fun match with Michael Richards with 2 of his decks:<br />
<br />
Michael Richards DS Invasion vs LS Cardman deck<br />
Im only mentioning this here at all, because it actually was a fun game, and because it shows how much I know about the game these days. Never heard of Cardman (except the South Park guy, no idea if thats where this is from). So, Michael flipped fast, while I was searching for a Luke, and deployed Artoo with a gift to JP. Michael let me take it back, because the Gift does do nothing to Droids. Doh! I managed to kick his Nute Gunray out of the throne room and then out of play via OOC/TT Combo. We did a lot of battles and nifty moves that game, and the winning side changed from time to time, but Michael won with 6 cards I believe.<br />
Fun game, man! Come to Germany any time.<br />
<br />
Props: Playing Michael Richards in a fun game<br />
Slops: Not knowing my game anymore. <br />
<br />
I did another fun game against Brian Fred, and used Jonny Chus LS WYS Panic deck, actually a DDM deck. I played against this vs Jonny in the Team event, and lost. Like I said to him: I come all the way to the US to play against you, and you use Davids deck?!?. <br />
Anyway, that was fun, and so was the game against Brian. We unfortunately didnt get to finish it, but I guess I would have won that one (right, Brian?). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Team Event Day 1:<br />
Again, this is getting a bit blurry with 4 games Day 1 (plus 2 fun games), and another 8 on Day 2. I have to pass on any detailed information, sorry. Everybody who ever played at Worlds should know the feeling. I can only write a report for the actual Day 2 games. <br />
<br />
My deck was:<br />
DS Combat (the deck I almost played at Worlds, but Im glad I didnt)<br />
Dirk Friedrichs was my partner for the LS<br />
We ended up 7th place from about 16 teams, but he carried most of the load for that.<br />
I just made sure that the opponents didnt win too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
Worlds Day 2:<br />
<br />
Here was the big day. I decided to just have a great time, and I really did actually. Unfortunately, I didnt make it past page 12 or so of the new rule book, and didnt even re-sleeve my LS deck, or made any changes to the V text (those are the reduxed versions of course, but not the most current printing). I had to work till midnight the day before the flight, and then pack my stuff, shower, and off it went to da plane. If anybody was eager to disqualify me for crap like that, I simply would have accepted that. I didnt really expect to play at Day 3, so it was pure fun for me. By the way, as always during Worlds, players were very cool, fair and it was a tough, but relaxed atmosphere for the most part. I thank all my opponents and especially Henry Dunn for being the most relaxed TD ever!<br />
<br />
My decks again: <br />
LS Senate (Supreme Chancellor Chris style)<br />
DS RallOps (Nico European style)<br />
<br />
Game 1: DS RallOps vs Tom Hollingworths LS Senate<br />
<br />
Damn, first game had to be DS, and also with a crappy opening hand. No characters in starting hand should just not happen with 23 or so in there. That is not to say, that Tom didnt know what we was doing. I really had the feeling hes done that match up a couple of times. Once I finally had my characters and flipped, his activation was around 18 to my 12 or so, and he kicked my from 2 Ralltiir sites with Mace and Quiggy (I think). We had a couple of minor battles, but he effortlessly kept at least 1 site, and always got a second one back during his turn. To put insult to injury, he also coverted my forest against his own, and kicked the crap out of my imps with Obi (with stick), who stayed of course. Nice move (if you are Tom). <br />
So, a mix of bad playing on my part and good playing on his, easily brought him the win.<br />
<br />
FL -25		Total: 0 (-25)<br />
Props: Playing Tom Hollingworth (most underrated player my ass, hes good). Nice guy, too. <br />
Slops: No characters in starting hand. Not knowing my deck or game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2: LS Senate vs Pat Johnsons IG-88 CCT<br />
<br />
The good thing about the Senate deck is that it can win every match up. The bad thing is, that all the match ups are tough. Ive played this against Nico, and won, but once Iggy gets going its a real pain, because I have to be reaaallly careful. The fortunate thing about odds on the other hand is, that statistically if you draw a bad starting hand a hundred times, then your opponent will draw a bad starting hand a hundred times, too. Well, it was my turn in the first game, so it was Pats turn to have a bad opening hand now. Only fair (if you are me). ;o)<br />
Having me pull 2 cards from his hand each turn didnt help him either (always the right ones). It was a tight and interactive game anyway. We battled a couple of times, and he captured some EPP, but I was finally able to kill IG-88. He tried coming back from that, but didnt really. The search bonus was gone, and I activated more than him. I believe I also managed to get Mes Amedda going in the end (not sure if it was that game though). So, it was a clear win in the end. <br />
<br />
FW +29	Total: 2 (+4)<br />
Props: Killing Iggy, and playing well. Another nice opponent, whose name I will remember now (only asked you 3 times, buddy).<br />
Slops: His bad starting hand. Otherwise none. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3: LS Senate vs James Bookers IG-88 CCT<br />
<br />
Same match up. Team Ohio, huh? I have to say, these guys can get pretty ugly online, but really are the sweetest dudes in person. Whoever said that, Im 100% with him. No complains about Booker whatsoever. We played a slow game, shuffling and cutting our piles hundreds of times, and were both very careful. The match up is tough, like I said, and whoever makes the first mistake will lose. Thats been my experience for this match up in all the games Ive played. He activated a lot with a couple of twixes out, and always had about 10-12 cards in hand (at least 1 per turn chosen from the force pile). Booker also always had about 10 force left (plus the 12-15 he activated) after I had set up with my 3-5 senators (I need that many to prevend a beat down there). So, he was able to do virtually everything with an almost completely activated force pile from which he could also choose, but couldnt really deal me any damage either, since we both played very defensively. I did more damage, but it went to time with me having 25 to his 18 or so. I believe I would have won this in the long run (almost had drawn all the Iggy hate together), but I might have taken another hour, so I really appreciate him giving me the full win. Maybe Ohio isnt so bad!  ;o)<br />
<br />
FW +25	Total: 4 (+29)<br />
Props: Playing and beating Booker. Team Ohio being nice after all. <br />
Slops: Time play, and a not interactive game. Its the match up though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 4: DS RallOps vs Jonny Chus EBO X-Wings<br />
<br />
Only my second game with the DS deck (my 4th total counting 2 test matches against Dirk a month ago), and it has to be Jonny. It would have actually been Jonny the turn before, and we had already started, but were re-paired. Like Jonny said in his report, weve played in New York a couple of years ago, then in Germany, again in New York, one game during the Day 1 team event, the almost play the turn before, and now again. At that point I said to him: Do you realize, that Ive played against you more often than against some German players?. He was laughing, but that is actually true. Anyway, always a pleasure! He kicks my wookie 4 games out of 5 (and the fifth time he used my deck), but at least we had some good games, where I gave him a hard time. Unfortunately, he also knew my deck pretty well, because it was more or less what he showed me in New York over a year ago (and at least half a year before Nico had the idea). I didnt know his, but read somewhere that he played a 15 tons of X-Wings deck a while ago (and won with it), so I didnt expect much ground or speeders. I flipped and spread fast, and also had a solid space in hand, and drew some more of that. I killed a lone <br />
X-Wing with Vader in Shuttle, but he only lost 1 card overflow due to huge forfeit. In retrospect, I should have used Crossfire (V) to add some damage, but Ive never really played against this kind of deck, and didnt expect the little ships to be that strong to be honest. In what I thought was a good move (and I still would do it again), I played a lost Monnok, and got nothing?!? With 13 bloody X-Wings in the deck, and about 12 cards in hand? Dammit! I guess thats what Jonny means, when he says I got lucky against Chris. What was really stupid was moving Vader on to another X-Wing to block a drain. Thats where I got clobbered. And I had seen the hand. I just didnt pay enough attention, only seen the 1 <br />
X-Wing and not the rest. So, in addition to the expected Vader loss (I would have gotten him back into hand, etc.), but not the shuttle and another 15 cards overflow. He outdrained me, and kept me flipped back then of course. Not my best game indeed. Next time, Ill give you a harder time, Jonny! Still, nice fast game, and he is the 2 time World Champ, right?<br />
<br />
FL -21		Total: 4 (+8)<br />
Props: Playing Jonny. Trying to play a successful Monnok.<br />
Slops: Not playing a successful Monnok. Getting a stupid space beat down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 5: LS Senate vs Ryan Masons DS Combat with Imperial Propagandas<br />
<br />
Well, half the games done, and I was 2:2. That was okay for me so far, especially since I didnt have any real training. Next up was Dark Combat, also a tough match up, since I have only 3 good destinies for dueling in the deck, and cannot cancel his drains. Only beat downs will win me the game, and that I did twice. He started with Maul and Double-Saber, while I set up first turn (Palpy and Mothma). Next turn he drains and re-inforces with Palpy. My turn, I deploy the 2 destiny manipulating Political Effects, and ask for his power there. Always a nice second turn question, if some-one has two of the toughest beeyatches in the SW universe on table, by the way. He had 12, I believe (no idea where they stood), so I deploy Quiggy with stick (6 power), play I Have A Bad Feeling About This, and battle. No responses for all this. Im not sure if I had pulled some cards from his hand either. I swing and kill Maul, and Maul kills Quiggy. I draw a 6 (+3 Amidala) and 5 maybe (+3 Senator), and he draws a 6 (add 6 to my power , and -3 Senator). So, my power is around 29 to his 15. Difference twice is all on table plus some overflow. And after drawing (another Bad Feeling, and Senators), I do the real nasty move of playing Seeking An Audience (V) out of play to take Quiggy back into hand. A real spirit breaker! Ryans from Canada by the way, and he really took it all with good spirit. Would have loved to go to that industrial rave party with you guys, but I was too jet legged. Sorry. So, I did another beat down (not quite as tough), was careful not to drain for more then 2, since he had a couple of Attrocities (V) out, and a non-virtual one was likely, and out drained and damaged him in the end. <br />
<br />
FW +21	Total: 6 (+29)<br />
Props: Playing really good at least. Not walking into the Attrocity. Ryan, industrial music clubs, and Canadians in general. <br />
Slops: Did make it to Canada that week, but couldnt hit any bar or pub in Chicago. Wtf?<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 6: DS RallOps vs James Bookers Hidden Base Space <br />
<br />
Booker again, and I sure was more happy then him about the rematch. Some of my cards were foils and bend badly, so he had me use proxies, which was absolutely correct. It wasnt my deck, and Ive never even seen it before coming to the States. So, sorry abot that, and mad props to Booker for not making any hassle about it, and Henry Dunn for handling these things easy in general. When we finally played, we were again shuffling, cutting and activating in the hundreds, but it was still a better game. I flipped and spread on the ground, while he set up in space. Maybe a bit too careful (gathering at Rendevouz Point, and then moving over), but at Worlds you cant be too careful. Again, one mistake, and youre pushing the daisies. I also found his Hidden Base with first or second try (I somehow always manage to do so), so it became a drain race. Overseeing It Personally helped me having bigger drains, and he retrieved with Luke (V), and drained big, too. It was a tough and intense end game, and went to time again. Hands down. During my last turn I initiated a battle just to exchange a crap interrupt from hand against Brief Loss Of Control (V), which I had top decked before. During his last turn, I used that to prevend his Kessel drain. So, I barely had a time win with about 12 to 9 or 10, I believe. My command card said TW +1, but it wasnt that close. Ill use the number for that report though. It was close enough anyway, and he would have won it, if we had played it out, so that I didnt ask for a full win (which might have brought me to Day 3, dammit). The Brief Loss (V) will make him hate my guts forever as it is. <br />
Although he must hate Brad Eier more for losing with 44 in the final game, but after having done my share to keep Booker out of Day 3 (and after you read my next game), Im the last one to point fingers. Team Ohio are my friends now.  ;o))<br />
<br />
TW +1		Total: 7 (+30)<br />
Props: Good game. Beating Booker again. Finding the HB soon. Brief Loss Of Control (V).<br />
Slops: Winning a losing game. Time play. Foil cards that bend. <br />
<br />
<br />
Game 7: LS Senate vs Joe Olsons DS Combat<br />
<br />
Thats the one game, I would rather forget about, and thats more my fault than his. I was playing loose and sloppy for most of the day, and all my opponents were easy going, too. Im not sure if any-one really let anybody else take any actions back, or if it simply never came up, but all the games were old home week style up to that point. To make a long story (and 20 minutes 3 judge decision) short, I forgot to take 2 cards (for 2 tunnel visions) into hand, because he assumed I was cheating in between. I didnt (I had drawn a couple of cards and pulled 2 political effects, so my hand appeared large), but really left the 2 cards in force pile. I dont think he wanted to be a jerk about it, but was more wondering about my hand size. The rest of the game, the judge pointed out that he made more mistakes than me, and after I wanted to lose 3 to a drain of 1 or 2 after he especially told me its not 3, I think we can agree that it was just a long day, and nobody wanted to screw with the other. Anyway, it was my mistake, and I take responsibility for it and apologize. <br />
The 2 cards were crap by the way. Henry Dunn had a laugh, because one was a Political Effect and the other a Smoke Screen. I really had nothing going and just wanted to battle some. That we did after all, and had a little drain race going. He won with 12 in the end. <br />
<br />
FL -12		Total: 7 (+18)<br />
Props: Henry Dunn and the judge team for hard effort. Joe Olson for patience. :o)<br />
Slops: Me for screwing up. The whole game otherwise. :o(<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 8: DS RallOps vs Thomas Whaleys QMC Gungans<br />
<br />
So, Im at the last game, and my mind is a water melon. As I said to my buddies before, the last game is an advantage for me, because Im always overworked, undersexed, and usually havent slept enough for days, while it might be an extreme situation for my opponent. Well, not so with Thomas Whaley. This guy is one step ahead of me in that regard. I heard he hasnt slept for 3 days straight before every Worlds. This has not only got my respect, but a good laugh out of me as well. Considering that I played a third of my regional games drunk this year, take it as a compliment, man. Thomas is the American answer to our own (German) Ralf Wachowiak. Maybe not too high on the ranking lists, but hes able to beat every player out there, and knows the cards and rules better then most. At least thats my impression. Ive played against him a couple of years ago in a sealed tourney, and now for real. Anyway, we were both tired and beat, but it was a fun game. And he had a damn fun deck, too. <br />
I could sum the deck and the whole game up with one sentence from him: And after I deploy the Gungan General, I Off The Edge my Power Droid!. Hows that for starters? I was really having a ball when I heard that. And he actually Off The Edged a Power Droid every bloody turn. (The one time I dont have a Program Trap, right Pistone?). Basically, the game consisted of me battling him off the Cloud City sites, and losing as many characters as I retrieved with Dark Dominion (V), while he retrieved like hell each turn. Im not sure how many Cloud City Celebrations I cancelled and how much Thomas actually retrieved, but more then I could deal. Overseeing It Personally, and board control brought me the win though. <br />
<br />
FW +22	Total: 9 (+40)<br />
Props: Fun game. New things in Thomas deck. Off The Edging Power Droids in general.<br />
Slops: None really.<br />
<br />
Total result was 9 (+40) or so, which placed me at 16 of 43. <br />
<br />
Again, 5:3 was good, and I was happy with it. The only losses I had against Jonny Chu and Tom Hollingworth, who placed 1st and 3rd on Day 3, and against Joe Olson (in a game I would rather forget or have repeated. I say it again: my fault.). All in all it was a fun weekend. <br />
Nice to meet all you guys (again or first time). Always a blast!!!<br />
<br />
After-Tourney stuff:<br />
<br />
The rest of the week I spend hopping through the States. First Salt Lake City and Denver with Angelo and Sibille. We had 2 funny days there. Then, up to Vancouver, and visiting Michael Erisman in Snowqualmie. Thanks again to you and Michelle for everything, man!! Youre the best! I also got to play a few cool games against Michael, and met Doug and Andrew Tylor for the first time. Then 2 days of partying way too hard with my cousin Cathy in Seattle, and a short trip to Anchorage, Alaska. So, this was my 18th visit to America, and Ive seen about 40 of the States. Current politics aside, its still one of the best countries in the world. Ill take my time for the rest of the States, and would survive without having seen Montana and Illinois.<br />
Been to Ohio though, and have the speeding ticket to prove it (get out there fast, right?). I dont want to get too frindly with you guys. ;o) <br />
<br />
Anyway, my late report. Sorry for any mix ups. It was 3 weeks ago. <br />
<br />
May the Force be with ya<br />
