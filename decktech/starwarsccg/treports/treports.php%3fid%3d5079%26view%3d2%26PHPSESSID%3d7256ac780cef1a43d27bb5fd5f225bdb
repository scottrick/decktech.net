Pre-Tourney Junk<br />
<br />
	June 19, 2004  I had been tweaking my decks for the past few weeks for states...I decided on CCT for dark side and, of course, I love WHAP for Light.  I like CCT because it takes away Han and Lando, has decent damage, and can adapt to most light decks out there.  I was slightly concerned about WHAP, having played the matchup several times...but Security Precautions (v) and Krayt Dragon Bones (v) made me feel good enough.  Ive had a lot of success with WHAP, and I decided to gamble that I wouldnt face Walkers more than once.  Walkers is undoubtedly the worst matchup for WHAP, at least in my experience.  But enough rambling.<br />
<br />
We had like 16 people show up by noon, which was pretty cool.  Kevin yavinite Elia was supposed to TD, but wanted to play, and thankfully Ralph Anger agreed to direct instead.<br />
<br />
Matchups are set....and the games begin!<br />
<br />
Round 1  My CCT vs. Barry der dritte Wright, IIIs LSC<br />
<br />
You know whats great?  Coming down to a big tourney with lots of new people...and playing against someone who lives 5 minutes from your house.  Oh well.  This matchup was fairly uneventful.  He podraces, and starts Squassin.  He puts Yoda (v) out on Naboo, I think I have someone with the prize on cloud city, and free executor with Lando up at Bespin.  The main turning point occurred when I saw that Yoda was out with no force saved.  I dropped First Strike with DVD LOTS, Fett on crack, and I think P-59...maybe it was someone else...I dont really remember.  I cause around 16 overflow.  He had Obi-Wan and Princess Leia (v) at the other Naboo site, but couldnt drain since I flipped him.  Lando (v) saved me from losing force from combat once by adding one to my total...Lando (v) is my hero!  Hes so good.  I think I just drain the rest of the game...details are kinda fuzzy unfortunately.<br />
<br />
FW 2  (+28)<br />
<br />
Props  Getting the opportunity to do the First Strike beatdown I guess...<br />
Slops  Playing against a fellow Harford County dude.<br />
<br />
Round 2  My WHAP vs.  David JediJawa Lanktons Walkers<br />
<br />
Im not too thrilled when I see his objective.  He starts YMSYL, Mob Points Combo, and Combat Response.  I start DDTA, Wokling (v), and Saitorr (v).  I figure that I might as well just play it out and hope I dont have to play this matchup again.  I flip quickly, and he takes some time getting set up at the 5th marker.  His Decree (v) hurts my damage, like all Walker decks do...grrrrr.....Vset 7 better do something to fix that.  I wait until the turn when hes gonna blow the generator, then play Sense/Recoil in Fear.  But alas, after he shuffles it in he gets the Epic Event back in his hand...oh well....bad luck for me.  It gets blown up, I lose some.  <br />
<br />
Scrub Mistake #1 <br />
<br />
Ric Olie, BL rushes Tat Maul on the Infiltrator, and tries to battle...then realizes he isnt present at the system.  Stupid stupid stupid.  Dengar (v) was on the Punishing One at Hoth....the infiltrator was at Rendili (I think...mightve been Carida...oh well).  So Ric doesnt accomplish a whole lot.<br />
<br />
My lightsabers help me get fairly decent drains on Naboo (Lightsaber Proficiency rules!)...and walkers puts a ton of cards on the table, so I know its going to be close.  Atrocity helps a bit....and I use It Could Be Worse a bit.  But his damage ends up outlasting mine....I hate Walkers.<br />
<br />
FL 0  (-4)<br />
<br />
Props  To Dave...its a solid deck for sure...it was a close game.<br />
Slops  The PC for making walkers so strong :)  and letting it start Decree...and making Decree (v).  I guess I deserve slops too for not packing more walker hate.<br />
<br />
Round 3  My CCT vs. Brandon TptMan Powerss WHAP<br />
<br />
Yay for playing another guy from Harford County that I playtest with all the time.  I start Mob Points, KDY (v) and Delivery (v).  He starts typical WHAP stuff, suspending my Mob Points before I can grab my favorite super star destroyer.  First turn, I put Emperor Palpatine down at the Throne Room and deploy Security Precautions (v) there.  His turn, he puts out Padme, and goes to pull a Jedi.  Unfortunately, with Precautions (v) out...he doesnt have the Force to do it.  Padme gets persona replaced by Queen Amidala.  I put out Maul w/stick and someone else....maybe Dr. E combo.....all reinforcing Palpy.  Also, Bubo comes out with Krayt (v)...and Amidala gets eaten with a little help by Lando (v) (I didnt battle because I had like 4 force saved and I figured he had Its A Trap).  He abuses Found Someone You Have (v) to get Amidala back, and rushes with Jannick, Horace Vancil, and Sio Bibble.  He runs KlorSlug (v) so I dont get to be mean and abuse the not-so-good doctor.  Everyone dies except for the queen I think, and forfeit Palpy.  I manage to hold on to the Throne Room for the rest of the game...there is some action on Cloud City tho...I think Blizzard 4 got rushed by Qui-Gon.  Thankfully tho, I maintain possession of the Prize, and Despair (v) lets me keep a nice high drain of 3 going.  Space gets set up and my drains eventually end it.<br />
<br />
FW 2 (+16ish)<br />
<br />
Props  Lando (v) is the king of SWCCG.  Found Someone You Have (v) is pretty hot in WHAP...that let him regenerate a ton of people.<br />
Slops  Again...making the trip to states where there are tons of new people and playing someone from Harford County.<br />
<br />
So right now Im like 4 (+40).  Drew Scott is undefeated, and I think Chris Anger, Elia, and Lankton are towards the top at this point.  Not really sure tho.<br />
<br />
Round 4  WHAP vs. Kevin yavinite Elias SYC TIE swarm<br />
<br />
Ive never played against TIE swarm before...and I dont really want to again now, after seeing Elias version.  Its tech, and bong, and dare I say....broken.  :)  He starts Mob Points combo, KDY (v), and Decree (v).  Im pretty wary at first, I have no idea how this decks gonna play out, so I just kinda lay low on Naboo for a while.  He gets out Wakeelmui and Sienar Fleet Systems, and the insanity begins.  He deploys TIE interceptors all over the place I think he had Kashyyyk, Sullust, and Endor out as his battleground systems.  Arica comes out really quick to stop my drain at the Throne Room.  Panaka tries to Sorry About the Mess her....and misses.  A few turns later, Qui-Gon tries....and misses.  Qui-Gon gets her on his 2nd try tho fortunately, it stinks that it took so long tho.  Thankfully, I got Mace damage set up pretty quick...and Qui-Gon + Saber + Proficiency = steady drain of 3.  Even tho he uses Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to cancel it a few times.  I get Officer Dolphe out early to battle a lone TIE, and he plays that interrupt All Power to Weapons or whatever so he has immunity.  Nothing really happens...and next turn cannons come out and Dolphe goes bye bye.  That saddens me.  I put Obi-Wan at the Death Star Dbay to keep him off a BG site.  So he keeps retrieving tons and tons from Sienar, and I get Dolphe back eventually by using Route (v) and Disorder (v).  Dolphe comes out again and keeps battling lone TIEs.  I think on 3 consecutive turns he deployed either The Emperors Sword or the Shield as a react.  Thats just craziness....and pretty cool actually.  My objective was the only thing keeping Dolphe around as he was like power 9 or so and kept cancelling his battle destiny.<br />
<br />
It was a pretty intense drain race...but I had a drain of 3 with Qui-Gon, 1 with Obi, another 1 on Naboo, plus obj and mace damage rolling.  The game looks like its gonna be really close.  I find Ric Olie, Bravo Leader, and he comes down to reinforce space.  I dont believe they were ever challenged and set up a nice drain of 1 at endor.  (Dark Side Endor is dumb.  Light side gets drain -1 unless they have an ewok on Endor.  Whats up with that?  Decipher has a sick sense of humor...trying to get LS players to play with Ewoks.....)  I Alter Dreaded Imperial Starfleet towards the end....just to make sure that my drain of 3 will keep going through.  I drain him out and win by 3.<br />
<br />
FW 2 (+3)<br />
<br />
Props  To Kevin...it was a very good game, very very close.  Props to Route (v) for being awesome and letting Panaka and Qui-Gon try 3 times to kill Arica.  Sienar Fleet Systems deserves props to for being just crazy-good.  And Dolphe has to get props....he is the man when the WHAP obj flips.  He took on 2 Emperors Shields and an Emperors Sword I think.<br />
<br />
Slops  Qui-Gon for missing Arica with a saber.  The Emperors Shield and Sword for coming down as reacts.  Shouldnt that be restricted to the same system as the Emperor or something?<br />
<br />
Round 5  WHAP vs. Drew  drew man1 Scotts Walkers<br />
<br />
Well, I lost my gamble.  Its no good playing walkers twice in a tourney.  But oh well, too bad for me.  Whenever you gamble my friend, eventually you lose.  This game was pretty cool actually, I had never met Drew before...and we joked around a bit.   He started Imperial Arrest Order Combo, YMSYL, and Combat Response.<br />
One thing that really stinks tho...is when you play WHAP...and you activate Secure Route (v) with your first 3 force!  Oh well, I had a Signal in hand so it worked out I guess.  I flip 2nd turn....and start the obj damage.  On the turn he blows the generator, I use Atrocity (v) and have an It Could Be Worse in hand.  What should I do?  Its risky.....I go for it, and reduce the damage to 0.  He has no response.  (whew, that couldve been bad)  I was actually feeling kinda good about this game, Qui-Gon came out and killed off a walker, and controlled the 3rd marker for awhile.  He was draining with his saber and proficiency there, but unfortunately he controlled my lovely drain of 4.  But the good feeling soon leaves.  He uses non-v Decree also, and I lose all drain bonuses.  He plays with a TON of Hoth sites, and he gets steady damage rolling in.  My damage is severly hindered by Decree and Decree (v).  (If I get to design a virtual card it will say something to the effect of...Deploy on table.  Opponent loses 2 force at the end of each of their turns for every copy of Imperial Decree on table.  (Immune to Imperial Decree and Alter)).  That would solve many problems for WHAP.  Anyway, I try to play cat-and-mouse with walkers...but I keep getting outpowered by like 2 per battle, and keep losing 2.  Also, I make<br />
<br />
Scrub Mistake #2 <br />
<br />
He Barriers Obi-Wan when I rush Tempest 1 with DS-61-2 aboard.  I decide to Sense it....losing 2 force plus the sense thanx to my Do, Or Do Not.  Dolt!  That was basically me losing 3 force for absolutely nothing.<br />
I lose by like 9...as he eventually pulls off a Garrison.  I also let him get off a Control Combo without grabbing it, which hurt.<br />
<br />
FL 0  (-9ish)<br />
<br />
Props  Getting It Could Be Worse to save me from losing anything to Target the Main Generator.  Drew for being a cool guy.  Thats about it.<br />
Slops  Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control (v) for existing.  Decree and Decree (v) for being good.....too good.  Me for making scrubby mistakes...and to Secure Route for getting into my Used Pile.<br />
<br />
So Drews definitely in the final... and the only one undefeated to my knowledge.  Im pretty sure I wont be.  But as luck would have it, sides work out so that I get to play Drew again!  Last game of the day...<br />
<br />
Game 6  My CCT vs. Drew drew man1 Scotts WYS<br />
<br />
I had never played against WYS before, and wasnt quite sure what to expect.  He starts Menace Fades, Squassin, and Insurrection combo.  In the beginning I just focus on getting the Executor set up with Chiraneau and Flagship (v).  He puts Mirax to Kessel early.  I rush with ZiMH, and he Hyper Escapes away.  Too bad Despair (v) wasnt out yet.  He then puts everyone and their brother at Kessel.  By that I mean that Dash was there (Wedge was with Dash on Outrider I believe)...Theron Nett, Mirax, and I think Luke.  Quite a full house, and I wasnt too keen on rushing with an Executor that would be power -9.  So I kinda let him have the drain of 3 there, I dont play Resistance...or the anti-WYS shield.  Eventually I get my Despair drain of 3 going, and show him that it overrides Menace Fades.  He has a Palace Raider in a Patrol Craft at Dbay 94 for a long time, but I fear to rush because of Fallen Portal.  In retrospect I probably shouldve rushed anyway, just to force it, but oh well.  Eventually I put P-59 there, but dont battle.  He puts down Talon Karrde on another craft, but I barrier Talon.  He battles anyway, and P-59 shoots the raiders craft, and he loses 2.  Now, what game would be complete without another <br />
<br />
Scrub Mistake (#3)<br />
<br />
I draw a 4 for battle destiny with P-59 and immediately add 1 to it with Lando (v).  He draws a 4 for battle destiny, and had I REDUCED it, my favorite droideka would have lived.  Argh!  Yay for being a scrub.<br />
<br />
On his next turn, he moves Talon into the cantina hoping to drain...but Bubo comes out to make a snack of Mr. Karrde.  The whole game Im draining for 3 with Despair (v), but he cancels it every so often by using Control and Its A Hit and It Could Be Worse like 5,000 times.  (By the way, Id like to talk with whoever designed the WYS objective.  Why did they make it so you can play a lost interrupt, then play it again from Lost pile, AND make it impossible for DS to Sense it?  Thats just mean.)  <br />
<br />
At some point I get The Emperors Prize (v) on Vader, and thats cool, because I like direct damage.  Space is kinda stupid, as the Executor keeps chasing Luke around b/w Tatooine and Bespin.  It becomes clear that this game is gonna be really close, and we both start doing kinda weird things to try to bump up the damage.  He lands some people at docking bays, Zuckuss lands at Mos Espa....and Luke even comes to the Cloud City docking bay to block a drain.  Its his turn, and he has one life force left and I think I have 2.  Were both frantically thinking of ways to get last minute retrieval or damage in, but when it gets to be his move phase, he loses 1 to Empys Prize.  <br />
<br />
FW 2 (+2)<br />
<br />
Props  One of the best games Ive played in a long time, mad props to Drew again.  Despair (v) deserves props for overriding Menace Fades, Emperors Prize (v) deserves props for winning the game, and I guess Bubo gets props for eating Talon Karrde.<br />
<br />
Slops  Me for not packing Resistance or the anti-WYS shield I guess.  Me for making another big scrub mistake that definitely hurt me.  WYS for not letting me Sense anything.<br />
<br />
So I finish 4th out of like 16 or 17  (8  +40ish I think, I guess I got some of the numbers wrong, my bad).  Drew finishes on top at the end of 6 games, with 10 victory points, and Dave Lankton has 9.  So it will be the two of them in the final confrontation....how about that?  The two guys whose walker decks beat me...gotta love irony.<br />
<br />
FC Game 1  Daves Profit against Drews Walkers<br />
<br />
I wont go into too many details here, out of respect to the players, but Ill tell you basically what happened.  Kevin Elia and Dave designed this Profit deck with Walkers in mind specifically.  The ability to put out Boussh whenever you want to kill Vader at the 5th marker is so huge.  Dave kills Vader and Maul, and Drew ends up using Veers to go for the main generator.  He draws a 6, and later admits he wasnt tracking it.  There arent too many walkers around on Hoth towards the end...Drew has space solidly, but Dave owns Tatooine and I think the Hoth dbay.   Dave wins by 16.<br />
<br />
FC Game 2  Drews WYS against Daves Walkers<br />
<br />
So Drew needs to win by 17 to take the tournament.  Dave puts out an Imperial Walker with Lando (v) and the cannons on board first turn....saying hes gonna blow it 2nd turn.  If he had, he definitely wouldve won.  Unfortunately, on 4 consecutive turns, he tries to blow it with Lando and fails.  Drew gets the Kessel stuff going, and Ill Take the Leader boosts his drain at the Spaceport docking bay on Kessel to 2.  Drew is dealing steady damage...Dave has virtual Dengar at the Hoth system.  Eventually, he puts Tat. Maul on the walker to blow it up.  Drew uses It Could Be Worse to reduce the damage, Dave uses Its Worse, and uses his whole force pile to up the damage by another 10.  Drew has Its A Hit in his hand!  Thats tech.  Finally, both sides are able to deal damage, but Drew still has a pretty nice-sized life force.  Dave knows he just has to get him under 16.  When Daves about to be drained out, he plays Limited Resources to make Drew lose 4.  Then, Drew drains Dave out and counts his life force............................<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
17!<br />
<br />
It doesnt get much closer than that folks, what a finish.  Great tourney overrall...many many good games were had.  I guess its time for final props and slops.<br />
<br />
Final Props  <br />
<br />
Kevin Elia/Ralph Anger for running the tourney.<br />
Drew for winning it<br />
CCT for going 3-0<br />
Elia again for playing TIEs and a crazy Lobot TRM deck that drains for like 27 on turn 2 or 3  ( I still want to see that decklist)<br />
Everyone for showing up.<br />
Pepsi Vanilla, for tasting good (even tho I still think it tastes like Vanilla Coke)<br />
The guy that I saw that played Dark Deal, and used All Too Easy to freeze Qui-Gon w/Stick and cause 8 force loss.  Ive never seen that happen before.<br />
Props to you if you read the TR the whole way thru to get this far.<br />
<br />
Slops <br />
<br />
People who didnt show who couldve.<br />
Me for hoping to only play against walkers once, but having to play against them twice.<br />
Secure Route (v) for being activated.<br />
IO/IC (v) for owning me.  <br />
Slops to you if you just skipped to this part.  :) <br />
<br />
For dark decks, I saw a bunch of walker decks, some CCT, a Deal, a Watto, some Hunt Down, a TIE deck, an Invasion, and thats all I remember.<br />
<br />
For light decks, I saw some WHAP, some Profit, a LSC, some MBO, a WYS, a MWYHL, a crazy TRM deck that abuses Lobot, and a bit of Hidden Base.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if Ill post either of my decks I took, I guess if theres enough popular interest...I might.  Well, I suppose thats it for now....<br />
<br />
Good Morning!  (And if I dont see you, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!)<br />
<br />
P.S. First one to get that reference will get 3,000 cool points.<br />
