I have been given consent to post this.<br />
<br />
<br />
XXXXXXXX: for what it&#39;s worth, i&#39;m on the adv rulebook committee<br />
XXXXXXXX: they&#39;re not all noobs =)<br />
retwin316: haha, but you yourself have often admitted to being quite noobish ;)<br />
XXXXXXXX: hmmm true lol<br />
retwin316: and i would never put you in the group of people of whom i spoke about, the chu&#39;s, bastian&#39;s, clint&#39;s<br />
XXXXXXXX: obv<br />
XXXXXXXX: neither would i<br />
retwin316: i mean i know you understand the game<br />
retwin316: so you think this change is for the better?<br />
XXXXXXXX: honestly, long term, yes<br />
retwin316: why would anyone want to change the rules now<br />
retwin316: it makes no sense<br />
XXXXXXXX: the rule side of it is overly complex<br />
retwin316: substituting a destiny?<br />
XXXXXXXX: and all that complexity can be transfered to card text in the form of just making cards add destiny to attrition or power instead of adding battle desitny<br />
retwin316: i am not buying that at all<br />
XXXXXXXX: well i&#39;m not going to rehash the whole argument<br />
retwin316: what do you mean transfered to card text?<br />
XXXXXXXX: the problem with reversing the rule on substituted destiny draws is that battle destiny limiting becomes too powerful<br />
XXXXXXXX: and also too easy to cancel<br />
retwin316: you lost me<br />
retwin316: i thought you were arguing agaisnt what i am<br />
XXXXXXXX: no i agree<br />
XXXXXXXX: if nothing is done, then endor ops and the AOs that limit to 1 battle destiny become too good<br />
retwin316: !?<br />
retwin316: but you just said a second ago that you thought the change was good?<br />
XXXXXXXX: long term, yes<br />
XXXXXXXX: because this change isn&#39;t all that&#39;s coming<br />
retwin316: lol<br />
retwin316: sigh<br />
XXXXXXXX: design is working on a small v set that will alleviate the problems we all foresee<br />
XXXXXXXX: the biggest problem with the whole thing is that Sonn made the announcement about destiny without waiting for everyone to get together and come up with a strategy for releasing the information<br />
retwin316: strategy?<br />
retwin316: !?<br />
XXXXXXXX: which should have included lingrell saying &quot;v set 13 will be coming out soon and will fix any problems the rules change introduces&quot;<br />
retwin316: ok<br />
retwin316: so then let me ask one thing<br />
retwin316: after all is said and done<br />
XXXXXXXX: instead sonn got pissed off at brian hunter and phatalerror arguing about the failed destiny thing and so released the destiny draw thing before ppl were ready for it<br />
retwin316: LOL<br />
retwin316: quick question then<br />
XXXXXXXX: because as you can see, he&#39;s not the best at dealing with ppl<br />
retwin316: when all is said and done<br />
retwin316: i have tantive, and bright hope, my oppenent has dengar, he plays watch your back, can i cancel the destiny?<br />
retwin316: dengar in ship<br />
XXXXXXXX: once this new rule is in effect, yes<br />
XXXXXXXX: use 1 force with bright hope to cancel it<br />
retwin316: ok, tell me what is wrong with this scenerio?<br />
retwin316: that doesnt seem retarded?<br />
XXXXXXXX: you didn&#39;t have your defensive shield version of imperial justice V out<br />
XXXXXXXX: or you could have prevented him from canceling it<br />
retwin316: what the frimbazel does that mean?<br />
XXXXXXXX: that means that this rules change is not the only thing that will happen in the next month or two<br />
retwin316: how has any version of imperial justice ever stopped a destiny from being canceled<br />
XXXXXXXX: imperial justice V: both players draw only one battle destiny which can&#39;t be modified or canceled<br />
retwin316: ahhhh<br />
XXXXXXXX: the design committee KNOWS that this rule will make destiny draws too easy to cancel<br />
retwin316: by taking a card into hand<br />
XXXXXXXX: and they will come up with a set of cards that will balance that out<br />
XXXXXXXX: like, probably, a defensive shield version of imperial justice V<br />
XXXXXXXX: that doesn&#39;t have the take card into hand restriction, but some other cost<br />
retwin316: you dont feel as though having to make up a whole new set of cards, to help out agaisnt changing a rule completely, is a bad idea?<br />
XXXXXXXX: i believe that the complexity of the game should lie on the back of the cards, not the rules<br />
XXXXXXXX: look at magic, it has the simplest system possible, and thus is the most popular game<br />
XXXXXXXX: swccg has a LOT more complexity, which (obv) is a plus of playing it, but it can be a barrier<br />
retwin316: yeah, but no matter what you, or sonn, or evan want, this is not magic man<br />
XXXXXXXX: i know<br />
XXXXXXXX: i just think it should be a little bit more simple<br />
retwin316: why would you want to dumb down the game?<br />
retwin316: MORE SIMPLE!?<br />
retwin316: god<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol<br />
XXXXXXXX: don&#39;t freak out<br />
XXXXXXXX: obv i still want complexity<br />
retwin316: why dont you play a different game then XXXXXXXX :)<br />
XXXXXXXX: have you seen the creature rules we cooked up?<br />
retwin316: there is swccg, there is magic, and there is uncle wiggily<br />
XXXXXXXX: they are way more complex than the last set of rules for creatures<br />
retwin316: why must swccg be like thos games<br />
XXXXXXXX: i&#39;m not saying that<br />
XXXXXXXX: i don&#39;t want it to be like magic<br />
XXXXXXXX: i&#39;m just saying, i&#39;ve played a lot of different games the last few years<br />
retwin316: creatures are dumb, and ddm is the only person who ever goesd about trying to make them good<br />
retwin316: if you dont want it to be like magic, why dumb it down<br />
XXXXXXXX: well the point is, we streamlined the creature attacks so that they all work the same way, and the same way as battles<br />
retwin316: there is no reason to change this particular rule<br />
retwin316: it isnt too complex<br />
XXXXXXXX: which is more complex than attacks used to work, but at the same time simpler because if you know how a battle works, attacks work the same way<br />
retwin316: maybe colo was for tards, but who cares, colo is gone<br />
XXXXXXXX: true<br />
XXXXXXXX: and we&#39;re all happy about that<br />
retwin316: i have never once had anyone question what was going on when i play darklightser spin, and if it was a newish player, they understood right away when it was explained<br />
<br />
Portion removed to protect XXXXXXXX It was quite comical though....<br />
<br />
retwin316: i am trying to be civil about this, because i consider you a friend, but this is just too much<br />
XXXXXXXX: dude, i was pissed when i found out about it too<br />
retwin316: doesnt sound like it<br />
XXXXXXXX: you should see the first couple posts on the thread when sonn told us about it<br />
XXXXXXXX: the point is that now i believe it&#39;s the right way to go<br />
retwin316: it sounds like someone just decided, and everyone else in your little group just accepted it<br />
XXXXXXXX: as long as design comes up with the cards that fix it<br />
XXXXXXXX: dude we argued about it<br />
retwin316: there shouldnt be cards that need to fix it though<br />
retwin316: that is frimbazeling stupid<br />
retwin316: ok, so what you are telling me is, he decided, you all argued, but he said i am pulling rank, so you all fell in line?<br />
XXXXXXXX: no, he convinced us<br />
retwin316: LOL<br />
retwin316: convinced<br />
retwin316: so why dont you convince me<br />
XXXXXXXX: and most of us (not all though) believe that if handled properly, it&#39;ll work<br />
retwin316: because this sounds like a load of exhaust<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol because i have to wave my hand and sound like a jedi to do it<br />
retwin316: you know what i think, with something being changed that basicly changes the very way the game should be played, it should be a unanimous decision<br />
retwin316: and it doesnt sound like it was<br />
XXXXXXXX: heh nothing is every unanimous<br />
retwin316: i want to know what he said that convinced you<br />
retwin316: DUDE<br />
retwin316: ok, think about it then<br />
retwin316: this is changing the very way the game is played<br />
retwin316: if it isnt unanimous<br />
retwin316: it should&#39;t be changed<br />
XXXXXXXX: well maybe you&#39;re right<br />
retwin316: we arent talking about changing an abusive V card, we are talking about changing the very rules of the game<br />
retwin316: come on man<br />
XXXXXXXX: well we&#39;re talking about changing a game situation that arose out of a loophole<br />
retwin316: a loophole!?<br />
retwin316: i am not buying that<br />
retwin316: those cardss have been used for years to get around broken strategys<br />
XXXXXXXX: what convinced me is that the rules themselves on destiny draws make no distinction between drawn and substituted.  consistently they say stuff like &quot;you only have attrition when you draw battle destiny&quot;<br />
retwin316: i dont care what they were initially supposed to do, by reading the cards, and knowing how the game has been played for years, you understand what those cards do<br />
XXXXXXXX: not &quot;when you have a battle destiny value&quot;, but &quot;when you DRAW destiny&quot;, but ppl always ignored that when using their loophole<br />
XXXXXXXX: that&#39;s what convinced me, in the end<br />
retwin316: so i dont get it, you arent supposed to have atrition if you didnt draw destiny? the atrition part could just be changed<br />
XXXXXXXX: that&#39;s one example, not the whole thing<br />
retwin316: it sounds to me like he already decided no matter what he was changing it, and then he just went about trying to convince your group it was ok<br />
XXXXXXXX: i dunno, i really doubt that<br />
retwin316: do you think if decipher still had the liscense, that they would just change the game?<br />
retwin316: do you think any card game 10 + years into it, would just change a ruling this ground breaking?<br />
XXXXXXXX: i think what happened is he was really trying to get inside the rules documents, and found this inconsistency, and is trying to fix it<br />
XXXXXXXX: i would point to magic 6th edition<br />
retwin316: what, the stack?<br />
XXXXXXXX: or L5R redoing their game<br />
XXXXXXXX: or raw deal revolution<br />
retwin316: yeah, but we arent redoing the game<br />
retwin316: raw deal is complete exhaust, i wouldnt bring that game up<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol<br />
XXXXXXXX: you just asked if any card game would change a rule<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol<br />
retwin316: that game has always had something wrong with it<br />
retwin316: i said 10 + years in<br />
retwin316: magic 6th ed wasnt even close to 10 years in<br />
XXXXXXXX: true<br />
XXXXXXXX: you&#39;ve got a point there<br />
XXXXXXXX: how about this: en passant was introduced into chess about a 1000 years after the game became fairly standardized<br />
retwin316: god, this is just frimbazeling sick<br />
retwin316: what was?<br />
retwin316: lol?<br />
XXXXXXXX: en passant, the ability of a pawn to take a pawn by moving into the spot the first pawn would have been at if it had just moved 1 space instead of 2<br />
XXXXXXXX: anyway it&#39;s kind of a silly example<br />
retwin316: i have no idea what you are talking about<br />
retwin316: i mean i have played chess before, but i dont know what you are talking about<br />
XXXXXXXX: pawns can move 2 squares when moving for teh first time, right?<br />
retwin316: yes<br />
XXXXXXXX: that wasn&#39;t always the rule<br />
XXXXXXXX: it was introduced like 500 years ago to speed up games<br />
XXXXXXXX: about a hundred years after that, ppl decided that if you moved a pawn 2 squares like that, it was ok to pretend to take the pawn by moving to the square it would be in if it had only moved 1 instead of 2<br />
XXXXXXXX: but only by taking it with a pawn<br />
retwin316: so you were persueded by him telling you this is to fix a loophole that shouldnt exist?<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol<br />
XXXXXXXX: no, no<br />
XXXXXXXX: oh wait<br />
XXXXXXXX: yes<br />
retwin316: or the atrition thing<br />
XXXXXXXX: i thought you were still talking about en passant<br />
retwin316: no, i am not too worried about chess<br />
XXXXXXXX: yes, the fact that the destiny draw substitution wording is inconsistently applied....you quite clearly have to draw destiny to have attrition, etc,<br />
retwin316: so all of V 13 is being made to help fix the damage the new change will make?<br />
XXXXXXXX: not all<br />
XXXXXXXX: but that&#39;s the purpose of V13, yes<br />
XXXXXXXX: i can&#39;t say for sure b/c i&#39;m not on the design committee<br />
XXXXXXXX: but based on what lingrell has said in the AR review committee, yes<br />
retwin316: does sonn even care if more people quit because of this? and the end result is that swccg as we know it is going to get progressively less players?<br />
XXXXXXXX: he was ok with this change from teh beginning, knowing that he would be fixing it<br />
retwin316: you remember what happened with lotr right?<br />
XXXXXXXX: again, i think that the outcry about this rule is more based on how it was revealed to the public than how it is actually being implemented<br />
retwin316: when they changed the very way it was played<br />
XXXXXXXX: and lotr was frimbazeled simultaneously by like 3 things<br />
retwin316: well, it went as you know, they make a change, people quit, they make another, people quit<br />
retwin316: but when rotation was announced<br />
XXXXXXXX: no cash + minion culture revamp + rotation<br />
retwin316: it literally destroyed it<br />
XXXXXXXX: that&#39;s true<br />
retwin316: well, all of those things effected the eventual out come<br />
retwin316: but rotation was what did it in the worst<br />
XXXXXXXX: true<br />
retwin316: you know last year they barely got enough people for a day 3<br />
XXXXXXXX: i just really don&#39;t see this being anywhere near that serious<br />
retwin316: this is gona change the game substantially<br />
XXXXXXXX: i guess we disagree, then.  we&#39;ll have to wait and see how it pans out<br />
retwin316: this changes the very way people have played for years<br />
retwin316: you dont think it changes the way people have played for years?<br />
retwin316: you havent noticed that every year, less and less people go to worlds?<br />
XXXXXXXX: yes i have<br />
retwin316: and a change like this, no matter what you, or sonn think, is gona make other people quit<br />
retwin316: or just not be interested in playing<br />
XXXXXXXX: and that&#39;s true<br />
XXXXXXXX: and it&#39;s sad<br />
XXXXXXXX: i completely agree<br />
retwin316: which is going to make less people play<br />
XXXXXXXX: that&#39;s why the long term goal of the players committee, and you&#39;re going to hate this, is to introduce new players into the game<br />
retwin316: its sad that the game the past 3 + years has consisted of the players that play because they love the game, and now that game is being changed?<br />
retwin316: cause i think that is sad<br />
XXXXXXXX: i can see that you think it&#39;s definitely a bigger deal, this change, than i do<br />
XXXXXXXX: and i admit that you may be right<br />
XXXXXXXX: but as long as they keep pushing back virtual sets that doug taylor designs, i think overall it&#39;s going to be a positive year<br />
XXXXXXXX: and if they get worlds pinned down<br />
retwin316: well, i just think it is really silly than sonn basicly decided this, and you were persuded by some quick talking by his part<br />
retwin316: you and the others, because from what it sounds like, no one initially thought this was a good idea, and you all just went along with him for whatever reason<br />
retwin316: .....<br />
XXXXXXXX: well i just wanted to give you some insight into how the decision was reached and what kind of ppl the committee consists of<br />
XXXXXXXX: not just a bunch of sonn&#39;s friends<br />
retwin316: the decision was already reached, and he basicly just smooth talked everyone into falling in line it sounds like<br />
XXXXXXXX: because he had valid reasons for making the decision<br />
XXXXXXXX: on the surface, it looks bad, i admit it<br />
retwin316: who is he even trying to help by making this ruling?<br />
retwin316: himself?<br />
XXXXXXXX: but when you look at all the repurcussions, all the rules documents, and what the design committee is doing to mitigate any actual gameplay changes, it&#39;s a good decision<br />
retwin316: has this guy ever even played the game?<br />
XXXXXXXX: he already said: the PC&#39;s long term goal is to maintain the current player base (which having 1 unified rules doc should help do) and also bring in new players<br />
retwin316: some guy who doesnt even play competitvely is in charge of changing our game!?<br />
XXXXXXXX: lol<br />
XXXXXXXX: of course he&#39;s played it<br />
retwin316: yeah, but lets be realisitc, you ever heard of him before the rules things?<br />
retwin316: no one has<br />
retwin316: which likely means if he did play, he was just playing with a couple buddys in some podunk town, and when he decides he wants to change the rules, he isnt looking at everyone as a whole, he is thinking back to what his experience as a player were, and changing them for that reason<br />
XXXXXXXX: if that&#39;s what you think<br />
retwin316: so what do you know of him as a player XXXXXXXX, since you know him so well<br />
XXXXXXXX: i don&#39;t know him that well, just as rules advocate<br />
XXXXXXXX: god, i&#39;m not defending him, i&#39;m defending the decision<br />
XXXXXXXX: i already told you he took a big exhaust over the boards when he announced it the way he did<br />
retwin316: people always have motives for doing things, and since he is the only one who thinks this was a good idea, besides a handful of other people (you yourself said you needed persueding) what are his motives<br />
XXXXXXXX: he brougth all this on himself<br />
retwin316: who does he actually want to make this simpiliar for?<br />
XXXXXXXX: NEW PLAYERS<br />
XXXXXXXX: the PC actually wants to attract new players<br />
retwin316: is that your final answer?<br />
retwin316: do you really buy that?<br />
XXXXXXXX: having 1 complete and authoritative rules document will help that happen<br />
XXXXXXXX: do you not want anyone else to ever learn this game?<br />
retwin316: yeah, i guess you are right. there was 5 new players here at the shop the other day, who all said they are gona start playing now that this rule is being changed<br />
retwin316: XXXXXXXX, it takes absolutely 5 seconds to explain a card like darklighter spin<br />
retwin316: 1 second<br />
XXXXXXXX: look we obviously disagree on this<br />
XXXXXXXX: sorry for wasting your time trying to convince you otherwise<br />
retwin316: you gona get mad if i post this to dt? i wont if you dont want me to<br />
XXXXXXXX: post it<br />
XXXXXXXX: i&#39;m pretty sure the only thing i&#39;ve said to break fight club is that i&#39;m on the AR committee<br />
retwin316: nah, i kinda feel as though you would be mad<br />
XXXXXXXX: and that many ppl disagreed initially<br />
XXXXXXXX: wait did i tell you about the locations?<br />
retwin316: i guess it is all in how people will decipher what you have said, because there is several ways of taking many things you said<br />
XXXXXXXX: no that was somebody else<br />
retwin316: the locations?<br />
XXXXXXXX: just something they&#39;re working on<br />
retwin316: im not gona post this, i am just furious as to what is going on<br />
retwin316: anyone trying to say this is easier for new players is using that excuse as a cop out<br />
retwin316: and that is the 100 % truth on that matter<br />
retwin316: new people are just not going to get into the game<br />
retwin316: 1st off it takes too much money<br />
XXXXXXXX: btw i agree that it needs playtesting<br />
XXXXXXXX: i just read a post where you said that<br />
XXXXXXXX: i absolutely agree<br />
retwin316: so why dont you chime in then<br />
XXXXXXXX: Sonn saying that it went into affect (originally) may 2nd was the stupidest thing ever<br />
retwin316: you obviously have some sort of pull, if you are part of his ar posse<br />
retwin316: you do know that none of this is to help get new players into the game, you know thats a cop out right?<br />
XXXXXXXX: i suspect it is, but if it does bring in new players because they don&#39;t have to deal with the symantics, or helps existing players advance in the game, then it&#39;s worth it<br />
XXXXXXXX: this is one of the those rulings that, when i explain it to a new(er) player, i feel like i&#39;m cheating<br />
XXXXXXXX: and i HATE that<br />
retwin316: this isnt going to help any existing players advance in the game<br />
retwin316: and new players 1st off have to buy cards, and if they have money, find the cards, and find people to play with, new people dont just start playing<br />
retwin316: and if they do, it isnt hard at all to explain to them that darklighter spin isnt a drawn destiny, and thus gets around destiny limiting<br />
XXXXXXXX: the new players thing is just one reason<br />
XXXXXXXX: the other competing reason is for consistency throughout all rules documents<br />
XXXXXXXX: btw don&#39;t forget what lingrell posted and everybody skipped over: &quot;Regardless of the new destiny rule guys, can anyone here give me a bit of a chance to look at the design side before everyone thinks that Darth/Poly Effect/etc will own the game? <br />
  <br />
 Just because something is being discussed to be included in the AR doesn&#39;t mean design will not do what it feels is necessary to balance the meta. <br />
  <br />
 So everyone needs to relax and just wait. &quot;<br />
retwin316: didnt i respond to that already<br />
XXXXXXXX: i dunno<br />
XXXXXXXX: possibly<br />
retwin316: this is something that needs to be done after this year<br />
retwin316: if at all<br />
retwin316: i mean when is this V 13 even gona come out<br />
XXXXXXXX: actually i agree with that<br />
retwin316: as if this isnt bad enough, this is going to ruin our regional<br />
XXXXXXXX: the timing of the announcement was stupid<br />
retwin316: lets see<br />
XXXXXXXX: btw it&#39;ll prolly exhaust all over our state championship too<br />
retwin316: we wont know anything for sure until may 21st, that is 2 weeks before our regional weekend<br />
retwin316: well, we have regionals, and states<br />
XXXXXXXX: ok i see you did respond to that post<br />
XXXXXXXX: of lingrell&#39;s<br />
XXXXXXXX: and once again we come back to it being Sonn&#39;s fault for rushing the announcement<br />
retwin316: ok, so if he tells us may 21st instead, we have no idea it is even coming<br />
retwin316: and we get blind sided worse<br />
retwin316: this is frimbazeling retarded, i am getting even madder now<br />
retwin316: this could have been done profesionaly<br />
XXXXXXXX: i agree<br />
retwin316: instead he just made a decision, and it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks<br />
retwin316: i am 100 % sure this needs tested, and i am 100 % sure it should wait until after this season<br />
retwin316: i think you need to just talk to members of your group without talking to him, and see how many you think feel as though it needs tested, and should wait until next year so it doesnt frimbazel people this year<br />
retwin316: because it is quite obvious he isnt going to listen to reason from anyone else, the only hope is if people from his so called group bring it up<br />
XXXXXXXX: yeah<br />
retwin316: this conversation would be perfect to post as an article<br />
retwin316: obviously some people would think i was being childish, like always, but even more would find it very insightful i think<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and now that all that is done, i would like to point out that the other party involved believes that this rules change should be tested as well. Hope this sheds a little insight for everyone. I know it did for me.
