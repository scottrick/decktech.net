He already wrote two articles, what else could he have to say? Well, until I came back to the game, I was always way too afraid to write an article back in the day because of all of the different kinds of players that would read it. I felt like a small fish in a big pond. Now that the game is in the current state that it is, I feel better about what I am doing on this site. <br />
<br />
Lately, I have posted two articles that I wrote to prepare all of the players on this site for this article. The first one talked about ways to get more players back into the game, and the other talked about how we treat one another on this site. Although, it seems that we are getting stronger, we are still going by Deciphers old rules. A few things have changed, but it is still the way it used to be. We play around with whoever, then go to tournaments (usually once a month on Sat.), then get on here to exchange experiences with decks and what not. Then we prepare for the major tournament scene i.e. States, Regionals, Origins, and finally Worlds at GenCon. Now there is nothing wrong with that, because it works and it makes people happy, but that is what it was when a major company was producing the game too. We have continued to play the game, and the Players Committee has taken over the duties that Decipher used to provide to the Squadron leaders, yet nothing has really changed. <br />
<br />
Even though the game seems to be getting strong again, it is still not a major contender among card games. Decipher has completely abandoned this game only supplying the PC with left over product and uncut sheets. In time, when Decipher has truly forgotten about their old game, they will delete everyones Star Wars Ranking that is just taking up space on their website. This may not be for years, but in the end, it is going to happen. So what are we going to do? Have you really thought about it? For all of you out there who never quit or just came back, how long are you really wanting to play? <br />
<br />
We have a great opportunity here, think about it. We have a game that we all love, and continue to play. Each week another new or old player comes back to the game, making the player base larger and more competitive. More people are returning to Decktech, more are posting decks, and we have even seen an increase in Articles. I mean, for months now, there were never more than 3. Now we are back at 10, yes, yes I know that three of them are mine, but hey I am working here. <br />
<br />
This 3rd article is going to be the best one that any of you have read in a long time. I believe that I have a truly great idea for this game, a way to get more people involved and give everyone another reason to play competitively. This idea would re-format the way we play the game each month, as well as provide a solid future for the game that will keep it from EVER dying.<br />
<br />
Are you ready for this, here it comes<br />

The Unofficial Star Wars CCG League<br />
<br />
 <br />
Yes, a League is the answer to all of our questions and problems that have been running around in our heads since Dec 2001. Think about it. There is no other card game that is in a League format, they all are pretty much the same. There are Worldwide tournaments, ranking, prizes, championships, cons, and all that. Non of them have a different feel about them other than, the game itself is different. Star Wars CCG currently is the only game (beside YJCCG and JKCCG) that runs on auto pilot. The game doesnt have a national company to promote it or to produce new cards. Even the PC is made up of just players who dont want to see the game die off. The players today are who keep the game going, and they have done a good job with what they have had to work with, but there is no way it can last forever like this. A change must happen before the game does die off, and a League is really and truly the answer. <br />
<br />
I have been thinking about this for years, even back before I quit back in 2001, because it was SO hard to get people together to play if it wasnt at a tournament. Sure, I could always get a friend to play now and again. But I want there to be so many players that, ANYTIME I feel like playing a game, there is someone I can call. Well, what if you could do more than just play game after game. <br />
<br />
A League would allow us to do a lot of what we do on Decktech, but in person, with our local players. Because what I have always found with this game and all card games is that as we play, we create factions of the players that we play. The few good players will only hang out with each other, build decks and then kill everyone at a tournament, leaving the other players who are also friends in the dark. The good players could be helping the lower end players, but that was never on their minds. Now, that was then, today is a whole new time for this game. There is completely no reason that a local group cant get together to support each other with ideas, gameplay, and just plain fun. <br />
<br />
Think about how the PC was formed. It took the players who still wanted to keep playing the game to get together, talk about what could be done and what had to be done. The right people were called, and now they have been going strong for the past 3 years. Just like that, but it took one guys idea to put it into place, just like this.  <br />
<br />
We decide when this game is dead, it could have been in 2002, but its still here. 2003, nope still here, 2004, not yet, keep it coming, now 2005. When is it going to end? No telling but ask yourself this, if you could, would you play the rest of your life. If the answer is yes, then we have to work together to put this in place,read on.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Listed below are just a few ideas about what the League can do for us through the next years of play.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1)       The League will be supported globally through a website that can be created by the players, just like the PC. It will be in full support of the Players Committee, and of course paying any dues that Decipher requires, advertising on the site should be enough. The site would have every player that is currently playing, and if the players want it, there will be contact info for each player providing a resource for others to find players in their area that currently play. This site can have a profile of every player, that, unlike, Decktech, will be more personal about the player, so we can get to know more about them besides just what they type in the small area at the top of the screen. It will keep track of every tournament that player places in the top 3 and accounting for all awards like winning a Regional, designing a card. This resource can keep a running tally of a persons Win /Loss record for all sanctioned tournaments, much like a sports team. <br />
<br />
2)       Each major city will be elected as a League location. It will be given a name to be adopted by the local player base that supports that city. I.E. Nashville would be the elected city in TN to start with, and the player base here would go by a planet name, like Decipher did or we can have something made up or just a squadron # like Red Squadron 37. We can have a national vote about which way we like best, in the end they will all be in connected names.<br />
<br />
3)       The League website will start over EVERYONEs ranking. This will be your League ranking and in time your main ranking. For now, your Decipher ranking will stay there, but how long do you think they are going to just keep peoples names holding on their server, in time Decipher will drop the ones that dont currently play one of their newer games. So, by us having created our own ranking system, we can separate the knowledge of who is truly great, and who used to be great back in the day, and just signed up to keep their old ranking from 3 years ago. We can keep it the same way, starting everyone at 1500. Rating points will come from tournaments, that will not change, but we will also have random events in each area every month that will give opportunity for more rating points, all rating point events will have to be posted to the site in advance (time limit to be determined) and meet the set qualifications, so we are not just handing out rating points to just everyone.<br />
<br />
4)       Each month will give opportunity for different things to happen with the game. Once a week, there will be League education night. This is a time that will be reserved for new players or players who want to get help with their decks and playing ability. This night can have more than just games being played. We can have an education lesson about the big things to know in every game you play. Prizes can be given to those who bring a new player to this night, can be at a restaurant or a relaxing play where food can be ordered. This will mainly be a night to get to know the players in your area making the whole process of playing a more personal experience.  <br />
<br />
5)       Bring back scenario tournaments and special events. A League would provide the ability for any local area to have a different type tournament once a month. It can be posted ahead of time with what the event will be. For the newer players, we can bring back the Mentor / Apprentice tournament, where an old player mentors a new player to the game. The new player will play in a tournament made up completely of other new players, that way there are no worries from the new players getting killed. The winning team will awarded prizes, the crown for that month on the site, maybe even T-shirts. We can also be open to just about anything else you want, from playing real classic, to having a scenario like the Cloud city one they had where you had to do something in the game to earn the full 2 win points, like playing so many games of Sabecc or freezing someone. We can also have tournaments that will be only up to a specific set like Dagobah. That way the older guys can play their old kick-butt decks that used to rock the tournament scene, and newer players can understand how the game used to be played, helping them to become better players. <br />
<br />
6)       Monthly CASH tournaments, I for one would love for there to be more games for money. People put money on SOOOOOOO many things, sports, poker, why not Star Wars. This will be only for those who want to play. They can be completely independent or a reported event. These events will have specific rules and of course will have an entry fee to be giving to the winner. We can make the entry fee based on that players current ranking from the League website. The higher the ranking, the higher the fee, meaning that the newer players will not be out as much as the older ones and it will make the games between the best players mean more. In order to play in one of these tournaments, you would have had to be registered on the website and have picture ID at time of tournament so that older players couldnt play under newer players name so their fee would be smaller. <br />
<br />
7)       Each League City can compete with one another for the top City or area in the game. This can be done with combining all of the rating points of that area or it can be determined by how many players are logged into the current base or even by how many activates that city is having, making them a superior place to play Star Wars CCG. Each month there will be a winner, and the city that has the most months will receive a trophy for that year at the Worlds Tournament. <br />
<br />
8)       Nothing has to change with the major tournament scene and what the PC does for the game. We still need the PC to continue to grow and change the game. With more V-Cards, rule updates, and making sure that all major tournaments go through smoothly. They are also the connection to Decipher for continuing to get prize support for tournaments. The League can get set up to do this as well. Decipher is always open to making more money on their abandoned game. <br />
<br />
9)       We can have TRUE team tournaments by having tournaments and events where each City would compete against one another at major events, so it changes from the abilities of just a few players, to the ability of many players playing as a group, and because it would be against other Cities, it would keep the top 4 players from teaming up just to win over the lower players. I already have a basic idea for T-shirts that each city can make. Each city can have a different color. No two cities will have the same color. All letters can be in white, listing what the city is and on the back there can be a list of all of the current players within that city for that year. As the city grows each year, the shirts will be different changing and growing as the base changes in that area.  <br />
<br />
10)   Hold events on weeknights like other leagues of play. Most bowling leagues meet and play during the weekdays because it gives them something to do on the nights after work that does not involve the television. There is NO reason this cant work the same way. Only in place of a bowling ball and weird shoes, we will have backpacks and card binders. Each area can decide what day works best for them, and there will never be a perfect day for everyone. The key is having so many different opportunities for players, that if they miss one week, they can still get their fill next week without having to wait a whole month.  <br />
<br />
11)   We will charge dues to help support the League and pay for it to stay in existence. EVERY SPORT you play as an adult, you have to pay in order to play it. There is no reason for Star Wars being any different. The money is needed to support what the sport is doing. Star Wars should be no different, since we make up the cards and have the tournaments, we should pay for stuff. If there was a system set up like this, there is no telling what we could afford to do with the game. The site can have advertising, and a monthly / yearly fee to use, much like Decktech does for its premium members. Only you will be able to do SO much more with your page. The dues can afford a staff that can be in charge up always updated the site and the rankings, that way we dont have to wait 2 months to see our new rankings.  <br />
<br />
12)   No replacing! This site and idea will NOT replace Decktech or the Players Committee. It will only be a third way to complete the game and give a more enjoyable experience. The League site will NOT have any deck posting or tournament reports. That is Decktechs baby. The V  Cards will still only be offered on the PC site, unless the PC wants to combine or transfer information to this site. The key in the League is to help the game, not hurt the current resources that have been in place longer. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Now, I have only cracked the surface on this idea. I still have even MORE ideas for where the game can go besides the 12 I listed here. This can TRULY be the future of how we play this game. It is the answer to how we can keep this game going FOREVER. With a thing like this in place, there is no reason other gamers wouldnt want to play. We will never have to worry about the game ever truly dying or there not being anyone to play. A League would be the creation of how this game can continue its existence, while other games simply fade away. <br />
<br />
It will be important to take a true count of how many active players we have across the U.S. That way, we can get an idea of which areas would be the best places to start as League Cities. I can already vouch for Nashville as one. It would be nice by Worlds to have set up the website, and gotten at least 4 Cities set up.     <br />
<br />
Before the end of this article, it is important that you know that this idea cannot happen unless we have support by all of the players. This is only an idea now, without support that is all it will ever be. The key will lie in what you as a player really want for this game. If you really do want to play for years to come, then this next step must be made. I am not in authority to simply put something this big into place. If this is what you want then let me as well as others know. We have to get the PC on board as well, this needs to get on all the message boards, and we need to know your concerns for the game. This is very much something that can be done, but all it takes it votes. So, SPREAD THE WORD!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
If you agree with this idea and want to take steps to get it started, please d-mail me so we can start the process. The first thing is going to be running it by the Players Committee and working out any legal issues something like this might have. Nothing about this is that different from what the PC is already doing for the game. It is just on a MUCH larger scale. It also doesnt have to start this year. We can just get the ball rolling, and then it can take affect after Worlds. I for one would like to see it started before that, but I know things take time. <br />
<br />
I have said a lot in this article, and I am sure many of you will have mix feelings about this idea. That is fine, any new idea is going to be a shock at first, but you must think about what other options we have. All of the things I have said can be done because of the Internet. The net is the main reason that any of this is possible, so why not take advantage of this great opportunity we have to create something special and unique for the game we love.<br />
