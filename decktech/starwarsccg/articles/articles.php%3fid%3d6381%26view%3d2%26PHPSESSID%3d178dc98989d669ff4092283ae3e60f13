Utah is a very interesting place for a gamer and since players from AZ, Vegas - NV, Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana could be coming to States here, I wanted to give them a look as well as players here in Utah a look at why your state is so different than any other.  <br />
<br />
This is Part 1 Looking at the State of Utah and Gaming.  Part 2 will come out shortly looking at the players that still play Star Wars and what to expect at States.<br />
<br />
1.  Location, Location, Location<br />
2.  Cities, distances and stores<br />
	A.  Logan  Northern Utah<br />
	B.  Salt Lake City/Ogden  Middle Northern Utah<br />
	C.  Provo/Orem  Middle Utah<br />
	D.  Saint George - Southern Utah<br />
3.  Religion and People<br />
4.  College Towns<br />
5.  Havent played in two years and why are you on a Mission!<br />

1:  While most states gamers can be found in every card or comic book shop, that is not the case in Utah.  Utah has one of the oddest group of gamers I have ever seen.  While I come from a state, TN, where you played about every game at the store you hung out at and you traveled to the other stores that held events for the games you liked.  That is not the case in Utah.  Usually each store has one or two games that it specializes in and the rest of the games are not played in that store and sometimes not even around the rest of the state.  <br />
<br />
Take for instance Dragons Keep in Provo, UT.  DK is the only place in Utah that has the WWE Raw Deal game.  No other store carries this game and no other store runs events.  Even though there are only 6-8 of us, we are a strong bunch that plays.  The only other game the DK really carries is the new Street Fighter 2 game.  Besides that, VS is dead there, Magic, some people come in and leave quickly after seeing no one else playing.  <br />
<br />
While Magic is big at other stores, those players, most of the time, will not travel to other stores to play.<br />
<br />
When LOTR was big, only one other store nearby carried the game besides DK.  I ran events at DK and we would get 3 - 4 guys to come.  I would travel to the other store when they ran events and they would have around 6-8 players.  Now none of the other players from DK would go to this store besides me and none of those players would go to DK.  But if we combined the two groups of players, we would have almost ten people each week at two different events.  This happened until each store lost all of its players and there is only a small group that now plays in North SLC.<br />
<br />
Store loyalty, as well as traveling distance, are big factors here in Utah.  Because the state as well as the towns being so spread out, it really effects what people play by where they live.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2:  Utah is unlike any other state because of how far apart cities are.  Utah basically has one Interstate that runs from Southern Utah all the way out of the state in Northern Utah.  So this makes it so all the bigger towns are off of this freeway.  Southern Utah is about 4-5 hours away from middle Utah towns like Provo/Orem area which are an hour away from SLC which is another 1-2 hours away from Northern Utah towns.  There are a bunch of smaller towns to the East and West of the state but these are very small towns that usually are lucky to have a Wal-Mart.  Usually states have towns that are close together and it isnt hard to go to different events in different towns.  I grew up playing Star Wars and many other games in the Middle TN area.  It was 20 minutes to Nashville, and getting to big cities in other states usually took less than 4 hours.  Utah players are not so lucky.  <br />
<br />
It takes longer for SLC players to drive to other states and here are the hours it usually takes:  <br />
Vegas:  5 hours<br />
Denver:  8 hours<br />
Phoenix:  10 hours<br />
Bigger cities in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana:  5 + hours<br />
<br />
A:  Logan Utah and the more northern cities in Utah have a decent amount of gamers.  The area would be great for gaming but the problem is that most of the Northern Utah cities are over an hour away from SLC and over 2 hours from the Provo/Orem area.  My friend recently bought a motorcycle from Logan, UT on eBay.  He needed my truck so one Saturday we drove there, taking 2 and a half ours with no traffic on a Saturday.  While there, I looked in the phone book for gaming stores.  I found two.  The first one was out of business and the second was a mess.  We walked in and from somewhere in the back around a table of D&D players someone asked if we needed help, I said no and looked around.  I still have no idea which of the ten or so guys around this small table it was that said this.  All of them looked as if they hadnt seen a shower in about a year.  The store looked like crap, no sealed product, a couple of Magic rares, random Heroclix everywhere, and I wondered how this place stayed in business.  Now if this is what card players have to look forward to in Logan, Im really sorry and I hope that there is a better place to play that this mud hole I walked into.  The best part was my friend found $5 on the ground outside the store and we got some Sonic slushes with it.  <br />
<br />
B.  The Salt Lake City (SLC)/Ogden area actually has some decent stores but this is where store snobbyness comes into play.  There is at least one really good store in Odgen called Heros and Hobs.  This store has a good following and it appears that Magic is the biggest pull there while VS has some potential.  Salt Lake Citys tournament scene is dominated by one store, TheBlackRose.  These guys run almost every major event for Upper Deck and Wizards of the Coast in Utah.  You cant pull any events away from these guys.  The problem is that they do a good job but a lot of people have had trouble with the owners and therefore will not go to events.  To give you an idea of how many people go to big events, Magic states was this past weekend and there were 48 people there.  Most VS PCQs (again, only place that runs them in the state or has normal events for VS) get around 8 people.  It is really sad and therefore the store usually gets Idaho and Las Vegas guys coming to win these events.  They do it with no threats as there is only one really good VS player in the state of UT and he is usually at the bottom of every 10K and big event he is in.  <br />
<br />
Star Wars is non-existent in this area even though it is where it should have all the attention.  After going to every comic and gaming store in SLC  there was not one store that carried the Decipher Star Wars game.  I finally found one Baseball card shop that had Star Wars cards at a highly marked up price (think Jabbas Palace for $3.00 a pack).  He did have some Theed and Coruscant packs but unfortunately I heard the man that ran it past away last year and that his family was trying to keep it going on the weekends.  I havent heard if it is still open or not though or they carry any more SW cards.<br />
<br />
Park City/Heber area doesnt really fit into any of these categories but they do have a gaming store in Park City and there was one in Heber that only lasted a couple of months.  The Park City store is hard to find as I have passed it once and could not find it the next time I looked for it.  Because of this I dont know how the gaming is there but I know when I passed the Heber store when it was still open at 11:30 on a Friday night there was around 11 players inside playing some game.<br />
<br />
C.  The Provo/Orem area is unique.  These two towns were built around Brigham Young University, BYU, with Orem being a commuter city to BYU for newly married students with no center part of town while Provo was the small city that single students and those that wanted to live close to campus lived in.  Orem then became home of Utah Valley State College and now UVSC is a bigger school than BYU.  There are around 70,000 students between the two schools that are leaving each Spring/Summer and coming back for the Fall/Winter.  This means that summers are usually dead around here and overcrowded during the school year.  Because of the many changes, many gamers come and go.<br />
<br />
There are 5 stores in these two towns with one store 15 miles to the South of Provo.  There isnt a store between Orem and Southern SLC, a good 30 miles of no card stores.  Out of the 5 stores in the local area, two are in malls and mainly deal in Magic and Warhammer.  Only one of the stores, Dragons Keep, carries comics.  One of the stores -mainly does Yu-Gi-Oh while the other store does something, I cant figure it out yet.  The store 15 miles South of Provo mainly does Hero-Clix and Game of Thrones, about the only place in Utah that does Game of Thrones.  Dragons Keep is where we are holding Star Wars States and also the place it was held last year.  Sure the store used to be a dump but they have moved to a nice new location and there is a rather large space for gaming that is actually clean and clear.  The one store that carries Star Wars in the Provo/Orem area only has Jabbas and Cloud City and both are at full price from when they first came out.<br />
<br />
D:  Saint George and Southern Utah are really in the middle of no-where.  It is around 4-5 hours to get to the Provo area while around 1-2 hours to get to Vegas.  There hasnt been a comic shop or gaming shop in Saint George in probably 3-4 years.  There used to be one and Im surprised there isnt right now as this is a highly growing area with a lot of people moving in.  It is also a college town and in my opinion really needs a card/comic store (if you are interested and have some money to invest, email me).  The only gaming store in all of Southern Utah is in Cedar City and that is about an hour away from SG.  Last time I was at this store, they looked like they were barely making it even though they had just moved into a newer location.  They mainly relied on computer gaming to make it and gaming was just a side thing.  This area has two colleges that are within an hour of each other and there is only one dinky store, something needs to be done.  There is a big bunch of Star Wars players in the Saint George area that are all younger guys that still play the game.  Utah states has been held in Saint George before I took over because Jaron Janson was running events there.  He left on a LDS mission (more on that later) and therefore the game really died down there.  Now that he is back, these players should be ready to play again.  Like I have mentioned many times, this is a great place to live as the weather is nice, there is a lot of growth, there are some really good Mexican food restraints there and they dont have a card store.  This is one of the hottest markets in Utah.    <br />
<br />
3:  Religion and People:  Now the biggest misconception about Utah is that it is all Mormons (nickname of the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints or LDS for short).  While most of the smaller towns are mainly LDS, the Salt Lake Valley is no longer the majority; in fact, it is only around 30% Mormon.  This still might sound like a high percentage but having lived in the South, having 30% Baptist in my high school was not unheard of or if you live in the New England area, I would believe that 30% Catholic would be believable.  While a lot of people have a lot of different opinions about Mormons and their faith, members of the LDS faith can also be gamers.  Mormons are known for being big board game fans.  A lot of this is due to LDS families being really close as well as having big families so they need some form of entertainment.  <br />
<br />
But this is also one of the main reasons that Comic shops and gaming shops have problems making it in Utah and that is why there are so few comic shops.  When Comics were going through their explosion in the mid 90s, one of the big crazes was the Bad Girl faze.  This is where comics like Lady Death and Vamperilla showed girls in rather small swimsuits and rather huge breasts doing whatever they would do in their comics.  This had a lasting effect on the comic book market in Utah.  LDS families are usually highly conservative so for little Johnny to bring home a Lady Death comic, he might as well of brought home a Playboy magazine.  This led many parents to boycott comics and therefore their children didnt grow up loving comics.  This same feeling persists with gaming as well.  <br />
<br />
When I first got into Magic, right after Revised, The Dark and Fallen Empires had come out, my parents found out about the game.  They didnt know I played and told me that I was not allowed to play because they felt it was to much like Dungeons and Dragons (Which of course had to be evil because there was an ABC special on it in the 80s and my cousin who played tried to commit suicide and threatened to kill his sister.  Just an update on this, he grew up and became a bomb disposal guy for the military right after Desert Storm, arent you glad to know your country is in good hands).  I started playing with my friends cards till I got my own and I had to hide the game from them.  Now let me get this right for everyone out there.  I wasnt hiding Playboys, Drugs or anything of that nature, I was hiding Magic cards.  That image of the Demonic Tutor was just too much for my Mom when she found them one day and made me sell all of my cards.  Can you imagine having 25 Duel Lands and having to sell them off?   I still hold a grudge against my parents to this day for that.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, this shows what a typical Mormon parent thinks about EVIL card games like Magic.  So card games are looked at similar to D&D which must be EVIL because it deals with Dragons and Demons.  So that is why gaming has a hard time in the LDS culture.  (Of course now my Mom is one of the biggest Harry Potter fans around and if it doesnt deal with the same things as Magic I dont know what does.) <br />
<br />
Luckily Star Wars was a whole different story and my parents as well as many other kids that couldnt play EVIL games like Magic could play Star Wars.  You would be surprised at how many SW players I have talked to at BYU that have said that they still thought Magic was evil and that Star Wars was just fine.  <br />
<br />
So while Board Games and good things like Star Wars is okay, Comics are bad for their exaggeration of Wonder Womans Bust and all card games must be bad because they are like D&D.  <br />
<br />
But of course this does not hold true to everyone in Utah and the fact of the matter is that the LDS church does not tell you to not play these games, it is just over protective parents that say not to play them.  <br />
<br />
4: Utah is known as a place full of college towns.  Dont get me wrong, this isnt your drink it up and party type towns, this is your stone cold sober college towns.  Where most colleges you find co-eds drinking and partying, you will find most co-eds at BYU not able to go into the other sexs dorm room, past the living room area.  You will normally find a group of BYU students huddled together playing a game of Settlers Of Catan on a cool Fall night instead of drinking it up.  There are College thrown dances where Chaperones stop people from dancing to close and the music is edited for content.  (These schools are not for everyone and sometimes I am amazed that I made it through BYU with my own sanity.)  This isnt just something that happens at BYU, this happens at almost all the colleges in Utah, though the University of Utah is by far the most party happy school in Utah.  There is a college in Logan (Utah State), Salt Lake City (U of U), Orem (UVSC), Provo (BYU), Saint George (Dixie) and Ephraim (Snow).  So just about every town has a college in it so you have choices of places to go to school but you have to keep in mind that if you are a gamer, your best bet is in the SLC/Provo/Orem area.<br />
<br />
5:  This has to be one of the most interesting things about LDS culture.  It is normal for 19 year old guys to go on a two year church service mission.  You can be sent anywhere around the world to teach religion.  This is very common in this LDS faith.  It is not something you have to do, but it is something that a high percentage of them decide to do.  <br />
<br />
Living near BYU, I get the chance to meet a lot of guys that have just got home from serving for two years.  Most of them are out of touch with whats going on in the world as they have been focusing on just serving their missions.  For a gamer, this is really interesting.  <br />
<br />
When I first came to BYU as a Freshman at the age of 18, I was at the top of my game in Star Wars and Star Trek.  Needless to say, I never lost a game in Utah during this time.  This was right after Special Edition had come out and Operatives were still going strong.  I went to my first tournament here in Utah and most of the guys were running Dagobah training decks without the objective.   Why is this you ask, its because they just got back from a two year mission and they didnt have any of the newer cards.  They didnt know there was a new training objective, they didnt know what operatives were and they got killed.  I had won the four round tournament by round three and started playing in the Star Trek event that was going on that day.  Thats how easy the playing field was.  I later found a guy that was playing in my dorm, him and his brother, they played with cards just from Premiere, trying to get guns on guys.  Such as getting Hans Heavy Blaster on Han.  By this time, Cloud City Enhanced was out and playing Chewie with gun and all the EPPS just blew him away, he didnt like them since they werent what he started playing the game with so he wouldnt change.<br />
  <br />
This was common thinking and still is here in Utah.  I receive about an email every two weeks from a former player that says something to this effect:  I understand your running Star Wars states.  Thats great, what is the player base like around here.  I got back from a mission and learned that the game was dead, Stupid Decipher.  I want to get together for a game and try out my old decks.   This will either lead to me saying go look at the virtual cards, explaining this, and the SWCCGPC.com as well as Decktech.net or me playing them.  Usually if we play, they dont understand the Defensive Shields or the Virtual cards which either frustrates them so they dont want to play or they get giddy and look through the V cards like a school girl at her first dance lesson.  <br />
<br />
So for States, look for a lot of players that are just returning to the game that have no idea what the game is about past DS 2.  That should make for some fun old school decks.<br />
<br />
The next post is going to look at the game here in Utah, what players still play and what to expect.<br />
