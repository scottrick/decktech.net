<br />
Decks based on the Massassi Base Operations (MBO) objective seem to be a common topic in the community lately, here in the form of deck postings/reviews and on the various discussion boards.  The opinions of those running MBO are strong and often divided, and the inquiries from those who are contemplating playing this objective are deserving.  After all, this is a very difficult deck to build and play effectively.  I like to think it teeters on the brink of excellence.  What I mean by that is MBO has the power to be a monster, but doesnt become a monster easily (like Walkers, for example, which is a powerful decktype simply by operation of the objective and the cards that start with it).  This two-part article will analyze this objective by discussing its purpose, examining what is required to make it work, and finally detailing the pros and cons of the various theories of how to play and construct it.  While I will refer to my own MBO deck throughout the article, I do this only for reference and not to extol its virtues or boast about my own strategy.  I recognize there are other opinions, and I will do my best to limit reference to my deck to demonstrate through experience why certain things work and others dont.<br />
<br />
YOUR POINT IS?<br />
Whats the purpose of this objective?  I think many people make the mistake of using this objective for the wrong reason, failing to look past the cheap deployment of Great Shot, Kid! and the force drain bonuses at systems.  If you are thinking about using this objective as a platform for making a butt-kicking, beat-down space deck, just stop right there.  MBO is NOT a good launching pad (pardon the pun) for a deck designed to rule the skies.  Youre far, far better off making a space deck using WYS or HB.  MBO is kind of an oddity because while technically space-based, the true power of the deck is dealing 14 damage within three turns and retrieving most of the force youve lost.  I cant stress enough that having all those ships at systems is really only a secondary benefit, not the goal.  As you will see, keeping this purpose in mind makes a big difference in choosing which ships to include.<br />
<br />
STAY ON TARGET<br />
If youve ever built an MBO deck, the first time you sat down to put it together you probably went straight to your binders starships section.  Looking all bright-eyed like a kid on Christmas morning, you pulled capital ships, starfighters, and their matching pilots with reckless abandon.  Then you pulled starship weapons and destiny-adders.  Bad idea.<br />
<br />
Start with the cards that you will need to blow up the Death Star, because without that the deck is entirely worthless.  MBO must do everything in its power to blow that thing away, and ALL ELSE IS SECONDARY.  This necessarily means you must include the right cards and, in certain cases, multiples thereof in order to GUARANTEE you will have what you need when you need it to make the Attack Run.  Even assuming you get all the cards you need, you must also guarantee that your opponent cannot easily thwart you in this respect.  Here is the first point of disagreement among players Ive talked to: ignore how many card slots youre taking up, and dont cut back simply because it seems like having so many cards devoted to this one task is excessive.  So, lets start by looking at the cards you absolutely must have for each stage of the process.  I am going to concentrate on a strategy that aims to blow away the D* on turn 3, because anything later than that risks you losing too much force before you can start retrieving.<br />
<br />
START YOUR ENGINES<br />
What three effects should you start with?  I think this is a fairly simply decision.  Great Shot, Kid! Is a must because thats the main strength of the deck.  Squadron Assignments is required to get Luke and AiR5 to the D* together by the 3rd turn (or to get your spy pilot and matching ship for D* deployment if you go that route).  Finally, Strike Planning is required to pull the two generals youll use to flip and pull other required cards.<br />
<br />
HELL FLIP YA.  HELL FLIP YA FOR REAL.<br />
The first step in actually running the deck is flipping your objective, because you cant deploy your D* otherwise.  To do that, and quickly, you must be able to deploy to and control three sites by your second turn.  The easiest way to do this is by pulling two generals with Strike Planning, which avoids the necessity of drawing characters for this purpose.  Some suggest using Mon Mothma, but remember she deploys for 5.  On your second turn you will usually not activate more than 7-8 force, so shes not a really good option (even if she can pull Rebel Techs).  General Rieekan (v) is probably the best option because he deploys only for 2 and has fantastic pulling abilities.  He can pull a generic site and virtual Romas Lock Navander, who pulls systems.  While there is room for debate on the second general, I use Madine because, as you will see below, instead of relying on Fly Casual to deploy to the D* I use spy pilots.  There are two spy pilots who are also scouts, and they can be pulled with Madine (who deploys for 3).  As for controlling the 3rd site, you can really use any character that deploys cheaply.  I personally like to use a Rebel Tech because (1) you can sack him (to the used pile) to Pull Advance Preparation (v), a required card, and (2) you then wont have to have saved an extra force to move him when you consolidate your people after the flip.  I run 5 copies of the Tech so that I can get one into my hand early and so that I can deploy a few of them turn 3 to add to my Attack Run total.<br />
<br />
The only really big obstacle to flipping (other than a statistically improbable bad draw) is a savvy opponent who knows how to slow down MBO.  What a player like that will normally do is deploy characters to your docking bay early.  Now, if you deploy any Yavin sites with your objectives text, the opponent will just deploy more characters to that site on his turn and youll never accumulate 3 unoccupied sites to control.  So, the rule is DO NOT DEPLOY any sites until the very turn you flip (usually turn 2).  Heres how this works: if the docking bay is occupied, you need to draw any one Yavin site into your hand.  I run 4 sites for this purpose, the War Room, Briefing Room, Massassi HQ, and Jungle.  With 4 sites and 3 Control/Tunnel Visions, I can usually get one into my hand by turn 2.  On your turn, drop the site form your hand, deploy another using the objective, and deploy Rieekan to one of them. Now use Rieekans text to pull a generic site that has Hoth in the game text.  I use the generic Jungle b/c the dark side, should it deploy or move there, force drains at -1.  Now you have 3 unoccupied sites, guaranteed!  Deploy Madine to the second (remembering to use his text to pull a scout/spy/pilot) and deploy a Tech (or another character) to the 3rd.  Flip.  Pull out your D* with the flipside text of MBO, send your Tech to the used pile for AP, and then move Madine and Rieekan together, usually at the HQ for the +2 to Attack Run (or, depending on your draw, to the Briefing Room for +1).  And you can do all this for only 8 force (3 Madine + 2 Rieekan + 2 Rebel Tech + 1 movement).  If you are activating less than 8, make sure you saved enough from your first turn.<br />
<br />
I have seen really only one significant deviation from this flipping plan, and thats Frank Amadors MBO deck.  He starts with virtual Nightfall instead of Great Shot, Kid! And uses it for free deployment of one of the scouts that Madine pulls.  This allows him to typically flip on the first turn.  While this sometimes allows flipping to occur before the dark side gets a chance to deploy to Yavin, I personally am not a big fan of this very creative approach.  While flipping first turn is nice, he wont likely blow up the D* until turn 3 anyway (like I do) because hell still need to get all the other required cards into his hand.  Plus, hes denied himself the opportunity to pull other Yavin sites with the objective and hes burned one scout/spy/pilot that could otherwise be used to get Luke to the D*.  Finally, and most importantly, if he somehow loses Great Shot, Kid! The game is over.<br />
<br />
YOU CANT ALWAYS GET WHAT YOU WANT...BUT YOULL GET WHAT YOU NEED<br />
The next step after flipping is to make sure you have the cards you need for the Attack Run.  Heres a list:<br />
<br />
Death Star<br />
Luke (v)<br />
Artoo in Red 5<br />
Advance Preparation (v)<br />
Fly Casual OR spy pilot<br />
Spy pilots matching ship (if not using Fly Casual)<br />
Tantive IV or Tyderium (if not using one of the above methods)<br />
<br />
The D* is pullable with the objective, so thats easy.  As for Luke, you really have to use him as opposed to another pilot else you stand a really good chance of not drawing high enough on the Attack Run (virtual Luke adds 7).  As such, I rely on a combination of 3x each of Luke and AiR5, plus Squadron Assignments (which I start with HFTMF).  I have a good chance pulling one or both of them into my hand, and if I only get one having 3 copies of each means I also have a good chance of having the second half of the pair in my reserve deck.  Any less and you risk not drawing either one into your hand or not having the second card in your reserve deck when you go to use Squassin.  Plus, having 3 destiny-7 cards cant hurt.  Also, I like the ability in battle to forfeit Luke for 7 and simply drop another one my next turn for free.  In the worst case scenario where I dont draw either one, I run 2x All Wings combo to fish for AiR5 (to use with Squassin).<br />
<br />
Next you need a means of deploying Luke directly to the D*.  If you deploy him elsewhere and just move him over, you have to wait a turn because the Attack Run is a regular move.  And that would just leave Luke open to a beatdown.  So, Fly Casual is one approach.  Its a destiny 6 and allows direct deployment (with a -1 to deploy cost).  However, you have no way of pulling it and it is a huge target for Sense.  Theres even a bullet for it, and Ive actually seen people with it in their decks recently.  So, my preferred method is to use a spy pilot, who can deploy without presence or force icons.  You cant cancel a spy pilot, and I can pull such a pilot with Madine (Lt. Blount or Col. Cracken).  I also now have some extra power and forfeit in case I get battled at the D* system after it has been blown away, allowing Luke to stick around.  If the spy pilot method fails, you can always use Tyderium or Tantive IV if you were lucky to have drawn one.  I dont use Tyderium in my deck because after blowing away the D* you cant pull unpiloted ships from the reserve deck with Great Shot, Kid! (it never reaches your hand, so you cant simultaneously deploy with the pilot from your hand).  The Tantive, however, works nicely because you can use it with GSK later in the game.  I personally run a combination of all three of these methods...I try for the spy pilot first, but I also have a Tantive and one Fly Casual.  Then there is your emergency plan, which is really only for emergencies because it will cost a lot of force and requires a system parsec 3 or less.  You can deploy a capital ship with starfighter capacity (usually a calamari cruiser), deploy Luke and AiR5 directly to it, move the capital ship to the D*, and then disembark Luke/AiR5 for the Attack Run.  But that aint easy, so dont rely on it.<br />
<br />
Next, you need Advance Preparation to get the Trench, Attack Run, and the required proton torpedoes (I use the Enhanced Proton Torpedoes because they deploy for free).  A Tech will pull AP, but theres always the chance you will have activated your AP into the force pile.  I run two of them to obviate this dilemma.  Plus, having an extra doesnt hurt because after the objective is flipped you can use AP to retrieve any one card (your choice).<br />
<br />
THE BEST OFFENSE IS A GOOD DEFENSE<br />
In your nearly-complete quest to blow away the D* you have to play some good solid D.  Your opponent will not let you deploy to the D* and make the Attack Run that turn without a fight.  The two most common weapons for this are Imperial Barrier and Set For Stun.  Inconsequential Barriers is the best choice here, as it just so happens to cancel both of these cards.  I run 3 of this interrupt so I will have a very good chance of having one in my hand.  In trials, I failed to get one into my hand less than 25% of the time.  And, its a destiny-4 card that is a fairly useful used interrupt.  The only card I have seen that really screws up MBOs plans in this respect, and granted Ive only seen one player use it, is Id Just As Soon Kiss A Wookie.  Its pretty brutal...I deploy my spy pilot and ship and then Luke and AiR5 get bounced backed to my hand.  Not only do I have to wait another turn, but the spy is vulnerable to a beatdown.  This is doubly bad, because then next turn I wont have presence at the D* and I cant deploy Luke there.  [props to Jeff DeSando for this idea] On the plus side, this requires your opponent to save 3 force and the card doesnt see a lot of play nowadays.<br />
