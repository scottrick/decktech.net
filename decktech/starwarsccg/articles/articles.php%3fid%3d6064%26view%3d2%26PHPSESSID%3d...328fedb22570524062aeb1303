COSCON- Days Inn, Butler, PA<br />
<br />
Pre Tournament Stuff:<br />
<br />
I have not played a game of SWCCG since last July.  Well, that&#39;s not true- I played it sometime in August or September.  The last tournament was September, and the fall and winter was sparse with a lot of the regulars away at college.  I was interested in the new game WARS and I have been playing a good bit of that but I still kept up to date with happenings in SWCCG.  V 8 was coming out soon and it sounded like a very strong set in that it would redefine the meta.  There was talk that we&#39;d get a Christmas break tournament going but that never happened.    <br />
<br />
I let our TD know about COSCON, this weekend con in nearby Butler that was going to have some WARS events.  Why not try to see if we can get some SWCCGers to come out for the weekend?  He scheduled an event, and 6 people came out.  We had a prize package consisting of tournament foils, uncut sheets, and sealed boxes of cards.    <br />
<br />
Who I am: Mike Tomashewski (1553)<br />
(note- all ratings are our local Pittsburgh ratings that we reset in 12/03)<br />
<br />
My decks: Since I hadn&#39;t played since right after v7 came out, I knew I&#39;d need to redo my decks a bit.  For LS I played TIGIH in July.  I love that deck, but I was guessing that the DS decks of choice would be Scummy or versions of the Maul deck.  Little Luke and my current TIGIH wouldn&#39;t cut the mustard in that kind of environment, so I decided to go with something that could easily deal w/ Scum and mega drains- Hidden Base.  I went with an X Wing Swarm/Commie @ the Desert deck that did well enough at this past year&#39;s worlds.  I figured that it had fallen out of the public eye to a degree.  For DS I had a Hunt Down that did pretty well, and I figured it could hang w/ most LS decks, even that lame AITC deck.  I didn&#39;t think anyone would bring it, but better safe than sorry.  I switched to Gemmperors and threw in a Security Precautions in case I faced someone who decided that HB was a good LS deck choice.  My friend Brian made an Ewok/Musician deck that will only get better w/ V9 and found a crappy old DS deck.  Next tournament I&#39;m sure he will try to improve his DS.<br />
<br />
Lets play!<br />
<br />
Game #1- My DS vs. Justin Stratton (1500)s TRM<br />
<br />
Justin drove out from OH for this event, which makes him cool in my book and a new member of our Pittsburgh ratings system.  He starts Insurrection combo, Colo, and Disorder (V).  I&#39;ve never felt a need to play SAM in my HD, since I don&#39;t see too much TRM, but I&#39;m gonna fit it in after this matchup.  I start IAO combo, YCHF combo, and No Escape.  Justin uses DDTA shield to freeze YCHF but I have Sec Pre in hand already.  He puts out a docking bay, Goo Nee Tay and lets me go.  I don&#39;t have enough for Vader (or have one in hand) so I get a DB and drop Sec Pre.   I draw up a Vader but with Goo I need to save up to deploy him the next turn.  Justin gets another DB and Weesas for BNC and plays naked 3po from hand there.  I go, deploy DVDLOTS to a DB, and get out my other DB.  I draw until I have one force left, getting Carida into hand.  EPP Obi comes with DTF, which totally screws my Stunning Leader.  Vader dies (thanks to his CCF!) and we both keep losing to Visage.  I don&#39;t have a new Vader, but I need more energy- we are both feeling choked at this point.  I play Carida, Sidious, and draw up to a Bliz 4.  Justin drops a crew at my Carida (dumb move #1) and Phylo and EPP Luke to my DB.  I lost most of my space to Visage earlier sadly.  I&#39;m able to fight off Luke and Phylo w/ B4/Vader and IHYN, but then I have to lose him due to a big attrition draw (dumb move #2).  Justin&#39;s constant drain of 2 stinks (he had Tantive V there) and I&#39;m so choked I can&#39;t get out another Vader to save my life.  I foolishly drop a First Strike (4 force swing for each battle now, dumb move #3) and solidify a docking bay w/ Empy V, EPP 4 Lom and EPP Iggy.   Justin fights to hurt me and get stuff back with Disorder V and both battle effects and that slow retrieval is killing me.  I win the battle but have lost the war.  My mistakes compound and I lose by 12.<br />
<br />
0 (-12)<br />
<br />
Props- Not a bad return game all in all.  Meeting  a new player.<br />
Slops- LS effects suck!  Fish, and especially Goo was a game breaker.<br />
<br />
Game #2 My LS vs. Dan Tartagliones (1503) Balanced Maul Deck<br />
<br />
Dan was bragging about his Maul deck, so I was happy to test out my LS to see how it handles his deck.   He&#39;s playing a pretty solid variation of the Maul deck that goes for multiples small drains of 2 instead of a mega drain.  He also gets a first turn Bane V w/ starting Tatooine:JP and grabbing the AC.  He starts CR, Rack V, and Sec Pre V on the Palace.  I start Reb Planners V, YISYW combo, and Flaps V.  He goes, gets out Maul, his stick, the AC, and Bane and reinforces.  I get some extra cards, which helps me out.  My HB can flip second turn if I draw or have another system in hand.  I drop some systems and my X wings to the RP, as well as Honor, which mean my hyper escapes don&#39;t hurt me!  Dan doesn&#39;t have DS Sentry shield so I get to draw up all my force.  I get Sandwhirl, some speeders, Organized Attack, and a system.  Dan gets out Vader and stick and drops them at Tat JP and draws up.  During his turn I get X wings (after he passes the Monnok stage of only have 3 force left) with Org Attack and then I put out my systems on my turn.  While deploying from Reserve I pull my desert and a speeder for Zev, giving Dan some cards.  I spread the X Wings out, put out the Speeder/Sandwhirl and let Dan go.  Dan hits me for some (I flip to stop Maul&#39;s drain) and then come at me with Zuckuss V in Mist Hunter V and EPP 4 Lom vs. my lone X wing.  I houjix it and he moves to another system.  On my turn I drain for a bit and then put out HCF (barriered), X Wing guns,  Bright Hope V and Dash V piloting.  I don&#39;t battle and upkeep the Falcon.  Dan plays Baron in Saber 1 and Guri on the Mist Hunter.  We battle, I draw blind with the cannons and miss.  We are both at 1 destiny, he loses a few due to our power difference and runs away, finally remembering to probe.  I drain for a bit and give chase and draw up.  Dan controls my Sandwhirl and then plays Mara undercover to block my ground drain.  He then plays Jabba&#39;s Cruiser and Woof, and battles a lone X Wing but I hyper escape away.  He also battles my Bright Hope and Xwing and I react with Spiral to clear out the Baron.  My turn I get back Sandwhirl with Tibrin and make Mara lost.  Dan gives chase but I make good use of evasion and out of nowheres to add destiny against his ships.  Eventually it becomes a race- He&#39;s spread with Palpy at the AC draining for 1, and he finally gets my Hidden Base.  Unfortunately he&#39;s too far behind and my drains of 6-8 each turn finish him for a close win by 8.<br />
<br />
2 (-4)<br />
<br />
Props: Pulling out a tough win.  Dan for playing a really strong game.  New deck working!  Second turn flip.  Sandwhirling Mara.<br />
Slops:  Not getting a decisive beat in space.<br />
<br />
Game #3 My LS vs. Justin Stratton (1500)&#39;s Maul Deck<br />
<br />
Justin groans when he sees my deck- I right guess that Reid is playing HB as well.  Justin is playing a more basic mega drain Maul deck.  Right up my alley!  No guaranteed Bane V makes my life much easier.  He starts Watto&#39;s yard and the rest of the locs, as well as Rack V, If  the Trace, and CR.    He gets Maul, stick, and Watto to the Junkyard but has Bane V in hand.  Blah!!!!  I go and have a very similar start to the last game with drawing into a system and dropping X wings (though Justin has the Sentry shield).  I get Honor out as well.  I lose to his drain of 3 at the Junkyard and he reinforces for my inevitable turn in space.  I get out my 5 systems, grab Xwings with Org Attack and grab Sandwhirl and a Speeder for Dash V.  I deploy my speeder/Sandwhirl, and spread with my X Wings.  I also get out S Foils, which should be fun.  Justin can&#39;t drain me and tries to battle me but I Hyper Escape away (thank you Honor!), even though Firepower V is out.  His space is Zuck V in MH V and Lando V piloting.  I lock S Foils into attack position and drop Red Leader in R1, an X wing, Tantive V.  Power makes him lose some of his crew, and I continue to choke him with my pay 1 draw 1 text.  I keep draining and he eventually drops Bliz 4 to beat on Dash.  He also tries to do a straight power difference battle but I Out of Nowhere to kill the ship.  I play Corran there next turn to keep the pressure on.  He finally gets another Mist Hunter V out, but with Wooof V and Lando V piloting and probes me.  Crap.  I don&#39;t want to take a mega drain, so I throw down Wedge in his speeder with Zev at the Junkyard.  I&#39;m able to take out the MH with a cannon since Zuck isn&#39;t around, thus ending that pesky battle.  He drains over me (I forgot Maul&#39;s text) but I Satisfy the resistance shield so I don&#39;t have to lose a ton.  I badly track and miss an On the Edge on Wedge.  I draw into S Foils, but Justin sees no way out for him, and draws up before I can pay for Secret Plans.  I win by 17.<br />
<br />
4 (+13)<br />
<br />
Props:  Yeah LS!  Way to kick it vs. the Maul deck and get revenge for my DS deck.  <br />
Slops:  Not getting a lot higher differential.  Justin&#39;s DS getting poor matchups.<br />
<br />
Game #4 - My DS  vs. Reid Smith&#39;s (1636)s Hidden Base<br />
<br />
Reid is nervous about his deck, and with good reason.  With no ground forces to speak of, My HD will be Visaging him constantly and draining him slowly to death.  He starts Planners V, Rycar Ryjerd V, and Squassin.  I get to start my Colo!  I get out Sec Pre, which ruins his day, from hand and get a docking bay.  I learned my lesson and toss Carida to Visage.  Reid gets some systems and plays Dash/Outrider to the RP.  I forget to enforce Visage a few times this game- I think I forgot it now.  I drop Vader and his stick to a DB and flip.  Reid drops a spy to cancel Visage and makes him undercover and then gets another undecover on Vader.  My only spy killer is Empy V.  I keep looking for him but in the meantime I play P 59 to the other DB to get him to waste cards and Sidious to protect Visage (I deploy a new one).  I draw into Empy!  Reid keeps getting out matching pilots and spreading out, but my Battle Order shield makes him not drain and my Sec Pre makes him not want to flip.  Empy fries Boussh and enforces the Vader drain.  We later realize we played the UC spy movement rules wrong and LS has to use their text, not DS&#39; text.  Oh well.  Reid keeps retrieving with Luke V and gets out Leebo V who harasses me and makes me lose cards from Reserve.  Reid is finally forced to flip and I go nuts with Maul/Infiltrator and ZIMH, probing everywhere and ignoring battle damage.  Eventually I hit his Base but this also opens my ships up to beats so I consolidate my forces.  Reid knows I am going to win and starts Leeboing me to no end.  Eventually I Visage him out for a win by 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
6 (+20)<br />
<br />
Props: Beating a great player my first tournament back.<br />
Slops: Forgetting Visage and UC spy movement rules, lowering my differential. <br />
<br />
Though I beat Reid, I didn&#39;t do it by enough to get 1st place.  I end up with second, which nets me a Qui Gon w/ Stick foil and a bunch of packs of Tatooine and Cloud City.  I pull Princess Leia, Darth Maul, Naked Threepio, and a Slave I.  Here are the final standings:<br />
<br />
Reid Smith  6 (+50)<br />
Mike Tomashewski 6 (+20)<br />
Justin Carulli 4 (+32)<br />
Dan Tartaglione 4 (-5)<br />
Justin Stratton 2 (-34)<br />
Brian Sabotta 1 (-43)<br />
<br />
It was fun to get back into SWCCG and know I hadn&#39;t lost too much of my skill- I guess playing WARS has kept me sharper than doing nothing!  Thanks for reading!<br />
