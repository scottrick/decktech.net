I have heard from many of you that you share my feelings about the game, and where it is going. Like me, you want more for the game that we all love. The key now is putting all of these ideas into effect, which will not be that easy. There are many that would prefer to just keep things the way they are until finally the game just dies off. It is always best to think of the future rather than the present. Maybe if Decipher had done this, they wouldnt have lost the license to their most popular game. <br />
<br />
In this sequel article I want to take this idea to the next level. If this idea is to truly be put into effect, every group that has power with this game must be on board, that would include the PC and also Decipher. I am not sure if Decipher would even care as long as we follow the same rules that they required the PC to follow. If we get the PC on board the rest should be no problem. I am currently talking to my local PC person about the idea. I hope to come back with some feedback, but for now, we dont have to go for the glory on this. It can just be something that starts and grows to something MUCH bigger. <br />
<br />
The first thing we must do is spread the word to ALL SWCCG players that you know. There are many that are not as active on Decktech and may not know about this idea. After we have a collective group, the next thing that will need to take place is a complete roster of all active players in all the different areas. We need to know just how many active players we currently have. This information can be used to form the first main League cities (or Regions if no clear city has enough people or if we are talking about other countries like Germany or England). At the next main tournament that each of you have, take a list down of all of the players. We can get all of the information together and know for sure which areas are the strongest and which ones are still growing. It will also provide the current active SWCCG player base with a lifeline to how strong the game still is. Please send me that roster that you take down along with the name of the current TD or Shadow Squadron in that area. I can put all this info together and organize each area. Then post it so we know where the stronger areas are and where we need to pick up the pace.  <br />
<br />
Once the areas have been established, each one will need to elect a person who can act as the Director or Captain of the League. The tournament director and PC / Shadow Squadron members that might be in your area already have their job, which they have been doing well all this time. They dont have to change, just keep doing what you do best. If they want to, they can take on the role of the Director / Captain, but what I am talking about is someone that can get the group together on regular bases, not just plan tournaments and report the stats. This persons main job will be to organize the League Night that will take place during the week some night, which can be set up based on the current Leagues needs. <br />
<br />
Each week can be different. It may help to always take place on the same night every week because in order for it to work, there have to be people that show up. It is understood that not everyone will always be able to make it every week, but the point is to just have them each and every week as something that can be scheduled for like the tournaments. Why should we be limited to only playing competitively once a month? Lets make this a true hobby and not just something you do on the weekend or maybe just at a tournament. This can work well if it is planned out. <br />
<br />
WAIT! What do you mean LEAGUE NIGHT?!?!?!? Does that mean we just get together at some lodge somewhere and roast marshmallows? Well, allow me to go into more detail about what I had in mind for this idea.  <br />
<br />
A League Night can be as fun and crazy as you want it to be. It will all depend on the type of players and how inventive the group can be with getting everyone to WANT to show up each week. The key is not to make it feel like an obligation, but something that you can look forward to each week. One way to keep it fresh is to play at as many different places as possible. Dont just meet at the same card shop every single week, change it up. In Nashville, we also play at the Steak N Shake because they dont care and it is open 24 hrs, giving us the freedom to play as long as we want. But even that is not the only option. I have played in tournaments that were held in the magazine section of a Books-a-Million, non smoking section of an Outback (before it opened), and the observatory at the local Space and Science museum. Get creative, ask around, you will be surprised at what places will be happy to have a group of card gamers there for people to look at. Just because it is a card game doesnt mean you have to play it at a card store. Colleges have A LOT of locations all over that can be reserved. Most libraries at colleges have a student area, where you can make noise and eat food with big tables for playing. All the 24 hour locations are great Steak N Shake, Waffle House, Huddle House, Waffle and Steak, IHOP, Dennys, etcsorry if I left out your favorite place. I am in the South so I dont know of all of the late night spots.     <br />
<br />
Once the location is set, the Director / Captain will need to plan out the events for that night. Now I know what you are thinking, Arent we just going to like play Star Wars CCG? Well, yes of course you are, but why not do more than just play. Why not use the time to not only play but become better players in the process. <br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of things I would like to see happen with each League Night:<br />
<br />
<br />
1 - A small meeting in the beginning to share good news among the group as well as talk about new decks or cards that are becoming strong in the game. Introduce any new players that have come out to play that night. All new players will get free cards that are donated by the players. Anyone who brought a new player will get something cool. Announce a prize for the night either for a specific accomplishment in a game (Example: First person to force drain for 8 in one turn) or just for winning a mini two game tournament, whatever floats your boat.  <br />
<br />
2  Can then divide up into different groups for playing. The beginners can go to one table to learn new things as well as playtest with others at their own level. This can be supervised by a high level player who can give advice and show combos that new players might not know about. Others can just play around, testing deck ideas just like playing at a store.<br />
<br />
3  If a new deck is found to be a super strong idea, then it can be demonstrated to the whole group so everyone in the area will be aware of it, for example; a good Scum or Agents deck. The strength and weaknesses can be seen by everyone and others in the group can provide insight on how to beat it. That way no one is in the dark at a major tournament. <br />
<br />
4  Events can be planned out like trips to major tournaments i.e. Origins or a Regional. Even as simple as getting a group together to crash a tournament in a different city or state, like planning a trip to a states tournament. <br />
<br />
5  Awards for accomplishments can be given out for any number of things i.e. Deck designing, winning a tournament for the first time, beating a good player for the first time in a tournament, completing a pervious challenge from another meeting, new players designing their first deck that can win games on a regular bases.  <br />
<br />
6  Each night, there can be a challenge set forth for the week or even month. This can be to taking the time to research info about the game or to design a new kind of deck. The winner can be voted on each week as who did the best job with the challenge. <br />
<br />
7  One night of the month can be a scenario night, where you are suppose to show up with a deck that is VERY restricted. Like only cards from specific sets or just come with one type of light and one type of dark, BHBM vs MWYHL. This would give players a reason to maybe build a deck that they had never even thought of playing. As well as give play experience for more kinds of decks. Many players today lose games only because they had never played again specific cards before. <br />
<br />
<br />
The ideas are endless. I might seem a bit off my rocker, but I think this could really be something cool we could do with this game. I dont just want it to be something that is only done in my area, but something that all the players can share in. These ideas are things that dont take any kind of approval. They are just ways for all of use to enjoy the game we play even more. It also provides more opportunity for playing games with each other besides when a player here or there can get together.      <br />
<br />
As these nights start to catch on throughout the game, we can take the next step toward the creation of the League Website. It is probably not for a long time, but the key is to start somewhere. The League Night is the perfect place to start because it is not something that interferes with the current game or rules that the game is required to follow by Decipher. I am merely putting into place a format for organizing the current player base. Organization provides us all with more opportunity to play on regular bases. This game is so much more fun when you can share it with a group. That is what this idea is doing, gathering everyone together into a group in place of lose players here and there. <br />
<br />
It can work, but I MUST have help. If you too want to start doing these kinds of things in your area, then lets get started!!! BUT, if you are still sitting there saying, This will never work. Who wants to do all that? Then I guess it will not happen in your area until someone else starts it for you. Why be the follower when you yourself can be the leader??? The power is in your hands, so use it. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing from all of you. <br />

Cheers<br />
