I am doing this for several reasons.  First, I enjoy reading the reviews of fellow Decktech users, and to hear your opinions.  Second, I want my articles in a place that is easily accessable so that they can be properly archived.  Third, having the articles on my Decktech page will allow people who haven&#39;t seen them before to read about the awesome people I get to interview.  Fourth, I love to contribute to Decktech and help keep the site alive with frequent posts.  That said, here is the first edition of Decktech&#39;s Friday Times.<br />
<br />
The first thing I learned about Doug Taylor is that he&#39;s one of the lead designers of the virtual cards.  The second thing I learned about Doug Taylor is that he has a son named Jacob Taylor - just like me.  I didn&#39;t need to know anything else to be convinced that Doug is one of the coolest guys around.  But throw in the fact that not only is Doug, along with the rest of the Player&#39;s Committee, working hard on virtual set five right now - a set that focuses around the underused Dagobah expansion -   but he even managed to take some time out of his busy schedule to let us in on some of the secrets behind designing a virtual set, and a little of what we can expect for the future of the game.  If you ever wanted to know what it takes to keep the game alive, you&#39;ve come to the right place.<br />
<br />
JT: Being one of the lead designers of the sole card resource for SWCCG sounds like a daunting task.  What is the typical process for the design of a virtual set?<br />
DT: Well, myself and Eric [Olson] have the next couple of years mapped out for where we want to go, set-wise, and so we always have a pretty good idea of what direction we&#39;re going (and a kind of general understanding of what&#39;s coming next).  We usually take a few weeks off after a particular set &quot;hits the street&quot;, and then we both independently work up a bunch of cards for the next set.  As you&#39;ve probably noticed, the sets follow the movies more than they do the expansions Decipher did, so right now, we&#39;re hard at work on Virtual Set #5, which focuses on the middle segment of The Empire Strikes Back (so mostly it focuses on the Dagobah set).  So, once Eric and I design a bunch of cards (independent of each other), we send them to each other and critique each other&#39;s work.  Often we&#39;ll have a card (or even a few) that both of us ended up virtualizing, and in such cases we&#39;ll reach a consensus on which one is better, or sometimes we&#39;ll send both versions of such a card to the playtest list.  It&#39;s crazy, but even though we never coordinate ahead of time, we hardly ever end up doing the same cards.  We&#39;ve had five sets now, and we both tend to focus on different cards.  Occasionally, we work on a card together, like the dark side objective for Hoth, Imperial Occupation / Imperial Control (V), and together we&#39;ll come up with parts of it.  Other times one of us will design a card, and the other will suggest additional text that makes it better.  After we both make suggestions and offer opinions and make changes to the cards, one of us sends the cards to our playtest list.<br />
<br />
JT: What tests does a virtual card have to go through before we see it in in tournaments?<br />
DT: I&#39;m pretty proud of the group of playtesters we have working on things for us.  A few of them have carried over from the Decipher days, and we&#39;ve added some of the very best players in the game to help us out in this regard.  Many of the names would be recognized by anyone who follows this game, names like Brian Hunter, Jonny Chu, Brian Fred, Steven Lewis, and Scott Lingrell.  We&#39;ve not only got high profile players, but other really solid, lesser-known ones, as well as less competitive yet intelligent and creative types that bring their own unique perspective on things.  These playtesters usually comment on them and most of them play with the cards for a couple of months, giving us feedback by way of reports that they send in. We&#39;re thus able to tone down cards that are too powerful, or give boosts to ones that are too weak.<br />
<br />
JT: It sounds like you were already a busy guy, and then the PC takes up the little remaining free time you had.  How do you stay dedicated to producing sets with regularity in the face of all your other responsibilities?<br />
DT: I simply force myself to get stuff done when it needs to be.  Designing cards is pretty easy to do, since I have a job that allows me to do stuff like that while I&#39;m working (I work graveyard shift and have lots of available time).  Keeping up with the many emails and decision making stuff of being an Advocate in general is a bit harder, but I manage to cram it<br />
into my busy schedule.<br />
<br />
JT: Many are praising the Player&#39;s Committee cards as being much more balanced and player-oriented than the Decipher-made cards, and rightly so.  Does the PC take special consideration to be different from Decipher, or do you just make<br />
the sets as you see fit?<br />
DT: We really don&#39;t make any big steps to make things &quot;different&quot; from Decipher, per se.  One big difference between the design teams would be the focus, I believe.  Whereas Decipher&#39;s goal was always to sell more cards, especially the latest product (a pretty normal goal for a company who hopes to make money), our focus is often to help out older, lesser used strategies.  To be fair to Decipher as well, many of the &quot;problems&quot; of the game (things that hurt the game like one-theater decks, inserts, etc.) have already been solved, so we inherited a game that was pretty balanced (between the sides) and with a lot of deck variety in the tournament environment already.<br />
<br />
JT: Explain the reasons the V4 objectives were created.<br />
DT: We felt that that part of the films, arguably one of the most popular from the movies, really deserved to have objectives built around them.  Besides that, we had the cool images from Imperial Occupation / Imperial Control that totally fit the Hoth theme, and of course it doesn&#39;t see much play since the operatives decks have been dealt with.  A long time ago, Decipher toyed with the idea of a [Main Power Generators] for Dark side (we actually playtested it), but the idea was scrapped for whatever reason.  The idea just grew from there, and when Eric and I designed Hoth dark side objectives independently of each other, they ended up being remarkably similar.  We took the elements from each that we both liked, fine tuned them, and then sent it to the playtesters for fine-tuning, and it went through a number of changes.  The light side objective came along later in the process, and that&#39;s Eric&#39;s card, though I understand Andrew Howard had a big hand in shaping it as well.  It too went through numerous changes during playtesting, which makes sense since they both formed entirely new decktypes that really needed to be worked on them to make sure they were balanced and not too strong or too weak.<br />
<br />
JT: It seems that SYCFA has gotten a boost in every virtual set created.  Is there a reason the PC is trying so hard to make that objective stronger?<br />
DT: I suppose I&#39;m probably the main reason for that, and it&#39;s not per se because I&#39;m a huge fan of &quot;Big Blue,&quot; either. Rather than just help [Set Your Course For Alderaan], you&#39;ll notice that many of the changes have helped Star Destroyers in general, and [dark side] space as a whole.  I&#39;ve been one of the main ones pushing for Star Destroyers to be better and more efficient, though Eric has helped the whole &quot;Imperial-only&quot; decks with great cards like Imperial Domination<br />
(V) too.  I&#39;ve just always felt that Star Destroyers should better reflect the massive superiority in space that the DS had in the classic trilogy, and we all know that a [star destroyer] is like eighty gazillion times bigger and more powerful than an X-wing (though for game balance reasons Decipher had to make the X-wings better in so many ways).  Thus, there&#39;s been continual helps for [dark side] space decks, so that if one devotes a lot of resources to [dark side] space they can actually hold systems pretty well.  It&#39;s still a card-intensive way to go, and [star destroyers] are still big, slow and expensive, but the help makes them certainly better than they have been for a long time (some of us remember the &quot;old days&quot;, back to Premiere and [A New Hope], when the [dark side] ruled in space).<br />
<br />
JT: They say hindsight is 20/20: now that four virtual sets have been released and the majority of the cards are seeing tournament play, do you have any regrets about some of the cards designed?<br />
DT: Not too much.  There are a few cards that could have had cleaner text, like one of mine, Fear Will Keep Them In Line (V), that had text that some found confusing.  Another card I made, Spice Mines Of Kessel (V), was just devastating to Watch Your Step originally, and I think the final version isn&#39;t good enough in knocking down that decktype as much as it needs.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, WYS is one of my favority light side decks . . . it just is SO popular that it would be fine if it took a little bit of a hit, to encourage some other decktypes to see play.  It might have been good for that card to be a little bit tougher.<br />
<br />
JT: Steve Marshall&#39;s Hidden Base/EBO hybrid is now famous on decktech for &quot;breaking&quot; the virtual card Romas &#39;Lock&#39; Navander.  Have the player&#39;s managed to use any of the other cards in ways that the playtesters didn&#39;t expect?<br />
DT: There have been a few new uses, and I think there are still some more hidden nuggets in some of the cards that have not yet been discovered, believe it or not.  Myself and my own private group of playtesters have discovered a light side deck that is &quot;near-broken&quot;, that we&#39;re pretty convinced could be a nearly unbeatable decktype in the right hands. Fortunately for the overall health of the game, it hasn&#39;t seemed to hit the tournament scene yet, and we&#39;re hoping that some help from Set #5 will keep it from ever becoming dominant.  We actually love when players discover cool stuff with the cards, and that&#39;s always a fun part of CCGs.  On the other hand, we don&#39;t want to see any one card or decktype dominating the tourney scene, and cards that make an NPE (negative playing experience) for the opponent is something we try to avoid as well.<br />
<br />
JT: Many of us are already chomping at the bit for virtual set 5.  How far along in it&#39;s design is the PC, and have any tentative release dates been set?<br />
DT: It&#39;s currently in playtesting, where it will be for the next month and a half.  It should &quot;hit the streets&quot; at the end of May.<br />
<br />
JT: Ever since the word got out that Dagobah was going to be the chief feature of V5, there has been some wild speculation about exactly what cards will be virtualized.  How much thought is put into which card is made virtual?<br />
DT: I can only speak for myself on that, and the way I do it is this.  I go through my binders for Dagobah and Special Edition (I have a binder with every card from every set) and select cards that generally don&#39;t see play anymore.  Sometimes an effort is made to make some of the cards that have been foiled better (to give the players some value out of those Reflections cards in their trade binders), and we try to give care to doing a mix of rare, uncommon, and common cards.  If a card is one we want everyone to have an opportunity to have in each and every deck, then we&#39;ll make an effort to find a common card that fits that idea.  Sometimes a card idea will just plain fit a certain card (or cards), and other times I look at an existing card, examine its lore and/or picture, and come up with a cool new use for it.  I must say, though, that there is SO much stuff in Dagobah that begs to be virtualized.  It would have been simple to do a 100 card set instead of a 50 card one.<br />
<br />
JT:  The V4 objectives have been a big hit in the tournament scene.  Can we expect some Dagobah-based objectives in the new set?  And will those crummy Dagobah bounty hunters finally be seeing some serious play?<br />
DT: We&#39;re not making any immediate plans to do new Objectives, as there are still a ton of older ones that aren&#39;t seeing much play.  Believe it or not, our goal as designers isn&#39;t to see a ton of virtual cards in every deck and at every tournament.  As fun as objectives are to make, we&#39;re just as pleased to see players resurrecting older decktypes, like [Echo Base Operations] or [ISB Operations], based on new &quot;helpers&quot; we&#39;ve given them.  Certainly you&#39;re going to see some of those &quot;crummy Dagobah bounty hunters&quot; in decks soon (one playtester just wrote that one of them was the best card on the table in his recent game), and their increase in effectiveness should help out some decks that you don&#39;t currently see much of, like [Carbon Chamber Testing] and [Court Of The Vile Gangster].<br />
<br />
JT: Rumors have been circulating on some of the buzz boards that the PC is considering making virtual versions of some of the characters with permanent weapon icons for use in the Classic format.  Is there any truth to this, and how has the Classic format as a whole affected the direction the PC is taking with set creation?<br />
DT: There were some virtual versions of many of the Enhanced characters made, as well as virtual versions of the Maintenance cards, and we looked very seriously at the idea of doing this simply to help out the Classic format. Thus, the idea would be that it would simply be &quot;Episode I cards, Maintenance cards, and permanent weapons&quot; that would be banned in Classic, making those cards okay to play if you used only the virtual versions.  We ended up nixing that idea (at least for now), as it was found to add too much complexity to the game, as well as focusing on cards that it really isn&#39;t our goal to virtualize (you&#39;ll notice that our primary efforts are to help underutilized cards, rather than ones that already see play).  Classic is always kept in mind, and we feel that the more help we give to these decks now (while we&#39;re focusing on these cards from Episode IV and V) really boosts the overall effectiveness of the &quot;Classic-era&quot; stuff.  While we don&#39;t specifically playtest things just to see how it does in Classic or Scenario play, we always keep this in mind when we design and discuss cards.<br />
<br />
JT: How often do you play SWCCG yourself, outside of playtesting the new cards?<br />
DT: I play all the time, usually at least once a week.  Sometimes it&#39;s to playtest new cards, and sometimes just for the fun of it.  I&#39;ve personally never been able to attend tournaments that often, but that&#39;s more a reflection of my insane schedule (and the fact that I was the one running them) rather than showing my interest level.  I stay current with the game to be a better designer, and just because I love to play.  I wish I got a chance to play more in tournaments, so that more people would know my skill level from my rating (for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve always held my own against players rated 2000+).  The reality is, though, that I play the game a ton, and always have.<br />
<br />
JT: Do you ever say &quot;This deck I like needs some help, I think I&#39;ll design a card to boost what I&#39;m playing?&quot;<br />
DT: Not so much &quot;what I&#39;m playing&quot;, as I try to play a little bit of everything.  In fact, that&#39;s probably my biggest weakness as a player. Rather than just focusing on one particular decktype and/or deck, and mastering it, I tend to play a TON of different decks (I currently have around 20 decks built).  This helps myself and my playtesters to see how cards and decks do against a whole variety of decks.<br />
<br />
JT: What&#39;s your favorite V-card?<br />
DT: That&#39;s a toughie.  I played a game last night with the new virtual version of Harc Seff (which is of course subject to change), and loved the fact that he was generating 6 Force because of all of my opponent&#39;s non-battlegrounds! (How&#39;s that for a juicy, early spoiler?)  I&#39;d have to say my favorites include Fear Will Keep Them In Line, Wyron Serper, the new Han and Leia, and the weapon pullers.  Of course, there&#39;s Imperial and Rebel Reinforcements, Escape Pod . . . there&#39;s so many it&#39;s hard to choose a favorite!<br />
<br />
JT: Many of the virtual cards have streamlined previously underused decks, and many others have severely hurt popular decks.  How do you decide which decks need to be taken down a notch, and which ones need to be given a shove into &quot;tournament viability?&quot;<br />
DT: The ones that need help are pretty obvious.  One only needs to view the decks at any of the major events, or read a few [tournament reports], to see what isn&#39;t seeing much play.  As far as what needs to be taken down a notch, it&#39;s usually ended up being the latest stuff that came out, which (by its nature) ended up being mostly Episode I stuff.  Thus podracing, Senate, Lightsaber Combat and the like have all been given some love, as have maintenance cards.  In the future, expect any deck that ends up seeing extensive play (and when I say that I mean one that a huge majority of players are playing it) to be dealt with.  That doesn&#39;t mean we want to kill it, but rather that we want there to be variety in the playing environment.  We like it when the meta is constantly changing, and when players are forced to think about their deckbuilding choices.  If any card or decktype is simply a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, then we need to be doing a better job. Having thousands of cards to choose from is one of the fabulous strengths of this game, [in my honest opinion]. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=4788&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
