A friend of mine recently told me that he had Googled my name and found this site called Decktech that spoke of me playing a card game called Star Wars I told him Id check it out. So here I am with an article of my own. <br />
<br />
First let me say that it is a privilege to address you all. I have read several articles and am amazed at this site. What a forum for a game that at one time completely dominated my life, and inspired me to compete to levels that I never knew I could. I only wish that during my day, we had this tool, or that I had known about it. I am honored to be able to address whom ever may be reading this and to tell you that if you are reading this you probably love(d) this game as much as me and feel its loss each day as if it were a family member. I started playing Star Wars in 1996 when the first world championship was held here in Vale, Colorado. I hadnt played a single game at the time, but vowed at that moment; to qualify for the 1997 championship, and set a personal goal to be in the top 10 players in the world. The rest I guess, is history.<br />
<br />
With that said, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my accounts of games played with Decktech named, controversial players, set the records straight as to my games won/loss, and relive some of my favorite Star Wars moments. It may run long, and I apologize in advance, I do tend to ramble on a bit.<br />
<br />
Just for prosperity and whom ever is keeping track, I will name key players that I have played in tournaments only (not play testing games) and my win/lose record with that person. Again, Im only stating this for the record I will start with my understudy and long time good friend Kyle Craft - 5 games played, I won each game (5/5/0), Brian Hunter  four games played, he beat me second game at the 99 regional (4/3/1), I won the other 3. Gavin Palmer (3rd at 97 worlds) (2/2/0), Raphael Asselin (96 world champ) (1/1/0), Michael Riboulet (2nd at 97 worlds) (2/1/1), Phillip Jacobs (97 world champ) (2/1/1). Bastian Winkelhaus (2/2/0). John Arendt (4/3/1). If I have played you and neglected to mention your name, I apologized, Im only trying to mention key players. I can remember every game I lost in a tournament except the 99 world championship; I only know I lost 4 times. I will name those now excluding above named loses, Shawn Littleton beat me one game at a sanctioned tournament in Colorado. The Brazilian beat me first game, at the 97 world championship (my only first day lose). And I lost to a German named Riener Zeitchk on the second day at worlds 97. I did lose 4 games at the 99 world championship and I will tell that story in a bit. I hope this clears my win/lose record for anyone who is keeping track. I lost 10 games life-time total in sanctioned tournaments including 1st/2nd days at 97/99 worlds, Im not sure how many I won, but I would guess about 100-80ish games. I honestly have no recollection of wins, I only know that I played in about 20 or so regular sanctioned tournaments (averaged 6 games each), and only lost once. (not counting regional/world events in these totals). Again, I cant say this enough, Im not trying to brag or toot my own horn, this is strictly for the record and anyone who wants to know.<br />
<br />
Now Id like to share a very fond memory which ultimately became the single reason I would quit playing Star Wars forever. Like many of us, my personal life did take priority over Star Wars on occasion. I was unable to play during the year of 1998 due to my deployments in the Army (I served from 1991-1999). This seriously hurt my ability to follow the meta-game and stay competitive. I did, however, stage a serious comeback in 1999 when I competed at the Tatoonie regional tournament in New Mexico after not playing for almost a solid year. To mount a comeback of this magnitude, I would have to turn to my padwan, Kyle Craft. This was me at my best. I had never been more determined and focused than at that point in my Star Wars career. I knew every letter on every card, every ruling, and every player in the world. The walls of my apartment were cluttered with maps of tournament locations, player ratings, and white-boards to scribble decks on. I spent almost 10 hours everyday for 5 weeks, play testing and every single waking hour thinking about decks. I would get off work around 9:00 am (I now worked a graveyard shift for a computer operations center at an air force base) and Kyle would meet me at my house around 9:30 am. We would then play test until about 7:00 pm, I would sleep from 7:00 pm until 10:30 pm, get up and drive to work. I know it sounds crazy, but my goal was to take 1st place chair at the 99 World Championship.<br />
<br />
I had to overcome huge hurdles in design, theory, and the meta-game and I had to do it in a short amount of time. My assets were my devoted play testing, my unchanged play style, my play tester (Kyle) and the one thing that people will probably remember me for most, my completely unconventional deck designing. <br />
<br />
(Authors note: I went 7-1 on the first day of the 1997 world championship by building a dark-side deck which featured 12 Tie Scouts. During that tournament I was the only player to beat a German player. You should have heard the Germans yelling at each other, in German, for not play testing my design. The only words you could understand were tie scout. <br />
<br />
(Authors note: Jerry Darcy, a Decipher architect, wrote an article about my day-2, 1997 world championship deck which ran 7 Dark Deals, and how with some help, it could become a very broken deck. Later it became the Shot-in-the-dark/Dark Deal deck and S.I.T.D had to be erratad.)<br />
<br />
My dark side deck was very simple; it was designed to win on land. Brunstans Beats was very popular and everyone was running ops and destiny adders, therefore no one was really going to ground with the dark side  I saw this as an opportunity. So my dark deck deployed to an operative planet, although, I only ran one operative, it was a trick deck. The trick was to come out looking like an ops deck, but to deploy everything in one huge turn, Blizzard 1, Vader, Tarkin, Blizzard 2, etc,  I think you get the idea. The main goal was to make it completely mains proof.  The day before the tournament, Kyle and I drove down to New Mexico for one last day of play testing. The night before the tournament, Brian Hunter and his play test group actually came to our hotel room and asked to play us to test their decks. Kyle and I knew that it was certainly an attempt to scout our decks, but we agreed anyway and intentionally played our decks wrong. I scattered guys all over and never monnocked their big fat hands. Eventually the mains came and I got killed for about 100 force. When they left the room, Kyle and I were certain they took the bait. The next day I went 12-0-0 and took first place in the tournament, and who did I have to face in the finals, Brian Hunter. Ranked 1st place in the world for several reasons (please read my section on Brain and Kyle), he is an unbelievable opponent. The articles that I have recently read on decktech do touch base on his best quality, lack of mistakes. He will rarely make a single mistake and when he does, only a few will be able to capitalize on it. You have to beat him with your play style and your deck building techniques. Playing his game and his style will only show you why he was/is ranked number one.<br />
<br />
Since I won the tournament, I got to choose which deck to play first for the final match. I think he was very surprised that I chose the dark side deck that he pounded on the night before. I came out very slow and steady, and he watched me,  waiting to make his move. But the moment would never come. I deployed a Legion of Imperials, all to the same location, and had a fist full of destiny cancel cards in hand. In the mean time he was trying to setup Kessel run in space, but a steady drain for 3 at my one location force him to loose his only Kessel from the top of his deck. A mistake made that would cost him the game and his free trip to worlds. He eventually tried to hit ground, but to no avail  and I went to space with hounds tooth, and a couple giant destroyers to stop up his drain. I won the game by 29 force. The bar was set too high for Mr. Hunter as I reached for my stronger light side deck. My goal was not to win, but to get Brian below 29 force, then pick up. Once I saw he was at about 14 force, I did just that and won the match by differential. It was probably my most memorable game and my biggest victory ever, against an amazing opponent. <br />
<br />
What happened next would be the end of competitive Star Wars for me, forever.<br />
<br />
A few months later, Kyle and I traveled to the first ever DecipherCon. What a mess. There were a thousand people, trying to compete at the first ever Open Event. Peoples cards were getting stolen, hired Star Wars cast members were walking around half drunk and pissed. I vividly remember a 70 year old, Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett) having his drink spilled on him, because some kid was sprinting through the lobbie, late for a  Austin-Powers demo and ran into him! Warren Holland was literally, over in a corner with Chase Masterson (Lita  StarTrek DS-9) exchanging pleasantries. (I do have a picture of me and Chase that Warren took to prove it!) LOL. And to top this entire debacle off, Warren Holland had just hired some guy from England to be Red 1 and take Kendrick Summers place as Lead Tournament Coordinator for the World Championship. For the life of me, I cant remember his name, so Ill just call him the English Judge. He was extremely rude, had zero knowledge of the rules, very little organization skills, and no patients. You have to picture the room was at least the size of a football field, and at100% capacity full of screaming Star Wars kids. Chaos. Chaos, cant begin to describe it. And so the World Championship tournament began I won game 1 against someone and shuffled outside for some fresh air. About 90 minutes later, the pairings for game two were posted, and about 30 minutes after that, we started game 2. And heres where it all happened. My opponent was about 16 years old and obviously an internet style player. I dont recall his deck exactly, but I do remember him having too many cards in his deck. I called the English Judge over to have him DQed for cheating, but didnt get the ruling. The game went on and was going pretty good, I remember him draining me on Endor and I hit him with some mains of my own to even it up. My opponent then went to space but was forgetting to declare drains against me. For about 3 turns I lost zero force from a 3 drain at Kessel! When he finally realized his mistake, he asked for a ruling, to have me lose 9 force for the last 3 turns. As I began to giggle at the notion, English Judge ruled in his favor!! I had to lose force for the last 3 turns.   .    umm   yeahh. I lost it. I stood face to face with Mr. England and explained to him that there was no way this was possible, that I had to lose the force. I scanned nearby tables and grabbed Paul Todd Feldman, who had already sent some poor kid to the losers table. Paul was so awed by the notion; he couldnt even understand what they were debating. No other Decipherian staff members were in the room except one of the web-team guys, who was at a computer posting scores. I literally sat with my head in my hands for about 15 minutes in disbelief. I was shocked, stunned, and absolutely furious. It was at that single moment, I decided to quit playing the game for the rest of my life. To come to terms with the fact that you could very well be the very best player ever, and then have everything stripped away because some English prick had no clue what he was taking about, quickly and surely started to unravel my mind. I also knew then, that the company Decipher Inc. would not last more than 2 more years tops. Warren, the head of the company, cut off his own feet. He had failed horribly with Austin Powers, let go of Kendrick Summers, and began to hired losers, and the rest is history   . I passed every turn the rest of that game, as I activated force, just to draw it all up, collected my decks, and went straight to the bar. I ordered exactly 10 shots of Patron Tequila and drank them all. By game 5 of the tournament, I could barely walk and my bar bill was over $300.  Sharron McRandle (Mara Jade) just happened to be at the hotel bar watching me get bombed before noon, and decided to covered my tab! She, Kyle Heuer, and I ended up going to a rave that night and dancing until about 3:00 A.M.! <br />
<br />
Authors Note about Sharron: she loves expensive cigars! I probably spent $100 on cigars that night, very strange. <br />
<br />
I had put my cards away, and they would never see the light of day again, until the day I sold them on ebay for $550.00 to someone in Italy of all places. Shipping cost him over $200, I still have the auction saved in MS Word. Years later, I have spent many sleepless nights with a high-ball glass of patron in one hand and my head in the other, weeping for what never was, but will always be in my heart. That was the end for me, and it wasnt until 2005 when I returned from Iraq could I even look at a card. Kyle and I spent a few Tuesday nights since then playing premire-only, highlander style, but that too soon ended. And thats it, The end. Thank you all for sharing this with me, its been hard to stomach the painful memories, but fun to recall some of the good as well. I hope this sheds some light on my career in SWCCG, My best wishes to you all. <br />
<br />
Finally I would like to finish with a few paragraphs about Kyle Craft and Brian Hunter.<br />
<br />
You see, when I first met Kyle, he was a 12 year old kid, playing magic. Coming from a poor family, he had to mow lawns and whatever it took to get money to buy just a few packs of cards. He would then trade, to which Id never seen the likes, to get one single deck that he could roll someone who had invested hundreds of dollars to build their deck. Having played every single Star Wars player in town, I had come to the conclusion that I had no competition at all. I needed a play-tester, someone devoted and not corrupted by their own ideas. I chose Kyle. It was a gamble since he was so young, but one that would certainly pay off! Our play test style was actually pretty simple , we would build about 10 different decks, play roughly 10 games with each deck to find out which ones were winning. Next wed write those decks down on white boards, and visually study them. Hours of discussion, several arguments, and hundreds of slices of pizza later, would eventually yield the master deck. This was a deck, that in theory, would beat all listed decks. We would then play it over and over, tweaking and tuning, until it would in fact win 100% of the games played against each test deck. But over time, Kyle would often remove key defensive cards from the master deck and start playing with 5 or 6 of his own style cards. These would 99% of the time, be offensive additions. A card that makes you loose more force, or one that would add 2 destinys. When it was time for you to lose force, Kyle wanted you to lose all of your force at once. I would say this worked about 75% of the time for Kyle in tournaments which lead to huge differential wins. I remember a game at some forgotten tournament, that Kyle won by 49 force! I couldnt believe it. I dont know if hell ever read this, but if you reading this Kyle, Thank you! You certainly helped me be the best I could be, and you are/were an amazing friend and player.<br />
<br />
Brian Hunter, as I knew him, was in his early 20s, had hair down to his butt, and finger nails 2 inches long. The way he handled the cards, shuffled, and moved ships about, was almost creepy. When you played him, he didnt care what you were doing, he would rarely look up at you, and nothing you did in the game, would rarely seem to bother him. And after a while, if you looked close enough, you could see, in his eyes, the same game you were playing four turns ahead of your game! He definitely saw the game differently than most and would run the scenarios through his head before performing the actions. This alone probably set Brian apart from his peers the most, the ability to avoid mistakes and to recover from them if he did make them. He was often in his own world when it came to SWCCG. I dont know how he did at major events, or even what his ranking was, all I can attest to are the times that I played him. I consider myself very fortunate to have won 3 out of the 4 matches we played. I first heard his name during the 97 season. Out of nowhere, some guy named Hunter shot past me in the Tatoonie rankings. From South Denver, in a suburb called Littleton, Hunter had really started to make a name for himself. A card store there would run a tourney every weekend, and I think Brian won about 30 in a row. Late one Friday night, Kyle and I decided we would have to travel to Littleton and face Mr. Hunter. We showed up the next morning, won a few games, and ended up beating Brian and winning the tournament. I cant recall the details of the games played, but at the time we didnt consider him a threat to our region, just someone with a high ranking. It wasnt until the regional tournament the next year would we see the real Brian Hunter. I wasnt competing in 98 since I was deployed most of the year and new I would be out of state the month of worlds. But Kyle and Brian were certainly two prime players and quickly starting to dominate the scene here in Colorado. Several of the unnamed major players got killed by Kyle and Brain at that regional. I wish I could recall the details; the important thing was from that point on, those two would be at war. Every tournament held from then on, they would each search for the other always hoping to get a chance at the others throat. I think I started calling him Brian the Brain after that tournament. He started writing about decks on the internet, and started to surface on Deciphers deck column.<br />
<br />
The game was never the same after that regional, there was no fear like in the old days. Instead of everyone hoping that they wouldnt have to play the big guy at the tournament, everyone just wanted a shot at the champ. But month after month, both Brian and Kyle would defend their crowns, and remain as the two single most established players in our region, and perhaps the country. <br />
<br />
I think thats it guys, I have probably shared all that I want to. I will say thank you to Gavin Palmer, from Durango for being the first person to beat me in a swccg game at his house, (god I got sooooo mad - heehee)  Kendrick Summers, for being the soul reason that SWCCG made it. You were the best person to represent, teach, and promote this game. You are truly an awesome man, my best to your family. To Kyle Heuer, for just being hysterical! (he once started ripping through boxes and boxes of DS-9 in our hotel room at StarCon, trying to get one rare card. He must have went through 4 cases of prize support  I laughed so hard I peed myself) and lastly, to Kyle Craft, again the endless hours of testing, arguing, and more testing, were the best times of my life. <br />
