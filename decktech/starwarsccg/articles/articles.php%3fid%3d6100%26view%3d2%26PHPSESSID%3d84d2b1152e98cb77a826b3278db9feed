<br />
	It is my proud honor to reveal the spoiler for my new card in Virtual Set 9.  Now I&#39;m not just going to give you the text and be done with it.  That would be too easy.  Before I reveal my card I get to tell you a little bit about how I came up with it and a little bit of my thinking.  Don&#39;t be scared, sit back, grab a beverage, and let me tell you the story about the making of Biker Scout Gear virtual.<br />
<br />
Well, it didn&#39;t take long to figure out that designing a virtual card was not the easiest thing in the world.  I suppose it&#39;s only natural to want to have a strong card that has an instant impact on the game.  It is a great temptation to create a card that is unbalanced.  My first priority is to make a card that makes me happy.  In the future, I want to be able to say that I am still happy with it and I still play it.  But I also have to make sure to please everyone else.  I would not want a single person to come up to me and say that they quit Swccg because of my virtual card or that they thought my virtual card ruined their favorite strategy.  <br />
<br />
Weighing all these factors and getting a useful virtual card is quite a tough task.  I didn&#39;t know who the playtesters were or who the design committee was.  I wasn&#39;t sure what to do with the virtual card ideas I had or if they were even acceptable.  With the help of the PC and the PC&#39;s design committee, Biker Scout Gear was finally able to see the light of day.<br />
	<br />
Let me start with the earliest idea I had for the card.  The very first revision of it came around July of 2004 and it was an Invasion helper, of all things.  I couldn&#39;t make the text work because every time I pictured the little battle droids trying to hold a site, I also pictured myself losing them to any number of Epps that would come and wipe them out, all of them.  At this point, any card or strategy I imagined also seemed to be susceptible to the same fate.  It was around this time that I attended a local tournament which set me onto a new direction for my card idea.  A relative new player loaded up his Darth Maul with Maul&#39;s Double-Bladed Lightsaber and put him at a site.  I promptly came down with an epp and battled him away.  I knew for this game, that Maul would most likely not have his saber again.  He probably only had one or two Mauls in his deck and he probably only had one of his sabers.  Why wasn&#39;t Maul with his saber, which is two cards, a better character than my epp, which is one card?  I knew the new player was relatively disappointed that his powerful combo only lasted a turn.  Maul&#39;s immunity to attrition meant nothing.  I also thought about Emperor Palpatine and Darth Sidious and how I never use them even though they are great characters.  This was the impetus for the anti-epp portion of my card.<br />
<br />
	Let me give you a brief history of Epps.  The Enhanced Premiere Packs came out around November of 1998.  There were six versions; Han With Blaster Pistol, Leia With Blaster Rifle, Luke With Lightsaber, Obi With Lightsaber, Boba Fett With Blaster Rifle, and Vader With Lightsaber.  When they were released, they were greeted with some skepticism.  It was only one new card packaged with four boosters of unlimited Premiere.  And these weren&#39;t weak cards.  Most players recognized them as the powerhouses they are.  They have the ability to clear most sites by themselves and they drew multiple destinies when paired up.  But the most powerful Epps were released at the end of Decipher&#39;s run; Qui-Gon With Saber and Darth Maul With Saber. <br />
<br />
	These are the most powerful characters in the game.  They both have useful versions that come without the built in weapons but the card efficiency and all around usefulness in pretty much any deck makes the Epp versions far and away the best.  Now when all these Epps were coming out, I didn&#39;t really mind them at all.  They sped up the game, could fit into any deck, and generally were very, very useful.  They also came down to a site to battle and then left the table.  This was the deploy and die strategy that made an Epp able to clear a site while avoiding any beatdown.  So why would I make a card that counters them?  Generally I like this game because of how the game changes and evolves.  It has pretty much never been a static game.  New strategies rise and old ones fall.  At the end of Decipher&#39;s run, I thought I would play DS and LS senate decks for the rest of my Swccg days.  If it weren&#39;t for virtual cards then these would have been the decks that I used for each remaining tournament.  Because of virtual cards I have tried CCT, Walkers, AITC, and Speeders to name a few.  I feel like the game has moved on from most of the strategies from five years ago.  Only in a few very narrow ways has the game not changed.  One of those ways is the power of Epps.  I think it&#39;s a good time for them to change as well.<br />
<br />
	After I had this early idea of the virtual card, I kind of lost it.  My next few versions had text that cancelled everything and the kitchen sink.  Anything and everything got a counter.  I had to clear the chaff from the wheat.  I wanted to have an essential second function.  What was it that I wanted to have this card do?  The answer came to me at the World Championships in 2004.  Every deck I faced with my DS was a variation of the same LS turtle deck.  This deck wouldn&#39;t hide on Dagobah or under the Hoth shield like traditional turtle decks.  They would throw out five or six non-battleground sites and then sit back and activate force until they were ready.  No LS battlegrounds to go to, drain at, or to battle for.  <br />
<br />
	I think by now you know that I am talking about Throne Room Mains and like minded variations.  This is a strategy left over from the days of Premiere.  In those days you would draw until you had the right characters and activate until you could deploy them.  Back then the game had very few battlegrounds that anyone ever actually used.  It was usually a battle to hold the starting locations which were twixes.  The Dark Side seemed to have gone away from that strategy long ago; sometime around the introduction of the objective Watch Your Step.  Why was the Light Side still doing it?  This was the idea behind the non-battleground portion of my card.  <br />
<br />
	I was happy with these two functions but would the player&#39;s committee embrace them?  Was it time for an anti-epp card that was also restrictive of non-battlegrounds?  I figured it would be controversial and it was delayed from the previous virtual set because of this.  But I didn&#39;t hear as many negative comments as I expected.  Not from the local players that I had asked and not from the people whose opinion would have caused me to scrap the entire idea and start over with something like virtual Hyperroute Navigation Chart or virtual Fire Extinguisher.<br />
<br />
	Would I be able to do any more with this card?  Could I slip in one more function?  I had the two elements I thought most essential.  I&#39;ve always been a fan of cards that did a lot.  The more things a card did the better.  The more text on a card the more chance it could do something cool.  It didn&#39;t matter if the text was as lame as getting the Endor Shield from Reserve.  I knew that even the lamest game text could be useful in the right situation.  It&#39;s always good to have options when building a deck. You may suddenly realize an obscure line of text that wins a game for you.  Of course that also increases the chances that a card becomes too powerful.  I knew this virtual set was going to have an Endor theme and by this time I had settled on the card Biker Scout Gear to be my virtual card, which is an Endor card.  I searched through the Endor characters and found a little used keyword in the lore of some pretty ignored characters.  (Thank you Card Game Organizer.)  Did anyone use scouts?  Was Zuckuss the only scout that ever left a binder to see the light of day?  I thought I could find something useful to do with them.  I&#39;ve always liked Strike Planning so, to be honest, I just emulated its text in this regard.  This was the inspiration behind the scout part of the card.<br />
<br />
	At this point, the ideas behind the game text were there but they needed to be refined.  I have more than fifty versions of Biker Scout Gear on my cutting room floor and they all did things a little differently.  Some were even for a virtual version of Destroyed Homestead.  With feedback from the playtesters and the PC&#39;s design committee the card&#39;s game text slowly came into shape.  I decided on using the card Biker Scout Gear because I liked the idea of protective gear for an anti-epp card.  And with no more rambling from me, here is the spoiler for Biker Scout Gear.<br />
<br />
Biker Scout Gear (V)<br />
Deploy on table. During opponent&#39;s turn, a player may place one card (from hand or Life Force) out of play to cancel the targeting of a permanent weapon. Unless a Jedi Test is on table, a player generates only 1 Force at each of their non-battlegrounds while they have more than 2 such locations on table. Twice per game, / a scout of ability < 4. (A)<br />
<br />
	So there you have it, Biker Scout Gear.  I almost thought the card wouldn&#39;t get made.  I certainly didn&#39;t expect to be as pleased with it as I am.  I know that some of you may think this is the worst virtual card ever.  I know some of you will hate it.  It is my hope that most of you will see the possibilities.<br />
	<br />
Creating a virtual card is quite an honor and an opportunity.  So I&#39;d like to say thanks to those people that helped me with this card and its design: Doug T., Scott L., Garrett L., Alden P., the PC design committee, the PC playtesters, Brian H., Patrick D., Peter, Sam, Kevin B., and Poochie.<br />
I&#39;m also going to let you in on a deck that showcases Biker Scout Gear virtual.  Don&#39;t tell anyone because I just might be playing this at Gen Con this year.<br />

I&#39;m giving my decklist for Watto to demonstrate the idea behind BSG.  This deck represents the best possible deck I have found to showcase what Biker Scout Gear will do to the game.  I imagined BSG helping Scum & Villainy, BHBM, Invasion, Endor Ops, and maybe even Ralltir Ops.  But there was really no way to separate these decks from Hunt Down, Dark Deal, the Maul deck, or Watto.  A lot of decks would see a benefit to having protection from the Epp deploy and die strategy.  I chose Watto because it is a deck that immediately sees the benefit of being able to keep Watto alive and not having to worry about losing 5 to 10 force on the first turn.  <br />
<br />
This is an annoying deck that I would never intentionally make a helper card for.  There are several interesting things to notice in this deck.  First, I included Epps.  This isn&#39;t by accident but instead was meant to prove a point.  There is nothing in BSG that makes Epps worthless to play with.  They are still great utility characters.  They defend a site well and that is why they are included in the deck.  <br />
