<br />
As players, we all know that there are some pretty obvious cards that needed attention.  Many of these cards were captured in the June 12th Errata that was released by the PC.  And I&#39;m anxious to see what other cards are being considered for the redo.  But I hope that the PC Design Committee is going beyond just evaluating what the meta has been like for the past 9 months, and is instead trying to project what the meta could be in the future.<br />
<br />
Think of it like this, lets say that you have a buffet of choices to choose from at the your elementary school cafeteria (imagine just for a minute that we are all back in elementary school, I know I act like it).  You may just load up your plate from the sundae bar, and fill up on desert.  If this was a very serious problem, with various students choosing to do this, the school administration may decide to ban the sundae bar.  Or fix by getting rid of the hot fudge topping and replacing the ice cream with sorbet.  Whatever.  Lets just say its taken away.  Now, the school administration would be foolish to think that these same students are now going to go straight to the meat and potatoes section.  Instead, they may raid the pie cart instead.  And gorge on that.  That is, the problem was not truly solved.  Instead the problem was persisted by an oversight from the school administration.<br />
<br />
This brings me back to the redo.  I hope that the PC is seriously evaluating the status of things, and closely scrutinizing what will be left at the buffet (what is it with Team Ohio and buffets anyway?  Even the skinny guy is talking about them) after the fix is released.<br />
<br />
One way to do this is to not cut corners, and to truly make sure that ALL the v-cards are looked over closely, because it is of my opinion that there are various tier 1.5 strategies that are just waiting to pop up once the redo is complete.  Think of it this way, we as players have had 6 months to come up with strategies to counter the NPE&#39;s in the environment now.  Once those strategies are removed, imagine just for a minute what a strategy that could <i> contend </i> with those strategies will be like in the new environment!<br />
<br />
One method to adjust the environment is to establish a set of guidelines, and I know that the Design Committee has done this, and I know they plan to use it for all future v-sets, but hopefully they plan to apply it to all current v-cards.<br />
<br />
What are some guidelines?  Here are 3 fundamental 3 guidelines that I want to focus on for now, there may be more, but I&#39;m lazy:<br />
<br />
1 - Starting Force Ratios<br />
2 - Power / Forfeit to Deploy Ratios<br />
3 - Game text Length<br />
<br />
These guidelines are good, because they provide a measure that we can apply to the Virtual Cards and Decipher created cards.  Also please note that I used the term Guideline and not Rule.  I don&#39;t think that all cards / starting force ratios necessarily need to match these guidelines; variety is good, in limited quantities, as we will see when we review Decipher&#39;s design decisions.<br />
<br />
<B> 1 - Starting Force Ratios </B><br />
<br />
From all that I can see, the starting force ratio problem has been addressed.  Doug Taylor himself said that they were closely looking over starting force ratios and get them to be more akin to what Decipher had established upon turning the management of the game over to the PC.  This is great!  And I&#39;m pleased to see that much of the debate on the PC Forums has not been a complete waste of time.  Granted, the new CP (v) and CR (v) still allow for some potentially unbalanced force generation ratios as compared to what decipher released, but I&#39;m hopeful that the game will not be nearly as accelerated as it once was.<br />
<br />
To be clear, my use of the word ratio here is not exactly perfect.  A player may feel that if they have 6 icons and give up 3 - that is a good ratio.  I argue that it is not.  To give yourself 6 starting icons, I feel you should have to give up 5 starting icons for it to be a truly balanced ratio.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it appears that this guideline has been accepted and reviewed by the PC.  They&#39;re approach may not be as extreme as I feel necessary (for example, it is possible to start 5 to 1 ratio for Endor CP (v)), but I&#39;m hopeful that my feelings on acceptable starting icons will prove to be inaccurate.<br />
<br />
However, I&#39;m concerned about the other 2 guidelines, which the PC hasn&#39;t given much open indication that they are reviewing them.<br />
<br />
<B>2 - Power / Forfeit to Deploy Ratios</B><br />
<br />
Let&#39;s go through a little bit of a review here for the 2nd guideline... lets assume the following for characters...<br />
<br />
<i> a typical character&#39;s deploy should not be less than the character&#39;s power </i><br />
<i> a typical character&#39;s deploy should not be less than or equal to half the character&#39;s forfeit </i><br />
<br />
I would say that these guidelines are more or less accurate to how Decipher designed cards.  Granted, there are exceptions, and slight tweaks to the guideline when considering the affiliation of the card, or the subtype of the card (droid,rebel,alien for example).  In evaluating Decipher&#39;s products, you can see that they stuck to this guideline pretty well...<br />
<br />
Lets look at just Premiere for starters:<br />
<br />
There are 69 Characters in Premiere.  6 (8.7%) of &#39;em have greater power then deploy.  27 (39.13%) of them have a forfeit of 2 times or greater than deploy.  And 2 (2.9%) of them invalidate the guidelines on both counts.  Do you know which ones?  Wioslea and KFC!  Neither of which are exactly earth shattering cards.  But none the less, Decipher stuck with these guidelines.  When the guidelines were broken, they were the exception and not the rule.<br />
<br />
In fact, Decipher never got more then 13% in regards to breaking both the guidelines.  In Tatooine, there are 23 characters, and 3 (Graga, Padme Naberrie, and Watto) of them break both guidelines.  <br />
<br />
How about the PC?  <br />
<br />
If you look at all the V-Cards together (123 characters) you have a whopping 24 characters that break both guidelines!  Almost 20%!  (For those that are interested, in total, only 3% (25 out of 699) of decipher cards broke both these guidelines)<br />
<br />
Now you may say, but Justin - this doesn&#39;t matter!  I want the PC to make good cards!  I agree!  I do too!  But to make a card good by under-costing it does not make good cards, it is lazy design!  And its part of the reason why SWCCG is in the mess it is right now.  The abandonment of these guidelines make the game faster and contributes to escalation.  Cards that violate these guidelines need to have very good reasons to do so, in my opinion.  And to violate this principle with solid characters like Leia (v) and Motti (v), or characters with awesome gametext like Captain Bewil (v) compounds the problem.  That is, for a card to violate these principles, it should, in general be a lousy card (like Wioslea!), not a sweet card like Leia (v).  When they are sweet cards, it leads to escalation.  All other Leia&#39;s need to be compared to this one.  When this happens design digs itself into a hole.<br />
<br />
One more note before I move on.  I skipped another key analysis, because frankly I don&#39;t have the ambition to do it for all the cards released.  That aspect is &#39;realistic&#39; cost.  When I ran these numbers, I ran them on the deploy box against the power box against the forfeit box.  I did not evaluate &#39;realistic&#39; cost.  So for example, Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v) is not included in these 24 pc cards!  Or BoShek (v), Luke Skywalker (v), Commander Skywalker (v), cards targeted by Bargaining Table (v), etc.<br />
<br />
<B> 3 - Game text Length </B><br />
<br />
Another key design guideline that I hope the PC is reviewing is game text length.  When evaluating Decipher&#39;s card length rules, the approach I took was a simple character count.  Now this is admittedly a poor method, but it really is the best method that I can come up with.  Again, going with Decipher&#39;s released cards as a general rule of thumb, and looking at just non-combo interrupts and effects (red cards). <br />
<br />
When looking at expansions, take a look at these numbers...<br />
<br />
Premiere has 157 red cards, averaging 187 characters.  Special Edition has 106 red cards, averaging 228 characters (so you can see, things were moving up).  The largest full expansion average is Death Star II with 245 characters.<br />
<br />
Virtual Sets will blow that number away though...<br />
<br />
VSet 1 started pretty good, 158 characters (only 2 to consider though!).  VSet 2 (30 cards) = 187 characters.  But look at some of recent sets:  VSet 10 (7 cards) = 296 characters!  V-Set 8 (23 cards) = 293 characters!  <br />
<br />
Overall, Decipher released 957 red cards (excluding combo effect/interrupts which are their own entity really), and had an average 219 characters.  The PC has had 240 red cards, averaging 248 characters.<br />
<br />
Essentially, V-Cards do way more than decipher cards are able to do.  And lengthy game text was an exception for Decipher (boutique products tended to be longer), but for the PC it has established itself as the norm.<br />
<br />
When cards do more, they become harder to test.  So, I hope that the PC evaluates closely all these cards, and proceed to do something about the ones with a lot of game text (The Emperor (v), Weather Vane (v), just about all the Player Created cards, for example!).  Hopefully they can truncate some of them down, and work features into other cards.  <br />
<br />
I only ran this analysis for red cards.  Across all card types, I would estimate there is a similar behavior.  Also consider for a minute the cheats that PC design took over what Decipher did, with shortcut icons and smaller font sizes.  Design clearly recognizes this as a problem going into the future; I&#39;m hoping that they recognize it as a problem with the past that they are in a great position to correct right now.<br />
<br />
<b> concluding thoughts </B><br />
<br />
So, in closing, I hope PC design sees this, and recognizes some of the truth in it.  Essentially, I hope that they slow down a bit, evaluate where they are and think for a minute about the company I work for founder&#39;s motto:  &quot;Do it right, or not at all&quot;.  Players are patient, I think I speak for a majority of them when I say that I would rather the PC take too long pulling this redo set together, and get it right, over spending the next 6 months continuing to argue that the pie cart is just as bad as the sundae bar!<br />
<br />
Also, to be clear, is Decipher the greatest ever designer of all time?  Definitely debatable.  But look at how they messed certain things up, while generally following the guidelines I outlined above!  Imagine what they would have done if they instead ignored those guidelines!  Hopefully you can see the point I&#39;m trying to make.<br />
<br />
