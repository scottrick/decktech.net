It is now comparatively easy to find top players decks, and even their thoughts on game play and strategy, using sites like Decktech and Trandosite. This is a huge advantage for the whole playing community, new players included, but I fear that to an extent a new player may be disadvantaged by trying to run before he can walk. Whilst I am not going to criticise a player for copying a deck by Clint Hays or Yannick Lapointe, I do feel that that player cannot understand fully the deck nor how it is meant to be played. It is not true to say that this player will not get better - of course he will. Playing with a top quality deck will put him in a position to find out new knowledge and learn just how the deck does work (at the end of the day, playing itself is a learning experience). However, his ability to deckbuild and even his playing ability will not progress to its full potential if this method is taken.<br />
<br />
There are a huge variety of articles out there that claim to be &quot;vital for new players&quot;. I am not going to claim this. This is not merely for new players, I hope it will be of value to far wider audience. There are some parts of SWCCG that I believe are not given enough prominence, and I hope to raise them here along with some more conventional points that will, I am sure, attract criticism for being unoriginal but need to be said in any article which attempts to provide a formula for creating a SWCCG player.<br />
<br />
And that is what I am going to try and do.<br />
<br />
Some notes before we begin.... It is vital if you are to become good at SWCCG that you have someone (or a group of people) against whom you can regularly play. If you are starting out, another new player is ideal.<br />
<br />
Stage One: Getting Acquainted With the Game<br />
<br />
I am sure most readers will already feel that they are too advanced to read these first sections. It is not my intention to insult you, but I would encourage you not to skip by what may seem like the most basic stages because I believe here lies perhaps the most crucial aspect to a SWCCG player. When you first decide to play SWCCG, you must begin to tackle the rules. Grasping the basic rules can be hard enough, but after a few games most players have it. However, before you rush on and build your Hunt Down deck I suggest you have a think. Once you embark on the road of objectives, forever will it dominate your destiny. I like to think I have a pretty good handling of the rules and mechanics of the game; and crucially for this I look back to when I first started playing with my brother. All we had was the two player starter set for several weeks, and just played with the preconstructed decks in there. This was a great way to learn the game, and I can&#146;t recommend it strongly enough. Have some intense sessions with simple decks, and you will pick up things (and often be unaware of it) that supposedly &quot;more experienced&quot; players have missed. Today, I would recommend that players play a series of games using the Death Star II preconstructed decks (a great door into the game) with a friend. After a while, you can introduce some cards from your collection to modify the deck. This acts as an introduction to customising your deck.<br />
<br />
&quot;These players [newbies] rarely know all of the rules and at times seem as if they will never rise out of the hole they are in.&quot;<br />
<br />
The above is a comment made by Clint Hays in his article &quot;The Evolution of a SWCCG Player&quot;. This is perhaps sadly true, because too often players rush into action before having a firm grasp of the basics. Know the mechanics of the game. Stuff like the Carbon Freezing rules, or Cave Rules you can pick up later but the fundamentals of the game must be learned at the start. By becoming confident with a deck, even a DS2 preconstructed one, before you begin to play against &quot;real&quot; opposition will give you a good start in SWCCG. It may not seem like it in the short term, but trust me in the long term. Luke rushed to face Vader - and look where it got him. Not good.<br />
<br />
Knowing the cards is a big part in becoming acquainted with the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Surely not all the cards?&quot; I hear you ask.<br />
<br />
To an extent, yes. All of them. I don&#146;t mean that if I ask you the exact game text of Rayc Ryjerd you should know it off by heart - but I will expect you to have read the card, and to have a basic idea of what it does. I was very interested to see Steve Lewis&#146; views on this point. One of the best players and deckbuilders in the world, Lewis encourages players to examine cards and make their own minds up on them. No one considered TIE Vanguards tournament viable before his Monkey TIEs deck did so well. That a card is not being commonly used does not mean that a card is bad. Indeed, the surprise value is huge - but I&#146;ll be coming back to the &#146;Element of Surprise&#146; later.<br />
<br />
It was a great surprise to me to discover that Gary Carman, last years World Champion and undoubtedly the best player I have ever played against, did not know what most of the commons and uncommons from A New Hope and Hoth actually did. I hope Gary won&#146;t mind me saying this, but perhaps if he had those cards and had analysed them, he would be an even better player than he is now? And that&#146;s a scary thought for his opponents.<br />
<br />
Stage Two: Acquiring Desirable Assets<br />
<br />
This is only a short topic, but one I would like to take some time to talk about. Some may not believe it to be hugely vital to becoming a great player, but I shall disagree with those people. Firstly, I will take some time to speak of game etiquette. Great players do not need to cheat; therefore if you cheat you are not a great player. However, there is more to etiquette than cheating - which is a given &quot;don&#146;t&quot;. If you are a decent to your opponent, you will both get more from the game. I can do no better here than to quote from Mary Gail Dufresne - that great champion of SWCCG literature - who says &quot;Just because someone just mowed down your hit squad of jawas with Boba Fett&#146;s blaster rifle, you do not have a licence to be a jackass for the rest of the game or tournament.&quot; I think that says it all.<br />
<br />
More important to this article, however, is the effect your attitude and temperament has on your ability to play. Mike Fitzgerald in his article &quot;Characteristics of a Good Player&quot; speaks of the need for Patience and Confidence. Patience is a vital element of SWCCG; you must not lose control, or give up hope. Several times I have seen players suffer from massive early setbacks, but whilst their opponent becomes complacent they keep their wits about them and press their opponent. Your opponent won&#146;t make mistakes unless you force him to think. &quot;You and your opponent are both gonna make mistakes. The question is who can exploit the mistake to the fullest for the win.&quot; says Fitzgerald. Confidence is a slightly trickier aspect of the game on which to dispense advice. &quot;Confidence can give you the boost you need to win, while conversely overconfidence can allow victory to slip through your fingers.&quot; says David Marincic in the introduction to his article &quot;The Confidence Game&quot;. There are some great players in the world whose confidence is very visible - Clint Hays springs to mind (a self-proclaimed best player in the world) and several of the Quebec players. Whilst they are all admirable players, whose work I always enjoy reading, this is not the confidence I would advise players to take. Have faith in your abilities, but do not intimidate your opponent. Likewise, you must never yourself be intimidated. You&#146;re playing Joe Alread, so what? He&#146;s just another opponent to beat - if you go in with a negative attitude you will confine yourself to &quot;scrubdom&quot;. I liken playing the big players to a hole at my local Golf Course where I always try and go over the water with my tee shot rather than lay up. It always used to land in that bloody hazard, but since I first managed to get it over I&#146;ve been able to get it over consistently since. In the first few cases, you might think, &quot;Why bother? Just lay up!&quot; But then you will never be able to make that crucial step. SWCCG has other comparisons with golf, and you could do better than imitate the attitude of someone like Tiger Woods when playing. If he had an insert come up and cause 8 damage on his first turn, do you think he would go to pieces and leave lone characters at 2-2 sites to try and minimise his loss? Or would he save his characters, and wait for the opportunity to get back at the opponent and exploit the inevitable mistake he will make?<br />
<br />
Always ensure that your concentration is kept fully focused on the game - never be distracted by discussion, trading, other games, etc. Too often have I let my concentration slip and, for whatever reason, it is unforgivable. In one example, a Sealed Deck game against Alex Tennet (a particularly good opponent I might add), I was in the driving seat and looking solid. A slight lapse in my focus, and my Death Star Trooper initiated battle against a Talz to make him lose 1 Force. *BANG*. Luke With Lightsaber reacts over on a Lift Tube, hammers the trooper and 8 more off the top. I lose the game by 1 Force. (Later that evening, the Death Star Trooper was incinerated.... but I know who the real culprit was - darn it!). Memory of this game is enough now to ensure I keep my mind focused at all stages during the game as best I can.<br />
<br />
Stage Three: Deck Construction<br />
<br />
This is a huge and daunting topic to cover - Deck Construction. Once you are ready to enter a tournament environment, you need to think about building a tournament deck. I would advise players to enter tournaments fairly early on in their SWCCG careers - although I do not wish for players to rush in (see above), the initial learning process is a matter of several weeks rather than several months. Getting to a tournament is a chance for you to play high level players, and to get experience against a wide range of playing styles and decks. Clint Hays implores us to, &quot;Play, play, and play some more.&quot;<br />
<br />
To give advice on specific deck themes is a task too long for this article; I will deal more with a general aspect of the process. For more on this topic, I will point you to a previous article of mine entitled &quot;Deck Construction&quot;.<br />
<br />
Each slot in your deck is extremely valuable. This is something you should not underestimate, or forget. One card can make a difference, two or three cards can make a very big difference indeed - particularly as cards like Monnok or Masterful Move tend to be the cards players see as &quot;non-essential&quot; and slip in that extra Mara Jade or Star Destroyer.<br />
<br />
I cannot speak too highly of efficiency in deck building, or indeed of all aspects of SWCCG. It is a word I overuse and abuse rather horribly. What exactly is efficiency? My dictionary gives a rather vague meaning, or I&#146;d quote that. In SWCCG, we mean to make the most of a card (or cards) in a deck, and to maximise the interrelation in a deck. Locations are necessary to activate, but are bad to have in the deck because (a) They have destiny 0 if they come up for destiny, and (b) They don&#146;t help you activate when in the deck, so they are not fulfilling their potential. Thus, locations that can be pulled from the Reserve Deck are hugely better than those that can&#146;t. It is almost at the stage now that most decks pack only locations they can have out by turn three or so. This is a truth that I think will be exemplified at Decipher Con this year; it shall be interesting to see.<br />
<br />
As stated at the beginning of this article, you should not be scared to build your own deck. There are several questions you will have to ask yourself whilst building. The process of deck construction is one of continually asking questions; and it can take quite a long time so be prepared (the first 40 cards go quickly, but the last 20 really drag!). There are some crucial questions I believe you should ask yourself when building a deck, which have been compiled from the ideas of several players:-<br />
<br />
&quot;Is my Force generation high enough?&quot; - R Latham<br />
&quot;Is my Force generation too high?&quot; - J Shields<br />
&quot;Do I have a plan for victory through battling OR force draining?&quot; - T Sailor<br />
&quot;Can my deck win against a goldfish opponent (i.e. one that does nothing)?&quot; - S Latham<br />
&quot;Can my deck win if the opponent shuts down my main strategy?&quot; - C Hays<br />
<br />
These are just some questions on that process of deck construction. Once your deck is nearing completion, you should begin to ask yourself about how it will react against other decks. I stress that the deck should be near completion by this point, because otherwise your deck will be so stock full of &quot;Torture&quot; or &quot;Transmission Terminated&quot; that you will not have a plan for victory yourself. Do not be fooled into thinking that by packing Transmission Terminated your deck will beat Hunt Down - some players are fooled into thinking this. There is no such thing as a default win. Gary Carman, in an exclusive upcoming interview with Trandosite (shameless plug) says, &quot;To say you have an auto win without considering who you are playing, card draws, exact deck design etc, is both arrogant and stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, it is important to consider your decks weaknesses and try and counteract them - Gabe Alonso gives us some great advice in his article &quot;Jedi Training&quot; - &quot;You can rate the strength of a deck you are working on by using a gauntlet of other strong decks to play against it. In this way you can choose the one that does the best against all of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stage Four: Play the Game<br />
<br />
It&#146;s not hard to work out, that in order to become a better player you must play against other people. The more you play, the better you get. Nothing can substitute for experience. This is the oldest rule of the book, and I could list a hundred articles that say this (perhaps literally if one has access to all of Decktech&#146;s archives). If I can give you one piece of advice, it is to play as much as you can against quality opposition (for the sake of your being though, don&#146;t overdo it!! Most of the top players play once a week and this is a great amount in my book).<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no better way to learn SWCCG than to lose at it.&quot; claims Michael Lott in his article &quot;Starting SWCCG: A Beginner&#146;s View&quot; and I am rather inclined to agree with him. If you lose, take heart in the fact that it has made you a better player. Perhaps if you played that game again, you would not make that mistake you made, or perhaps when you next play with your deck you will have brought in some cards to strengthen it. Either way, losing is part of the learning curve. A vital part.<br />
<br />
If possible, play in different towns whenever you can - in a &quot;perfect situation&quot; I would like to play in a different region every week. This way I would pick up ideas from all over the world and I would rather rapidly increase my own playing ability. It is an opportunity that (to my knowledge) no one enjoys, but I have played in London and San Francisco, and several places in between. The variance is incredible, and it makes the experience a lot more enjoyable. Quick side note..... The Internet is making the world smaller, and whilst this is a good thing in many ways I fear it may limit SWCCG unless we actively try and keep originality in our local areas.<br />
<br />
I think this is about all I can say on playing the game. Play as often as you can, but make sure you don&#146;t exclude other parts of life or get to a point where you are fed up of SWCCG.<br />
<br />
Stage Five: Tricks Of The Trade<br />
<br />
There are a large number of tricks you can learn in SWCCG. Some of them are slightly sneaky, and we may not all agree with them - such as this little gem from Bill Gordon. &quot;If you are playing against a Hidden Base deck, at the moment they flip the objective, act mildly surprised. Look at them in their eyes and say: Is your hidden base on the table? All the while watching their eyes. Sub-consciously they will naturally look right at the system, giving you a very strong clue where to start your probes. This takes some practice, but extremely effective in quickly probing the correct system.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally, I would not do this at a tournament - but I&#146;m going to put it down as a trick of the trade never the less. I prefer more subtle parts of the human mind. A lot of players, when they draw a Grimtaash or Monnok will look up at your hand to see how many cards there are there. It&#146;s almost a knee-jerk reaction for some people. Knowing when the opponent has a Grimnock in his hand is a rather vital piece of information, but no one can accuse of cheating on this - it&#146;s merely observation.<br />
<br />
The most celebrated skill of a SWCCG player in recent times is card counting (or destiny tracking) - a skill which, to my knowledge, is unique to SWCCG because of the unique design of the game. Whilst cards such as Sim Aloo limit the power of card counting, it is worth remembering that Ommni Box and Bith Shuffle are the ultimate counters and have been around since the very start. Card counting today is still important, even if it is &quot;the most over-rated skill in SWCCG&quot; according to World Finalist of &#146;98 John Shields.<br />
<br />
Card counting is a skill that anyone can pick up. Many people are scared off by it - too complex, don&#146;t know how, etc. On the most basic level though, it is easy. Learn it. You cannot be a great player without knowledge of it - fact. Card counting the opponent&#146;s cards, as has been done by Bastian Winkelhaus, is something altogether different.....<br />
<br />
I promised earlier I would talk more on the Element of Surprise in this article, and I think here is quite a good time for that. It is vital, if you are to beat the best, that you use cards that are slightly unusual or have a high surprise factor. Cards do not have to be unknown (like Recoil In Fear - although this does rock) to have a surprise value. I always used to cite Lateral Damage of this, but now with people actually using Major Haash&#146;n perhaps its surprise has gone. Set For Stun is still a good one, and Sandwhirl or I&#146;d Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee are game winning examples. I have written an article on the Element of Surprise, which is one I am particularly proud of and I will direct you to this for further information.<br />
<br />
Stage Six: History and Research<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is no article that springs to mind which is a useful and concise history of the game of SWCCG. I believe that a good knowledge of past decks and game concepts is a valuable resource; what deck won the 1996 World Championships? This sort of information can be interesting. Undeniably, I feel that SWCCG is progressing - and to understand this progress will assist us in deck construction and gameplay. If I had not played against a numbers deck at its peak, I would not know the devastating effect numbers can have. A new player coming into the game might wonder why anyone would even think of still using numbers with so many counters - it is only through past knowledge that we can understand fully what it entails.<br />
<br />
This leads me on to research through tournament reports. These are surely the next best thing to being able to play yourself, if written well. There are some great report writers out there, and we can learn a lot from what they have to say. I would advise all players to read tournament reports - which, in a limited way, does allow us to play in a different region every week. The information passed on through tournament reports is huge, and we can pick up things from minor tricks to huge gameplay concepts.<br />
<br />
This brings me on finally to decks and articles; the two other big sections of SWCCG to be found on the Internet. I believe that research; reading good quality material; is a very valuable resource that, albeit not vital to becoming a great player, can be exceptionally useful. Being able to share your views is another valuable ability; if it weren&#146;t then Decktech would not be the site it is today.<br />
<br />
Use Decktech. Use Trandosite. Read. Assimilate the information. It helps!!<br />
<br />
Stage Seven: Party!<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, whilst we may strive to become the best player we can, as long as we have fun we can&#146;t really lose. And this is perhaps the greatest truth to remember in SWCCG. Decipher Con is a chance for you to show the world you&#146;re a world class player, but more than that it&#146;s the chance to have a great time and meet some new people, and old friends. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=1786&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
