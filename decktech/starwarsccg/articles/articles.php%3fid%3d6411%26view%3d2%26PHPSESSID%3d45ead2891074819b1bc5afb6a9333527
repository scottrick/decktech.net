If you haven&#39;t read Part 1, do so, or you may not understand the criteria that were used to determine the list.  <br />
<br />
By the way, Part 3 will begin with a (short) list of players that I overlooked when making the list of Honorable Mentions.  I will list a maximum of 5 other players that were not included among the Honorable Mentions, not because I considered them and ruled them out, but because, being only human, (or just *barely* superhuman at best) I simply forgot them.  After you&#39;ve finished reading Part 2, if there is any player that you are fairly sure won&#39;t be in the top 10, but that you still feel deserves an Honorable Mention, dmail me with that player&#39;s name and I will take them into consideration if it is a player I had forgotten previously.  On with the countdown!<br />
<br />
#20 - Alex Tennet<br />
<br />
As was brought up in John Arendt&#39;s Honorable Mention, Alex Tennet is the co-creator of one of the most famous decktypes in SWCCG history:  The Agents of the Black Sun deck entitled Dark Surgeon.  Alex is regarded by many Star Wars players as a truly bona fide CCG genius, and many of this site&#39;s regulars are surely well aware of his accomplishments in both Decipher&#39;s Lord of the Rings card game, and Upper Deck&#39;s VS card game.  However, this is not a list of great and influential CCG players, it is a list of great and influential SWCCG players.  And while his influence in SWCCG was felt, the simple fact is that his successes in this game were not as spectacular as the successes he&#39;s enjoyed elsewhere, keeping him at the bottom of the Top 20.  Still, holding ANY spot in the Top 20 is nothing to sneeze at.  <br />
<br />
#19 and #18 - Hawkinson Da Noma<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief, there may not actually be any such player as Hawkinson Da Noma.  Some people hold to a theory that &quot;he&quot; is actually TWO players, Hawkins AND DeNoma.  The theory states that because Hawkins and DeNoma worked on decks together, attended the same events together, and were almost always mentioned together (and mentioned in the same order), people slowly began to believe there was a single player named Hawkinson Da Noma.  <br />
<br />
John Hawkins and Chris DeNoma were probably best known by the SWCCG Community for their deckbuilding ideas and innovations.  The Northwestern US duo sometimes collaborated with Charles Hickey, coming up with some pretty off-the-wall concepts (WYS with Inserts) and some others that seemed to make perfectly good sense but just were never popular before (Dark Deal with I&#39;d Just As Soon Kiss a Wookie).  One or more of their creations resulted in the issuing of official errata.  In later years, some decks required 2 errata before rolling out of bed in the morning.  But in earlier times, for a player to &quot;break&quot; an old card badly enough to require an errata was actually RARE.  Hawkins and DeNoma are often regarded by other players in their region as some of the best minds the game has seen.  But the two maintained a relatively low profile.  Didn&#39;t have a lot of online presence, whether it came to talking on message boards or posting deck concepts.  And didn&#39;t travel for SWCCG events much.  In fact, several of the game&#39;s longest-tenured major event veterans have still never met either player.  They might in fact have been some of the greatest players the game has seen, but it is tough for anyone to know, since they never really made much of a splash outside their home region, aside from maybe a DPC or two.  Their merely respectable (rather than outstanding) major tournament success, and their merely respectable (rather than outstanding) tournament ratings conspired to keep them toward the bottom of the Top 20.  <br />
<br />
#17 - Thaddeus Chenoweth<br />
<br />
Now we&#39;re talking old school.  A name that might not even be familiar at all to some who have played the game for under 5 years.  Thad was a Tatooine Region player, and more specifically, played in Colorado.  In the first couple years of the game, Thad was effectively the Supreme Ruler of the Tatooine Region, having no equal, and truthfully, not even any real competition.  The players at his local events knew that a pairing against Thad = 0 victory points, and the only thing in question was the amount of the differential.  Thad would long possess the #1 rating in both Colorado and the entire Tatooine Region, and would inadvertently shape the future of SWCCG in Colorado for the next...well, forever, basically.  <br />
<br />
Thad&#39;s understudy was Kyle Craft, and there probably was no one better that Kyle could have selected as a mentor.  Kyle steadily improved and evolved into a capable player himself.  But even as Kyle developed to the point where he could confidently travel to more significant events outside the state, he was still unable to defeat his instructor. (Author&#39;s Note:  I remember a time when the two were paired during the swiss style of a tournament.  As soon as the pairing was announced, Thad turned to Kyle and said &quot;Turn around and pull your pants down&quot;.  Kyle&#39;s retort was...silence)  The benefit of being mentored by Thad was probably two-fold for Kyle.  Not only did he receive instruction from a tremendous player, but the constant beatings he received surely motivated him to become the best player that he could.  To develop his skills to the point where he could overthrow his Master and take control of the Region.  But unfortunately for Kyle, he was not the only player that Thad would inspire to compete at a higher level.  <br />
<br />
Brian Hunter took 1st place in the first SWCCG tournament he ever attended, and continued to win them with relative ease for a short while after that.  The first two times that he was forced to settle for a place OTHER than 1st, it was Thad who would walk away the winner.  Confounded by a player who had bested him twice, and not with better luck, but instead with superior deck construction and excellent decision-making, Hunter vowed to become more dedicated to this &quot;Star Wars card game thing&quot;, (which up to that point had been merely a fun distraction from his Magic: The Gathering career) and to eventually find a way to overcome this nemesis.  Thad would thwart Brian again at a Tatooine Regional Championship, earning the edge in differential when they split games 1-1 in the Final Confrontation.  But that would be the last time that Thad would place ahead of Hunter in a tournament, as Brian finally found more ways to win games against his adversary.  Hunter eventually wrestled away the top spot in the region from Thad, and in so doing, noticed that he had come fairly close to the #1 spot in the World as well.  And so a new goal presented itself...  <br />
<br />
Thad began playing less and less, and on the rare occasions that he did play, became less and less prepared to do so.  Ultimately Kyle would claim a few wins against his former mentor, and surpassed him for the #2 rank in the state, and #2 rank in the region.  In so doing, Kyle noticed that his rank in the World ratings wasn&#39;t too shabby either.  And before long, it became evident that taking the #1 spot in the World would be no more difficult than taking the #1 spot in the region.  And so, having finally emerged from Thad&#39;s shadow, he set his sights on a new objective, and a new target...<br />
<br />
Sure, Thad was a great player.  Sure, he won titles like Regional Champion.  And sure, he qualified for and competed in the &quot;World Championship&quot; Event multiple times, back when there was no such thing as an open Day 1, and you could only attend if you&#39;d earned the invite.  Maybe if Thad hadn&#39;t left the game so early, you&#39;d be reading his entry in the top 5 instead of at #17.  But as good a player as he was, he may still not have been as good as he was influential.  If Thad had not played SWCCG, and moreover, had he not played in Colorado specifically, then the names Kyle Craft and Brian Hunter might never have become known to the SWCCG community at all, because it was his dominance over them that pushed them both to be greater.  <br />
<br />
#16 - Greg Shaw<br />
<br />
Greg Shaw&#39;s SWCCG career didn&#39;t start reaching high notes until the game had been around for several years, but his accomplishments are not to be overlooked.  By this stage in the game&#39;s history, several of the old greats had either disappeared completely (TJ Holman, Steven Lewis, Yannick LaPointe) or were playing a lot less frequently than they had been before (Brian Hunter, Clint Hays, the Terwilligers.)  This opened the door for new blood to make an impact.  For players who had historically been unsuccessful to rededicate themselves to the game, and prove to the now-lazy Legends that they could no longer beat the rest of the field without effort.  Along with players like Reid Smith, Justin Desai and Mike Gemme, Greg Shaw was one of the founding members of this &quot;New Guard&quot;.  (Eventually Gemme and Desai would also leave the game, and Shaw&#39;s success became less consistent.  This has recently led to an even newer New Guard which consists of players like Drew Scott, Mike Pistone, Brandon Schele, and the infamous Team Ohio)<br />
<br />
The first time that people began to ask &quot;Who is this Greg Shaw guy?&quot; was after his 2nd place finish in the &quot;World Championship&quot; Event, when he was knocked out of the Final Confrontation against Angelo Consoli.  This would earn Shaw the largest second-place prize in the game&#39;s history.  The following year, Shaw proved that lightning can indeed strike twice, or that he was indeed no fluke (and most likely the latter), taking 2nd place in the same event again, behind Jonathon Chu.  Assuming Steven Lewis&#39; mantle as the new &quot;Mr. 2nd Place&quot;, Greg had shown that he wasn&#39;t just one of the better players in the New Guard, he was just one of the better players around, period.  2nd place didn&#39;t pay too badly the 2nd time either, making Greg Shaw one of the Top 5 cash earners in the game&#39;s history.  Greg is also one of only 3 players to have made the top 4 of Worlds more than once within the past 5 years.  The other two being Bastian Winkelhaus and Brian Hunter, which is not bad company to keep at all.  <br />
<br />
#15 - Kevin Shannon<br />
<br />
A player from the Pacific Coast of the United States (California specifically), Kevin was surely one of the most skilled players in the western half of the nation.  Whether it was Worlds, States, or any other event, Kevin could always be counted on to turn in a strong performance, and his exceptional rating reflected this fact.  Kevin had remarkable patience at the table, better than nearly any other player at waiting for the right time to pick his spot and make his move.  And whether or not he was aware of it, his careful (see also: slow) decision-making could sometimes irritate his opponent to the point where they would be induced to make a hasty mistake, just to try and get things going, or make something interesting happen.  <br />
<br />
Kevin&#39;s most impressive moment in SWCCG may have been at the Mega Tournament, where he went 7-1 against a field that included such heavyweights as Kyle Craft, Steven Lewis, and Clint Hays.  His 7-1 record earned him a spot in the Final Confrontation, where he faced Brian Hunter.  And although Hunter had dealt Kevin his solitary loss during the swiss style, Kevin was too much to handle in the Final, and he went on to win a complete set of every SWCCG card ever printed.  The other two tournaments that weekend went pretty well for Kevin also.  The day before the Mega Tournament, he took 2nd place in the warmup event, behind only Brian Hunter.  And the day after defeating Hunter in the Final Confrontation of the Mega Tournament, he earned his way into another Final Confrontation, where he was defeated by Brian Hunter for 1st place in the Arizona Grand Slam Event.  Kevin might have been able to take a higher spot on the list, but he didn&#39;t travel to many major events, and retired from the game years ago.<br />
<br />
#14 - TJ Holman<br />
<br />
What does TJ stand for?  Couldn&#39;t tell ya.  But most people who&#39;ve known TJ could at least tell ya that the guy has a knack for CCGs.  Based out of the NE United States, The &quot;Techmaster&quot; was known for taking existing deck ideas (like EBO) and filling them with new card choices that the opponent was not ready for.  Or simply taking a deck that everyone knew (like MKOS Skrillings, or SYC Brangus) and then make winning with it look easy.  TJ had some success in State Championships, and at Worlds.  And had even better success in DPC Events (including a win at the very first DPC), RamapoCons, and at Origins.  Most of these quality finishes were against very high quality fields as well, as there was no shortage of competent competition in the Coruscant region.  <br />
<br />
After Decipher Con was cancelled for the year 2001, TJ pretty well immediately quit the game.  He was in attendance for the World Championships at Freedom Con 1, but did not compete.  And never really made his presence known in the game again.  Had TJ continued to compete and succeed in SWCCG, he would most likely have been a lock for a top 10 spot.  <br />
<br />
#13 - Brian Fred<br />
<br />
Based out of the American Midwest, Brian Fred was a consistent presence among the world&#39;s top 20 rated players for a very long time, and also spent some time in the top 5.  Brian Fred has had a tremendous amount of strong finishes in high-level events, as well as his share of 1st place wins.  He&#39;s won the Corellia Regional, Indiana States, the Detroit Grand Slam, and an Open.  He also placed in the top 4 of the &quot;World Championship&quot; event in 2002, and placed 2nd at DPC Chicago, among a field of very dangerous opposition, including Clint Hays (4th place), Jonathon Chu, Brian Hunter (3rd place), and Justin Desai (1st place.)  Some of these events had fields much larger than any tournament has drawn in the past 3 years.  Although playing against Brian Fred could be dangerous to your win-loss record, he still usually found a way to make playing against him a fun experience.  And good players that are enjoyable to play against are a rare find.  Additionally, Brian Fred made himself a visible member of the SWCCG community by posting regularly on the Decktech Message Boards.  He also posted legitimately helpful reviews for other players&#39; decks, something that several of the game&#39;s other great players didn&#39;t do nearly enough.<br />
<br />
Toward the later stages of his SWCCG career, Brian Fred continued to play in major events, but without the same level of preparation he&#39;d had in the past.  While there is certainly nothing wrong with &quot;playing for fun&quot; in these types of events, the low finishes at Nationals and Worlds were very rough on his rating.  After these events, he seemed to disappear from the game.  However, he resurfaced to compete in Nationals at Gen Con this year, and is rumored to be expected at Worlds as well.  <br />
<br />
#12 and #11 - The Twiggs<br />
<br />
Brian and Chris Terwilliger were brothers living in the Coruscant region of the United States, and members of the famed &quot;Team Albany&quot;, which had also included Jonathon Chu, and the Sokols.  Between the two of them, the Twiggs have quite a few accolades.  Each of them have won the New York State Championship before.  Brian Twigg placed in the top 4 at the &quot;World Championship&quot; Event in 2002.  And they have numerous high finishes in Grand Slams, Regionals, Opens, and those &quot;Coruscant Civil War&quot; things.  But above all else, they were a dominant force in the ratings.  On some occasions, the brothers actually held the #2 AND #3 spots in the world rankings simultaneously, as well as having top notch sealed deck ratings.  For two brothers to both work their way into the World&#39;s Top 3 at the same time, when the game literally had tens of thousands of ranked players, is truly a staggering accomplishment.  However, there seemed to be some controversy surrounding these rankings.  Their father was Tournament Director at some (if not most) of their events, and hence responsible for reporting the results.  Apparently mistakes were made.  Or at least, the Terwilliger family says they were mistakes.  There were some players who claimed that these were not mistakes at all, but instead were fabricated and/or doctored results.  There were 2 New York players who said that these &quot;mistakes&quot; smelled funny, but leading the charge against the Twiggs at least as much as anybody was Clint Hays, although it was unclear exactly how or why he would have access to better information on the subject than anyone else who, like himself, wasn&#39;t at the events.  <br />
<br />
Author&#39;s Note:  Personally I don&#39;t understand why the SWCCG community was so unforgiving of the Twiggs regarding these incidents.  It seemed that Decipher took the allegations seriously enough to investigate the issue.  Sure enough, the brothers&#39; ratings were lowered.  But I don&#39;t recall that Decipher issued any sort of public statement about the whole thing.  It is actually *possible* that the ratings adjustment resulted simply from the Twiggs having a bad tournament or two at around the same time, and not from Decipher going in manually to correct ratings that had become artificially inflated.  Or if the ratings adjustment WAS made manually by Decipher to correct the ratings, it could still be true that this was done only to correct an honest mistake in the reported results, rather than it being a case of the wrong results having been submitted intentionally.  And if Decipher had really thought that the Twigg family was misrepresenting tournament results intentionally, then it seems they would have prevented Marty Terwilliger (Chris and Brian&#39;s father) from being the Tournament Director for any future events there, and I don&#39;t remember that happening either.  Based on all of this, I don&#39;t see any reason NOT to give the Twiggs the benefit of the doubt, and I&#39;m really not sure why so much of the SWCCG community refused to stop thinking that these allegations had tainted the Twiggs&#39; careers in the game.  <br />
<br />
But regardless of whether Chris and Brian&#39;s enormously impressive ratings were 100% deserved, they could not have faked all of their strong finishes earned against fields that were larger, stronger (or both) than any tournament is capable of attracting anymore.  There&#39;s no denying that either Twigg was a legitimate threat to any opponent who sat across from him.<br />
