For one, it will allow all of my editorials to be located quickly and easily, grouped together as articles on my member page.  Second, it will allow people reading the newer installments of the editorials, to back-reference prior installments as needed.  In addition, it will give people a chance to offer feedback on the editorials, in the form of reviews.  <br />
<br />
So without further delay, here is the first article:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In our first installment, we&#39;ll be taking a look at Virtual Set #4.  More specifically, the following 4 cards.  The &quot;creature effects&quot;, (Tauntaun Bones and Krayt Dragon Bones) and the objectives.  (Local Uprising and Imperial Occupation)<br />
<br />
#1 - Tauntaun Bones:<br />
<br />
There are basically two different ways to utilize this card.  For Tauntauns, or for Worrt.  <br />
<br />
A)  Tauntauns:  <br />
The card allows you to take Tauntauns into hand from reserve deck, and/or deploy them from underneath your starting effect.  This could be used with the new Local Uprising objective, which allows you to deploy non-unique rebels (in this case, the Tauntaun Handlers) from reserve deck.  You could also use the card from Special Edition (Entrenchment, I believe) which allows you to cancel force drains with non-unique rebels.  Unfortunately, the majority of the benefits from that objective are based around Speeders, not Tauntauns.  Any other LS hoth deck could still use the Tauntauns though.  Start Strike Planning to pull Madine, and he can in turn pull the Handlers, since they are scouts.  You can still use Entrenchment to cancel drains with the Handlers after Madine has pulled them into hand, and then use the Bones to pull Tauntauns, and deploy the Handlers aboard them from the Entrenchment.  But although those Tauntauns will draw battle destiny, they won&#39;t have much power, so it&#39;s a good thing they are able to react away from battles.  However, depending on the &quot;react away&quot; ability of the Tauntauns is a risky proposition, considering the ever-present Ghhhk combo, and the fact that Virtual Set #4 introduces another anti-react card, that being Stop Motion.  So while running all over the place with Tauntauns that draw destiny is sure to be fun, it is also sure to not be much good.  <br />
<br />
B)  Worrt:    <br />
The primary way that people are talking about using Worrt with Tauntaun Bones is for the purposes of eating Watto against the No Money, No Parts, No Deal objective.  Since the effect makes Worrt ferocity +2, he can be relied on to eat Watto at the Junkyard if he is alone.  This will basically require 3 slots, mixed between your deck and your sideboard.  One of them must be in the deck (the Bones itself), while the 2 Worrts could also be in your deck, or be in your sideboard, or one in each.  Unfortunately, for this strategy to be effective at all, you will also need to start Tauntaun Bones as one of your three effects with Heading for the Medical Frigate.  There are several light side decks that cannot afford to do this, as all three of their usual starting effects are necessary, allowing for no flexibility.  But there are *some* light side decks that could start Tauntaun Bones for this particular matchup, and use Worrt to buy themselves some time.  Seeing that the opponent has started the Bones, the Watto player has a few options.  <br />
1) Proceed as normal, flipping on turn 1, leaving Watto alone, and getting him eaten.  Follow up by deploying someone (such as Maul, Vader, Sidious, Xizor, etc) along with another Watto, and kill Worrt.  When the 2nd Worrt shows up, it only has a 50/50 chance of attacking Watto, and if it attacks the other character, the attack will be ineffective, and on the dark side&#39;s turn, they can kill the 2nd Worrt.  If Worrt DOES attack and kill Watto again, the Dark side player can then use whichever character was there to kill the 2nd Worrt, and then it will presumably be safe to deploy a 3rd copy of Watto.<br />
2) Don&#39;t flip on the first turn, and instead wait to deploy Watto until he can be deployed alongside one of the characters mentioned above.  When Worrt comes down the first time, it already has only a 50/50 chance of eating Watto, and whether or not it succeeds, it will be killed on the DS player&#39;s turn.  Assuming that character is still around when the 2nd Watto is deployed, the second Worrt will also not have better than a 50/50 chance of eating anyone before dying.  <br />
3) Flip on the first turn, then move the character at Mos Espa to the Junkyard as backup (assuming it is a character worth using as backup, and not some random idiot like Reegesk or Greedo.)  When Worrt comes down, it will again have only a 50/50 chance of eating Watto, and will likely be killed in short order.  As in the second example, the 2nd Worrt can expect the same situation as the first.  <br />
The second and third ideas are both probably better than the first, but which strategy the player uses would probably depend somewhat on what they had in their opening draw.  But every player should take note:  All 3 of the scenarios result in the death of both Worrts.  Players can expect for the Tauntaun Bones to cause *some* degree of disruption to a Watto deck, but should never expect that the Bones will defeat Watto decks singlehandedly, or result in some type of &quot;auto-win&quot; against that decktype.  For most players, using most decks, the temporary disruption to Watto decks caused by Tauntaun Bones will not be enough to warrant its use in tournament play.  The Worrt can also be used with some effectiveness against Scum decks.  When it is Ferocity 5, Worrt is perfectly capable of eating characters like Chall Bekan, Boelo, Gailid, etc.  On a good day, it might even take down Mighty Jabba.  While Scum decks will also eventually kill the Worrts, it can again cause some early disruption, and force the DS player to deploy quality characters to kill Worrt.  Characters would could have otherwise been used to attack the LS player at other locations.  <br />
<br />
Overall, the card is not good enough to see much use in tournament decks.  If you want to try a Tauntaun deck, you can use this card.  Or if you have a local meta that is extremely narrow, focused primarily around Watto and/or Scum decks, then the card could be worth considering.  Otherwise, probably not. <br />
<br />
#2 - Krayt Dragon Bones<br />
There are also basically two ways to utilize this card.  For Wampas, or for Bubo.  <br />
<br />
A) Wampas:<br />
The Wampas would be used for one of two reasons.  Either as an anti-LS Hoth package, or as part of a DS Hoth deck.  In either case, this will generally require a minimum of 4 slots, between the deck and the sideboard.  The Dragon Bones, One Arm, a Wampa, and the Wampa Cave.  Finding space in your deck for all 4 of these cards would be extremely difficult.  Finding space for One Arm and the Wampa in your sideboard would probably be even MORE difficult.  If anything, DS players would like to be able to have 12 shields in their sideboard, NOT 8.  Having only 8 shields in a dark side deck is definitely a recipe for disaster, and would be sure to catch up to you sooner or later.  However you split up the card slots, you will probably need to start the Bones with Prepared Defenses, which will also be difficult for some dark side decks.  The new Imperial Occupation objective could use these cards to get One Arm out, who will then get the Wampa Cave for added force generation.  They can then use the other Wampa (or Wampas, if they found room for multiples of the non-unique Wampa) to help defend the Walkers at their sites.  One Arm and the Bones each add 2 to the ferocity of regular Wampas, making them a massive 7 + destiny.  They also have a decent defense value, which will make overwhelming a Wampa through power totals extremely difficult.  In all likelihood, the Wampas will normally be killed only by weapons, usually lightsabers.  In the Classic format, where there are no EPPs, the Wampas would very rarely die.  However, in Classic there are also no sideboards, so you&#39;d need to fit the entire package into your main deck.  A combination of Barriers, Ice Storm, and Wampas would make it nearly impossible for the Light Side to attack your walkers with regular characters.  They&#39;d need to use Vehicles in order to have any luck against you, because the Ice Storms make their characters go missing, and the Wampas can eat any character in the game.  Not even Jedi are safe, when the Wampas adds a destiny draw to a base ferocity of 7.  In any other DS deck (that can afford to start the Dragon Bones), the DS player can add this package to their deck as a meta call against LS Hoth decks, primarily the ones that put characters in Echo sites.  (Generally the new Local Uprising deck or EBO decks)  Toss One Arm out to get the Cave, and start saving up some force.  Get the non-unique Wampa onto the table, and try to get yourself into a position where you can use the Wampa to attack one of their characters on your own turn.  During your deploy phase, put a serious bad guy in the Wampa Cave (such as EPP Vader or EPP Maul).  During your battle phase, have the Wampa attack their character.  Use the gametext on the Wampa to relocate that character to the Wampa Cave instead of it being eaten.  Since a character is allowed to participate in an attack and a battle in the same turn, that character is eligible to be battled by your dark jedi in the Cave.  Initiate battle, hack the character, draw destiny, and watch your opponent throw a ton of cards into the lost pile.  (the character will most likely be low ability, easily hit by your lightsaber, and also unable to draw destiny alone)  If necessary, the Wampa(s) in the Echo Base can continue to attack any other LS characters, either sending them to the cave or to the lost pile, but either way, keeping the LS from accomplishing its goals in the Echo Base.  But in neither of these cases (with the new dark objective OR as an anti-LS Hoth package) are the Wampas really worth the slots they take up.  <br />
<br />
B)  Bubo:<br />
There aren&#39;t really any light decks against which a 6-ferocity Bubo (or &quot;Krayt Bubo&quot;, as I&#39;ve begun to call it) would be particularly useful.  So the only real reason to use Krayt Dragon Bones in combination with Bubo would be if you play in an environment where the Tauntaun Bones/Worrt combination is very popular, and you are hellbent on playing Watto or Scum.  In those instances, you can use the Dragon Bones to get Bubo from reserve deck or sideboard and keep him at your key site (the Junkyard for Watto, the Audience Chamber for Scum).  If Worrt shows up, he and Bubo immediately fight each other, and Bubo wins.  The Tauntaun Bones threat is eliminated.  The LS might attempt to kill Bubo first, and then deploy Worrt later, but killing Bubo may not be that easy.  He&#39;ll be 6 ferocity and defense value 5, so even guys like Qui-gon would have a tough time getting rid of him.  Once again (as with the Wampa), it will probably take a lightsaber to eliminate the creature.  In a Scum deck, Bubo would also prevent your opponent&#39;s characters from leaving the site, and would gobble up undercover spies like TK-422 or Boushh with ease.  In a Watto deck, Bubo combines well with Imperial Barrier to give you defense against minor characters.  Guys like Corran Horn and Leia will need to draw decent destiny to stay alive, while characters like Owen & Beru or Bron Burs (good characters against Watto decks) will be eaten automatically, since they draw destiny only in battles, but do not have 4 ability to draw destiny against Bubo&#39;s attack.  But as I say, using the Krayt Bubo would only be worth considering if the Tauntaun Bones are a problem.<br />
<br />
Like Tauntaun Bones, the Krayt Dragon Bones card is probably not good enough to see much tournament use.<br />
<br />
#3 - Local Uprising/Liberation<br />
<br />
The new light side objective is set up to revolve around the use of unique T-47s (the Rogue Squadron), with help from Maneuvering Flaps and EBG to help get the ball rolling.  Once the objective gets going, it uses the T-47s to cause direct damage, while Frostbite lets the Speeders retrieve a few cards each turn, and if the Echo Base Trooper Officer or Romas Navander is used to lower the shield, the deck can pull of some extremely big drains using the T-47 Battle Formation.  All of this is supplemented by the fact that the deck can, once flipped, use 2 force during the control phase to take any card into hand from reserve deck (a la Rops), and limits direct damage against you to just 1 force.  Sound good?  It is.  It is also very card intensive, as you&#39;ll be putting a lot of cards onto the table, very quickly.  If you&#39;re going to a tournament where you&#39;re thinking you have a shot at going undefeated, then this decktype might very well help you win all of your games.  If, however, you think that you might lose one or more of your matches, then you might want to look at a light deck that loses slightly more often, but wins big when it wins.  Because this deck will very rarely win big, and that could definitely drop you behind the competition if you end up in a differential race.  For more information about this decktype (along with a sample decklist, and detailed strategy information), you can check out my posting of the decktype on my Decktech page.  It is posted as a deck for the Classic format, but would only need very little tweaking in order to be made ready for &quot;Real Wars&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Overall, this is definitely a quality card.  The PC has succeeded in introducing a decktype that, despite its card-intensive nature, is worthy of consideration, and is a potential threat to the vast majority of dark side decks.  Especially this next dark side deck...<br />
<br />
#4 - Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control<br />
<br />
This objective helps out the traditional &quot;Walker Garrison deck&quot; theme deal with some of the problems that have plagued it in the past.  The threat of an early revolution on the Ice Plains was a big enough problem for Garrison decks that they were often forced to include cards like Crush the Rebellion and Evader.  The objective eliminates that threat.  Garrison decks could also have trouble with LS hoth decks, because the Energy Shield severely hampered the Garrison deck.  Drains at the defensive perimeter were under the shield, and could thusly be eliminated by Honor of the Jedi (even if No Escape were on the table).  The shield also made it difficult for the Garrison deck to occupy a battleground site, so the deck could also be slowed by Battle Plan.  This problem is fixed by simply allowing the dark side deck to pull the cards from reserve deck that are needed to blow up the MPG.  And by starting the MPG itself, the deck ensures that those cardslots are not wasted against other LS decks.  Garrison also was annoyed by Jedi Test 1 and Menace Fades, both of which eliminate the force drain bonuses from the Defensive Perimeter, and more importantly, the card &quot;Walker Garrison&quot; itself.  The objective allows this deck to ignore both of those cards, as long as the deck is flipped, and the opponent does not control a Hoth location.  The objective also lets you start Prepare for a Surface Attack, which keeps your force drains at Hoth sites from being cancelled by cards like It&#39;s a Hit, Plea to the Court, Rebel Fleet, Bargaining Table, or the flip side of the Hidden Base objective.  When the deck&#39;s drains cannot be cancelled, and its drain bonuses cannot be cancelled, that will mean that the light side cannot just ignore the Garrison deck and concentrate on its own agenda.  The LS player will be forced to acknowledge what is happening on Hoth, and forced to develop a plan for dealing with it.  So now that we know all of the ways that this is better than traditional Garrison decks, in what ways is it worse?  Well, the deck will not allow you to play the Colo Claw Fish, as that would make it too easy to blow the MPG too quickly.  Also, your opponent loses no force to YMSYL while you&#39;re on the zero side.  That pretty much means you NEED to flip your objective, which forces you to find cardslots for the things which let you blow the MPG, such as the Epic Event and the At-At Cannon.  And once you are flipped, the objective cancels Rebel Base Occupation.  That is probably the single biggest disadvantage for this deck, when compared with old-school Garrison decks.  But the tradeoff is worth it.  <br />
<br />
If you can get the objective flipped, then life is good.  Your opponent loses a bunch of force when you blow the MPG, and then starts losing force to YMSYL, and the Defensive Perimeter becomes a battleground for purposes of Battle Plan/Order.  Your opponent is suddenly in a world of hurt.  <br />
<br />
If you cannot get the objective flipped, then life is BAD.  You have no battleground sites on Hoth at all, so Battle Plan is crippling you.  You can&#39;t deploy to most of your sites, because of the energy shield, but your opponent can.  Your opponent has not needed to lose force for the MPG being destroyed (since it hasn&#39;t been), and they don&#39;t need to lose any force to YMSYL.  Your force drain bonuses CAN be cancelled, you can&#39;t take a card from lost pile into hand when you deploy an At-At, you don&#39;t get the battle destiny bonus at the system, and your walkers are not destiny +1.  You are the one in a world of hurt.  <br />
<br />
Like the Ls objective, this new Ds objective is also pretty card intensive.  Not quite so much as the LS deck, but still pretty card intensive.  If you get your objective flipped, you can probably expect to win more often than not.  Victory is not assured, but it can probably be expected, in most cases.  But because you&#39;ve deployed so many cards, your victory will again not be by a large margin.  However, if you cannot get your objective flipped, then defeat can probably be expected, and is very nearly assured.  And there is a very good chance that your loss WILL be by a large margin, because the deck does virtually nothing when not flipped.  Therefore, this decktype is a dual-threat to your own differential.  When you win, it often won&#39;t be by a lot, and when you lose, it often WILL be by a lot.  But if you think you&#39;ve found a VERY reliable means of making sure that you see the 7 side of your objective every game, then the deck could be worth considering, as it does deal out a massive amount of damage when allowed to function properly.  <br />
<br />
Obviously then, LS players who play against this objective will probably need to focus on ensuring that the dark deck does not flip.  Occupying Hoth sites will reduce the destiny draw for Target the Main Generator, while attacking the Walkers (particularly Blizzard 1, as that is often the Walker with the Cannon) can slow the deck even further.  As long as there isn&#39;t a piloted At-At with the Cannon during the dark side&#39;s control phase, everything is fine.  If there IS, then it&#39;s time to cross your fingers and hope for a low destiny draw.  (A fairly likely possibility, considering the fact that the deck requires a lot of low-destiny cards)  The LS deck that probably has the easiest time of keeping the dark deck from flipping would be...the new Local Uprising deck.  The light deck has a flexible spot in which effects it starts with HFTMF, so it can choose for one of those three to be Nick of Time, which can then pull Power Harpoon and One More Pass.  The deck pulls its zero-destiny cards from reserve deck by turn 2, and when Rogue 2 (with Zev aboard) fires the Harpoon, it only needs a 1 to drop any Walker in SWCCG.  With One More Pass, Rogue 1 (with Luke aboard) could do the same.  When you&#39;ve pulled all your zeroes, and only need to draw a 1...things look good.  And the dark deck will never blow the MPG (or do anything at ALL, actually) with a bunch of crashed walkers.  (the Local Uprising deck I&#39;ve posted also includes additional information about how to use the Nick of Time package against the Walker deck)  The Dual Laser Cannon and the multiple destiny draws from Commander Luke will polish off whatever remains.  These are the main things that make the Dark deck risky beyond the point of reason.  In order to have any real chance of winning this matchup, the dark deck would be forced to use multiple really BAD cards.  Things like Crash Landing, Weapon Malfunction, or Overload, none of which are good enough to be used in a tournament deck, and none of which the Dark Side player can pull from reserve deck.  Stocking up with these lousy cards will dilute the effectiveness of the deck, and STILL not guarantee a win in the matchup, since it has no way to be sure it will draw them.  It can be argued that Nick of Time and One More Pass are also BAD cards, and that is probably true.  But since the Light Deck can start Nick of Time, it CAN guarantee that it will get these &quot;counter cards&quot; when they are needed.  The Nick of Time package doesn&#39;t involve particularly good cards, but it very nearly equates to &quot;auto-wins&quot; over the Garrison objective.  If the Garrison deck packs counters for Local Uprising, it still won&#39;t equate to &quot;auto-wins&quot; in that matchup, and the inclusion of those BAD cards will only make a deck that is already questionable (because of its differential issues) even more shaky.  <br />
<br />
Overall, this is a halfway decent card.  The objective makes the deck powerful enough to win a fair amount of games.  But its wins are small, its losses are big, and it has an extremely bad matchup that it cannot meta for without the inclusion of very poor cards, which could result in losing games it could otherwise have won.  I don&#39;t expect that you&#39;ll see much of this objective at the top tables of major events this year.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s my take on those 4 cards from the new Virtual set.  Hope you&#39;ve enjoyed reading the article.<br />
