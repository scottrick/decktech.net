I am not kidding. You are about to read the LONGEST article EVER on Decktech. This is truly a very long Encyclopedia of information on the deck types for the SWCCG universe. This article will breakdown all Objectives for Lightside and Darkside including their game text, as well as all major deck types like Throne Room Mains and popular set-ups with Careful Planning/Combat Readiness (V). Think of this as a gift to the PC and current SWCCG players as a guide to all deck types. I have taken the time to list all the basic set up, the most popular ideas, and the pros and cons of how the decks play out. <br />
<br />
Please take the time to read through all of my explanation before you believe I am incorrect about a specific deck. My goal here is to just list the facts and not to play favorites on decks. I mainly just wanted to provide all the basic information of what all these decks do. You will choose the deck that fits your style of play. To get an idea of how big this thing is there are 35 total objectives currently in the game. I then went on to list 5 popular CP/CR (V) decks that are currently being played over Objectives. <br />
<br />
This project was begun on 06/10/05, so it has taken me a very long time to get all of this down. Please show some respect when rating this because I know that some of you are going to want your ideas to be added to this. I plan on keeping this updated over time. So please feel free to give me any ideas that you want to be in the 2nd edition of this Encyclopedia. I plan on updated it everytime a new V Set comes out to make a new deck possible.  <br />
<br />
<br />
NOW, to start, I thought it would be a good idea to list all the decks in an index to this article. To save space and time, I have only listed the 0 side of the card, which is what they are called by anyway.<br />
<br />

*****Objective Based Decks*****<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To begin, I decided to start with the Objectives, because they can still be played today and were the reason the game changed from simply starting one location to setting up a whole strategy that could be played out much like the movies. I began with the lightside objectives first, then moved into the darkside. To make it easy on new players, they are listed in the order they were released starting with the 5 that came out in the Special Edition set in 98. Please Enjoy. <br />

While this side up, during your deploy phase, may deploy Luke, Yoda (deploy -2), Yoda&#39;s Hope, At Peace and/or Luke&#39;s Backpack to Dagobah from Reserve Deck; Reshuffle. Whenever you draw training destiny, draw two and choose one. Place Luke&#39;s completed Jedi Tests on table. Your cards on Dagobah may not Force Drain or contribute to Force retrieval. Add 4 to each player&#39;s destiny draw for Sense or Alter. Flip this card when Luke completes Jedi Test #5.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side)Immediately retrieve 10 Force and place destiny card from Jedi Test #5 on that Jedi Test. While this side up, during your move phase, may use 3 force to take Luke into hand from a location you control (cards on Luke go to owner&#39;s Used Pile). Luke&#39;s Jedi Tests are suspended (not lost) whenever Luke not on table. Luke may ignore location deployment restrictions. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter. Place out of play if you Force drain at Dagobah or if Luke is placed out of play. Cancel Luke&#39;s Jedi Tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 4 Dagobah sites, The Way of Things (Only if Testing to 3), Yoda&#39;s Hope, Luke&#39;s Backpack, Jedi Tests, Yoda (V), Daughter of Skywalker or if testing Luke, play Son of Skywalker or EPP Luke. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: If you play this deck you will be training Luke or Leia on Dagobah with Yoda. The objective allows for a much faster training process than when the testing idea was first released. It speeds the process up by letting you find all that is needed and deploys it all at once or as you can afford it. Yoda (V) allows you to retrieve 3 each time you complete a test and the only way to cancel the retrieval is by not paying for it. No Sense or Alter with this objective, O side adds 4 to draw for S&A and 7 side prevents darkside from playing S&A. Since most of the game is spent on the 0 side. It is normally not seen. This objective has always been one that plays defensively. There are many different ways to play with this objective, but you really have to decide two things if you chose to play it. One is how high of a Jedi Test you want to train between 1 to 6, and second if you are going to use Daughter of a Skywalker or Luke (my favorite version is EPP because you will gain immunity each time you complete a test, so it is nice just leaving him his lightsaber when I take him into hand with the objective.) The most common versions of this deck will play a hit and run ground force until they can flip and start pounding on the darkside with auto 6 or 7 destiny draws with jedi test 5. Permanent Weapon characters are very common in this deck because of the card slots.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: This objective will usually have already won before it has flipped, the best way to play this deck is to have them in the hole right as you have the power to completely finish them off. It is just hard getting to that point. Once Jedi Test 1 is completed, the darkside has a much harder chance of hurting the lightside, unless they have counter cards for canceling force drain bonuses. Bane Malar (V) had put a large pain on the deck to stay alive until Entrenchment (V), which can now help the objective to hold its own again while it tries to flip. As each test is completed, you are able to fight the darkside easier until finally you have the super destiny draw. Cards like Mace (V) and Han, Chewie, and the Falcon are power houses once you have a 7 on test 5. The common way to win with this deck is to cause fast damage earlier like at Kessel and attacking the darkside fast to keep them from stocking characters on all of the sites. It is very important not to get beatdown for high amounts of direct damage and overflow. Early card loss will put key cards in your lost pile. Retrieval is very important for this deck to win, because so many of the cards are meant for testing and defense, you will not have room to stop all of the drains and direct damage that the darkside can throw out.<br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Its very movie like. The deck really makes you feel like you are playing out scenes from the movie. If you get really good at flipping fast, you will have the ability to clear a site very easily with just one character. It is currently much easier for more players to keep track of their high destiny for test 5 with Flash of Insight (V). If you are able to shut down their drains and damage, you can literally choose when the game is over. Many timed games are between this objective. It has the power to stay alive for a very long time if played correctly. If you are looking for a deck that has a good chance of getting a timed win, this one is your best bet. Entrenchment (V) has also really given this deck a new life. I see this deck being played more as time goes on. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This is, in my opinion, the second most difficult lightside objective to flip. It takes a minimum of 6 turns and thats if you get Yoda, a Skywalker, the Training Area site, test 1, the Backpack, and Yoda&#39;s Hope out first turn. Many of those cards could be in your force pile and you will need at least 5 Force to have enough to deploy both characters if Bad Feeling Have I is not out. Many things can cause this deck to lose; creatures eating your characters on Dagobah for example. The darkside bring down a power party to Dagobah by loading up a ship like Hound&#39;s Tooth and landing on a site that you have to be at to complete a test. Missing the tracking, and putting a crap destiny on test 5. Many deck types are based to beat it. Scum kills it if they go to the ground. Heavy Space will close any chance of the deck holding a drain there. Huntdown Dueling can hurt you by placing two main attack characters out of play and causing direct damage all game with Visage. Walkers can really kill it because by turn 3, you have lost 10 cards from them blowing the Shields and you are still testing at 1 or 2. Many cards that cause direct damage hurt this deck too; like Search and Destroy, and Occupation cards. Oh, and watch out when retrieving cards. You cant use any character on Dagobah or your objective is out of play. <br />

* Hidden Base<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text (Correct with Errata):<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Rendezvous Point. <br />
Place a planet system (with a parsec number from 1 to 8) from Reserve Deck face down on your side of table (not in play); that card indicates the planet where your Hidden Base is located. While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at systems and sectors. Flip this card any time after you have deployed five battleground systems and your Hidden Base<br />
system.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, to draw a card from Force Pile, opponent must first use 1 Force. For each battleground system you control, you may cancel one opponents Force drain (limit twice per turn). You may not deploy any systems. At each system opponent occupies during any deploy phase, opponent may probe there by placing one card from hand face down beneath that system. Place out of play if Hidden Base system is probed; Dark Side places probe cards in Used Pile (and may retrieve 1 Force for each Probe Droid used to probe). If your Hidden Base is a battleground system, deploying it counts as one of the<br />
5 battleground systems you must deploy to meet the flip condition.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Rebel Planners (V), An Unusual Amount of Fear, Kessel, Squadron Assignments &/OR Maneuvering Flaps (V), version of the Falcon. Lots of starships.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Very cool objective. This deck has been in play since it was released. Two versions even made it to the final table of Worlds in &#39;99 & &#39;00, and it is still providing a difficult game for many darkside decks to this day. A lot of how this deck wins is by flipping early and causing heavy drains before the darkside can set up their space. As each new set has come out, this deck has merely added to how it plays out. For years, the darkside had a much harder time finding the hidden base until the powerful bounty hunter ships and Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator came to town. When playing this deck, you have two chooses. The first is flipping ASAP before they can even find their space. You put a damper on their game early by causing them to pay for every card they draw. Currently you can flip very easily now with all of the new V cards. In one turn, if you have both Mon Mothma (V) and Romas (V) out, you can deploy 4 systems. The other two coming from the objective and underneath your starting effect (read Rebel Planners (V)). The second is getting the darkside to set up their space early before you have flipped and then beatdown their ships so they have no more space in their deck leaving you flipped the rest of the game. That would allow you to lock them out from drawing up, giving you time to completely retrieve your lost pile if designed to do so. In most games, you will usually find a happy medium between flipping early and waiting til they throw you some ships.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: It is much harder for the darkside to beat you down in space because the lightside has more ways to both attack and run away. Cards like Houjix, Hyper Escape, Out of Nowhere, Organized Attack, S-Foils, and Alternatives to Fighting are all very commons in all versions of this deck. There are also five cards that can retrieve in space pretty easily; Kessel Run, Rycar&#39;s Run, Our Most Desperate Hour, All Wings Report In, and Slayn & Korpil Facilities. The current tech with this deck is playing Kirdo III and using the system&#39;s text to pull the <> desert and Sandwhirl. Next, you get Commander Luke (V) on Rogue 1 and stay protected under the Sandwhirl for getting around Battle Order and Search & Destroy. This tech also keeps Huntdown flipped because Luke is on the ground. Another trick you can do is only play systems that have parsecs 8 <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Solid space deck. Has a very high record of wins against Huntdown, Bring Him Before Me, ISB, and even does well against Scum. Not very many ground decks built around this objective. You truly have to love space decks and playing with starships. This is a very good deck for having a steady place to drain the whole game. Only an equally large darkside space deck will be able to stop all the drains.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Because of its long lasting ability, many cards have been made that really give it problems. Security Precautions and Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator can almost auto kill this deck. It takes no battle damage at systems it has probed and is totally immune to attrition. It can also cloak if it fears weapons. Both cards are very standard in so many dark decks that Hidden Base is just not as strong on consistent bases.<br />
<br />

* Rescue the Princess<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Detention Block Corridor (with Leia of ability <4 imprisoned there), Docking Bay 327, Yavin 4: Docking Bay and Yavin 4: War Room. <br />
While this side up, your spies, 8D8, Revolution, Death Star Plans and Detention Block Control Room may not deploy to Death Star. Cards that release captives are immune to Sense and Alter. May not play Nabrun Leids. Flip this card of you move Leia to Yavin 4: War Room. Place out of play if Leia is lost from table (you may not deploy Death Star Plans for remainder of game).<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, for opponent to initiate a Force drain, opponent must use +1 force, During Battle, opponents unique (.) characters, vehicles and starships lost from table are placed out of play; Leia adds one battle destiny; attrition against opponent is +2; and Imperials, Dark Jedi and Imperial starships lose all immunity to attrition. Flip if Leia is captured. Place out of play if Leia is lost from table. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Cell 2187 (V), Prisoner 2187, R2-D2 (V)<br />
<br />
Idea Behind the deck: Another movie objective right out of A New Hope. This deck is one of the three least played of all lightside objectives. The main reason is because it can simply NOT win unless Leia is freed successfully and taken to the War Room to flip the objective. To do this, you must get specific characters to her site. The objective itself prevents deployment of Spies and 8D8 to Death Star. You may not play Nabrun Leids. So you literally have to deploy to Yavin and march on over. Once she is freed, you have to get her three sites away before the darkside comes with all guns blazing to kill her or re-capture her. Once she reaches the War Room, you finally flip and stay that way until, oh yeah, Leia goes down in flames. Luckily, if you play with Prisoner 2187, your objective stays in play the whole game, unlike the way it was printed.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: Well, it wins if it stays flipped because it is truly the MOST powerful lightside flip side in the game today. I guess that is why it is so hard to flip. ALL characters, starships, and vehicles the darkside loses from table are placed OUT OF PLAY!! To make this easier for the lightside to do, they also said that all your immunity to attrition for all Imperial starships and Dark Jedi is gone. No more Executor. Just in case you draw bad destiny, the objective also gives you +2 to attrition which means in every single battle, the darkside is going to place something out of play. The best way to play this deck is with EPPS or Quick Draw (V) to keep the lightsabers in the deck. Weapons are what this deck is all about. Killing characters on the table so that they never return. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Truly a different playing experience. This is an objective that many good players have little game experience against. You will have a good element of surprise by playing this at a tournament. Many times, you will find players that normally beat everything popular, but forget a part of the flip sides text after Maul just got hit with a lightsaber and sent to the out of play pile. Anyone that can win consistently with this deck is truly a good player because the deck can still lose even if built perfectly.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL TECH: Here is a special way to flip super fast that I give credit to Micah Wooten. Start Bargaining Table (V) to pull Laudica (V). Use her to pull Echo Base Garrison, which then pulls the Bacta Tank. You then play On the Edge off of Prisoner 2187 right as she is freed, which is noramlly during your deploy phase. She then goes to the Bacta Tank and because she is 0 to deploy, can re-deploy for free to the War Room in the same turn, thus completely missing all possible darkside attacks.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This objective truly is the #1 MOST difficult objective to flip. Four cards AUTO kill this deck; Ephont Mon, Look Sir, Droids, Restraining Bolt, and Droid Detector. All of these cards just prevent any of the key characters (mainly R2 and 8D8) that can free Leia from ever getting to her. Though two of them are not that common, by just piling a good size number of characters on either the Detention Block or the docking bay, the opponent will almost always be able to kill or re-capture Leia. There are even accounts of people using Bombers to collapse the docking bay so Leia will never be able to move into the War Room. This deck cannot be played at a major tournament because it completely relies on flipping to win the game, so if you are never able to flip, you will never win a game. <br />

* Datooine Base Operations<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Dantooine system. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy from Reserve Deck to Dantooine one site or non-unique Rebel; reshuffle. At Dantooine locations, each Imperial is deploy +2. Flip this card if Rebels control at least three Dantooine sites and opponent controls no Dantooine locations. Place out of play if Dantooine is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. At Dantooine locations, each Imperial is deploy +2. Your squadrons may deploy to Dantooine (deploy cost = squadrons power -3), are immune to attrition <4 and may draw one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. Your Force drains are +1 at systems where you have a squadron present. Flip this card if opponent controls at least two Dantooine locations. Place out of play if Dantooine is blown away<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: <> sites, They&#39;re On Datooine (V), Multiples of either X, B, or Y Squadrons, lots of Rebels.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is one of those very weird ideas that was created back in &#39;98 when the objectives were first released. It also falls in the category of top three least played. This deck lets you deploy squadron for a straight amount of force without having to replace them. To flip, you must control three Datooine sites with &quot;Rebels&quot; and opponent may not control ANY Datooine locations. Not always that easy. The only thing the objective does on the 0 side is let you deploy the <> sites and a non-unique rebel from reserve. To somewhat help you, it makes deployment for Imperials +2 to all Datooine locations. Once flipped, ALL darkside force drains are -1 and the Imperials still deploy +2. The rest of the 7 side is all about the Squadrons, giving them immunity <4 as well as the ability to draw a battle destiny. You also get +1 force drains at systems where you have a squadron. Nothing about this objective is that powerful. You dont really get that much help from your objective if you should happen to win a game. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: Well, that is the thing, it doesn&#39;t win that much. The objective was simply designed with having to do too much to keep it flipped. It runs around doing things in space, yet you still have to put in enough ground to hold the sites so that it doesn&#39;t flip back. The only prayer this deck has is with They&#39;re on Datooine (V), the only V card that was made to help this objective. It allows you to deploy the squadrons for the same way that the 7 side does, only you don&#39;t have to be flipped. The effect also provides help with activation by making all the Datooine locations +1 force generation. The newer versions of this deck have tried to use the squadrons for beatdown and the protective side of the Datooine sites to hide out. Once Goo Nee Tay is out, Imperials have a much harder time deploy. The problem is that there are so many powerful Aliens and of course Darth Maul that are not affected by the objective. Any version of this deck that has won, will usually be one that is playing Speeders on the ground with T-47 Battle Formation. Other than that, I for one, don&#39;t know how to win consistently with this deck.<br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Another deck that could win purely based on lack of experience against it. Many players go into this game thinking it will be an auto win, when they find that the game was harder than they expected purely because they are never sure what the deck will be doing. This objective has not seen very much major action, so it is a very good objective for the surprise factor. In a major tournament, the darkside player will be picking up many of your cards to read them and, for most of the game, be trying to figure out what your strategy might be.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Because it is very very weak. This deck needs more help than any other objective for either side. It just doesn&#39;t do enough to make it worth the time or effort. There has never been a good version posted on Decktech as an example of how to play it. Truly, if V cards should be made, this objective needs them the most. It would almost be worth just Ving the whole objective and starting fresh. The main reason to not play it is the card slots. You have to play with both ground and space, with enough to stay alive in both areas. The darkside is way too strong, and Darth Maul will continually be killing off Rebels on the sites. Scum also makes this deck impossible to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Local Uprising (NON V) (Operatives)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any planet system and one <> site to that system. This system is the Subjugated planet.<br />
While this side up, once during each of the deploy phases, you may deploy one <> site to the Subjugated planet from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if your matching operatives control at least three battlegrounds sites related to the Subjugated planet. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. You may retrieve 1 Froce whenever you deploy a matching operative to the Subjugated planet. Your matching operatives on that planet are each forfeit +2 and, when at same site as an Imperial or AT-AT, are each power +2. When you have at least one matching operative in a battle on the Subjugated planet, you may add one battle destiny. Flip this card if you do not occupy at least two battleground sites related to the Subjugated planet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: A very stupid idea. At first, the idea was to play a deck with 25 of your planets operative because they were broke on their planet. Basic it worked like this. Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all darkside drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created 3 cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that they wish they had never made. It won the &#39;98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.<br />
<br />

<br />
* Rebel Strike Team<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Endor system and Rebel Landing Site. <br />
While this side up, opponent loses no more than 1 force from each of your Force drains at Endor locations. Once during each of your deploy phases, may use 2 force to take one Bunker or Deactivate The Shield Generator into hand; reshuffle. Flip this card if Bunker blown away or if, during your move phase, you control three exterior Endor sites (with two Rebel scouts at each) Place out of play if Endor blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at each Endor site where you have a Rebel scout, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent, except by a react. Rebel scouts are immune to attrition <4. Once during each of your draw phases, may retrieve one Rebel scout of ability <3. Your Epic Event destiny draws are each +2. Flip this card (unless blown away) if, during opponents move phase, opponent controls three exterior Endor sites or Endor system. Place out of play if Endor is blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Strike Planning, General Crix Madine/ Mon Mothma (V), General Solo (V), Luke, Rebel Scout (V), Lots of Scouts and Endor sites, and The Shield is Down! (if blowing the bunker)<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Its all about the Scouts, hanging out on Endor. Great movie objective, that puts you right at the front of the Back Door ready to blow the Bunker. If you are going to play this objective, you have to decide up front if you are going to blow the bunker, because deck plays out very differently if you choose not to. The 0 side is very basic, just letting you pull the bunker and the epic event that blows the bunker. Your drains are restricted to one 1 per site until you flip. In order to flip, you either blow the bunker, or control three exterior endor sites with two Rebel scouts at each. Once flipped, your scouts gain immunity <4, your drains at sites with a scout are protected from being modified or cancelled, and you get to retrieve a scout of ability <3 during your draw phase.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: Previously, this objective won if it was built to be a mains and toys deck on Endor. It could get a lot of scouts out quickly with Gen. Madine. It got alittle help from the Tatooine Set with The Shield is Down! Now, the deck has been given a whole new world with the introduction of the V9 cards. The set provides a good 6 cards that can be used to blow the bunker with ease (General Solo (V), Luke, Rebel Scout (V), I Wonder Who They Found (V), That&#39;s One (V), Count Me In (V), and I&#39;m With You Too (V)). The whole idea of this objective has changed. Now it can set up a whole beatdown party that is almost untouchable. Once set up, it can just match on over and blow up the bunker with very little problem. After it is blown, you get an eight force swing with TSID!, and the epic event, as well as the darkside losing their hand. The rest of the game is spent draining and trying to get them caught in a beatdown. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This objective has literally been re-awakened with a new spirit. It is now very easy to flip permanently. The eight force swing is like Walkers only better. You have much less fear of getting beatdown by the darkside on the ground with all the new V9 effects. Another great example of an objective that has not been seen much for years, so you have the ability to surprise a few players with something different as well as powerful. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The biggest fear this deck has is CCT because the whole idea behind the V9 effects is getting General Solo (V) out early and then using him to set up the beatdown party. CCT will start the game with him Frozen in prison, so your whole strategy is put on hold until you can free Han. This can sometimes be very hard against a good CCT deck. So when decided to play this deck or not, you have to take into account how difficult playing against this objective would be. <br />

* Quiet Mining Colony<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from your Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations. Flip this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City). Place out of play if Bespin is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and independent starships are immune to attrition <4. At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your independent starships deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors). <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Keeping the Empire Out Forever, Beldons Eye (V), Outrider, and Dash<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Originally a very hard objective to flip, making it an almost never played card. Then with Tatooine came Keeping the Empire Out Forever, which completely changed this deck and made it a very very popular objective. KTEOF allows you to flip by only having to control two sites (dont have to be battlegrounds) and just occupy Bespin system, once flipped it cant be flipped back. Also, if that wasnt enough, the effect allows you to search you Force pile and take ANY one card every turn. With KTEOF now being played, players could flip much easier and get a bonus that made it worth playing with this objective. The only problem was it was sometimes hard to find a ship to occupy Bespin. So, to fix the problem, the PC allowed the creation of Beldons Eye (V), which lets you deploy an independent starfighter and a matching alien pilot for FREE from hand and/or Reserve. Now, you can easily build the deck to flip first turn, and play the entire game searching your Force pile for that key card. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck wins by the player being able to react to what the darkside is playing by always finding what is needed at the right time through the Force pile search. There are many ways to play with this deck. Theres Mains and Toys, Run Around and Drain, Heavy Space, and the most recent, the Tuskan Breathe Mask (V) set up with all aliens. The most common strategy with this deck is to deploy 2 to 4 sites. Put enough space on Bespin to keep from ever being knocked off. Set up Cloud City Celebration and Off the Edge for consistent retrieval. You play a hit and run strategy with Path of Least Resistance, Rebel Barrier, Narrow Escape, Houjix, and Its a Trap. All of those cards can be found very easily and then retrieved to be played again and again.       <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: For years, it was a very solid deck for lightside. The Tuskan Breathe Mask (V) version really uses a lot of what this objective was designed for with all of your aliens gaining Immunity of <4. Combined with Ellors Madak (V), it makes it very hard to kill a character. Even if you dont play the alien version, Keeping the Empire Out Forever will always make this deck sound appealing. It can set up very very fast and have a very good chance of lasting out even against a tough darkdeck. The whole deck takes place on Cloud City, so you never have to fear cards that target planet sites, like Always Thinking with Your Stomach. If you play Insurrection, Ellis will never be able to move any characters to your sites. With the popularity of this objective in the past 4 years, there are many different versions posted on Decktech that can be used a blueprints, unlike less popular objectives. It is very easy for a newer player to learn to play well because you dont have to worry about trying to track a card in your Force pile. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This deck can sometimes take a long time to win. It doesnt always keep steady drains going the whole game, so the darkside isnt always finished off in a timely fashion. Currently, this deck has taken a small break in tournament play with the huge popularity of Scum decks that simply beats the snot out of characters on the ground. Because you have to deploy characters to sites in order to flip, it will only be a matter of time before the darkside can get enough characters over to Cloud City for a one battle beatdown which ends the game. Although some of the new V10 cards will help this deck out a lot. I fear it may still be too scary having to put guys on the ground with no real protection. Also, Pinned Down (V) put a damper on the Tuskan Breathe Mask (V) version that has been played the past months.    <br />

<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Tatooine: Jabbas Palace and Audience Chamber (Han frozen there; he may not be moved while frozen). Opponent may deploy up to two aliens to Audience Chamber. <br />
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain at Audience Chamber and you may not Force drain at Tatooine locations. You may not play Frozen Assets. Luke, R2-D2, and C-3P0 are deploy -2 at Jabbas Palace sites (Master Luke deploys for free instead). Flip this card if Han is on Tatooine and not a captive. Place out of play if Tatooine is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) Immediately retrieve 5 force (or 10 if Han has power <4) once per game. While this side up, cancels game text of Bad Feeling Have I. Your unpiloted starfighters may deploy to exterior Tatooine locations. During your control phase, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground location occupied by Han, Luke, Leia, Chewie or your Lando. Flip this card if Han is captured or not on table. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Some version of Han, Seeking An Audience (V), Leia, Rebel Princess, Threepio with Parts Showing. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Another great movie type objective, putting you right at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. This objective has been very strong since its release in 2000. For years, all it did was change and evolve, and even improved with cards like Leia, Rebel Princess and Seeking an Audience (V). It has stayed popular because it is a great objective that is centered around the main characters of the movies. This is made clear by the objective causing direct damage for each main character you have at a battleground location, so it even works if they are in space. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: There are many ways to play this deck, but for the most part in every version, you will be playing Mains with matching weapons. This deck has been known to greatly abuse Civil Disorder (V) and Mantellian Savrip because you can get Threepio out first turn so that you are consistently putting cards back in your deck to get ones that you need. With Han (V), you are promised free retrieval of 5 the moment you flip and also has immunity <4 in this objective, allowing him to stay alive a bite longer. There are many combos that are used through this deck. Some nice ones include Boushh, Leias Blaster Rifle, and Colo Claw Fish, which can KO any character or vehicle early game. Example: Against Walkers, killing Blizzard 4 first turn, while Vader is still on it.    <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Still a nice deck for lightside. It has good staying power and can provide consistent damage the whole game. Also, a good platform for early game beatdown with Master Luke since he deploys for free and Chewie, Engraged or a Leia coming down from Reserve deck. It is very important to play enough defensive cards that can prevent getting beatdown. You also have an excellent advantage against all darkside objectives that are built around Jabbas Palace like Court, and MKOS because you will get to convert their starting sites. Also, since the deck is built around the main characters, the darkside has many cards which will affect almost every character in the deck. In my opinion, the deck has to play 2 Savrips and 2 Houjixsto work with Civil Disorder (V) to have a good chance. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The biggest problem this deck has always had is that is allows the darkside to just start the game with ANY two aliens they want. That combined with the ability to go first, will allow them to set up a nice protection against any kind of party that should come to free Han. Scum decks set up over this deck, so it also hurts the activation. Before, dark decks only played with a hand full of aliens that would provide you problems by them deploying for free to your Audience Chamber. Now, the Scum deck will convert both sites giving you only three force total to start with, as well as starting with Jabba the Hutt (V) and Lando (V) already on the table. Careful thought should be made when putting one of these decks together. <br />

<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay.<br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors. While this side up, you generate on more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4. Flip this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls few than three Yavin 4 sites. Place out of play if Yavin is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your total power +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is blown away, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponents Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter present with a pilot character aboard are each +2. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Great Shot Kid!, Squadron Assignments, Strike Planning, Luke Skywalker (V), R2 in Red 5, Advanced Preparation (V), lots and lots of Yavin sites and big starships. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Yet again, its a movie objective. This one has only gotten better as the game has continued. When it was release in 2000, it was a very very difficult objective to play out. It simply took too many card slots to just blow the Death Star, and almost non of them can be found. Plus, it deployed a lot of cards and had no form of retrieval. The fix the problems the deck had, four cards were made that completely change how effective the deck can be (Great Shot Kid!, Advanced Preparation (V), Rebel Tech (V), and Luke Skywalker (V)) All of these cards have helped to bring this objective back to the tournament scene, but now in 2005, the deck known as MBO is still not quite good enough to be consistently a winner because the whole game rest on how fast you can blown the Death Star. In order to blow the Death Star, you have to get Luke there, and that means if you want to deploy there directly, you have to have a spy ship. So you can play Blount and Cracken or just Tantive IV (V). Tantive IV (V), in my opinion, is the best chose because it only cost two, and it will add two to the force loss.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: The deck can win very easily once you blow the Death Star because when that happens, the darkside takes a BIG direct hit for 14 force. Many good dark decks deploy so many cards (CCT and Scum), giving them a lost that big can literally cripple them to the point of losing every game. After dishing out the damage, the fun begins. From then on out, one per turn you get to deploy ANY starship you want for free from hand or Reserve and also you get to retrieve 3 force EVERYTIME you deploy a starship thanks for Great Shot Kid. So Home One goes down for free, then gets killed, then retrieved, and played again for free. This deck totally rules the stars. You will be able to totally over power the darksides space no matter what deck they are playing leaving you solid +2 drains at systems with piloted starfighters. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: If built correctly and with a little luck, you can flip and blow the Death Star by second turn. That means you are hitting them for the 14 before they can even do anything to you. Then you spend the rest of the game, attacking their space and retrieving anything they deal you on the ground. This is probably the only deck where you really dont need to ever go to the ground once you have flipped. Because you space is so cheap, it doesnt matter as much to have to play for drains against Battle Order. The deck usually just plays with EPPs to strike a character on the ground and then get retrieved. If you want, you can play with the Forest to just pile all of the EPPs there so they have weapons and are completely immune to attrition. The deck can be very easy to play because you do the same thing every single game. Flip, blow up Death Star, and have fun. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: If the Death Star takes more than four turns to blow. You will almost always lose. The only way to win with this deck consistently is to build it to be very very fast. If you take too long flipping the objective and too long to get Luke over to the Death Star. Then the darkside is going to be draining and causing the key cards to fall into the lost pile. The main reason this deck is still not a top deck in tournaments is because it can be easily disrupted. Two cards really hurt this deck (Sense/Uncertain if the Future and Imperial Barrier). I cant tell you how many games I have played where I have everything I need to blow it and my opponent plays Sense/Uncertain to completely change my hand and force me to start all over. It also hurts when you are trying to flip, one of your guys gets Barriered at the docking bay, then beatdown next turn. What the deck needs is one V card that can prevent these two cards, or maybe one that prevents battle damage at non-battleground Yavin 4 sites when playing this objective. <br />
Practice is the key with this objective, so make sure you get lots of games before taking this one to a tournament. <br />

Game Text: <br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Chief Chirpas Hut (with Death Star Icon Luke and Lukes Lightsaber there), Endor: Landing Platform and I Feel the Conflict. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Alter, Strangle or Captive Fury. While this side up, your Force generation is +2 at Lukes site. While an Imperial is at Landing Platform, you may not Force drain or generate Force at Lukes location. When any Imperial is at Lukes site, Luke is captured (seized by an Imperial, if possible, even if not a warrior). Flip this card if Luke captured.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at end of each of opponents turns, opponent loses 2 force unless Vader is escorting Luke. At any time, an Imperial escorting Luke may transfer Luke to Vader, if present. Vader may not transfer Luke. Once during each of your turns, if Vader present with Luke (even as a non frozen captive), may shuffle Reserve Deck and draw destiny. If destiny >14, Vader crosses to Light Side, totally depleting opponents Life Force. Flip if Luke neither present with Vader nor a captive. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Version of Jedi Luke, power altering cards <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The first of its kind. An objective that can win the game the moment the seven side is completed. Basically, this objective has the ability to simply win the game if you can figure out how to win 4 battles and the opponent is playing with Vader. You can sometimes win with 3 if you get a good destiny but 4 is much easier (Unless Emperor Palpatine is present, then you need 5). A common mistake with this deck is forgetting to ask for the card to put on I Feel the Conflict once you are victorious in battle. Through the years, this objective has really not changed its strategy. Every version is built pretty much the same way. Common versions of this deck always try and find ways to alter power. It will be through total battle destiny, total power, or simply lowering the power of the opponent; anything to win the battle. Some of these cards include; Jedi Presence, I Cant Believe Hes Gone, Clash of Sabers, and Smoke Screen. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck wins only if it wins battles. Of course, there are many ways to do this, so you have to be smart with how you build a deck like this. One very popular way to help out in battle is to play with I Cant Believe Hes Gone. This Immediate Effect that is played once Obi is placed out of play. Then you get to add +5 in all battles at sites with just one force. This card is usually completed early with Balanced Attack finding Obi and then Obi-Wans Apparition (V) placing any Jedi just lost out of play. If Vader has Luke, and you have won the required number of battles, you get to shuffle and draw to win anytime you can during your turn. Its that simple. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: If you love to battle and be on the offensive side, rather than the standard defensive, which the lightside tends to prefer. This deck can literally pull out a win against a normally automatic loss. You get to start Jedi Luke with his stick before the game has even begun. Now that Qui-Gon and Mace (V) are around, you have two powerful characters that can be used to battle while Luke is captured. You want to force Vader to be deployed, so it is important to get to any Imperial on the table. If they are playing with no Imperials, then you can use Jedi Luke to battle the whole game. The new Luke, Rebel Scout (V) also makes this objective strong by forcing any Imperial on Endor to move towards Luke so that he must be captured.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The main reason not to play this deck is it completely relies on the opponent playing with Vader to have a good shot of auto winning. If you should come up against a deck like Scum that plays only aliens, all of those battles you win will mean nothing, and the aliens most of the time will have no problem simply killing Luke off the table. Not only that, but this objective has not been near as powerful with the creation of Darth Maul because he can be played in place of Vader as a character to just throw down and put Luke in lost pile. <br />

Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hutt Trade Route and a Jabbas Palace site. May deploy Yarna dal Gargan. Reveal one unique (.) alien from your deck whose lore specifies its species. This card is your Rep.<br />
For remainder of game, your Rep is a leader. Yarna dal Gargan is immune to Alter. You may not deploy insert cards or operatives. While a rancor is at Rancor Pit, Trap Door is immune Bo Shuda. Flip this card if you occupy two battleground sites (must occupy a third with a non-alien of your Reps species if a non-Tatooine locatin is on table).<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn you may cancel a Force drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep. Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Reps species. When two of your aliens are battling at any Tatooine location, add one destiny to total power. For remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand. Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 battleground sites. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Yarna dal Gargan (V), Bargaining Table (V), Ellors Madak (V), and aliens. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Alien based objective. For years, this objective was almost never played. It just didnt set up very well, and had very little staying power compared to other lightside decks. This all changed when V set 8 came out, providing 5+ cards (Tuskan Breathe Mask (V), Ellors Madak (V), Yerka Mig (V), Bargaining Table (V), and Yarna dal Gargan (V), plus many new aliens that help the deck). There cards completely changed the power of this deck, so much so that it got one of the cards an errata (TBM (V)). The new V cards made the deck so powerful that a lone alien that normally would have caused major overflow in turn absorb the damage and cause enough attrition to break through immunity. The deck was fast and ruthless allowing for huge retrieval and very very long staying power. It was truly the hardest deck to beat and earn a full win. The deck could literally find a way to stay alive when it looked as though it had been beaten. Even with the errata to TBM (V), the deck was still very powerful until V9 was released and created 3 new cards that countered the deck (Pinned Down (V), Dead Ewok (V) and Empire New Order (V)). <br />
<br />
How it can Win: The basic strategy of this deck with the new V8 cards was to flip first turn by pulling aliens with Bargaining Table (V) and Uh-Oh (V). Before the errata, you would put BoShuda on the Audience Chamber and with TBM (V) and Yerka Mig (V) there protected from ever being canceled (except Alter for YM (V)).  Ellor Madak (V) provided drain and destiny help by adding +2 to your Force drains and battle destiny drains and making the opponents destiny draws -2. TBM (V) provided the protection by adding 7 ability to every site, and allowing 7 battle damage to be ignored. The objective could not be flipped back with Yarna dal (V), which also protected BoShuda, creature attacks, and lets you pull any Tatooine location. Yerka Mig (V) would let you retrieve a force whenever you deployed a unique (.) alien to a battleground, so it even worked in space. From all of that, you can see how this deck could win almost every time. It was a machine pulling characters that would retrieve cards then go lost just to get retrieved later and then re-deployed all over again. The darkside had almost no way to hurt this deck. Beatdown was gone, and there was no way for any darkside deck to keep up with the loss of characters the same way this deck could. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The errata to TBM (V) changed the way the deck was played by forcing the lightside to put the effect on a battleground and protect it. But, the deck is still very powerful. It is still very easy to protect the effect. Most commonly, it is placed on the Cantina for a drain of 4 with Ellor Madak (V). You get 5 or so aliens there, and you are set. The deck is still very fast, and can be very hard to defeat in a timely manner. You also have a good chance that the darkside will not be playing ANY of the counter cards from V9. Deak Ewok (V) and Pinned Down (V) are truly just counters to this deck, so many chose not to play them because they dont help their deck strategy at all. They also believe the fear of the cards alone will be enough to warrant players not playing this deck. You as a player have a great opportunity to win by surprise just like players did with Odds back when the first counter cards for them were made. With that being said, even though the main way to play this objective was with the new V8 cards, you are not restricted to just playing with Aliens. The objective itself is still a good set up for a Tatooine Mains and Toys deck. It can pull all the locations you want, BoShuda cant be canceled, and all of your characters on Tatooine are protected from creatures. Ellor Madak (V) only requires that 5 different alien species be on table. Once that is completed, you can still get the bonuses from the card with Rebels and Jedi. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The main reason not to play this deck is because the counter cards DO exist. Before V9, you had a deck that was very powerful that the darkside could only play against and hope to come out on top. What the counter cards have done is create a simple way out for the darkside if they happen to play against this deck. So in the end, the chose will be up to you based on what you think will be played at the current tournament. If you chose to play the Mains and Toys version to this objective, you will not enjoy the power of TBM (V) to protect from beatdown, so by putting characters on the ground, you are still running the risk of a Scum deck coming over and winning with one battle. <br />

* Watch Your Step (NON V) (Smugglers)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Cantina, Docking Bay 94, and Tatooine system. <br />
For remainder of game, opponent activates no Force at your Cantina. Your cards with ability are deploy +6 except Luke, smugglers, freighters, and independent starships. Opponents game text on Kessel System is canceled. While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take Corellia or Kessel into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if you occupy two battlegrounds with smugglers or have completed two Kessel Runs. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your Force generation is +1 at each system you control with a smuggler. Opponents Force generation at non-battlegrounds is limited to 1. When you have two or more smugglers in a battle, add one battle destiny. Each of your smugglers is forfeit +2. Once during each turn, may play one interrupt from Lost Pile (then place that card out of play). Sense, Alter, and Keep Your Eyes Open may not be played. Flip this card if you do not occupy two battlegrounds (unless you have completed two Kessel Runs).<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Kessel, Version of Luke, lot of Smugglers<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objectives: The first lightside objective to restrict the use of any type of characters. Until this objective, all the objectives could be built with anyone. This one meant that Obi and Leia had to be left out of the mix. It was a very solid deck over the years becoming popular very quickly after its release. It is easily the hardest objective for the darkside to flip back, of the objectives that can be flipped back. The objective has so many things that it does to help the lightside and just completely hurt the darkside. If you play this deck, you have to get used to playing with only Smugglers and Luke, as well as a very limited amount of starships to chose from. That is where the real test begins because with this deck, you can be very powerful on the ground or in space, but it is very hard to control both areas. In the early days, the deck was built around space playing with Captain Han and sometimes putting Luke in space. Then the idea came about to play with non-unique Palace Raiders which could deploy as a react on transport vehicles and with the objective got 2 destinies when they got matched up with any other smuggler including another Palace Raider. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: It wins by utilizing all of the bonuses the seven side provides. Two smugglers get 2 destinies and have enough forfeit to keep from being beatdown. The objective causes the darkside game text of Kessel to be canceled, which makes it very easy to play Kessel Run over and over again. It can use cards like Nightfall to tech against specific decks like Walkers by allowing your Spies to deploy for free to that planet, so that means Boushh and Lando with Vibro Axe go down for free. Then you add Luke, Han with Gun or Chewie, Engraged to make for a very big beatdown. One of the strongest parts of the objective is completely preventing the darkside from getting to play Sense or Alter. Literally, one of the main reasons the deck continues to be a strong deck type.<br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: If you are looking for a different feel to a deck. This one is it. If you can stay flipped your opponent will not have an easy game. Decks like Huntdown and Walkers that play with a lot of non-battlegrounds really take a hit against this deck with the limit 1 force generation. The best version of this deck is the non-unique Palace Raider version, so you need to have a good collection of Jabbas Palace Sealed Deck. The Smugglers get really awesome bonuses with this deck, so you really have a solid format for a lightside deck.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: With the creation of WYS (V), the non V WYS is just not as strong. Plus the NON V version is not allowed to play with Qui-Gon, Mace (V), or Yoda. So the deck takes a back seat to others that can include all of those characters in their attack force against the darkside. Most of the time, this deck will be weak in one of the two areas of play. It is hard with the restrictions to have a powerful force in both space and on the ground. The deck is also very very open to Undercover spies because they dont get to play with Corran Horn. Although this objective is still strong. It is not the best chose for a lightside deck.  <br />

* Plead my Case to the Senate (Lightside Senate)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Galactic Senate and any other (Episode I) location.<br />
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability <4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. You may deploy cards on your Political Effects to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least one with a peace agenda) at Galactic Senate. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponents hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (+3 for any characters with an order agenda) when drawn for battle or weapon destiny. May use 2 Force at end of a turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 4 Queen Amidala, Ruler of Naboo, 8 to 10 other Senators at least 2 must be Senator Palpatine and one must be Mon Mothma (V), Strike Planning, 2 to 3 Might of the Republic, Threepio with Parts Showing, and four Political Effects. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Broken strategy that took a few years off, and has now been made strong again with the introduction of Mon Mothma (V). When the objective was first released, it was not that strong or even played that much. It was only after Reflections 3 that it became a super powerhouse with the introduction of Shields and Han, Chewie & the Falcon. The deck went on what seemed to be an endless winning streak that only seemed to stop when The Emperor (V) was released. This objective won worlds in both 2002 and 2003 defeating everything that came in its path. The only deck that had a chance against it was darkside Senate, though the lightside had an advantage with the Queen getting to be placed unlimitedly on a Political Effect as long as it was affecting separate actions (one per destiny draw and one per force drain). The deck was a machine that in itself was not an easy deck to play. The player had to be excellent at tracking and using Threepio with Parts Showing to time when Amidala was on the top. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This objective wins because with the Political Effects, it has the ability to alter whatever the darkside was doing. You can turn an Epp into a work horse attacking a site. You get at least a +3 to your draws and at least a -3 to theirs. It abused cards like A Jedis Resilience to get the Epps right back into hand for another attack. Han, Chewie, & the Falcon would hold a system draining for +2 and with the auto two destinies, always had a +6 to battle destiny. Specific senators while at the Senate would prevent the darkside from getting too powerful in space by either keeping the darkside from drawing too many destinies or Palpatine letting you add the power of one of the darksides destinies to your total power with just a force. <br />
   <br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The Emperor (V) made this deck very hard to win because he could drop down and just auto kill anyone who showed up. There was no way around this for years after he was released until Mon Mothma (V) came out in V set 9. She alone allows you to flip that much faster and prevents the Emperor from shocking anyone while she is there. If that wasnt enough, she also lets you pull a battleground, which before you had to draw or play cards that could pull them. Currently, it has been given a new birth in the tournament scene. Senate can be very hard to play against, and can stay alive for a long time altering what the darkside is doing. One up to date strategy puts Mace (V) at the Naboo: Core for a solid drain of 5 and the protection from any character that is ability <5. Other versions play with the Endor: Back Door and pull General Solo (V) to set up the Endor effects and wait for the darkside to make a move. So many different strategies with this deck make for a nice surprise to players that just came back to the game and are not familiar with how this objective plays out. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Because The Emperor (V) still exists, all the darkside has to do now is Set for Stun Mon Mothma (V) and then shock two characters away before she can come back down. The deck has no real protection from beatdown aside from playing with Houjix. A beatdown deck like Scum has all the tools necessary to beat this deck consistently. Another weakness this deck has is Monnok. Many times in a game, this deck will have doubles of Amidala in hand ready to be played on the Political Effects. Nothing hurts more then having to toss them to a Monnok lost played during the darksides control phase before they drain. On a side note to the weaknesses with this deck, the lightside Senate deck is THE MOST EXPENSIVE deck to build in the current SWCCG universe. Because the deck is made with a large majority of Coruscant cards, which is the RAREST set. You will be looking at throwing down a good amount of money if you didnt already own enough of the cards.   <br />

Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Wattos Junkyard, City Outskirts, and Credits Will Do Fine. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except unique (.) aliens, Republic characters and starships, and (Episode One) Jedi. Your Destiny is suspended. While this side up, once per game may take Coruscant and/or Tatooine system in hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may no deploy any systems. Maul is immune to attrition. Flip this card if there are 4 or more cards beneath Credit Will Do Fine. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your unique (.) Republic characters are power +1 and forfeit +2. Aliens may not have their deploy cost modified and Imperials deploy +1 to Tatooine sites. Whenever you draw battle destiny, may retrieve 1 force (Force retrieved in this way may be taken into hand.) While Queens Royal Starship at a planet system, once during each of opponents control phases may activate up to 2 Force. Once during each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground site you occupy with a senator.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: version of Qui-Gon, Mace (V), and random aliens and Republic characters. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective has not seen much action. Following the same trend as others before, the objective is too slow, and not that effective to be worth playing. The main idea is to get out a powerful Jedi, i.e Qui-Gon or now Mace (V) to the Junkyard and do what you can to keep the darkside off the site long enough for you to drain 4 times there or win enough battles so that you will collect cards on Credit Will Do Fine and flip to objective. Once flipped, it cant flip back, but doesnt really do that much to be worth it. There are a lot of cool things that the seven side could do, the main one is getting to retrieve a card directly into hand WHENEVER you draw a battle destiny. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck can win because the strategy of the objective is literally the easy one to play of all the objectives. All you have to do is out a good size party with Undercover protection and Tawss Khaa (V) at the Junkyard, and just hit them for 3 to 5 cards ALL game. That is it. You of course can build a version to do more than that, but you really dont have to. You are already hurting in both the space and ground departments, so the best way to build this deck is to base it around that lone strategy, any other will make it more difficult to win. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This is another one of those lightside objectives that has not seen much playing time at tournaments until the V cards have made it better. New V cards in the past few sets have made this deck a bit more appealing than before. Krayt Dragon Howl (V) is currently a new idea that allows you to start the game with ANY version of Obi you want with his matching lightsaber already at the Junkyard before you even start the game. Combined with the new Mace (V), this objective has now been given new life. A new Tech idea with this deck is to combine that old droid from premiere CZ-3, who lets you react by deploy CARDS, not just characters but ANY card you want at normal use of force. Then you can combine him with Dont Forget the Droids (V) to keep the darkside from getting ANY weapon or destiny draws in that battle. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The problem this deck has always had and continues to have is that is can lose to very specific deck types. Scum will simply beats down the Jedi that are trying to hold the Junkyard. SYCFA big blue will over power your space package. Combat prevents the drain, and just knocks the Jedi off the table. Huntdown can Duel off and cause direct damage all game. Walkers causes a lot of direct damage and plays on a totally different planet that never has to interact with Tatooine to win. The objective protects against Your Destiny with Luke not being able to be in the deck, but they still forgot about Agents of the Black Sun, which it doesnt protect from, so that deck hurts too. Some good players have won tournaments with this deck, but it was because they has been playtesting many different versions of this deck over the years and knew the best way to play against other decks. For the rest of us, it might be safe to play a better objective until more cards are made to help this deck out, mainly in the space department. <br />

* We Have a Plan (AKA WHAP)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Throne Room, Theed Palace Hallway, and Theed Palace Courtyard.<br />
For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except (Episode I) Jedi, aliens, (Episode I) vehicles, Republic characters, and Republic starships. Your Destiny is suspended. You lose no Force to Vengeance Of The Dark Prince. While this side up, you may not deploy characters to interior Naboo sites. Once per turn, may activate 1 Force. Flip this card if you control Theed Palace Throne Room (with Amidala there).<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you lose no more than 2 Force to any Force drain. Your independent starships are power +2 and immunity to attrition of droid starships is canceled. If opponent just drew a battle destiny greater than three, you may use 1 Force to cancel that battle destiny. During your control phase, opponent loses 2 Force for each battleground site you control with Amidala or Panaka. Flip this card if opponent controls Theed Palace Throne Room. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 4 Theed Palace Amidalas, 2 Panakas, some Episode 1 Jedi, Wokling (V), and Secure Route (V)<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Known to all as WHAP. When this objective was released, it was completely impossible to flip. The original designed forced you to deploy outside and then march in, usually taking 2 to 3 turns and this was all while the darkside had deployed a nice beatdown party to the Throne Room to wait for your arrival. So for years, it was just not played. Then the PC allowed the creation of Secure Route (V), which single handedly made the deck a tournament contender still being played to this day. Secure Route changed the way the deck flipped by allowing characters to deploy directly to the Throne Room and get a non character card back into hand whenever you deployed a Republic character to the same site. That meant that if the darkside didnt deploy to the Throne Room on their first turn, the lightside could now flip very easily first turn. Once you flip, the only way for the darkside to flip you back if they control the Throne Room. No easy task with Jerus Jannick protecting Amidala. He prevents any targeting of Amidala while he is with her, as well as acting as a Houjix at the site when he is forfeited.  <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck is very strong because of two parts of its seven side. One is never losing more than 2 to any force drain no matter what. The second is the ability to simply cancel ANY battle destiny that is greater than 3 with just a force. Combined with the direct loss of 2 with Amidala and Panaka, and the darkside is in for a long game. So, it is very hard to out drain them, and you cant beatdown with battle destinies. What is the darkside going to do now?? That is the question. If the darkside leaves Naboo alone, and they cant absorb indirect damage with Imperial Decree (V) or Imperial Propaganda (V), then they will almost always lose. It is very fast and plays cards like Civil Disorder (V) and Found Someone You Have (V) that work with Secure Route (V) to help keep characters and interrupts in the deck to be played over and over again. Once Amidala is protected by a Jedi and Jerus Jannick, she will almost never leave the table. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This objective is very different from others you might have played. It is all Episode I based, so you will not be playing with Luke or any other Rebels. Because of that, you will not be affected by any cards that hurt Rebels. Miiyoom Onith is almost useless against this deck, only getting the one or two male aliens that the deck plays with. The strategy of the deck is very easily to grasp because you pretty much do the same thing every game. Just get guys to Naboo and hang out. It is another light deck that just does its own thing and leaves the darkside to do theirs. Before V set 9 came out, many players were playing high drain decks at one site like the Maul deck or Bantha Herd (V). This objective would not be affected at all by those decks, so it was a very solid chose back then. Since the creation of Entrenchment (V) though, the lightside now has many ways to get around the high drain sites and dont have to look to this objective for safety. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The decks main weakness is in space. Many versions simply chose to not play with any space, so the darkside is left open to drain all game there with no problems. The few ships they do play have ok ability and are forced to stick together if they are to stay alive. Early attacks really hurt this deck. Maul with Stick early with the right cards can completely destroy the way this deck works. Getting knocked out of the Throne Room early will allow the darkside to pile up on the site and completely stop you from ever flipping again. Another weakness with this objective is it doesnt always do a lot of damage. All of the sites are drain one sites that relay on your bonuses to do any damage. The indirect can be gotten around with Imperial Decree (V), so if the darkside has any way to retrieve cards, they will most likely win the game. A TIE retrieval deck really gives WHAP problems because it has more space than it can handle as well as solid force retrieval all game. Of course, this deck is also weak to beatdown on the ground against Scum. I have heard of games ending in 10 minutes with the WHAP deck flipping first turn, and the darkside playing Ellis to get Jabba over to the Throne Room and beatdown the small group once Jannick was captured or his game text canceled.  <br />
<br />

* We&#39;ll Handle This (AKA Combat)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text: <br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Generator Core, Theed Palace Generator, and Inner Strength <br />
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain where opponent has a Dark Jedi, and your Force drains at Naboo sites where you have a Jedi may not be canceled. Once during your control phase, may target one opponents character present with your Jedi at an interior Theed Palace site. Target is lost. Flip this card if an opponents Dark Jedi is present at an interior Naboo battleground site. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you may not Force drain or initiate battle at any location where you have a Jedi. Once during your move phase, your Jedi may initiate lightsaber combat against an opponents Dark Jedi present: Each player draws 2 destiny. Loser (lowest total) loses 2 force (cannot be reduced). If difference is 5 or greater, lost Force must come from Reserve Deck, and losing character is lost. Flip this card and retrieve 1 Force if opponent has no Dark Jedi present at any interior Naboo battleground. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Qui-Gon, Jedi Master, Obi-Wan, Jedi Knight, Mace (V), and even more Jedi.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Combat was suppose to be the new dueling, giving both sides a way to knock off an opposing Jedi without having to battle. It was released in Reflections 3, the last objective to be release by Decipher before the license was lost. This one was a little broken when it was first released. It allowed you to have protected drains with your Jedi at already large icon sites at Naboo, but the broken part was that ability to make ANY non Jedi character present during the players control phase to simply be lost. That meant it didnt matter who was there, they were just lost. Sorry hope you didnt need that Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter there. So for the beginning of this objective, you pretty much had to play with Jedi in order to stand a chance against this deck. It went on that way until the PC created a shield to limit who was to be made lost by the objective. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (V) for darkside and Affect Mind (V) for lightside changed it so that only spies and droids would be lost during control phase, as well as preventing you from draining for too much by limited the force drains to only 2 if you have two or more Jedi at Naboo sites. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck wins because it has the ability to remove all the Jedi in an opponents deck and the solid Jedi power to hold the sites and drain the darkside for a lot. With the creation of Mace (V), Jedi Lightsaber (V) and Quick Draw (V), you can now play with 7 different Jedi and give them all a lightsaber that will never leave their deck. It is very easy to set up a lightsaber combat against a Dark Jedi. Inner Strength allows you to put any card you want under the Jedi that may later be used as the Combat destiny draw, so you are never initiating Combat blindly. It is almost an auto win every time. When the darkside loses the Combat, the Dark Jedi is lost a long with 2 force for top of reserve deck. If Qui-Gon, Jedi Master was the Jedi was initiated it, darkside has to lose an additional 2 force, meaning in one swift stroke, the darkside lost one of their Dark Jedi and 4 cards blind from the top. Thats pretty powerful when you think about it.  <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The strongest version of Combat is a strategy best known as a Shield Buster deck. Because there is a shield that hurts Combat, Pod Racing, Odds, etc, this objective made for a great idea to get some of your strategy through the shields. If you were to design the deck to start Pod Racing, you force the opponent to play their Reactor Terminal (V) or be hit with the 6 force loss as well as I Did It all game. They will have to play with their Combat Shield as well in order to keep from getting characters just made lost during their control phase. The other two slots will be up to the opponent to what they feel like stopping. If they want to make you pay for drains or retrieval, then Battle Order and/or Secret Plans need to come out. Then you also have the SAC that Combat plays with as well as wanting to play with your Grabber. Then, if that is not enough, the deck plays with ODDS!!!! Yep, once the darkside has thrown out their 3 or 4 Shields, and Mob Point Combo is not on the table. They will get a Never Tell Me the Odds put in your deck. With Jedi Luke having a 6 and Yoda, Master of the Force having a 4. All you need is to add a Lando, Scoundrel to push it over the top. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The two V cards have really put a damper on the Combat Objectives. They were once very very powerful, and now are just a random idea. Currently, it is just not one of the objectives that you can feel confident with all the time. Of course, I have to add that it is very weak to Scum beatdown. Also, two of the most popular V cards to date also have a very powerful part that protects them from Combat. Ability, Abiliy, Ability (V) for Darkside and Civil Disorder (V) for lightside both allow the player to simply lose 1 force to make a random Combat card LOST. A bunch of aliens who you cant stop or even Combat can come down with power 50+ and just wipe away any number of Jedi hanging out on Naboo. Maybe in the future, this objective will get a new birth and return to greatness. <br />

* Local Uprising (V) (AKA Speeders)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hoth, Echo Command Center, and Main Power Generators. May deploy Echo Base Garrison and/or Maneuvering Flaps.<br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Hoth Sentry or non-Hoth locations (except Rendezvous Point), and you may only play T-47 Formation twice. While this side up, once per turn, you may (deploy from Reserve) one exterior Hoth site or non-unique Rebel to Hoth. Flip this card during your move phase if your T-47s and/or non-unqiue Rebels control 2 exterior Hoth sites. Place out of play if 1st Marker blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, each time you must lost Force (except from your card, battle damage, or a Force drain at a battleground) it is limited to 1. Once during each of your control your control phase, opponent loses 1 Force for each marker site you control with a Rebel and a speeder. Flip this card if you do not control 2 exterior Hoth Sites. Place out of play if 1st Marker blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Commander Luke (V), General Rieekan (V), Romas (V), T-47 Battle Formation, Frost Bite (V), Maneuvering Flaps (V), Echo Base Garrison, any number of speeders from non-unique to Rogues 1-4.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: A PC created objective that had a very nice run for awhile. The whole time you hung out on Hoth, just doing your thing until you win. This objective is very easy to flip with a very solid 7 side. Basically, you flip by just controlling three marker sites with a speeder or non-unique trooper. This can be done very easily with Rieekan (V) and Commander Luke (V) both pulling cards that you use to flip. Once flipped, you just set up each marker site with a speeder and a rebel, because the objective will cause direct damage for each pair. With Frost Bite (V), you can retrieve force if the pairs are matching, like Luke on Rogue 1. The objective allows you to take ANY card you want into hand from reserve for just 2 force during you control phase. It also protects from random force lose by reducing any lose that is not a drain at a battleground, your card or battle damage by limited it to just one force. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck wins with very fast setup, protection under the shields, the ability to &#39;react&#39; the speeders, very high force loss with T-47 Battle Formation (which you can only play twice a game), always having the right card you need by searching during control phase, and many ways to set up steady retrieval (Frost Bite (V), Uh-Oh(V), On the Edge, etc). All you have to do is put Luke at the 4th marker, Wedge at the 3rd marker, and just drain, retrieve and wait. If the darkside left you alone, you almost always won. In most games, it will all come down to how long you can stay alive on the Hoth system. The best versions of this deck would be able to stay alive on Hoth the whole game. In order to win, you must hold presence at a system long enough to play both T-47s. If you lose Hoth early, most dark decks will not give you another system to occupy.<br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Well, in todays current environment, I can&#39;t really give a good reason to play this objective. This used to be in the top three decks to play for lightside until V set 8 came out and released J&#39;Quille (V), who I explained in the next section. Now in order to win, you have to design a version that can protect Romas (V) as well as prevent early death to Rieekan (V) or pray they don&#39;t have J&#39;Quille in their deck. The best thing that could fix the mess this deck is in would be to create a V card that could prevent the deployment of a spy to a site like an Ephont Mon for lightside.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: J&#39;Quille (V), who single handedly shutdown the deck. He is a spy that can deploy directly through the shields and allows friends to follow. He alone has put too much fear of beatdown for poor Romas (V) who must be at the War Room to lower the shields so T-47 can be played, and you can get around Come Here You Big Coward. It is clear that his creation was meant to completely stop players from wanting to play this objective. It may as well be the non V version of the objective. Its funny how they virtualized a dead objective only to turn around and make it dead again.<br />
<br />

<br />
* Watch Your Step (V) (Corellians) (AKA WYS (V))<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Corellia and one unpiloted freighter there, with a Corellian pilot aboard. May deploy Corellian Engineering Corporation and/or Leebo. <br />
For remainder of game Corellian locations are immune to No Escape and non-Corellians deploy +3 there. Your Force generation at Corellia system is +2. You may not play Tuskan Breath Mask, and your starfighters are defense value +2. While this side up, once per turn, may (Take Into Hand from Reserve) No Questions Asked, Kessel, or any <> site. You may not peek at cards. Flip this card if you occupy Corellia system and control 2 Corellia battleground sites. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your Corellian present with another of your characters at a site may be forfeited to satisfy all battle damage and attrition against you. Replace the word Audience Chamber with the word Corellia in Palejo Reshads game text. Once per turn may place one card from hand on top of Force Pile to draw one card from Reserve Deck. You may activate and retrieve 1 Force whenever you win a battle or fire a non-repeating weapon. Once per turn you may (deploy from Reserve) a Corellian, BoShek, or Kessel Run. Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 battlegrounds (opponent may retrieve any one card). <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Dash or a Han to start, No Questions Asked (V), and lots of Corellians.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The newest of all the objectives to hit the game. It was created at a time when the Darkside was ruling the game, having an almost unfair advantage in the game. What the PC decided to do was create an objective that was versatile to the current environment as well as a fresh idea to the game. With WYS (V), you get to start with a freighter and Corellian pilot already in play with Leedo aboard. That is HUGE because you get to start the game with a drain of 1 no matter what unless they chose to play a shield. When the objective was first released, it had to be clarified who was truly considered to be a Corellian, because many of the cards that are dont say it in the lore. Through rulings, it was made clear that ALL versions of Han Solo, Dash, and Wedge were to always be known as Corellians no matter what it says in their lore. Currently, it was also ruled that the seven side of the objective that allows you to Houjix when you lose a Corellian at a site that they are present with another character, be allowed when they are both on a vehicle or landed starship even though they are NOT present at the site. It is very easy to flip because you can do it many different ways. Some use Bargaining Table (V) to pull Laudica (V) and then use any number of different ways to get out the other character. Strike Planning can pull Madine who pulls Sergeant Buckman both of which are Corellians. They are the cheapest way to flip by only costing 4 force total, but you are open to attack from weapons and capture. I have even seen versions that will play with speeders and just flip and wait for them to come after them. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: The objective is super strong on the ground as well as in space. There are like 5 different ways to play with this objective that can still win. With the creation of the objective, they also made No Questions Asked (V), an Admirals Order from Reflections 2 that literally gives the lightside a strong defense in space by giving immunity, force generation, a destiny to power, and a +3 bonus to your total battle destiny. The card even provides a +1 force drain bonus to the Corellia sites. The objective allows you to activate and retrieve a force whenever you simply fire ANY non-repeating weapon as well as simply win a battle. The ability to activate a force is an auto tech against Secret Plans making you pay for the retrieval. NQA (V) and the retrieval combined with the new Entrenchment (V) provides an almost auto win to any game. The only thing you have to figure out is how you are going to do it. I have seen versions that stay in space and play Quad Laser Cannons. You could also set up the Back Door and play all of the Endor effects that can deploy there and protect the lightside from ground problems. They can be set up with Mon Mothma (V) and General Solo (V). There are even still versions that will not flip and simply use the objective as a vehicle for playing a space deck. They complete Kessel Runs, and play cards like Hit and Run to attack and then run away.  <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Currently the STRONGEST lightside objective to play with. It flips by second turn and is very hard to flip back. The +3 deployment to ALL characters deploying to Corellia that are not Corellians is almost broken keeping the darkside from almost never interacting with you on the ground. It is very fast causing drains of 3 to 5 almost from the beginning of the game. The objective has the best chance of beating Scum by having a solid space package as well as a built in way to get around the auto win beatdown on the ground. The platform makes it very easy to gain and keep Entrenchment (V), which alone can slow the darkside down to the point of almost no damage. So far, there has been no clear dark deck that can always beat this objective. The only way to beat WYS (V) is by playing with a lot of the cards that hurt it or simply the lightside player making a mistake. Those kind of odds make this objective currently the best chose for a light deck to play at a major tournament.  <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This deck can lose if two things happen. One is if NQA (V) is somehow kept off the table for most of the game. It is the most powerful card that the deck has, and must be taken out for the darkside to have a chance in space. This is most commonly done with Grand Admiral Thrawn allowing the darkside Admirals Order to get bounced into their hand and not go to their used pile. Second is you must invade Corellia and flip them back or set up a big battle on the ground that causes large overflow. This can only be done by separating the two characters at the site. Now most of the time, if they are not safe in a vehicle, then they will have defensive cards out to prevent a character from leaving the battle before they can be forfeited i.e. Klor Slug (V), Corellian Retort (V), I Wonder Who they Found (V) and so on. So the three most powerful cards that you have to look out for are Set for Stun, Hidden Weapons, and Boba Fett (V) from Special Edition. Both of which can remove a character from the site that are not weapons or things that are causing them to be lost. A vehicle will protect you from the Hidden Weapons and Fett (V), but the only thing you can do to the Set for Stun is play Inconsequential Barrier to cancel it. In most games, you will not have to worry about most of these things as long as you are prepared, but you must have all your weaknesses covered before you will have a solid victory. Oh, yeah and it helps if you remember to NOT leave Mace alone at a site against a Scum deck.  <br />

* Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi (AKA Huntdown)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Holotheatre and Visage of the Emperor. May deploy Meditation Chamber and/or Epic Duel.<br />
While this side up, during your move phase, may use 4 force to take Vader into hand from a location you control (cards on him go to owners Used Pile). Add 4 to each players destiny draw from Sense and Alter. <br />
Flip this card if Vader is at a battleground site and no Light Jedi or Luke is at a battleground site. Place out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponent cannot initiate battles or Force drains where opponent has a Jedi or Skywalker. You lose no Force from Visage of the Emperor. While Vader at Meditation Chamber, subtract 2 from each of opponents battle destiny draws. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter. Flip this card is opponent has Luke or a Jedi at a battleground site or if Vader is not on table. Place out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force Drain at an Executor site. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 4 versions of Vader, 2 to 4 Visage of the Emperor, 2 to 3 Darth Maul with Stick (or you can just play Darth Maul from Tatooine and get him in space) 2 Zuckess in Mist Hunter, 2 Bossk in Hounds Tooth, 1 to 2 Mauls Sith Infiltrator and No Escape<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: A truly timeless darkside objective. It was released in 98 and still continues to be a very solid chose for a good darkside deck. All of this time, this objective has been the longest lasting of all of the darkside objectives. Like other powerful objectives, it continues to evolve and change to fit the current playing meta. No matter what expansion that Decipher released, or what V cards were made, it just didnt matter. So many different versions have been made of this objective. In the beginning, the hardest part was trying to find a site fast enough to put Vader at before you lost too many cards to Visage, with the ability to find docking bays with Imperial Arrest Order, the deck become much faster and more reliable. Then the introduction of Darth Maul with Stick gave the deck the extra attack force it was previously lacking. The main reason for this deck been so powerful is that it directly attacks the strongest characters the lightside has. The original dueling version that uses Epic Duel could place both Obi-Wan and Luke out of the game, leaving the lightside with only Leia as a power character. It stayed this way for years, until the release of Qui-Gon and now Mace (V). With the lightside having multiple Jedi to play with and attack with, the dueling part of the Objective has become less powerful. So for the past year or so, the best versions of this deck have been built around simply battle and direct damage from Visage. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck has always been strong because it prevents the lightside from playing Sense and Alter (the same way Mind What You have Learned Does for lightside), it causing direct damage at the end of BOTH turns with Visage, and gives no icons to the lightside to start the game. The most powerful versions of this deck either play with Imperial Arrest Order Combo to pull docking bays for the battlegrounds and activation or they start Conduct Your Search to pull the Endor: Back Door as well as Blast Door Controls to cancel Rebel Barrier. Both version have the good things and their bad things. The docking bay version allows for you to play with all docking bays that have very high cost to transit away from them once the lightside has deployed there. You can play with cards like Put All Sections on Alert that work at your Executor sites and Death Star sites to cancel a Rebels game text and prevent them from drawing battle destiny. All in all, the deck has very very good destinies. Usually playing 2 I Have You Now, to beatdown on Luke or other Rebels, so they will stay off of the table. Many times, this deck will win by simply getting a few good beatdowns against the lightside for high overflow, then the Visage will finish them off. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Always a good chose. You will not feel bad about playing this objective if you really know how it works. The strategy follows a very simply pattern; battle, battle, battle, then drain and let Visage do the rest. You are playing with usually all high power characters and vehicles. The destiny is high, so most of the time, just having a character that can draw destiny and absorb some attrition is all you need. It helps to be a very good tracker with this deck, because once you find a 7 or 6, you can track it all game to get the maximum damage in any battle. Always a good idea to throw 2 Janus from Death Star II to allow you to put those high destinies back in the deck, and then get a new card into hand from Reserve, much like Mirax does for lightside. Anyone who can understand how this objective works, and set up some good battles on the ground, will have no problem winning with this deck.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This deck can give you instant victory, or an auto loss. It all depends on how you play with it and how long it takes you to find your Vaders. The key to any version of Huntdown is to get Vader out ASAP. The longer he takes, the longer your deck kills you. If it takes you 10 turns to get him out, then you would have lost 20 total cards all because of your own card. Like most popular decks, this deck has a few weaknesses to some things that other decks can do. The biggest weakness for Huntdown is its space package. Because of the importance of good destinies, and the use of card slots for the ground, there is not much room for a lot of space. The standard for Huntdown these days will include 2 Zuckess in Mist Hunter, 2 Bossk in Hounds Tooth, and either 1 or 2 Mauls Sith Infiltrator. Most of the time, you are just going to have to pay for drains on the ground, and keep the space in hand until late game. If you come up against a total space deck like Hidden Base, then you get Maul in space on his ship to quickly find the hidden base and block a system. Most of the time though a space deck will beat this objective because it just doesnt have enough room to be affective on both the ground and in space. <br />

Game Text: <br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Carbonite Chamber, Carbonite Chamber Console and Security Tower with a Rebel (opponents choice) from opponents Reserve Deck (if possible) imprisoned there. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy from Reserve Deck one Audience Chamber, Docking Bay 94, or East Platform; reshuffle. You may not play Dark Deal. Flip this card if you move a frozen captive to Audience Chamber (or if no Rebel was in opponents Reserve Deck at start of game).<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your aliens and independent starships are immune to attrition <4 and, once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve 1 Force. While you have a frozen captive at Audience Chamber. Scum and Villainy is immune to Alter and during your deploy phase, you may deploy Scum and Villainy from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Place out of play if there are no frozen captives on table (unless no Rebel was in opponents Reserve Dec at start of game). <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Special Delivery (V), Kuat Drive Yards (V), Executor, Mob Points Combo<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective has slowly gotten better over the years. It was one of the first 5 that the darkside had back in 98, and at the time was not the most powerful chose. As time pasted, the introduction of more powerful characters has made the objective a good format for a Mains and Toys deck, but it was still way too hard to flip, because at the time, it was way too hard to successfully freeze the captive that was given and then also get them to the Audience Chamber. Then Reflections 2 introduced Jabbas Prize that allowed you to put a frozen version of Han already in jail. This got around having to freeze anyone, and also took Han out of their deck. Combined with getting to pull your Lando and deploy them in space to prevent the lightside from playing there Lando, you put the opponent at a disadvantage. As time pasted, cards like They Must Never Again Leave This City from Reflections 3, Special Delivery (V), Kuat Drive Yards (V), and Despair (V) have made CCT one of the strongest and most powerful decks to be played. Its awesome power lasted for most of 2003 and 2004, until V Set 8 released Thrown Back (V) and Drop (V), the new starting effects that allowed the opponent to activate and draw a card every time you took a card from Reserve. This really hurt CCT at its peak because it usually searched 4 to 5 times in the first turn, and then continued to search 2 to 3 times each turn after that until mid-game. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck can win by setting up a Free Executor and Lando (V) first turn every game. Then the deck continued to pull each card that was in the deck with Special Delivery (V) deploying any Effect and Flagship (V) letting you take any Admiral or card with Executor into hand during both turns. It sets up systems with Kuat Drive Yards (V), and gets a bonus +2 drain on the ground with Despair (V), which also prevents the objective from being placed out of play. Because the deck can just find itself, it made for a very solid reactive deck to any and all lightside decks that would come against it. You can even play with IG-88 (V) and search your Force pile each turn for a card like Keeping the Empire Out Forever does with QMC. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Even with the new starting effects, the deck is still a good chose to play for dark side. Getting to take away both Han and Lando before the lightside can even have a turn is very strong. Plus you get out the strongest ship the darkside has for FREE every game. Currently, many light decks are using General Solo (V) to set up the Back Door and pull the new Endor effects from V set 9. CCT is an almost auto counter to this strategy by removing the main character that is needed. You can even design a version to remove every main character the lightside has. One great combo with this deck involve Lando (V) and Hidden Weapons, which is now an AUTO capture card. All Too Easy can auto freeze one of the Jedi that comes to the ground against you, and you still have the Circle is Now Complete to make Obi out of play. Combined with good space, you have a very good deck to play.<br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This deck does search for A LOT, so what was once a powerful set up, has now become a solid set up that will give the lightside 5 extra cards in their opening hand as well as a 5 more cards in their force pile helping them setup that much faster. The deck also deploys A LOT of cards. The ability to simply find any Effect you want to deploy makes for an average game with CCT playing 8+ effects on the table. Many games with this deck will not win by more than 25 because it simply cant. If you chose to play CCT, you need to make sure you dont get hit for a large force loss early. Any large overflow or big drains will kill this deck fast, so you have to make sure you dont throw out too many effects that you may not need in every game. Save them for cards to lose, and only play the cards that do the best damage to the strategy you are playing against. Also, mid to late game, use one of the Objective searches first before you chose to deploy an effect with SD (V). That will save you from getting out cards that you dont really want because the one you were searching for was in your force pile.   <br />

* ISB Operations<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any Coruscant location.<br />
For remainder of game, your characters with ISB, Rebel, or Rebellion in lore are ISB agents and spies, and may deploy regardless of deployment restrictions listed in their game text. Flip if ISB agents control at least two Rebel Base locations or if four ISB agents are on table.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one ISB agent. When you have a non-Undercover ISB agent at a battleground site, your Force drains are +1 there and opponents Force drains are -1 at same and related locations. Flip this card if no ISB agents are on table. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Standard cards in every version: Death Star Droid from Premiere, 8 to 10 ISB agents<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective was the first to cause all the players in the game to start reading all of the lore on the cards to see which characters got to be ISB agents. In the beginning, this objective was very popular, because it was also the first deck that could beat operatives even before it got the major errata. It was a way the darkside could keep characters in their deck all game by getting to retrieve one during your draw phase. Besides operatives, it was good against Tatooine drain decks, and any deck that used speeders because all you had to do was put the Death Star droid out on one of the sites, and it would be safe from battle and just make all of the drains on that planet -1. If it got killed off, then you just retrieve it next turn and redeploy it. This was the objective that made Outer Rim Scouts so valuable because you could build a very solid ISB deck that played anywhere from 6 to 10 of them in one deck. They all drew destiny on their own, were aliens that could be found and targeted for retrieval with Abyssin Ornament. Combined with a good space package, the deck remained solid for years until the game got to the point of being to fast for ISB to keep up. Currently, there has only been two V cards (Tarkin (V) and Frozec (V)) that helped out ISB. The objective is not as popular because it is too slow in getting set up and doesnt have the power set up as other darkside decks.  <br />
<br />
How it can Win: The strongest part of ISB is you have the power to completely SHUTDOWN the force loss the lightside is causing from drains on the ground. The Death Star droid is the most powerful card in the deck, because it is the key to slowing down the lightsides drains. If you can set up Imperial Decree in space by controlling Yavin 4 and Hoth, then the lightside will have NO drains. It also has the ability to build a deck that can throw down many characters for free with Sunsdown on the planet because all spies deploy for free. This can be done very easily now with Crossfire (V) allowing you to just find the Sunsdown from Reserve. The darkside in general has an advantage in space, so combined with the bonuses of this objective, you can play a deck that is very hard to beat. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The only version currently worth playing with sets up the Free Executor by starting Were the Bait (V), Kuat Drive Yards (V), and Mob Points Combo. Then after the Executor was deployed, the space ISBs went there, while the rest of the deck was spent blocking drains on the ground, and purely fighting in space. Of course, that was in 2004, and The Professor (V) puts a big damper on this set up by making you save up at least one turn to pay for the 8. ISB is not usually a very good idea for a ground based deck because of the activation problem, so if you chose to play it, make sure you are sticking to space. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Until this deck gets some help with activation, it is not going to be the best chose for a dark deck. The objective compared to others has the smallest amount of text, so it is very basic to what is does. With the ability to play decks that give you 8 and 9 activation first turn. The chose to play ISB is not an easy one. I believe this deck will return to greatness, but until then. I would keep it in the binder. <br />

* Ralltiir Operations (AKA Ral Ops)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Ralltiir system<br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy from Reserve Deck to Ralltiir one site or non-unique Imperial; reshuffle. At Ralltiir locations, each Rebel is deploy +2. Flip this card if Imperials control at least three Ralltiir sites and opponent controls no Ralltiir locations. Place out of play if Ralltiir is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. At Ralltiir locations, each Rebel is deploy +2. At all locations, add X to your total battle destiny, where X = number of Ralltiir locations your Imperials occupy. Once during each of your control phases, you may use 2 Force to take any one card into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if opponent controls at least two Ralltiir locations. Place out of play if Ralltiir is blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: <> sites, AT-STs, any different types of Imperials<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: At one point, this objective was THE most popular to be played for darkside. Its run lasted from 99 through most of 01. Only after more powerful Episode I ideas came out was this deck considered to be a weaker chose. Though it never won a Worlds title, this objective was played religiously by all different kinds of players. It was a very solid strategy that could set up pretty fast and was very hard for the lightside to counter. Onnea Tha also made this deck much hard for the darkside to stop the lightside characters from deploying fast to the planet. Once the game because faster, with the lightside getting more powerful characters and starships like Qui-Gon and Dash in Outrider. This deck just seemed to lose its power. For the past years, it was only being played by those who still long for the old times, and build versions that seem to look good on paper, but in the end lose to the many lightside cards that get around the once strong defense that the objective provided. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: Must like WYS (V) is now, the objective used to make it very hard for the lightside to deploy a very good squad to attack the Imperials on Ralltiir. In the old days, it would take a good 3 turns before the lightside has enough force to deploy and stay alive on the ground on Ralltiir. The objective provided all that was needed to flip by second turn usually, and deal out a good amount of damage on the ground if you played with Overseeing it Personally and the Emperor. The bonus to all battle destinies made the darkside a powerful force in battle. Also, the ability to take ANY card you want during your control phase gave the deck a nice reactive power to play against any lightside strategy. The original designs of this deck would pull one the <> docking bay with Imperial Arrest Order, get out AT-STs that could react to each other at the sites, and usually put a few AT-ST pilots on board for extra help. The rest of the deck would just battle and drain until it had broken through the lightside strategy and won the game. The objective was very very hard to flip back once it was flipped. The only problem now is all of the objective powers are no longer that strong. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: With the introduction of V10, Insignificant Rebellion (V) has now given new light to this objective. It provides protection from Onnea Tha, which had been turned into a Shield for the lightside to always have at their disposal. The greatest part of the card is the ability to activate 3 Force whenever you deploy a site to Ralltiir. This greatly helps the set-up of this deck by giving you more help from the originally port activation. As an added bonus, you also get to exchange any card in lost with a different card of the same type from hand whenever you draw battle destiny. This new strategy combined with the ability to find any card you want during your control phase should make for some very powerful combos. Since the new V card has just been released. It is too early to tell rather or not IR (V) will be strong enough to bring this objective back to a top tear dark deck. The best way I have found to set this deck up is to start Aratech Corp (V), Mob Points Combo, and IR (V). This set up will allow you to easily flip first turn if you can the three sites out. You can pull Carida for more activation and them a battleground planet so you wont have to pay to drain. Then sack the Combo to pull Imperial Arrest Order (NON Combo) to pull that docking bay. You play with the non combo because you are playing with so many pilots that are ability <2 that you get more from the +2 to forfeit. The Aratech Corps (V) will get any pilot out fast on an AT-ST which can also have ability so, if you play with enough of both. Your opening hand should have enough stuff to always flip first turn. The hardest part will be getting that last site out before they deploy and prevent this. If you cannot flip the same turn you play the sites. You will most likely not be able to flip. So you are forced to play with 4 to 5 sites. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This objective may start to become good again, but it will all depend on what players are able to do with IR (V). The lightside can activate 8 force during their first turn. Put down Mace (V) for 6 which goes right through your objective and Bad Feeling Have I. He is immune to attrition and gets to use his lightsaber twice. So combined with Quick Draw (V), he alone would easily kick the crap out of two AT-STs that were trying to hold the sites. Ralltiir only gives up just 1 icon to you, so if the lightside gives you none like against TRMs, you will only get 2 Force first turn. So, nothing is going out that turn, unless you are able to play 3 sites in one turn giving you an additional 9 force. If you put out a site with the objective, the lightside is just going to deploy there during their turn and you will never be able to flip. Plus, most of the time, all the lightside has to do to prevent you from flipping is put a ship like the Outrider from Corellia in a WYS (V) decks or just play Tantive IV (V) to turn the system into a battleground and drain for 2. That means in order to flip you would have to also have a ship to deploy there so they dont control the system. This can be scary if they Barrier the ship and kick the crap out of it during their turn. It may turn out to not be that big of a deal, but only time will tell with this objective.<br />

<br />
<br />
* Imperial Occupation (Non V) (AKA Operatives) <br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any planet system and one <> site to that system. This system is the Subjugated planet.<br />
While this side up, once during each of the deploy phases, you may deploy one <> site to the Subjugated planet from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if your matching operatives control at least three battlegrounds sites related to the Subjugated planet. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. You may retrieve 1 Froce whenever you deploy a matching operative to the Subjugated planet. Your matching operatives on that planet are each forfeit +2 and, when at same site as an Imperial or AT-AT, are each power +2. When you have at least one matching operative in a battle on the Subjugated planet, you may add one battle destiny. Flip this card if you do not occupy at least two battleground sites related to the Subjugated planet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: A very stupid idea. At first, the idea was to play a deck with 25 of your planets operative because they were broke on their planet. Basic it worked like this. Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all lightside drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against a Rebel. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game.<br />
<br />
SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created 3 cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that they wish they had never made. It won the &#39;98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Endor Operations (AKA Endor Ops)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Endor system, Bunker and Landing Platform.<br />
While this side up, once during each of your control phases, may take one Ominous Rumors or Establish Secret Base into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are both on table. Place out of play if an Endor location is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at each Endor site where you have a biker scout or a piloted AT-ST, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent, except by a react. Opponent draws no more than one battle destiny in each battle. Your AT-STs are immune to attrition <3. Once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one biker scout. Flip this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are not both on table. Place out of play if an Endor location is blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Endor sites, Ominous Rumors, Establish Secret Base (V), AT-STs, and a few biker scouts. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Originally a very difficult objective to stay flipped because it was not that hard for the lightside to get rid of one of the Effects that you needed to stay flipped. Because of that, for years this objective was only used as a platform for playing star destroyers in space. Many versions would never play with any addition ground sites, and just use the bonus drain from Ominous Rumors to drain at Endor and another system. Many common versions would call it Endor Ops Big Blue because so much of the deck had big blue Star Destroyers, and AT-ATs to hold the docking bay for the extra drain. As the strategies for darkside changed though, this objective became less and less popular. It stayed in the binder for a good 3 years until recently in V set 9. The deck was given a large number of cards that gave this deck a new life. More than half the darkside cards in V set 9 were designed for this objective; the main ones being Establish Secret Base (V) and Empires New Order (V). They even made it much harder for the lightside to flip the objective back. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: With the new V9 cards in effect now, the deck has a new strength to it. It can set up much faster now, and for every site that you have a scout or AT-ST at, they will not generate form the icons. So if you do play with this objective, you will not be giving up that much force to the lightside. Many of the Endor locations have a +1 drain, which provides Endor with a great platform for large drains. You also have the Back Door which is always a 2/2 site. Once flipped, the objective is protected against cards that cancel your drains and you also gain immunity and the ability to retrieve a biker scout each turn. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This objective has many new ideas that can now be played with it. It still has not been explored to its fullest, so currently, I dont have a good strategy for this deck. The best versions always use AT-STs to react to each other, and gain additional power from the new effects. They even made an AT-ST Cannon (V) to give them an attack factor. The deck is still not powerful because of one lightside card that just shutsdown the ground forces. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The introduction of Quick Draw (V) gave the lightside the ability to target vehicles with their many lightsabers. Mace (V) now has the power to take out all of the AT-STs in an Endor Ops deck and not even think twice. With AT-STs being the only solid way to set up Endor Ops, the objective is still too scary to play with in a major tournament. Maybe in time, there will be a new strategy to this objective that can be played successful.  <br />

* This Deal is Getting Worse All the Time (AKA TDIGWATT or Dark Deal Objecitve)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy one Cloud City battleground site. May deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases may take Bespin system, Bespin: Cloud City, Dark Deal or Cloud City Occupation into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Cloud City, Jabbas Palace, and Special Edition characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay when deploying to Bespin locations. Flip this card if Dark Deal on table and you occupy Bespin system and Bespin: Cloud City. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, Surreptitious Glance may not cancel Dark Deal. The Planet That Its Farthest From is suspended if targeting Bespin. Opponent loses 8 Force when you play All Too Easy. At each Bespin location you control with an Imperial, your Force drains may not be modified by opponent. If you have an alien/Imperial pair in battle, your total battle destiny is +2 (or +4 if alien is an Ugnaught). Flip this card if Dark Deal is canceled, if opponent controls Bespin system or if Bespin is blown away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Im Sorry, Executor, They Will Never Again Leave this City, and characters that can draw destiny on their own. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: When the Cloud City set first came out, one of the most popular cards for the darkside was Dark Deal. It was a new strategy that was introduced as the darksides version of EBO, equally having to control a number of locations before it could be played, and then the opponent having to occupy a number of locations to cancel it. Just like EBO, it was very hard to set up fast because back then, you had to draw the sites, the TIE, and the effect. Because of the overwhelming love for this effect, this objective was created to allow the darkside to set up this strategy much faster, and have the ability to keep it longer. The objective finally pulled everything that you needed to flip BUT two more sites. So even though you could play this objective, it was still not as fast as it should be. Then when the Tatooine set was released, the Im Sorry effect provided the last piece of the puzzle by letting you pull two Cloud City interior battleground sites once per game. Finally you could play this objective and set up Dark Deal to get a bonus in both power and drain usually be second or third turn. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck wins by setting up both Dark Deal for +2 drains at the sites, as well as deploying the Free Executor at Bespin with TWNALTC to set up Cloud City Occupation for additional direct damage. With the objective, Dark Deal can only be canceled if you occupy 5 Cloud City locations, so the ONLY way to get ride of it would be to have enough characters to put at all 5 locations that you have played, not an easy task at all. As soon as Dark Deal is in effect, you will cause very high and fast damage to the lightside that they will have to counter fast in order to stay alive. Many versions played with AT-ATs to hang out at the Downtown Plaza, and then powerful immune characters to control the other sites. This deck is a power offensive deck that attacks fast and battles rather than drains and runs away like QMC. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: For years this deck was a very good chose for darkside only losing if the lightside could figure out how to get around the drain bonus usually with Jedi Test 1 or Menace Fades. With the introduction of Tawss Khaa (V) and Bane Malar (V), (characters that stop drains on planet sites from being canceled or modified), the lightside stopped playing with Menace Fades and any testing deck would auto lose because they had no way to stop the large drains that Bane (V) protected. So during that time, this deck was still a great chose for darkside as it would play against decks that had no way to counters the drains unless they were very lucky at clearing the Cloud City sites or were the rare players who still included Menace Fades as defense this specific objective. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play: With the introduction of Entrenchment (V) in V9, all drain bonus decks took a big hit. Currently it is way too hard to play this objective and hope to win against any deck that plays Entrenchemt (V). Only if you could up the space package to the point of being able to block the systems they controlled long enough to get a few large drains through would you be able to play this deck and win. That in itself is not a solid strategy to play with. So until a better counter comes to get around the power of Entrenchment (V). The Dark Deal deck has now become a thing of the past.  <br />

* Court of the Vile Gangster (AKA Court)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text: <br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Audience Chamber, Great Pit of Carkoon and Dungeon. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one docking bay or independent starship from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Bounty hunters are forfeit +2 and immune to Goo Nee Tay. You may not play Scanning Crew. Each player loses 1 Force at end of each of their deploy phases unless that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine battleground site. Flip this card if you have two captives (or a captive of ability >2 at any Jabbas Palace site(s)<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy Sarlacc, Rancor or Rancor Pit from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Captives targeted by Trap Door are immediately relocated to Rancor Pit (do no draw destiny) and Trap Door may not be canceled. Opponent loses Force equal to forfeit value of each opponents character eaten by a Rancor or Sarlacc (place that character out of play). Flip this card if you have no captives at Tatooine sites and opponent has no characters at same site as Rancor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: cards that capture, any number of good bounty hunters and aliens, Rancor or Sarlacc<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The classic capture objective. This deck was made and groomed to be the best objective for playing with Bounty Hunters who want to capture. The whole idea of the objective is to capture a guy and then feed them to one of your creatures. To help with this, the objective will cause a 1 card direct damage loss until the lightside finally puts a guy on a Tatooine site. Whenever you finally feed someone to either the Rancor or the Sarlacc, the character is placed out of play, the lightside loses Force equal to the forfeit of the character eaten, and the Rancor Pit lets you retrieve Force equal to the same Forfeit. At first, this was not that easy because the lightsides Epps could easily cut through the Bounty Hunters that were trying to capture. Only after the V cards were made that this objective gained a lot of momentum. Cards like Jabbas Influence (V) to pull aliens and make your Bounty Hunters power +2, Lando (V) to auto hit with Hidden Weapons, and Krayt Dragon Bones (V) which allowed you to keep those creatures under your Starting Effect (Fear is My Alley) as well as add two additional Ferocity to the Rancor making him a 10 plus destiny. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This objective is the HIGHEST retrieval deck for the darkside that you could play. It wins very easily if the lightside has to play on Tatooine in order to play their strategy; i.e. Profit, Watch Your Step (NON V), Hyperdrive, and NON-Hyperdrive. It is SO easy for you to both capture and feed really any character to the Rancor or Sarlacc that the lightside will lose if they put someone on the ground early. Only after this deck has lost too many key cards will it be safe for them on the ground. The other bonus to this deck is it can pull all of your independent starships from Reserve, so you are not weak in space either. The introduction of all of the new V8 cards, ( Jabba the Hutt (V), Hutt Bounty (V), and URURURURUR (V)), this objective became another excellent deck for darkside. The only problem was you had a chose whether to play with this or just set up Combat Readiness (V) and play the very popular Scum deck that I have probably mentioned a good 10 times now. It all comes down to if you want to win through capturing or simple beatdown. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The ability to capture is a very very powerful aspect for the darkside. With characters like Mace (V) and Qui-Gon who are completely immune to attrition, it is nice to be able to just take them away from the lightside. Then go on to retrieve force and place them out of play. Even though Scum beatdonw is faster, it can be gotten around with Houjix and WYS (V). Capturing is an easier idea by only have to get one guy and then eat them. When Agents was big a few months ago, this deck was not as strong because you were not able to feed them to the Rancor, but now that Agents has been almost killed with the V9 cards. This objective is a solid chose for any darkside player.   <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The biggest weakness this deck has is the space because it is meant to be a ground based deck. The space package in general in this deck is meant to be for defensive aspects for playing against Hidden Base or the Kessel drain in TRMs. WYS (V) has now become a very powerful space deck for the lightside, so much so that there is no way for this deck to win against a solid WYS (V) deck. They can absorb the 1 Force loss and just get it back with Flash of Insight (V), so they never have to come to Tatooine. If they play with vehicles on Corellia, you will not be able to capture, unless you can get them through All Wrapped Up after they forfeit the Corellian. You also have to play your <> docking bay to Corellia so you can drag them back to the Rancor pit. All the while, the deck is draining in space and killing all of your starships with NQA (V) and the Quad Laser Cannons. <br />

* Set Your Course for Alderaan (AKA SYCFA)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Death Star and Alderaan systems and Docking Bay 327. <br />
For remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth, or a Subjugated planet. While this side up, one during each of your deploy phases, may take one card with Death Star in title into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may not Force drain at Alderann system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled. Flip this card if Alderaan is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 Victory-Class) to Death Star system. Your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +1 (or +2 if that Star Destroyer is Imperial- or Super-class). If Yavin 4 system is blown away. Adds 3 to Force lost for each opponents Yavin 4 site. Place out of play if Death Star is blown away. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 2 Emperor Palpatines and/or Darth Sidious, lots of starships<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is another movie objective. It allows you to literally recreate the blowing of Alderaan. The deck can be built many different ways. When it came out, it was built as a Mains and Toys platform because at the time, it provided the largest amount of activation of any darkside deck, and allowed you to pull additional site for even more activation. With the introduction of V cards, the deck became even more powerful with the creation of Fear Will Keep Them In Line (V). It deploys on the Death Star and deals out direct damage of 2 for each battleground system you control with a Star Destroyer. When building this deck, you have to decide if you want to flip or not. You can play FWKTIL (V) either way, so it really comes down to if you want to include the cards that are used to blow Alderaan or not. If you decide not to flip, you have the ability to play a total space deck without ANY ground because you can simply TECH Battle Plan. This is done through the 0 side of the objective keeping you from taking ANY battle damage. So as long as you are immune to attrition, the only way for the lightside to kill you is if they are able to hit you. Since you are playing with both Emperor Palpatine and Darth Sidious, if you put in a few Force Fields, you will never have to worry about the ground. If you do decide to flip the objective, you will lose the auto Tech around Battle Plan, but gain many bonuses in space. The biggest beginning the +2 to Force drains at systems you control with a Star Destroyers. If you combine this with FWKTIL (V), you can deal out MAJOR damage with little fear of beatdown. <br />
<br />
How it can WIN: This deck wins by setting up Star Destroyers at system to drain and play FWKTIL (V). If you do play with FWKTIL (V), you will not be able to play with Kuat Drive Yards (V) to pull the systems. To find the systems you have two chooses. One is playing with Voyeur (V) to system deploy any battleground or you can play with Commander Merrick who can simply pull the systems. Once the systems and Destroyers on in place, there is nothing left to do but wait. If the lightside is not playing with much space, you should have an easy victory. If they have a light space package of only Home One, Tantive IV (V), 1 or 2 Bright Hopes, and maybe a Spiral. You should be able to set up a beatdown with Lateral Damage, the Tractor Beam, Relentless Pursuit, etc. There are many very powerful cards that can help your Destroyers to deal out big overflow in space. The only thing that stunk about them is they are very high to deploy. Well, they used to be until V9 put out Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V), which allows your (.) unique Imperial Class Destroyers to deploy -2 making them a lot easier to get out. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Star Destroyers can be a very powerful force. You can set them up to be really high power with Inconsequential Losses (V) and Motti (V). If you can get out Motti (V), he makes all your Star Destroyers with a weapon power +7. If you play with Heavy Turbolaser Battaries, which deploy for free with IL (V), they will add an additional +2 power. So for only 5 Force, you can play Tyrant for power 15 or Thunderflare for power 16. If you add a pilot for more power and forfeit, you will have a solid ship that can hold a system long enough for friends to help out. This objective is also an excellent platform for play with TIEs. You can now use Mob Points Combo to pull Walakewi and then sack it to pull Crossfire (V) to pull Sienar Starfleet. A TIE retrieval deck can work very well too by consistently getting back the TIEs that were lost by simply deploying more. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: This deck can lose for many different reasons. The most common way is usually because it takes too many high drains on the ground early while it is still trying to set up. Many lightside decks these days can set up with drains of 3 and 4 very fast first turn, so this deck simply cant keep up. Mainly because the cost of the Destroyers was so high, the early turns of the game only allow you to get out one or two. So you are the weakest to attack during those turns. Currently, this deck took a big hit with the introduction of Mon Mothma (V) subtracting 4 from the draw to blowing Alderaan. Though you can get around this by starting Colo Claw Fish or Sando Squash Monster, the deck worked better getting to start a different effect in their place. Choosing to play this deck will all depend on how well you believe it will do. Though I believe it is still a solid darkside platform, WYS (V) is just a bit too strong for this deck to handle.   <br />

* Bring Him Before Me (AKA BHBM)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Throne Room, Insignificant Rebellion and Your Destiny. <br />
For remainder of game, Scanning Crew may not be played. Opponents cards that place character out of play <br />
may not target Luke. You may deploy Emperor (deploy -2) from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent may deploy Luke from Reserve Deck (deploy -2; reshuffle) or Lost Pile. If Luke is present with Vader and Vader is not escorting a captive, Luke is captured and seized by Vader. Vader may not transfer Luke. Flip this card if Luke captured. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, lose 1 Force at end of each of your turns. Once during each of your turns, when Vader, Luke (even as a non-frozen captive) and Emperor are all present at your Throne Room, you may initiate a Luke/Vader duel: Each player draws two destiny. Add ability. Highest total wins. If Vader wins, opponent loses 3 Force. If Luke wins, shuffle Reserve Deck and draw destiny; if destiny >12, Luke crosses to Dark Side, totally depleting opponents Life Force. Flip if Luke neither present with Vader nor a captive.<br />
<br />
  <br />
Standard cards in every version: 2 to 6 versions of the Emperor, 2 to 3 versions of Vader, any number of ways to cause you to win a battle. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Much like There is Good in Him for lightside, this objective has the ability to simply end the game by winning enough battles. Unlike TIGIH, you have to lose the duel first, and then draw a random destiny in order to win. BHBM has always been a strong objective for darkside because you are able to continually deploy the Emperor from Reserve deck all game for -2. Common versions of this deck play with Imperial Arrest Order Combo to pull the Death Star II docking bay, the Endor Docking bay, and maybe another random chose. Over the years, the versions of this deck have only changed to include the more powerful cards that can be used to win a battle. Cards like Maul with Stick, Blizzard 4, and Boba Fett, BH provided that extra power that they deck was lacking during the early years. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: Just like TIGIH, this deck can win very easily if you can just figure out how to win enough battles so you can cross Luke to the darkside. Most of the time, players who play this deck could win the game playing the darkside classic strategy of battling over and over and getting large amounts of overflow. A good version of this deck can be made with many 6 destiny characters like multiple Emperor Palpatines or if you dont own them you can sub them out for Tech Nor from A New Hope. Combined with creatures and the card Tauntan Bones from Special Edition, you have the ability to place one of the 6 destiny characters out of play to add that destiny number to your total power. If you play with Womp Rats/Bubo and Krayt Dragon Bones (V) to clear away a few characters before you battle, you will have a better chance of having a higher total power. Other cards like You are Beaten to exclude characters and Set for Stun to just bounce characters back to the opponents hand are also good chooses. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This deck is still a strong chose for darkside even with V9 being out. BHBM can simply take Luke away from the lightside and with the introduction of Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V) in V9, you have the ability to prevent Epps from targeting your characters. The objective will always be strong because as long as you can still win battles against any lightside deck, you will have the ability to win the game. Besides the ones mentioned earlier, this deck also has other great combos like using the Emperor (V) and Force Lighting to auto kill any character you want or playing with Human Shield so that they the lightside will hit Luke in place of Vader. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The downside to this objective is you are restricted to when you can deploy Vader because as soon as you do, they will automatically get to deploy Luke from their Reserve or even their lost pile for Vader to escort. When you have Luke, you will flip and then begin to lose 1 Force from your objective. Games have single handedly been lost just because the lightside was able to stay away from this deck so long that the objective itself caused the deck to lose. The other problem with this objective it has a hard time with lightside objectives (WHAP and Hyperdrive) that simply get around Your Destiny and never even have Luke in their deck. These objectives dont ever have to worry about you getting the auto victory by crossing Luke. This deck also doesnt usually have an awesome space package. You can compare it to a Huntdown package because they are usually very similar. Weak space means you are going to be weak against a good WYS (V) or Hidden Base. <br />

<br />
* My Kind of Scum (AKA MKOS)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Desert Heart and a Jabbas Palace site. May deploy Well Guarded. Reveal one unique (.) alien from your deck whose lore specifies its species. This card is your Rep. <br />
For remainder of game, your Rep is a leader. Well Guarded is immune to Alter. You may not deploy insert cards or operatives. While frozen Han on Table, Rebels are immune to No Bargain and Bad Feeling Have I. Flip this card if you occupy two battleground sites (must occupy a third with a non-unique alien of your Reps species if a non-Tatooine location is on table).<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn may cancel a Force drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep. Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unqiue alien of your Reps species. While Jabba and Bib on table, your battle destiny draws are each +2. Wounded Wookiee is destiny +3. Unless a non-Tatooine location is on table, your aliens are forfeit +2. For remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand. Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 battleground sites. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: version of Jabba, version of Bip Fortuna, Greedo (V), Ket Melss (V) and any other random alien card.<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The brother to Agents in the court, this objective also plays with aliens in Jabbas Palace and a Rep at the start of the game. Unlike Agents though, this deck had been much stronger to play with until Agents got A LOT of help with V set 8. This objective was stronger because the darkside has always had more powerful aliens. It was never a great tournament chose though until more V cards were made to make aliens even more powerful. Of course, now with all of the many deck types to play with aliens, the chose to play with this objective over the others is in personal opinion.   <br />
<br />
How it can Win: Many versions of this deck have been made around an alien that can be pulled with one of the many effects that can pull aliens. The most common chose these days starts with Ket Melss (V) to take into hand Greedo (V) and Beelo because the Rodian (NON V) can be deployed to replace any (.) unique Rodian thus sending him to Used pile. Then you kill the Rodian off, retrieve it with the objective and do it all over again. This works well because you are able to play the Greedo (V) on the objective to cancel drains and battle destinies, then it can be deployed and returned to the deck to be done again and again. Using this strategy with the other powerful aliens cards that are out, you have a great deck that can stay alive for a long time.   <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Just like Scum decks and the Court objective, playing with aliens is never a bad idea in the current environment. The biggest reason to play with MKOS over the other two is because you can manipulate battle and drains as well as add a +2 to each of your battle destinies. MKOS decks are built to be a bit more defensive than the other aliens decks. Versions will usually include Stunning Leaders to protect from beatdown and Ooo Taa Goo Ta Solo (V) to add additional destiny draws. You also have a consistent retrieval all game no matter what with the non-unique aliens coming back every control phase. Since so many players are aware of the Scum deck, playing with MKOS will allow for much of the same play, only no fear of getting ALL of your locations converted with a NON-Hyperdrive deck. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Most of the time, if you are going to play with aliens, you might as well just play with Scum because the Scum deck is a more consistent deck and has the ability to win against more types of lightside decks. MKOS plays with a lot less characters than Scum does because many of the slots are being used to work with the objective. Usually though, you would get your Jabbas Palace converted no matter what, and if you play against Profit, they will get to convert your sites. So against both of those decks, you would have to start the Lower Passages and hope to either draw the sites or play with Voyeur (V) to deploy them directly. <br />

* Agents of Black Sun (AKA Black Sun)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Imperial City (with Xizor there) and Coruscant system. <br />
For remainder of game, your aliens with Black Sun in lore, bounty hunters, and information brokers are Black Sun agents, Emperor or Independent starships. During your control phase, each of your Bounty Hunters may make a regular move to an adjacent site where there is a bounty. Scanning Crew may not be played. Flip this card if Xizor is at a battleground site and Luke is not at a battleground site. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn, may place a card from hand in Used Pile to peek at cards in your Force Pile. Once during each of your battle phases, may peek at top X cards of any Reserve Deck, where X = number of locations you occupy. For each Black Sun agent in a battle, attrition against opponent is +1. During your control phase, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground location occupied by Xizor or Emperor. Flip this card if Luke is at a battleground site or if Xizor is not on table. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Guri (NON V and/or V), lots of Bounty Hunters, 2 or 3 version of the Emperor<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Just like Watch Your Step (NON V), this was the first objective that restricted who could be played in the deck. When it first came out, it was made into one of the strongest decks that could be played. Back then, it played with an unheard of 6!!!! Emperor Palpatines so that you would get him in your opening hand and always have him on the table all game. The extra 6 destinies didnt hurt much either. As time pasted, it seemed to die off because it was limited on who it could play with and usually missed not being able to play with Vader or Maul. The PC decided that this deck needed some help, so they created a good 8 cards to help this objective. The two strongest being Xizor (V) which made a larger number of characters into Black Sun agents as well as gave those Agents all the ability to draw destiny on their own, and Information Brokers (V), which allowed Scum and Villainy to deploy on the Imperial City and let you deploy a Black Sun agent from Reserve including The Emperor (V). That was huge because you could now get a bonus for playing with aliens on a different planet other than Tatooine and you had a card that could finally pull a version of the Emperor. Of course of you wanted to continue to use the Scum and Villainy text, you would have to play with Emperor Palpatine because Jabbas Influence (V) allows only that version of the Emperor.  The other problem this objective had in the beginning was that both the Coruscant Docking bay and the system were not battlegrounds, so in order to get Xizor to a battleground to flip, you had to deploy a different battleground docking bay and transit or you could put a Presence of the Force to make one. When Coruscant came out they released a battleground version of both the system and the docking bay. That gave Black Sun a much better area to play with by being able to flip first turn by simply moving Xizor over.  <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This deck has a lot of things going for it now. If you have Desilijic Tattoo (V) out, all of your Bounty Hunters and Independent starships will have forfeit +2 and defense value +1. Combined with Jabbas Influence (V) and Xizor (V), all the characters in your deck will draw destiny have very good power and have enough forfeit to absorb anything the lightside throws at them. The Seven side of this objective does a lot different things that give you the power of deck manipulation. It lets you peek at cards in either Reserve deck during your battle phase so you will either know what your destiny draw is going to be or what your opponents is going to be. You can also look at the cards in your Force pile simply by putting any card by in your deck. You dont have to reshuffle them, so after looking you have the ability to know what you are drawing before you draw it. If that wasnt enough, you also cause added attrition in battle with your Black Sun agents and direct damage while the Emperor or Xizor are at a battleground. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This deck also plays with aliens. The only difference from the other decks is you get to start with one already on the table and spend much of your time on Coruscant and not Tatooine. When your Bounty Hunters are Black Sun agents, they gain more abilities than simply playing aliens alone. A great combo can be played with this deck if you combine your already power effects i.e. JI (V), DT(V), and IB (B) with Ability x3 (V). Your lone bounty hunter is so powerful, that he can attack by himself retrieve 2 Force with S&V and a character with AAA (V). Then go on to add at least one to attrition, get lost, then put back in the deck with the next battle. Many battles can take place with only a few characters, so you will always have bounty hunters to play with all game. The new Xizor (V) also can pull Unexpected Interruption which can be used (V) or (NON V) to help this deck. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The biggest weakness this deck has is it relies on Xizor staying alive to win. If he can be killed, the objective cannot be flipped, so much of your time is spent trying to protecting him. The deck also has to keep Luke off a battleground as well, so you have a problem if you come up against Commander Luke (V) in Rogue 1 because all he has to be is at the site not present. With the introduction of S&V being played with this deck, the Admirals Order Black Sun Fleet is not longer worth playing with because you lose the ability to retrieve, which is of course more powerful. WYS (V) is now the big lightside deck, so if you are planning on taking this to a tournament, you have to make sure to include a different Admirals Order to get the NQA (V) off the table.   <br />

* My Lord, Is that Legal? (AKA Senate)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Galactic Senate and any other Episode I location.<br />
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability <4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. Your Republic characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay. Cards on your Political Effects may deploy to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least 1 with a blockade agenda) at Galactic Senate. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponents hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (or +3 if senator has an ambition agenda) when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. May use 2 Force at end of any turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 5 Lott Dot, 7 to 10 other senators, 2 to 3 Squabbling Delegates, all 4 political effects, Naboo system<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Much like LS Senate, this objective was a broken strategy for the past 3 years. Only in recent months has it begun to lose. This deck has stayed powerful even after LS Senate had dropped off with The Emperor (V) making it too hard to play. DS Senate didnt have to fear any such character. Even with the creation of over 5 V cards that hurt DS Senate, the deck still seemed to find a way to win. It took the Worlds Title in a record 3 years in a row; 2002, 2003, and 2004. Despite not getting the awesome ability of Queen Amidala, RON, the deck was giving a different ability. Lott Dot is by far the strongest of all darkside senators letting you take any card from force pile into hand just like Keeping the Empire Out Forever and IG-88 (V). In other decks, this is a strong ability, but in Senate it is pretty much broken because it provides you with a Senator anytime you need one and allows you react to the lightside while still using all of the Political Effects to make things go your way in battle. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: Just like LS Senate, DS Senate wins with playing cards that can battle and do damage on their own combined with the power of the Political Effects to make the pain even worse. The standard set up for this deck is pretty much the same. Set up the Galactic Senate with a Lott Dot and another Senator and flip. If the lightside didnt start a system, you would start Naboo and get out your Zuckess (V) and Mist Hunter (V) or any other power ship with good immunity. For years, this deck could react and beat any deck the lightside through against it unless the played literally all the possible cards that hurt DS Senate. The two most powerful ones are Scrambled Transmission (V), which can simply cancel ANY DS Political Effect with just a force loss, and Leia (V), who can be place out of play to place any senator out of play with her. So, Lott Dot goes south fast with this card. If the lightside didnt play those counter cards. This deck would usually have no problem beating anything. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: For years, this was the auto win deck. It literally went over a whole year back in 2002 to 2003 and didnt lose one single game. Even up until V set 8 did it win games and beat the most popular LS decks. Now though, the lightside has become more powerful against the weaknesses this deck did have. So what once was a very awesome deck, now can be beat. This can still be a very powerful deck. So you could play it and feel confident going to a tournament because it is clear that the counter cards are just not being played. The biggest problem this deck has now is that there are new lightside decks that can play around the manipulation. Take care when taking this to a major tournament. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Currently, WYS (V) is way too powerful to be beat with this objective. Too many cards are used for the purpose of Senate that there is just not enough Starships to counter the power of NQA (V). The new Endor effects that play on the Back Door from V set 9 have also made it hard for Senate because they have the power to get around battles, weapon targeting, etc. Also, V9 has brought lightside Senate back to the playing field, which allows them to win by playing with the counter cards to darkside Senate. I think darkside Senate has finally reached the point of retirement until new cards can bring it back to greatness.  <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
   <br />
* No Money, No Parts, No Deal (AKA WATTO)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Wattos Junkyard and Mos Espa.<br />
For remainder of game, Wattos Junkyard is immune to Revolution. If Watto at Wattos Junkyard, opponent may use 8 Force to place Watto in Used Pile and you may retrieve up to 4 Force. While this side up, Qui-Gon is power +3. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from your Force drains at Tatooine sites. Flip this card if Watto present at Wattos Junkyard and you occupy Mos Espa. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may place a card from hand face down on your side of the table and opponent must choose to lose 2 Force (you place card in Used Pile) or use 2 Force (you may deploy that card for free). If opponent uses 2 Force and you cannot deploy card, lose 2 Force and card is lost. Opponents non-unique aliens are each deploy +3. Flip this card if Watto not present at Wattos Junkyard or you do not occupy Mos Espa.<br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 3 to 4 Wattos, Executor, Maul with Stick or Tatooine Maul, and random cards<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is very different from the other darkside objectives because just like Hyperdrive for lightside, it completely runs around playing at just one site. Of course, it is the same site, the Junkyard. Unlike Hyperdrive though, the darkside is NOT restricted on what players they can play with. This deck can be built with any number of Imperial or alien forces. For years, this objective was a very solid strategy allowing the darkside to either cause direct force loss for 2 or get to play ANY card they want for free. The darkside Junkyard with Watto present is also a very powerful site by preventing the lightside from drawing ANY battle destinies. So the only way for the lightside to knock them off the site is to get lucky with their weapons. The downside to this deck is that the lightside can simply put Watto back in their deck with just 8 Force. This will let the darkside retrieve 4 Force, but if they should get Watto out early. It can have a major affect on how the deck plays out. Watto is the key to the deck and must be protected for the deck to work. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This objective can win by almost always flipping first turn and causing early direct damage. The normal strategy with this deck is to deploy Watto with the Junkyard text. Then play an alien like Ephont Mon to Mos Espa with Power of the Hutt. This will flip the objective and most of the time, you could sack the Mob Points Combo you were starting with to pull Carida, Rendelli, or Executor, and find Search and Destroy for yet another Force loss. Since you always go first, you can use Wattos text to find his Chance Cube and then use it as the card you place in used pile for the 2 force loss. For years, this deck continued to be strong because the lightside would never have any force to use to prevent the 2 force. Not only that, but when this objective was released. The lightside only played with a few strategies that provided them enough force to deploy anything powerful enough first turn. As the game continued, you would fortify the Junkyard with a vehicle to protect Watto and some power characters like Maul and Vader. You could then wait until the lightside had the force to pay and get around the loss of 2 to then deploy cards like the Executor for FREE. Because the deck could set up so fast, it made for a difficult game for the lightside to play against. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The deck is much like Hyperdrive doing the same thing and simply hanging out on one site. So because of that, you will not have to think that much to play this deck. Most of the time you are just battling at either Mos Espa or the Junkyard and dont have to go the opponents sites. The great thing about the power of this objective is you can flip it back at the end of your turn. Then deploy another character to Mos Espa to flip it either cause the 2 force loss or get a card out for free. Always make sure you are playing attention to your opponents force pile, because this deck allows you to get cards back in your deck that normally would be stuck in your hand. If your opponent doesnt have any force or maybe just 1 saved. Then you can put ANY card you want down with no fear. If they do have a lot of force, then you would be safe to put a high deploy card like the Executor down so that the player will choose to pay and not lose the force. Then you get that Executor out for free. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The main reason this deck worked was because the lightside never had any force to cover the loss. With the creation of both Careful Planning (V) and Thrown Back (V), the lightside now has been given the ability to have enough force to deploy a strong force on their first turn. Also, with all of the searching that Watto does its first turn, the lightside will ALWAYS have the force to pay and not loss during their first turn. This causes the Watto deck to back fire on itself because the deck always searched at least twice every turn. Because of the new V cards, this deck is no longer a good chose for darkside and would not be smart to play on the current tournament environment.  <br />

For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except Federation starships and characters with Trade Federation in lore. Civil Disorder is canceled. While this side up, once during your deploy phase may deploy a Naboo site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponents Force icons at Naboo system are canceled. Flip this card if you control Theed Palace Throne Room (with a Neimoidian there) and Naboo system. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you lose no more than 2 Force to any Force drain. Your battle droids deploy -1. If you have two Federation droids with different card titles (or a Federation droid and a Neimoidian) in battle at a site, draw two battle destiny if unable to otherwise. Your droid starfighters are immune to attrition <3. If opponent just drew an Interrupt for battle destiny, once per battle you may place that card out of play. Flip this card if opponent controls Naboo system or Theed Palace Throne Room. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 2 to 3 Gunrays, 3 to 4 Lord Mauls, 2 to 3 Darth Sidious, The Phantom Menace, Blockade Flagship, lots of Droids. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The darksides answer to WHAP. It also is completely run around Episode I preventing you from playing with Vader or even aliens. Your only power characters are Lord Maul and Darth Sidious. When this objective was released, it did get some playing time because at the time, the lightside still only had a moderate space package and this deck really didnt have to fear any of the characters that might come after it. The deck plays completely around Trade Federation Droids, so you are not affected by cards that target Imperials or Aliens. The good thing about that is they do count as occupying the locations. The bad thing is that you dont get destiny from your ability since none of the droids have ability. That means that in order to draw destinies you are relying on what the card itself says or the flip side of this objective. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: The idea of this objective is to do the exact same thing as WHAP by controlling the Throne Room, only you can directly deploy there easily first turn. Because of the ease of getting to do there directly, you also have to control the system. So in many games, you will have no problem flipping first turn because you get to start with the Blockade Flagship already there. You can even get a Neimoidian out very easily with The Phantom Menace when you get Lord Maul out. The problem is keeping control of the Throne Room or the system. Invasion doesnt have the power of Secure Route (V) to get cards back, but it does have power with its droids. They do a lot of good things when you pair them together. Much like the movie, they only work when in a group of many of them rather than on their own like the Jedi. Because of that, much of the deck is devoted to characters rather than interrupts and effects. The objective lets you start with Droid Racks already on the table, which is like a Bacta Tank for darkside only you can put as many droids there as you want, then only pay 2 to take one into hand. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: This deck is very different than other darkside decks because you will not be used too many of the cards. Most people in tournaments would have never played against more than half your deck. The flip side really makes your droids strong by giving you 2 destinies no matter what as long as you have two of them together or one and a Neimoidian. Other other cool part of this objective is getting to make ANY interrupt drawn for battle destiny out of play. So not only are you making them lose a card, but it cant even be retrieved. You also have the power of Darth Sidious which in this deck usually gets put at the Coruscant: docking bay (SE) so you can use other other part of his text which lets you add a destiny. Him being on Coruscant too let you put those Jedi Out of Play when lost from table. This was really the objective that he was designed for.  <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: Well, for a time this deck could be play in tournaments and sometimes do very well. But with the creation of Jedi Lightsaber (V) (Sorry Invasion Lovers) all of your droids are made LOST when hit. So you HAVE to play with Moletor (V) which can be canceled with Grimtaash, so really you are not going to have an easy game against any deck that plays Mace (V). The other problem this deck has always had is that, much like WHAP, it is not that strong in space. Any strong lightside space deck will have no problem over running the Naboo system and controlling it all game. So the deck has to be built to be strong on the ground as well as space. Something that Episode I based decks just cant do very well. Until they make a few helpers for this deck, I would not recommend it in a major tournament.  <br />

* Let Them Make the First Move (Combat)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text: <br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Generator Core, Theed Palace Generator, and Deep Hatred. <br />
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain where opponent has a Jedi, and your Force drains at Naboo sites where you have a Dark Jedi may not be canceled. Once during your control phase, may target one opponents character present with your Dark Jedi at an interior Theed Palace site. Target is Lost. Flip this card if an opponents Jedi present at an interior Naboo battleground site. <br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you may not Force drain or initiate battle at any location where you have a Dark Jedi. Once during your move phase, your Dark Jedi may initiate lightsaber combat against an opponents Jedi present: Each player draws 2 destiny. Loser (lowest total) loses 2 Force (cannot be reduced). If difference is 5 or greater, lost Force must come from Reserve Deck, and losing character is lost. Flip this card and retrieve 1 Force if opponent has no Jedi present at any interior Naboo battleground. <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: 4 Lord Mauls, 3 Vaders, 2 to 3 Emperors, 2 to 3 Darth Sidious, Force Field, and good space. <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: Just like lightside Combat, this objective was very powerful when it first came out. It was very easy for the darkside to set up fast and force the lightside to stop the drain of 4 with Lord Maul his Double-Bladed lightsaber. For years, this objective could only be stopped by an equally good lightside Combat deck or lightside Senate. Only until the creation of the V cards did it take a back seat to other much stronger darkside chooses. Standard versions of this deck would set up quick and put the Bounty Hunter ships in space with the system that was pulled with Mob Points Combo. Then just sit back and wait. No fear of Undercover spies or an Arcona blocking your drain. Well, until I Find Your Lack Of Faith Disturbing (V) was released. Just like lightside combat, you no longer had the ability to make ANY non Jedi character there lost during Control phase. <br />
<br />
How it can Win: This decks win by knocking the Jedi off the table with your Combat cards. They make it much easier to complete over the formally popular Epic Duel that Huntdown was always famous for. If you did happen to lose, you Jedi was not placed out of play, just lost. So you could get another one out. As mentioned in lightside Combat. This objective was a great base for the Shield Buster deck. You would have the power to get some of your broken strategies through by forcing the lightside to play all of their Shields slots. It started Pod Racing, played SAC, had high drains, and of course ODDS!!! It was very easy with Emperor Palpatine on the table to have high total destiny on table. Unlike the lightside which can play both Luke, JK and Yoda, MOTF for a total of 10. The darkside version had to play with more worthless characters that had high destiny like TechNor or any one of the many 4 destiny characters.<br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: The Shield Buster version of this deck is still the best way to play this deck. If you chose to play with the Shield Buster, you have to play with the Bounty Hunters in their ships. The good thing about the darkside version is that the lightside does not usually play with Staging Area Combo or just Your Insight Serves You Well. That means that you have a much better chance of them not getting out their Odds Shield before the 3 or 4 slots have been used. This deck is literally the only deck left that has a good chance of playing Odds in todays environment.  <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: When Combat was new; it was very hard for any lightside deck to win over the Combat cards. Now, cards like Civil Disorder (V) allow the lightside to make any one of your Combat cards lost with a force. The objective is also not as effective with the anti Combat Shield. The lightside has many decks that can win very easily without playing Jedi, so they will never have to come to Naboo. You also devote many cards to holding the sites and completing Combat, that your space package is not always that great. Maul gets stuck on Naboo many times, and you are not able to use your Infiltrator against decks like WYS (V) and Hidden Base. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
   <br />
<br />
* Imperial Occupation (V) (Walkers)<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Text:<br />
<br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hoth system, Ice Plains, and Main Power Generators (Light side). May deploy Imperial Decree and/or Prepare For a Surface Attack. <br />
For remainder of game, you may only play Walker Garrison twice and AT-ATs deploy -1 to Hoth. Revolution does not affect Hoth locations and you may not play Colo Claw Fish. While this side up, once during your control phase, may take into hand an AT-AT, Target The Main Generators, AT-AT Cannon, Death Squadron, or Electro-Rangefinder. Opponent loses no Force to You May Start Your Landing. Flip this card if Main Power Generators is blown away.<br />
<br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, Rebel Base Occupation is canceled. Your Force drain bonuses may not be canceled unless opponent controls a Hoth location. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy from Reserve any marker site. Once per turn when you deploy an AT-AT, you may take one card (except an AT-AT) from Lost Pile into hand. For each Imperial in a battle at the Hoth system, your total battle destiny is +1. Your AT-ATs are destiny +1 when drawn for weapon or battle destiny.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Standard cards in every version: Blizzard 4, Blizzard 2, Tempest 1, Blizzard 1 (NON V), version of Veers, version of Vader, Target the Main Generator, 2 Walker Garrisons, 3rd Marker, Sando Squash Monster, Tatooine Maul, Sith Infiltrator, and You May Start Your Landing <br />
<br />
Idea Behind Objective: The first of the darkside PC created objectives. It was the exact opposite to Speeders and another great movie objective. For a long time, Walkers was the strongest darkside deck to be played. Only with the creation of stronger lightside decks did this deck because less powerful. Much like WYS (V) is now, this objective could be made many different ways and still win. Of course there were versions that were stronger than others, but it really didnt matter as long as you were able to blow the Shields. Just like MBO is with blowing the Death Star, the whole objective ran around being able to successfully blow the Hoth Shields. If you failed to do so, then it made it much harder to win the game. The greatest part of this objective was it ran completely around cards that were strong, yet werent broken.<br />
<br />
How it can Win: This objective wins because it is very fast and can set up very solid damage that is protected from canceling and plays on Hoth, so you get the bonus of Imperial Decree. In about 80% of the games you will play, you will have no problem blowing the Shields by turn 3. That will dish out an 8 card direct damage loss, then an additional card lose from You May Start Your Landing, which causes for lose for each Hoth site occupied by a Walker. Once the Shields are gone, the objective flips and the deck moves to set up for Walker Garrison. The deck doesnt rely on the use of Walker Garrison to win. Most of the time, by the time you are ready to play it, the opponent would already have lost the game. The Garrison just finishes them off. The most powerful part of the objective is the ability to take ANY card you want from you lost pile back into hand once per turn when you deploy an AT-AT, and it doesnt have to be to Hoth. <br />
<br />
Why I SHOULD play it: Walkers will always be a strong strategy because you are playing a deck that is based around powerful ground vehicles. When Speeders was big, Walkers sometimes has a hard time beating it. But now that JQualle (V) is around. Speeders is completely gone, so you can play this deck with very little fear of the match up. The deck is a great match up for lightside decks that cause characters to be higher deploy i.e. WYS (V), MBO, and even DBO. The most common set of these days will start Mob Points Combo to find Rendelli, You May Start Your Landing to pull the 3 rd Marker and a Walker Garrison, and random third effect. Currently, you want to start Sando Squash Monster to get around Mon Mothma (V). Some versions choose to play with Krayt Dragon Bones (V) which pulls both One Arm (V) and Wampa (V) from under your starting effect Fear is My Alley. There are many chooses for the space package. Some play with bounty hunter ships and Tat Maul in space, yet others chose to play with Star Destroyers to benefit from the Prepare Defenses Text. Those versions play with Imperial Commands and typically play with Grand Admiral Thrawn. The best choose is the bounty hunters because they are much cheaper and can be found when you sack the Mob Points to find Combat Response. <br />
<br />
Why NOT to play it: The past few V sets have created cards that can hurt Walkers. Entrenchment (V) and Mon Mothma (V) from V9 have caused the idea of Walkers to be a bit more difficult to play. Mon Mothma (V) made the deck much harder to flip by subtracting 4 from the draw to blow the Shields. So you have to play Sando in order to get around it. Also, with Entrenchment (V) in place, you will not be able to cause any damage from Walker Garrison because it gets around all of your objective and effect protections. The only way to get around this at all is to play with Tatooine Maul and get him in space to cloak or simply block the system from being controlled. If you should play against a large space deck, it would not be easy to block all of their systems. Hopefully, a lightside deck will not have full control of two systems and two sites. So if you use your Walkers wisely, you might be able to hold off the controlling of either the system or the site long enough for the Garrison to go through.         <br />

***Popular NON Objective Based Decks***<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This section will show you popular deck types that are built WITHOUT the benefit of Objectives. They dont follow any kind of specific strategy and are all really designed to play out the same way, only they are based on different planet systems. All NON Objective based decks are built around some form of Mains & Toys, meaning they are all interactive with characters, weapons, vehicles, and starships. The idea is to battle the opponent and drain them out. M & T continues to be the most basic of SWCCG strategies which has lasted since the creation of the game. This section is not as in depth as the Objectives because there are just too many different ways to build these decks. I just wanted to talk about these possibilities with deck making.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lightside:<br />
<br />
<br />
* Thrown Room Mains (AKA TRMs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting Location(s): Yavin 4: Throne Room<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Design: Truly, this deck has been the longest running power house for the lightside. No matter what set came out, this deck only changed and evolved. The idea has always been the same. Lightside goes first, deploys LOTS of twix sites (two icons for me, non for you) for activation, waits for the darkside to begin their strategy and then react. Forever, this deck has only changed to play with the most powerful characters and starships that were available. Currently, this is the ONLY living deck for either side that plays with just a starting location. All other decks will either play with an Objective or use CP/CR (V) to pull additional locations. The original design that really put this deck on the map was when the Starting Interrupts Careful Planning / Combat Readiness (NON V) from Endor came out. The deck would start the Throne Room like normal, then with CP be allowed to pull two related <> sites, which were the Farm and the Swamp. During the first turn, the lightside player would use the Swamp text to find a Nuj that would absorb the darkside icon. Then the next turn, find the other Nuj giving you 4 icons that were safe from direct deployment from the darkside. From there, as cards were made that could pull locations, the deck became that much stronger getting more of its sites out faster without having to draw them. The deck will probably always be one that can be played because it is only doing a very basic strategy that the lightside can do very well. <br />
<br />
Best Way to Build It: The standard for building this deck in todays environment is to always have 4 to 5 twix sites one of which being the Jedi Council Chamber. You want to choose sites that normally are not going to be taken over by a Spy i.e. Yodas Hut, Rendezvous Point, etc. Also important to play with sites that can be pulled, the Jedi Chamber with Speak with the Jedi Council and Boss Nass Chamber with Wessa Got a Grand Army. The key to the deck is getting your sites out early. If you have trouble finding them, it can mean the game, so make sure you build the deck around the activation first. Epps are now the work force in the standard versions playing 2 of each of them and usually 3 copies of A Jedis Resilience to get them right back into hand for another attack. The deck will have a very basic space package usually Home One, Bright Hope (V), Tantive IV (V), and Han, Chewie, & the Falcon. The only main drain location is Kessel, which never has a problem of being held with this deck. Normally the starting includes Wokling (V) for early activation, Insurrection Combo to pull docking bays, and either For Luck (V), Colo Claw Fish, or Civil Disorder (V) all depending on the match up. Sometimes one of these will be started over the Wokling (V). The rest of the deck includes Interrupts for battling and pulling sites, characters that can support the Epps on the ground and the starships in space, and SAC.       <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Mains & Toys with Careful Planning (V) <br />
<br />
<br />
Starting Location(s): Tatooine, Coruscant, Endor, or Naboo<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Design: When I started writing about the main lightside decks that start CP (V). I noticed that even though they are built around different planets, they are all made pretty much the same way. So I decided to just give a basic strategy on what all of these decks are doing. No matter what planet you chose to play with, when you design this deck, you will be making a Mains & Toys deck. The name comes from the idea that the deck will be playing with the Main characters from the movies i.e. Luke, Yoda, Qui-Gon, Han, etc. The Toys part means that you will be using their helper cards that make the Mains even more powerful. That would include all of their weapons, vehicles, starships, effects, and interrupts that target and help these characters. For example, if I am playing with a lightsaber, a card like Lightsaber Proficiency or Clash of Sabers would work very well with my lightsaber to give that character an extra advantage. The objectives can be made around totally different strategies, but if you want to build a deck that sets up with CP (V) to start 3 locations and then also 3 to 4 effects on the table, you will be including the power characters to go with them. The key is to pick the planet that will meet your needs and be fun to play. The four most popular to chose from are Tatooine, Coruscant, Endor, and Naboo. You can also use Hoth, but those decks are built around EBO, so you would not be using that system for Mains & Toys. <br />
<br />
Best Way to Build It: There are many elements that go into a lightside Mains & Toys deck. To start, you must first decide what characters you will be using. Since there are so many different versions of many of the characters, you will want to pick the best characters for the locations that you will be playing. If you chose Endor then Luke, Rebel Scout (V) would be better over Luke with Lightsaber. Then again if you play on Tatooine, you might be better to play with Luke (V), Master Luke, or Luke, Jedi Knight. Same goes for characters like Leia and Han. If you are building a deck that puts Han on the ground, then General Solo (V) may be better, but then if you want him in space, you may want Han with Gun, Han Solo (V), or Captain Han. With Leia, you need to decide if you want Boushh, Rebel Princess, or Princess Leia (V). After you pick the characters, you will need to decide what they will be doing. Is this a react deck like TRMs that will be set up and attack the darkside on their sites, or is this more of a defensive deck that put cards down on your own sites and waits for the opponent to come to you. Deciding this will open up what interrupts and effects will help this deck to win. If you are playing offensively, you dont need a bunch of cards that help you to run away. The rest of the deck is built around the planet and the strategy that goes with it. If you play Tatooine, you will more than likely be playing with Wattos Junkyard and Credit will Do Fine. If you play on Endor, it will probably be the Strike Planning, the Back Door and the new V9 effects that General Solo (V) can pull. If you chose Coruscant, you will need Coruscant Celebration, Fallon Portals, docking bays and so on. I could go on forever with all of these decks, so I just decided to list the most popular cards for lightside Mains & Toys decks. If you want more info on these decks, please look at a popular version up on Decktech. <br />
<br />
Popular Starships: Home One, Tantive IV (V), Spiral, Bright Hope (V), Han, Chewie, & the Falcon, Outrider w/Dash, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V), and R2 in Red 5 w/ Luke Skywalker (V).<br />

Darkside:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Tatooine Scum<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting Location(s): Tatooine (Coruscant Version), Tat: Jabbas Palace, Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Design: Finally it comes to it, the most solid dark deck to be played for the past year. It was created after V set 8 was released and three very powerful cards were introduced; Hutts Bounty (V), Jabba the Hutt (V) and Jabbas Space Cruiser (V). The worst being Hutts Bounty (V) because it provided the deck with extra activation, +1 bonus to total battle destiny, and the most powerful text, the ability to reduce a characters power to 0 once per turn at the same site as your Gangster. The Gangster didnt even have to be in the battle to hurt the lightside character. There was truly no way around this short of Altering the effect to used pile with their SAC shield out. The deck itself was a perfect machine, which provided all the necessary mechanics for playing against just about any lightside deck. The deck gets its name from one of its most important cards Scum and Villainy, which made 90% of the characters deploy -1 and lets you retrieve 2 force whenever you initiated battle. The whole deck revolves around Jabba the Hutt (V). He pulls the S & V, and must be at the site for Hutt Bounty (V) to be deployed. If he is not on table, then you will not get the bonus activation and will not be able to beatdown most lightside decks with the ability to double all aliens power at same site. The beatdown is the main way this deck wins. Even though it can react and still cause good damage on its own, the super beatdown with JTH (V) is what wins games. Stories have been told of power being in the 80s and 90s. So even if the lightside had power 40 and 20 forfeit, they would still take 20 to 30 cards in overflow. That is just sick.  <br />
<br />
Best Way to Build It: The design of a good Scum deck can vary and still be pretty awesome. The only differences are in how many Barrier and None Shall Pass (V) you play with, specific choose of aliens in the deck, and what specific interrupts to play. The starting effects are always the same with Jabbas Influence (V), All Wrapped Up (V), Power of the Hutt, and No Bargain / Combat Response. After that, the basic design is pretty standard. It provides 3 battlegrounds sites (Jabbas Palace, Audience Chamber, and Lower Passages) that were protected with No Bargain for +2 deployment to Rebels, None Shall Pass (V) for sending ANY character to force pile when they are deployed, and Imperial Barrier to trap a character to get beatdown. Jabbas Influence (V) would find any non-bounty hunter alien from Reserve. URORURURR (V) would let you place a card from hand on top of your Force pile to draw the top card of your Reserve, which would always give you the force to play the Barrier or the None Shall Pass. The space is very solid with Jabbas Space Cruiser (V) getting pulled with Power of the Hutt, Mist Hunter (V) subtracting 3 from weapon and battle destinies, Bossk in Hounds Tooth to additional destiny, and Tat Maul in Space on his Infiltrator. All of those ships can hold Tatooine all game to protect the Tatooine Occupation for an additional 3 card direct damage. It just goes on and on. This deck has truly been a powerhouse for a very long time. With the introduction of V10, 4 cards were created that hurt the key cards that Scum relies on. It will all depend on how many players find a way to include them in their light deck and still beat other decks. The best versions of Scum are currently posted on Decktech. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Bespin Weather Vane (V)<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting Location(s): Bespin, Bespin: Cloud City, and Cloud City Battleground site<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Design: Unlike the Mains & Toys decks for lightside which are all built the same way, this set up allows for a boarder array of possibilities. The greatest power of this set up is the activation. With Weather Vane (V) and Cloud City on the table, you will activate 9 force your first turn ALL BY YOURSELF (if the site provide 2 icons). Throw in a few twixs sites like the Dagobah and Wampa Cave that can both be pulled with A Dark Time for The Rebellion (V) and you have 13, more than enough to do damage every turn. The next power of this deck is ability to deploy the Executor for free first turn every game with They Must Never Again Leave This City (pulled by Were the Bait (V)). You still get the 9+ force, so you have no problem deploying characters on the ground for a first turn Firepower (V) or Battle Order. The four slots for your starting effects could be ANY number of strategies but the most effective ones start with Were the Bait (V), Mob Points Combo, Weather Vane (V), and then a random 4th effect which could be Blaster Rack (V), Crush the Rebellion, Combat Response, Ability x3 (V), or Kuat Drive Yards (V). All depending on what you want to do. <br />
<br />
Best Way to Build It: The strongest versions of this deck are mainly space based decks or a split between what is the strongest in both areas. You have two chooses. If you want to play around mainly a space deck, you should start the Cloud City: Chasm Walkway as your battleground site and just get any version of Maul there with his double-bladed lightsaber (could be the Epp or one with immunity). Blaster Rack (V) must be started if you choose to play with immunity. This version plays with all of the main bounty hunter ships, Darth Vader (V) in space, Short Range Combo, Lateral Damage and so on. The key is to knock them out of space, drain at both Bespin and Cloud City and battle them off the Chasm. An added bonus includes Miiyoom Onith from Premiere as something to do with all of that extra force you are activating. The other version of this deck will start either the Downtown Plaza or the Port Town District because they are both drain two exterior sites that you can deploy Walkers. This version usually will play with Levitation Attack (V) to play devices for free from under Fear is My Alley. The devices include the Tractor Beam, Defensive Sheild Generator (V), Restraining Bolt, Binders, etc. Some version will use Alert My Star Destroyer (V) to flash Admiral Piett (V) to find the Executor over the Mob Points Combo because the two of them only cost 2 Force. Then Piett will pull the Admirals Order Battle Deployment to find your Walkers. The Walkers combine with the standard ground forces (i.e. Maul with Stick, Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter, 4-Lom with Gun, IG-88 with Gun, etc.) to knock out anything the lightside throws out. The cool tech with this deck is to get 4-Lom with Gun on a Walker and get the Binders on him. So if you play with All Wrapped Up (NON V), every character that gets forfeited can be captured and held by 4-Lom alone. This version plays with Imperial Commands to find characters and add destinies. Both versions play with SAC, the choosing Sense Combo to have the power to change up the players hand. The best versions of this set up are currently on Decktech.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
* Mains & Toys with Combat Readiness (V)<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting Location(s): Coruscant, Endor, Hoth, and Naboo<br />
<br />
Idea Behind Design: Much like the lightside, when you chose to build a deck around these planets, you will be playing pretty much the same Mains & Toys strategy. The same rules apply for both sides. You chose a planet, then characters around that planet, and finally what interrupts and effects to best support your planets strategy. The biggest difference from the two sides is that you pretty much put the same darkside characters in every single version no matter what planet. Even though you do have a chose of which version of Vader or Fett to play with, the basic design for the darkside just doesnt change that much. The darkside doesnt have 12 versions of one character and 9 versions of another. Vader is the only character that you now have a few choses, even thought most decks on the ground will always play with the Choke Vader. Typically a darkside M & T deck will play with 3 Maul with Sticks, 3x version of Vader, a version of the Emperor, 2x version of Fett usually Bounty Hunter, Blizzard 4, P-59, Dengar with Gun, IG-88 with Gun, 4-Lom with Gun, Darth Sidious, Dr. Evason & Phonda Baba, JQualle (V) and Lando (V). These have become the standard for any deck that wants to continually beat the lightside on the ground. Any additional characters would be included depending on the planet, like General Veers (V) with Blizzard 2 in a Hoth or Naboo deck. <br />
<br />
Best Way to Build It: The planets for the darkside are not much different from the light. The biggest thing you have to think about for the darkside is can my deck hurt the lightside over Entrenchment (V). If you build a deck with CR (V) around Hoth or Coruscant, you will be limited on the sites you can play with that will do any kind of damage. With Hoth you do get the 3rd Marker, which does have a +1 drain, but will die to Entrenchment (V). Courscant in my opinion is not a very good planet to base a deck around for darkside. With Entrenchment (V), all of your bonus drains from Overseeing It Personally are gone and you are left with only draining at the docking bay and the location you have a Presence of the Force. Besides Tatooine; Endor and Naboo are the best choices for a planet to use for a darkside M & T deck. Both planets have very good drain sites and much like the Bespin set up, can give a good number of activation first turn that can be used to set up Mist Hunter (V) at the system and a Maul or maybe Blizzard 4 and Vader on the ground. Both systems are drain 2 and both planets have sites that are drain two (Battle Plains for Naboo and the Back Door for Endor). That means if you do get a good opening hand and can set both areas up first turn, if you play against a light deck that must use its first turn to set up, you will have a guaranteed drain of 4 unless they are able to cancel it will a Control or Rebel Fleet. In the current environment, light decks dont always pack the ability to cancel drains since the introduction of Bane Malar (V) from V7. Many good designs of all of these decks are now on Decktech.     <br />

Well, that concludes my efforts thus far. I can always go back and add and change all day long, but then this would have never been released. Again, I know that all of you will want to add to these decks because there was no way I could think of all of the great combos that each of these objectives and decks can make. My goal was to start with something that could be updated and altered for years to come. I hope all of you have gotten something from this, and I hope it will prove to be a very useful tool to all SWCCG players as they grow in this amazing game. <br />
<br />
Be looking for supplements to the Encyclopedia that will be out as I finish them. I wanted to go on and release it now the way it was so as not to take forever. Please excuse my run on sentences and I am sure misspelled words. It is hard to create something this large and have it be totally flawless. <br />
<br />
The next installment will be The Hall of Broken Decks where I talk about all the broken deck strategies over the years that have caused cards to be given an errata. <br />

Thanks for your support of this great game. <br />
