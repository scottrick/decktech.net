The 2nd Annual SWCCG Encyclopedia of Decks is finally here. For all of you who were supportive of the 1st edition, you will not be disappointed with this new and super improved edition. Much has happened to the game since the summer of 2005 when this was first released. Since I had already done the majority of work with the previous post, this edition is more fine-tuned. All the parts that were missing were added. Sit back and get ready for the ride of your life. Once again, prepare for an education, as this tool is now FREAKING HUGE!!!!! <br />
<br />
After previously posting this article back in April, I decided to have it proofread and corrected so it could be reposted as a perfect resource for the game. The previous post has been completely deleted. I am proud to say this new post is now free off grammer mistakes. As an added bonus to having it reposted, the article has been updated to include some of the new ideas from V13 as well as the change to the creature rules. Please enjoy! <br />
 <br />
For the players that didnt read the previous Encyclopedia, welcome to the longest article EVER on Decktech. The 1st edition was an unheard of 35,474 words on over 45 printed Decktech pages (as quoted on a previous review). This one is even bigger than that. Well, bigger is an understatement. The 2nd Edition is now almost 80,000 words on 138 printed Word pages. The purpose of this article is to be a resource and tool for the game so ALL who play have a reference to the possible deck choices the game offers of April 2007 with the current Virtual set being 12. This tool has each and every Objective listed out with current game text, popular strategy, pros and cons to playing them, and some ideas for making them tournament worthy. Of course, I also provided my own personal opinion to how good of an option a specific deck or Objective might be in the current environment. Now I am just one man, I am not perfect. There is no way I could cover ALL possible ideas for each deck. The article would be endless. All I can do is provide a starting place for you from my own personal experience, reading e-mails, and talking with players. The sections try to flow, but for the most part, I just included every little idea I knew about from each deck. I have spent a long time making this article and did my best to make sure there were few grammer errors. Please excuse any I might have missed.  <br />
 <br />
Once again, I want all who read this to remember that it represents many many MANY hours of work. So even if you are an old player who already knows everything about the game, please show respect for the work that went into creating something like this and offer constructive criticism that can be used to improve it. My goal here is to just list the facts and not to play favorites on decks. I mainly wanted to provide all the basic information of what all these decks do. Of course, now that we are on the 2nd post of this article, each deck has more complete content that can be used as a basic guide for playing the deck. That being said, I want all who review this to know that if you put a rating lower than 5, it will be deleted. There will never be something like this on Decktech for SWCCG, and it deserves nothing less.  <br />
 <br />
The 1st Edition of this article received many reviews. Many were amazed, while some provided me with new ideas on how to make this article as complete as possible. Listed below are the changes that you will see from the last Edition with a few of the ideas I recieved from the reviews. I encourage each of you to include more suggestions that will help make future versions that much better.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
What is Different? <br />
 <br />
$- Added # count to the Index of decks for easy reading on PDAs.  <br />
$- Common nicknames or abbreviations for each Objective is listed next to title: CCT, MWYHL, Speeders, Walkers, Huntdown, etc.  <br />
$- Terms Lightside and Darkside have been replaced by LS and DS in the descriptions to save space.  <br />
$- To help new players, all Virtual cards listed now have the set number next to the (V) Example: Luke Skywalker (V1), Jedi Lightsaber (V9). This added feature will also help everyone who reads the Encyclopedia to learn the Virtual sets so well, that they will be able to name any cards vitual set without having to think about it.  <br />
$- Out with the old in with the new: Old section Standard Cards in Every Version changed to Popular Cards to Look For  <br />
$- NEW section for each entry: What Changed Since 1st Edition, place where you can see what has changed for the deck. <br />
$- MORE DECKS!! New non-objective based decks were added to the Encyclopedia.  <br />
$- Additional content to previous entries! Updates with erratas, Re Edit updates, new ideas, and new Virtual sets that were released post 1st edition.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
NOW, like before, I thought it would be a good idea to list all the decks in an index to this article. To save space and time, I have only listed the 0 side of the card, which is what they are called by anyway. Remember the Objectives are first in order of release, then the non-objective, Careful Planning (CP (V8)) & Combat Readiness (CR (V8)) decks. Please feel free to post more suggestions for future editions as I used many of the suggestions that players gave me for this one.  <br />

 <br />
To begin, you will see the Objectives.  They can still be played today and were the reason the game changed from simply starting one location, to setting up a whole strategy that could be played out like the movies. I began with the LS objectives first, then moved into the DS. To make it easy on new players, they are listed in the order they were released starting with the five that came out in the Special Edition set in 98. Please Enjoy.  <br />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Dagobah system (may not be converted).  <br />
While this side up, during your deploy phase, may deploy Luke, Yoda (deploy -2), Yoda&#39;s Hope, At Peace and/or Luke&#39;s Backpack to Dagobah from Reserve Deck; Reshuffle. Whenever you draw training destiny, draw two and choose one. Place Luke&#39;s completed Jedi Tests on table. Your cards on Dagobah may not Force Drain or contribute to Force retrieval. Add 4 to each player&#39;s destiny draw for Sense or Alter. Flip this card when Luke completes Jedi Test #5. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side)Immediately retrieve 10 Force and place destiny card from Jedi Test #5 on that Jedi Test. While this side up, during your move phase, may use 3 Force to take Luke into hand from a location you control (cards on Luke go to owner&#39;s Used Pile). Luke&#39;s Jedi Tests are suspended (not lost) whenever Luke not on table. Luke may ignore location deployment restrictions. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter. Place out of play if you Force drain at Dagobah or if Luke is placed out of play. Cancel Luke&#39;s Jedi Tests. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 1 to 5 Dagobah sites, The Way of Things (Only if Testing to 3), Yoda&#39;s Hope, Luke&#39;s Backpack, Jedi Tests, Yoda (V5), either Daughter of Skywalker or a version of Luke (play Son of Skywalker (V5) or EPP Luke), It Is The Future You See (V12), At Peace (v12), Asteroids, Kessel, Bargawins  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: If you play this deck you will be training Luke or Leia on Dagobah with Yoda. The objective allows for a much faster training process over the original Jedi testing when Dagobah was first released. It speeds the process up by letting you find all that is needed and deploys it all at once or as you can afford it. Yoda (V5) allows you to retrieve 3 each time you complete a test and the only way to cancel the retrieval is by not paying for it when Secret Plans is out. No Sense or Alter with this objective, O side adds 4 to draw for Sense & Alter and the 7 side prevents DS from playing them. Since most of the game is spent on the 0 side, they are normally not seen. This objective has always been one that plays defensively. There are many different ways to play with this objective, but you really have to decide two things if you choose to play it. The first is how high of a Jedi Test you want to train; between 1 to 6.  Second, is if you are going to use Daughter of a Skywalker or Luke (my favorite version is EPP because when you use him offensively, then it is nice to always have his lightsaber when you take him back into hand with the objective.) The most common versions of this deck will play a hit and run ground force until they can flip and start pounding on the DS with auto 6 or 7 destiny draws with Jedi Test 5. Permanent Weapon characters are very common in this deck because of the card slots. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This objective will usually have already won before it has flipped; the best way to play this deck is to have them in the hole when you have the power to completely finish them off. It is just hard getting to that point. Once Jedi Test 1 is completed, the DS has a much harder chance of hurting the LS, unless they have counter cards for canceling force drain bonuses. Bane Malar (V7) can protect one planet site and also allows the site with Ree Yees to be protected. As each test is completed, you are able to fight the DS easier until finally you have the super destiny draw. Cards like Mace Windu (V9) and Han, Chewie, and the Falcon are power houses once you have a 7 on test 5. The common way to win with this deck is to cause fast damage early at high drain locations, like at Kessel, and attacking the DS fast to keep them from stocking characters on all of their sites. It is very important not to get beatdown from high amounts of direct damage and overflow. Early card loss can sometimes put key cards in your lost pile. Retrieval is very important for this deck to win, because so many of this decks cards are meant for testing and defense, you will not have room to stop all of the drains and direct damage that the DS can throw out. This objective provides the best set up to play The Signal (v8) because there are so many cards that can be pulled and started that you need. Obis Apparition can be started with MWYHL against Huntdown to give them a mere 3 Force total activation first turn. And they have to waste guys on the Executor in order to get the activation back. This is awesome since you need time to set up as well.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: A new strategy I found from playing this objective recently involves using Asteroids and Asteroids Dont Concern Me, ADCM (V5). The build starts that effect with The Way of Things. The key is to set up Home One at one Asteroid and either a loaded Falcon with Captain Han and Chewie (V10) or Luke Skywalker (V1) on R2 in Red 5 with a Flight Suit. The three of those ships can in no way be blown up with Asteroid destiny. You play Thrown Back (non v) to track the 3rd Asteroid sector so you can auto kill ANY ship, even the Executor. Daughter is used to train fully. The whole game you will have steady drains at the sectors and ADCM (V5) will cause 2 to 3 direct damage all game. Hiding in the Garbage (non V) is used to get important cards early. You play standard MWYHL set up, but this version has NO ground. You simply handle what they deal out with two Projection of a Skywalker and all bonuses gone to Test 1. <br />
<br />
MWYHL did not see much help with V10 or V11, but recently got two new cards in V12 that have opened up new options for this objective. At Peace (V12) totally changes how this deck is built. The card, which can already be pulled by the objective, allows you to play your Jedi Tests from underneath your Starting Effect. This opens up two to six card slots in your deck as well as always gives you the test right there ready to play. Plus you no longer have to play with the Dagobah: Training Area. No danger that the one test you need is in your Force pile or lost to an early drain. It also allows you to simply lose 2 Force to cancel a creature attack, so you no longer need to include the Yodas Gimmer Stick if you fear creatures. Finally, the card allows you to put Daughter back in your deck so you are not forced to play with more than one should you get her in your opening hand (The rule being that you couldnt deploy her to train in MWYHL when she didnt come from your Reserve Deck). While not exclusively a MWYHL helper, another card in V12 is It is the Future You See (V12) which totally changes how this deck can be played. The new virtual Jedi test is played in place of a starting interrupt. The card requires that you play only one starting location that isnt from Special Edition or Coruscant. You are required to start Battle Plan, Do or Do Not, and any Immune to Alter Effect. From there, the card gets a little crazy. You must decide before you draw your opening hand if the card will be played as Jedi or Agent of Evil. The Jedi path allows you to place cards from your hand face up on the card to be used in place of Force from your Force pile. The cards are considered used when you turn them over, then turned face up again at the beginning of your next turn. This is also a new way around Battle Plan because you have a permanent force pile that can in no way be altered by the opponent, so even if you have just one force left, you can continue to pay for your drains. The Agent of Evil path plays on opponents side of table. The Agent allows you to immediately take into hand ANY Luke and ANY site, so you already have two keys to a strategy before the game starts. The down side is the Agent part gives the opponent +3 to total battle and duel destinies. Both cards should boost this objective into the top tier decks, but it is too early to tell for now. This new Test 5 has finally made MWYHL a viable option for LS. Because you go first, the LS now has a new way to play a TRMs style deck. You also can set up Luke (V10) at Beggers Canyon first turn, meaning the DS has to start the game having to pay 1 Force to draw or retrieve a card. When you combine this with the ability to get Test 1 going to reduce drains, MWYHL has become a very powerful option for LS.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Its very movie like. The deck really makes you feel like you are playing out scenes from the movie. If you get really good at flipping fast, you will have the ability to clear a site very easily with just one character. The three most popular ways to track a destiny for Test 5 are Traffic Control, Thrown Back (non v), and Episode I Threepio. Thrown Back is great because you can put up to three cards down during both players control phase. If you are able to shut down their drains and damage, you can literally choose when the game is over. Since you can complete shut down their damage with Test 1, Projection of a Skywalker, and retrieval, this objective has the most timed games. It has the power to stay alive for a very long time if played correctly which makes for long games. If you are looking for a deck that has a good chance of getting a timed win, this one is your best bet. Some popular versions of this deck play Bargawins and high destiny devices to keep constant retrieval during both turns that can get around direct damage from Search & Destroy. At Peace (V12) has really opened this deck open to more options. And IITFYS (V12) now lets you go first in the game to start the testing before the DS even gets going. With the new options for this deck, you should see it being played more often in major tournaments. Just so you know, even though At Peace (V12) has a built in way to cancel creature attacks, you will lose the game if you have to lose 2 Force each turn (LS and DS) from attacking creatures. If you fear creatures, you have to continue to play Yodas Gimmer Stick. The Advanced Rules document caused the rules on creatures to change.  The impact of the new creature rules is still to be felt but the new rules make it less likely youll have to worry about creatures for some time. <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: This is, in my opinion, the second most difficult LS objective to flip. It used to take a minimum of six turns and that was if you got Yoda, a Skywalker, Dagobah: Training Area site, Test 1, the Backpack, and Yoda&#39;s Hope out first turn. Many of those cards could be in your Force pile and you will need at least 5 Force to have enough to deploy both characters even if Bad Feeling Have I was not out. Since At Peace (V12) speeds up the process a bit, the deck is now much stronger, but can still take a long time to get going. This is also a bad objective for causing damage, so even though you are not losing much Force, you arent causing the DS to lose Force either. Many things can cause this deck to lose; creatures eating your characters on Dagobah, the DS bringing down a power party to Dagobah by loading up a ship like Hound&#39;s Tooth and landing on a site that you have to be at to complete a test, missing the tracking which puts a crap destiny on test 5, or the DS causing too much damage too fast before you can get going. SYCFA Fear has been this decks worst matchup for the past few years because it cant handle both the Fear damage and space drains. Direct damage that cannot be stopped really hurts this deck. Huntdown, Walkers, SYCFA Fear, BHBM, Occupation Effects, Search and Destroy, Black Sun, and Watto all deal out consistent direct damage that can easily cripple you before you have flipped. Pick your battles well because overflow from battle can also kill this deck fast. Your only hope when playing against decks that cause a lot of damage is to set up some extra retrieval. On the Edge with Flash of Insight (V5) is great. On the Edge is a great card to play after you have flipped because you would get an auto 6 every time. Oh, and watch out when retrieving cards. You cant use any character on Dagobah or your objective is out of play. Another reason not to play this deck is it deploys A LOT of cards to the table. The average win with this deck is usually in the teens. If you totally stop the DS damage, and have good amounts of retrieval, it can win by 25+.  <br />

02 * Hidden Base (HB) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text (Correct with Errata): <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Rendezvous Point.  <br />
Place a planet system (with a parsec number from 1 to 8) from Reserve Deck face down on your side of table (not in play); that card indicates the planet where your Hidden Base is located. While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from each of your Force drains at systems and sectors. Flip this card any time after you have deployed five battleground systems and your Hidden Base <br />
system. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, to draw a card from Force Pile, opponent must first use 1 Force. For each battleground system you control, you may cancel one opponents Force drain (limit twice per turn). You may not deploy any systems. At each system opponent occupies during any deploy phase, opponent may probe there by placing one card from hand face down beneath that system. Place out of play if Hidden Base system is probed; Dark Side places probe cards in Used Pile (and may retrieve 1 Force for each Probe Droid used to probe).  <br />
 <br />
***If your Hidden Base is a battleground system, deploying it counts as one of the 5 battleground systems you must deploy to meet the flip condition.*** <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Rebel Planners (V6), An Unusual Amount of Fear, Kessel, Squadron Assignments and/or Maneuvering Flaps (V4), version of the Falcon, X-Wing Swarm, Corellian Corvettes, Quad Cannons, Lots of starships, Retrieval Effects <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Very cool objective. This deck has been in play since it was released. Two versions even made it to the final table of Worlds in &#39;99 & &#39;00, and it is still providing a difficult game for many DS decks to this day. A lot of how this deck wins is by flipping early and causing heavy drains before the DS can set up their space. As each new set has come out, this deck has merely added to how it plays out. For years, the DS had a much harder time finding the hidden base until the powerful bounty hunter ships and Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator came to town. When playing with this deck, you have two choices. The first is flipping ASAP before they can even find their space. You put a damper on their game early by causing them to pay for every card they draw. Currently you can flip very easily now with all of the new V cards. In one turn, if you have both Mon Mothma (V9) and Romas (V4) out, you can deploy 4 systems. The other two coming from the objective and underneath your starting effect (read Rebel Planners (V6)). The second way to play the deck, is to get the DS to set up their space early before you have flipped and then beatdown their ships so they have no more space in their deck leaving you flipped the rest of the game. That would allow you to lock them out from drawing up, giving you time to completely retrieve your lost pile if designed to do so. In most games, you will usually find a happy medium between flipping early and waiting til they throw you some ships. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: There are so many ways to play this Objective. Some choose to play entirely space, while others use it for a platform to run a different strategy that may even be a platform to play a TRM-style mains deck. The main reason it stays strong is because the DS has a much harder time beating down in space verse ground. This is because the LS have more ways to both attack and run away. Plus there are very few cards that can reduce a starships forfeit. Cards like Houjix, Hyper Escape, Out of Nowhere, Organized Attack, S-Foils, and Alternatives to Fighting are all very common in all versions of this deck. There are also five cards that can retrieve in space pretty easily. They are Luke Skywalker (V1), Kessel Run, Rycar&#39;s Run, Our Most Desperate Hour, All Wings Report In, Slayn & Korpil Facilities, and Bargawins. A common way to play the deck deploys Kirdo III and uses the system&#39;s text to pull the <> desert and Sandwhirl. Next, you get Commander Luke (V4) on Rogue 1 and stay protected under the Sandwhirl for getting around Battle Order, Search & Destroy, Huntdown, and Black Sun. You could also use Luke Skywalker (V1) since he still retrieves when piloting at a battleground. This tech also keeps Huntdown flipped because Luke is on the ground. Another trick you can do is only play systems that are parsecs higher than seven and lower than three so that the DS gets some of their ships stuck on half the systems. The only ship that has hyperspeed 6 is Mauls Sith Infiltrator. When deciding what space to go with, you have many options. You can do non-uniques with X-Wings, Y-Wings, B-Wings OR the usual capitals like Home One, Spiral, Bright Hope (V6), Tantive IV (V7), OR matching pilots/ships. Some use a mixture of all three. The key is to make sure to match whatever ships to red cards because the red cards are what make them powerful.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to Hidden Base was the creation of the Corellian Corvette + Quad Laser Cannon deck. The entire space package is almost complete non-unique vettes. The idea behind the deck is to completely knock the DS out of space, flip, and retrieve the lost pile with Luke Skywalker (V1). This is done by combining cards like Corellian Engineering Corp, Sorry About the Mess Combo, and the Admirals Order Taking Them With Us. CEC allows your Quads to deploy for free and adds +2. The Quads are called blasters in their lore, so you can use the add +3 with SATM Combo. Then the AO gives every ship that has a weapon, battle destiny unless able to otherwise and allows you to lower the defense value of any capital ship by 4. So with all the additional support cards, you auto hit everything even the Executor. Plus the Quads themselves add +1 when targeting a starfighter. Since they cant draw up their last Force card, you have the ability to completely retrieve your lost pile as long as they are not doing too much direct damage. With completely no direct damage, you would only need Luke Skywalker (V1) to retrieve one force a turn. If you can set up Battle Plan and knock all of their ships out of space they will not be able to do anything but sit there and watch as their loss of 10 becomes 33. This deck is now at tier 1 being played in current tournaments. As a new way to play the deck, you can also play with Medium Bulk Freighters in place of the Vettes since they deploy for only 2 and are hyperspeed 6 thanks to CEC. They can be a great choice for the current meta since they deploy and move like starfighers, they can deploy into the Clouds because they are still capital ships, which cannot be targeted by Tallon Roll or SFS Laser Cannons. Only a few cards can hurt this deck, and no DS deck can just automatically beat it. The other change was in the Redux of the virtual cards that removed the ability to reduce a drain to zero that was on Rebel Planners (V6). So now, the DS can set up drains with Bane Malar (V7) that can never be canceled. The best answer to this is set up at three battlegrounds, and get out Ultimatum, so after your Luke retrieval, you are only losing 1.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This strong LS space platform has a very high record of wins against Huntdown, Bring Him Before Me, ISB, and even Scum. Not very many ground decks are built around this objective. You truly have to love space decks and playing with starships. This is a very good deck for having a steady place to drain the whole game. Only an equally large DS space deck will be able to stop all the drains. CCT and SYCFA are the two solid match-ups. The biggest reason to play this deck is because it has the ability to lock out the opponent from drawing up since they have to pay to draw. This is one of the few decks that can turn a small differential win into a very large one. The LS has some really great drain systems with Kessel for three, Coruscant (SE) for three, Kiffix for two, and Naboo for two. The vast majority of DS decks dont play heavy space because the DS has more options for ground-based decks. So playing HB gives you an automatic advantage even if you arent playing weapons. With the introduction of Mauls Sith Infiltrator, the DS has the option of building decks with just a few ships that allow them to satisfy Battle Plan even if you could knock most of them off the table. The objective provides you a built in way to both keep them from drawing up, and to cancel of two Force drains. Since Battle Plan/Order Defensive Shields are so easy to play, the DS goes to space much faster than they used to.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Because of its long lasting ability, many cards have been made that really give it problems. Security Precautions combined with Maul&#39;s Sith Infiltrator can almost auto find your hidden base. It takes no battle damage at systems it has probed and is totally immune to attrition. It can also cloak if it fears weapons. Plus, more DS decks are starting to include Cease Fire to get around the SATM Combo shooting Maul during Control phase. Search & Destroy can also hurt this deck if it can be set up early enough. The current versions of this deck have ways around many of these problem cards, so you will see HB still running strong. No Target is what really makes this deck amazing because it can totally prevent the opponent from moving for one full LS/DS turn. Its a Used interrupt and is 5 destiny. There are many Interrupts that make Hidden Base great, so if the DS isnt playing multiple grabbers, you can usually abuse them all game.  <br />

03 * Rescue the Princess (RTP) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Detention Block Corridor (with Leia of ability <4 imprisoned there), Docking Bay 327, Yavin 4: Docking Bay and Yavin 4: War Room.  <br />
While this side up, your spies, 8D8, Revolution, Death Star Plans and Detention Block Control Room may not deploy to Death Star. Cards that release captives are immune to Sense and Alter. May not play Nabrun Leids. Flip this card of you move Leia to Yavin 4: War Room. Place out of play if Leia is lost from table (you may not deploy Death Star Plans for remainder of game). <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, for opponent to initiate a Force drain, opponent must use +1 force, During Battle, opponents unique (.) characters, vehicles and starships lost from table are placed out of play; Leia adds one battle destiny; attrition against opponent is +2; and Imperials, Dark Jedi and Imperial starships lose all immunity to attrition. Flip if Leia is captured. Place out of play if Leia is lost from table.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Cell 2187 (V3), Prisoner 2187, R2-D2 (V3), Life Tubes, EPPs, Fambaas, On the Edge, Bacta Tank, Han Chewie & Falcon  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind the deck: Another movie objective right out of A New Hope. This deck is one of the three least played of all LS Objectives. The main reason is because it simply CANNOT win unless Leia is freed successfully and taken to the War Room to flip the objective. To do this, you must get specific characters to her site. The objective itself prevents deployment of Spies and 8D8 to Death Star. You may not play Nabrun Leids. So you literally have to deploy to Yavin and march on over. Once she is freed, you have to get her three sites away before the DS comes with all guns blazing to kill or re-capture her. Once she reaches the War Room, you finally flip and stay that way until Leia goes down in flames. Luckily, if you play with Prisoner 2187, your objective stays in play the whole game, unlike the way it was printed. In the old days, players won with this deck by playing tons of high destiny droids. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: It wins if it stays flipped because it is truly the MOST powerful LS flip side in the game today. That is why it is so hard to flip. ALL characters, starships, and vehicles that the DS loses from table are placed OUT OF PLAY!! To make this easier for the LS to do, they also said that all immunity to attrition for all Imperial starships and Dark Jedi is gone. No more Executor, Vader, Maul or even Palpatine and Sidious. Oh, and just in case you draw bad destiny, the objective also gives you +2 to attrition which means in every single battle, the DS is going to place something out of play unless they can cancel or prevent the destiny draw. The best way to play this deck is with EPPS or Quick Draw (V9) to keep the lightsabers in the deck. Weapons and destiny are what this deck is all about, killing characters on the table so they never return. The problem is so much of the deck is built for getting Leia to the War Room that many times you can flip the objective, but the DS has done too much damage to make it possible for the LS to win.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: At the moment, this objective continues to be an unviable tournament deck. The DS is still way too strong and the game is way too fast now. There is almost no way the LS can hope to win with this deck if it takes more than three turns to flip. The newest idea for this deck I have heard includes playing many copies of Artoo, Brave Little Droid because he isnt a spy. Since Cell 2187 (V3) says Artoo just has to be at the Jail during your Control Phase, Artoo, BLD can deploy directly to the Death Star: Docking Bay and move in front of her immediately on your first turn. The downfall is you have to play enough copies of Artoo, Come Back At Once from Cloud City to make sure you get him in your opening hand. Then you still have the problem of getting her to the War Room safely. Besides using Lift Tubes, Fambas, and Speeders, you can start Rycar (V2) to pull Mercenary Armor (V7), which makes her a Spy. The same card also pulls Undercover (V3), so you can immediately make her Undercover and safe from battle. This keeps her save for at least a turn, so you have that extra time to find just one way to move her on your next turn. During their turn you move her to Docking Bay, your turn, break cover during deploy phase, use any one vehicle to transit, then use her landspeed to move into the War Room. All of this is not auto, and you can still lose from bad draws or stuff being in your Force pile. Plus if they are already at the DS docking bay, they can Sniper or Hutt Smooch her while she is Undercover. Until new V cards are made, the best option for getting to the War Room fast is still the On the Edge + Bacta Tank trick that is listed in the below section.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Truly a different playing experience. This is an objective that many good players have little game experience against. You will have a good element of surprise by playing this at a tournament. Many times, you will find players that normally beat everything popular, can forget the part of the flip sides text so that after Maul just got hit with a lightsaber hes sent out of play. Anyone that can win consistently with this deck would be considered one of the best players ever since it can still lose even if built perfectly. Many have tried for years to make this deck tournament viable. One idea includes starting Bargaining Table (V8) to pull Laudica (V8). Use her to pull Echo Base Garrison, which then pulls the Bacta Tank. You then play On the Edge targetting a just freed Prisoner 2187 and guess wrong, which should be done during your deploy phase. She then goes to the Bacta Tank and because she is 0 to deploy, can re-deploy for free to the War Room in the same turn, thus completely missing all possible DS attacks. You still have the problem of finding the stuff to get Artoo over to the Death Star and having the On the Edge in hand. Plus, they can also Sense the darn thing.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: This objective truly is the #1 MOST difficult objective to flip. Four cards can AUTO kill this deck; Ephant Mon, Look Sir, Droids, Restraining Bolt, and Droid Detector. All of these cards just prevent any of the key characters (mainly R2 and 8D8) that can free Leia from ever getting to her. Plus you also have to worry about The Emperor (V6) deploying to the Jail or the DS docking bay first turn and shocking R2 or Leia. These days, you most likely will only see Ephant Mon and the Emperor (V6), so you have a chance if you can knock them off the table. You only have one or two turns before the DS just piles a good size number of characters on either the Detention Block or the docking bay, the opponent will almost always be able to kill or re-capture Leia. There are even accounts of people using Bombers to collapse the docking bay so Leia will never be able to move into the War Room. SYCFA Fear (Any Version) just auto beats this deck. They will be totally set up in space by the time you even get close to flipping. You will be taking way too much damage too fast to stop. Most versions of SYCFA play so many Star Destroyers, it doesnt matter if you put one out of play. This deck cannot be played at a major tournament because it completely relies on flipping to win the game, so if you are never able to flip, you will never win a game.  <br />

04 * Datooine Base Operations (DBO) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Dantooine system.  <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy from Reserve Deck to Dantooine one site or non-unique Rebel; reshuffle. At Dantooine locations, each Imperial is deploy +2. Flip this card if Rebels control at least three Dantooine sites and opponent controls no Dantooine locations. Place out of play if Dantooine is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. At Dantooine locations, each Imperial is deploy +2. Your squadrons may deploy to Dantooine (deploy cost = squadrons power -3), are immune to attrition <4 and may draw one battle destiny if not able to otherwise. Your Force drains are +1 at systems where you have a squadron present. Flip this card if opponent controls at least two Dantooine locations. Place out of play if Dantooine is blown away <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: <> sites, They&#39;re On Datooine (V3), Multiples of either X, B, or Y Squadrons, lots of Rebels. <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is one of those very weird ideas that was created back in &#39;98 when the objectives were first released. It also falls in the category of top three least played. This deck lets you deploy squadrons for a straight amount of force without having to replace your other starships. To flip, you must control three Datooine sites with &quot;Rebels&quot; and opponent may not control ANY Datooine locations. Not always that easy. The only thing the objective does on the 0 side is let you deploy the <> sites and a non-unique rebel from reserve. To somewhat help you, it makes deployment for Imperials +2 to all Datooine locations. Once flipped, ALL darkside force drains are -1 and the Imperials still deploy +2. The rest of the 7 side is all about the Squadrons, giving them immunity < 4 as well as the ability to draw a battle destiny. You also get +1 force drains at systems where you have a squadron. Nothing about this objective is that powerful. You dont really get that much help from your objective if you should happen to win a game.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Well, that is the thing, it doesn&#39;t win that much. The objective was simply designed with having to do too much to keep it flipped. It runs around doing things in space, yet you still have to put in enough ground to hold the sites so that it doesn&#39;t flip back. The only prayer this deck has is with They&#39;re on Datooine (V3), the only V card that was made strictly to help this objective. It allows you to deploy the squadrons in the same way that the 7 side does, only you don&#39;t have to be flipped. The effect also provides help with activation by making all the Datooine locations +1 force generation. The newer versions of this deck have tried to use the squadrons for beatdown and the protective side of the Datooine sites to hide out. Once Goo Nee Tay is out, Imperials have a much harder time deploying. The problem is that there are so many powerful Aliens and of course Darth Maul that are not affected by the objective. Any version of this deck that has won, will usually be one that is playing Speeders on the ground with T-47 Battle Formation, or is beat to win without having to flip.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Since no one talks about or even cares about this objective, it continues to receive no help from V cards. Since no one talks about this objective, it never comes up as a deck to fix. The best helper for this deck would be an Effect that would either allow the LS to go first so it could set up some activation before the DS had a turn OR keep it from flipping back. Then it could be built strong enough on one platform either space or ground to be competitive. Since this objective is just as bad as the original QMC and AITC, it would need the same kind of help that both those decks got from Keeping the Empire Out Forever and Yarna dal Gargan (V8). If anything, this deck got worse with the Re Edit because Theyre On Datooine (V3) lost the ability to pull a Squadron once per turn. That was the best thing going for this deck as it was. The only remote help to this deck was the new V12 card, It is the Future You See (V12), which allows the LS to go first, and provides a way to get some extra activation early. The problem is that you are required to start Battle Plan and Do or Do Not as two of your three starting effects, so you dont have the ability to start both Theyre On Datooine (V3) and a way to auto flip.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Another deck that could win purely based on your opponent having a lack of experience against it. Many players go into this game thinking it will be an auto win, only to find that the game was harder than they expected purely because they are never sure what the deck will be doing. This objective has not seen very much major action, so it is a very good objective for the surprise factor. In a major tournament, the DS player will be picking up many of your cards to read them and, for most of the game, be trying to figure out what your strategy might be. As mentioned earlier, this deck provides a great option for a beatdown deck with squadrons. The X-Wing Squadron deploys for 6 with this deck, and currently has printed power of 9. When you add helper Effects like Incom Corporation, they become power 12 each. Then Organized Attack makes them immune to attrition and power 15 each. Although you want to have them already in play for they become higher deploy since they say power -3. Finally, you can play S-Foils to make each X-Wing Squadron power 21. When you think about it, why arent more people playing this deck? Even if you just play with the Organized Attacks, they can still be a powerful attack force. The speed of the game is why this deck has stayed in the binder so long. The deck only activates 2 Force on its first turn, so when it goes up against Huntdown, you could have already lost 10 cards in damage before it is ready to deploy a Squadron. Speeders with matching pilots is your best bet or piling up characters at a Forest to drain for free.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Because it is very very weak. This deck needs more help than any other objective for either side (besides maybe RTP and WYS (V8)). It just doesn&#39;t do enough to make it worth the time or effort. There has never been a good version posted on Decktech as an example of how to play it. Truly, if a V card should be made, this objective needs one very badly. It would almost be worth just Ving the whole objective and starting fresh. The main reason to not play it is the card slots. You have to play with both ground and space, with enough to stay alive in both areas. The DS is way too strong and Darth Maul will continually be killing off Rebels on the sites. Brave souls play this deck in tournaments.  <br />

05 * Local Uprising (NON V) (Operatives) *R.I.P* <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any planet system and one <> site to that system. This system is the Subjugated planet. <br />
While this side up, once during each of the deploy phases, you may deploy one <> site to the Subjugated planet from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if your matching operatives control at least three battlegrounds sites related to the Subjugated planet.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. You may retrieve 1 Froce whenever you deploy a matching operative to the Subjugated planet. Your matching operatives on that planet are each forfeit +2 and, when at same site as an Imperial or AT-AT, are each power +2. When you have at least one matching operative in a battle on the Subjugated planet, you may add one battle destiny. Flip this card if you do not occupy at least two battleground sites related to the Subjugated planet.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: A very stupid idea by Decipher. At first, the idea was to play a deck with 25 of your planets operatives because they were broke on their planet. Basic it worked like this. Your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all DS drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against an Imperial. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. The reason this objective was even made was because Lucas denied the creation for some of the card designs only weeks before the release of Special Edition. To fix this last minute problem, the Operative strategy was added without ANY play testing.  <br />
 <br />
SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. They also no longer have presence, so they cant control a site by themselves. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that we all wish they had never made. It won the &#39;98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea. <br />

06 * Rebel Strike Team (RST) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Endor system and Rebel Landing Site.  <br />
While this side up, opponent loses no more than 1 force from each of your Force drains at Endor locations. Once during each of your deploy phases, may use 2 force to take one Bunker or Deactivate The Shield Generator into hand; reshuffle. Flip this card if Bunker blown away or if, during your move phase, you control three exterior Endor sites (with two Rebel scouts at each) Place out of play if Endor blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at each Endor site where you have a Rebel scout, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent, except by a react. Rebel scouts are immune to attrition <4. Once during each of your draw phases, may retrieve one Rebel scout of ability <3. Your Epic Event destiny draws are each +2. Flip this card (unless blown away) if, during opponents move phase, opponent controls three exterior Endor sites or Endor system. Place out of play if Endor is blown away. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Strike Planning, General Crix Madine/ Mon Mothma (V9), General Solo (V9), Luke, Rebel Scout (V9), Lots of Scouts and Endor sites, and The Shield Is Down! (if blowing the bunker), Back Door Effects from V9 <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This deck is all about the Scouts, hanging out on Endor. Another great movie objective, that puts you right at the front of the Back Door ready to blow the Bunker. If you are going to play this objective, you have to decide up front if you are going to blow the bunker, because this deck plays out very differently if you choose not to. The 0 side is very basic, just letting you pull the bunker and the epic event that blows the bunker. Your drains are restricted to one per site until you flip. In order to flip, you either blow the bunker or control three exterior Endor sites with two Rebel scouts at each. Once flipped, your scouts gain immunity < 4 to attrition, your drains at sites with a scout are protected from being modified or cancelled, and you get to retrieve a scout of ability < 3 during your draw phase. For as long as this objective has been out, it has never been a major option for LS. The main reason was it never had many options for the way it could be built and still win. Even today, you dont see it being played that often. There have been new V cards to help it but with how fast the game is now, the slowness of this objective make it hard to play. Plus nothing about the objective really hurts the DS, so many dont take the time to playtest the possibilities.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Previously, this objective won if it was built to be a mains and toys deck on Endor. It could get a lot of scouts out quickly with General Madine and set up good damage, which was hard to disrupt. Since it was so hard to blow the shields with the original design, this version was the only one you ever saw. Then it got a little help from the Tatooine Set with The Shield Is Down! You get a huge bonus to blowing the shields. After it is blown, you get an 8 Force swing (you retrieve 8 & DS loses 8) by having played both TSID! and the epic event. It also makes the DS put their ENTIRE hand in used pile. This is a huge ability in the game because they lose an entire turn of possibilities since they dont have ANY cards to play with until the end of their next turn. Once the shield is gone, the rest of the game is spent draining and fighting off the DS. The good thing is the objective cant be flipped if you blew the shields (unless they blow up Endor with the Death Star). Even though TSID made the deck worth playing, it was still way too hard to set up. Now, the deck has been given a whole new world with the introduction of the V9 cards. The set provides a good six cards that can be used to blow the bunker much faster (General Solo (V9), Luke, Rebel Scout (V9), I Wonder Who They Found (V9), That&#39;s One (V9), Count Me In (V9), and I&#39;m With You Too (V9)). The whole idea of this objective has changed. Now it can set up a whole beatdown party that is almost untouchable. Once set up, it can just march on over and blow up the bunker with very little problem.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to this deck was the Redux changing the power of the broken (V9) Back Door Effects and Scout Luke (V9) from deploying for free. The most recent sets have introduced helper cards for Troopers, but currently no one has posted a viable tournament version of this objective. The death of the Back Door Effects has changed peoples opinion of Endor for LS. The most well know strategy for this deck is using Close Air Support with Tala 1 & 2 from DSII to set up solid presence in space as well as provide added destinies in battle on the ground. There are currently enough good Effects out there that can set up this deck well on a regular bases, only the deck doesnt always set up good damage since you cant drain for more than 1 until after you flip. For the time being, there have not been many advanced ideas for this objective.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This objective had been reawakened for a period with V9, but now doesnt seem all that popular after the Re Edit. The best thing going for it is still The Shield Is Down! The 8 Force swing is like Walkers blowing away the Main Power Generators only better. And the new, updated (V9) Back Door Effects still provide the LS with protection from early beatdown while they try and blow the shield. Another great example of an objective that has not been seen much for years, so you have the ability to surprise a few players with something different as well as powerful. It is possible that Faithful Service (V12), which makes all non-pilot warriors of destiny >1 from Hoth, Endor, or DSII into troopers, could make this deck better. It also says you can put back all your troopers on table right before the last card is removed from opponents life force. The seven side does provide some powerful ability by protecting all your force drains and giving immunity <4 to all Rebel Scouts. Since you can now play the Trooper helper cards with the Scouts. You can combine cards like Rebel Ambush to give all Troopers power +1 and total immunity to attrition. More options for this deck may come around as more players take a second look at this objective but right now its too early to tell.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest fear this deck has is still CCT because the whole idea behind setting up the V9 Effects is getting General Solo (V9) out early and then using him to set up the beatdown party. CCT will start the game with him Frozen in prison, so your whole strategy is put on hold until you can free Han. The DS is now playing the IG-88 (V5) version of CCT, which is very hard for this deck to beat. The game is also very fast now and decks like SYCFA Fear, that can set up BIG damage fast, finish this deck off before it can get started. The deck just doesnt have a great way of doing good damage after the shield is blown. When deciding to play this deck or not, you have to take into account how difficult playing against those objectives would be. The main reason to stay away from this objective is that it is still not very popular. Unless you want to feel adventurous, I would stick to decks you know more about.  <br />

07 * Quiet Mining Colony (QMC) <br />

 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Bespin system and one Cloud City battleground site.  <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may use 1 force to deploy a site (or cloud sector) to Bespin from your Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent loses no more than 1 force from each of your Force drains at Bespin locations. Flip this card if opponent controls no Bespin locations and you control Bespin: Cloud City and at least two Cloud City sites (one if Lando or Lobot on Cloud City). Place out of play if Bespin is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your aliens, cloud cars and independent starships are immune to attrition <4. At each Bespin location you control with an alien, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent. Your independent starships deploy -1. Once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy one docking bay from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if opponent controls Bespin system (or three Cloud City sites and/or Bespin cloud sectors).  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Keeping The Empire Out Forever, Beldons Eye (V6), Aliens, Bespin, Cloud City locations, Falcon, Outrider, Dash, Path of Least Resistance, Off the Edge, Pucumir Thryss, Strike Planning, Uh-Oh (V7), Tuskan Breath Mask (V8), Musicians <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Originally a very hard objective to flip, making it an almost never played card. Then Tatooine released Keeping The Empire Out Forever, which completely changed this deck and made it a very very popular Objective. KTEOF allows you to flip by only having to control two sites (dont have to be battlegrounds) and just occupy Bespin system, once flipped it cant be flipped back. Also, if that wasnt enough, the Effect allows you to search your Force pile and take ANY one card every turn. With KTEOF now being played, players can flip much easier and get a bonus that made it worth playing this objective. The only problem was it can sometimes be hard to find a ship to occupy Bespin. So, to fix the problem, the PC allowed the creation of Beldons Eye (V6), which lets you deploy an independent starfighter and a matching alien pilot for free from hand and/or Reserve. Then the Redux changed the free to -1 for each. You can easily build the deck to flip first turn, and play the entire game searching your Force pile for that key card.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck wins by the LS player being able to react to what the DS is playing by searching through their Force Pile and always finding what is needed at the right time. There are many ways to play with this deck; Mains and Toys, Run Around and Drain, Heavy Space, and the most recent, the Tuskan Breath Mask (V8) set up with all aliens. The most common strategy with this deck is to deploy 2 to 4 sites. Then you put enough space on Bespin to keep from ever being knocked off. You can set up Cloud City Celebration and Off the Edge for consistent retrieval. You play a hit and run strategy with Path of Least Resistance, Rebel Barrier, Narrow Escape, Houjix, and Its a Trap. All of those cards can be found very easily and then retrieved to be played again and again. Pucumir Thryss from Jabbas Palace is very common in this deck too because he adds +1 to all Force drains at CC sites. He can also download a non-unique Rebel to same site during your deploy phase. <br />
<br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to this deck was the Re Edit changing Beldons Eye (V6) and Tuskan Breath Mask (V8). Now you have to choose whether you want the destiny draw or soak of damage on the 7 side. They also changed Tuskan Breath Mask to deploy on table rather than on a location, so you cant find it with Wokling (V3) anymore. Plus TBM (V8) is no longer immune to Alter. The deck now requires many aliens to work and has trouble affording the extra slots to both pull the TBM (V8) and protect it. You also have to have more evasion since you cant draw destiny and soak. If you see this deck these days, it will most likely be a mains and toys version with Main characters, usually EPPs. The LS may still go with aliens and you will see Uh-Oh (V7) and musicians setting up solid retrieval to go with the Celebration. Currently, one of the most popular DS decks is the IG-88 (V5) start with CCT. QMC has a hard problem winning with the DS reacting the same way while removing both Lando and Han from your options. The downside to the IG-88 (V5) deck is they give up their starting effects, while you still get yours. Plus the current builds will not be able to handle your space, so you will keep presence at Bespin all game. This means you should have Celebration going most of the game. The TBM version is not gone. Aliens deploy cheap and work well with all the evasion with CC. You can play All My Urchins (V5) while all your ability on table is aliens, Han (except HC&F), and cloud cars; you may place a just forfeited character in used pile. When you combine this with 2-1B (V4), you can keep two characters a turn in your deck that gets forfeited in battle. 2-1B (V4) says any Lost character at same or related site. Then you still have TBM (V8) absorbing 7 in battle damage OR giving you a battle destiny. The alien based version is still a playable deck.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: For years, it was a very solid deck for LS. The Tuskan Breath Mask (V8) version really used a lot of what this objective was designed for with all of your aliens gaining Immunity of <4. Combined with Ellors Madak (V8), it made it very hard to kill a character. Since the Re Edit and creation of Frozen Dinner (V11), the alien based version has taken a big hit. You will still see this objective at random tournaments but it is currently not the strongest option for LS. Even if you dont play the alien version, Keeping The Empire Out Forever will always make this deck appealing. It can set up very very fast and have a very good chance of lasting out even against a tough DS deck. The whole deck takes place on Cloud City, so you never have to fear cards that target planet sites, like Always Thinking with Your Stomach or Walkers. If you play Insurrection, Ellis Helrot will never be able to move any characters to your sites. With the popularity of this objective in the past four years, there are many different versions posted on Decktech that can be used as a blueprint, unlike less popular objectives. It is very easy for a newer player to learn to play well because you dont have to worry about trying to track a card in your Force pile. This objective is also one of the best for setting up retrieval. Since you can pull any card from your Force pile during any phase on both the LS and the DS turns, there are many different strategies that can be built around QMC. Remember to watch out for Do They Have a Code Clearance? DS shield, which can grab the Off The Edge and then reduce further retrieval by X, where X is the number of cards stacked. If you fear this shield, make sure to have retrieval from Effects set up so you dont have to rely on the Off The Edge.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: This deck can sometimes take a long time to win. It doesnt always keep steady drains going the whole game, so the DS isnt always finished off in a timely fashion. The biggest problem is the deck requires you to keep presence in space, mainly Bespin in order to win. If the DS is able to knock you off the system, you will have a much harder time paying for drains, retrieval, and deployment of new characters and starships. Currently, SYCFA Fear and DS Senate are two very hard match-ups for QMC. It is very important to include a Scrambled Transmission (V5) if you fear DS Senate in your area. Since V8 Scum has changed, you dont have to fear the one turn beatdown from Jabba and his friends as much when you are playing Insurrection. Flipping is the most important part, so most versions of this deck only have what is needed for space, while the rest of the deck supports the ground. Any DS deck that can throw a lot of space at Bespin will give QMC problems. The IG deck is very popular now, so QMC may not be the best option since the DS starts the Force Pile search from turn one. QMC requires you to control the sites in order to flip, so if you deploy your site and cant flip first turn, you will may have trouble flipping later. You do have the advantage in space but will not be able to stop Tat Maul and Ship to prevent the DS from keeping presence as well. It will come down to the playing ability and luck in the game to decide who wins. For the time being, I would look at other options for LS with tournaments.  <br />

 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Another great movie type objective, putting you right at the beginning of Return of the Jedi. This objective has been very strong since its release in 2000. For years, all it did was change and evolve, and even improved with cards like Leia, Rebel Princess and Seeking an Audience (V6). It has stayed popular because it is a great objective that is centered on the main characters of the movies. This is made clear by the objective causing direct damage for each main character you have at a battleground location, so it even works in space. The whole objective is based around freeing Han from the Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber. While he is frozen, you cant drain at ANY Tatooine location.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: There are many ways to play this deck but for the most part in every version, you will be playing Mains with matching weapons or EPPs. This deck has been known to greatly abuse Civil Disorder (V6) and Mantellian Savrip because you can get Threepio With His Parts Showing out first turn.  With Threepio you are consistently putting cards back in your deck to get cards you need. With Han (V3), you are promised totally free retrieval of 5 the moment you flip and also has immunity < 4 in this objective, allowing him to stay alive a bit longer. There are many combos that are made possible by this deck. Some include Boushh, Leias Blaster Rifle, and Colo Claw Fish, which can KO any character or vehicle early game. Example: Against Walkers, killing Blizzard 4 first turn, while Vader is still on it. This combo is all but gone with the introduction of Frozen Dinner (V11), which cancels Colo Claw Fish. Freeing Han can be done very easily with Someone Who Loves You, which says Han is free if Leia is present at AC, unless playing against Jabbas Prize. Since you can pull Threepio, you can also start Rycar Ryjerd (V2) to pull Hopping Mad (V6).  Hopping Mad (V6) may only deploy on a non-Episode I Threepio but can once per turn take into hand Savrip, How Did We Get Into This Mess?, Thank the Maker, and Were Doomed. The original version said that Savrip just couldnt be canceled, but since the Re Edit, it has been changed to just Immune to Alter.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to Profit was the downfall of the original post V8 Scum. The original Scum would set up a powerhouse at the AC that could easily beat the snot out of any LS party coming to free Han. With the Errata and Re Edit to the Scum cards, the current Scum is no longer the most popular DS deck. The LS now has the option of playing with See-Threepio (V8). This Threepio has a built-in How Do We Get Out of This Mess? when present with R2. It works as long as Jabba is not on table. So against any DS deck other than Scum, Court, or CCT aliens, you can set up auto HDWGOTM first turn if you also start Cell 2187 (V3) to pull R2. Also, since this Threepio is not Episode I, you can play Hopping Mad (V6) as well. This new combo has become an excellent and powerful strategy for Profit. A version at Worlds 06 I played against was using the CZ-3 droids to react CARDS to same or adjacent sites. Then used Dont Forget the Droids (V8) to either protect ANY droid from being targeted by anything (USED) OR place a droid in battle out of play to prevent opponent from drawing any battle or weapon destinies in that battle (LOST). Since you need to protect Threepio and Artoo anyway, they make nice additions to the basic platform of this objective. Another great addition to Profit is Padme (V11), who provides additional direct damage when Leia or non-Jedi Luke is present at a battleground. Plus, during opponents control phase, she lets you take into hand any Leia or non-Jedi Luke. When you combine her text with Seeking (V6), you can pull almost every character in the deck. It really works here because she can take into hand Master Luke to deploy for free the very next turn thanks to the objective.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Still a nice deck for LS. It has good staying power and can provide consistent damage the whole game. Also, a good platform for early game beatdown with Master Luke since he deploys for free and Chewie, Engraged or a Leia coming down from Reserve deck. Profit has always been a great option for the early game Luke beatdown, which combined a Jedi, Master Luke, Courage of a Skywalker, and Jedi Presence. The beatdown is helped since your objective allows the DS to start the game with two aliens. You automatically have someone to beatdown as soon as you have the cards in your hand. You also dont take drains at the AC while on the zero side. So once you have the combo in your hand, you can drop down everything, clear the AC, and free Han all in the same turn. If done correctly, you can usually cause some good amount of overflow giving you an advantage in the game going forward. With the new combos that can be played with Profit, this deck has become another option for LS. Plus you also have the option of using Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start any Obi with matching stick already at the AC to either take on the aliens or free Han first turn should they decide not to deploy any aliens. Of the three types of Obi start decks, Profit is usually the least popular. The other reason to play this deck is for the new IG-88 (V5) deck with CCT. Since it usually takes Jabbas Prize on their first turn, Profit moves JP to the AC. So they dont start the game with a captive for IG. Their whole deck sets up through the searches from IG, so you remove the ability to set up their deck just by playing this objective. They do have ways to capture another character, so you want to make sure when you try to free Han that you are ready.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The DS starting of two aliens can be a problem. Since they also get to go first, they can start EPP Mara Jade (V12) and Dr.E, then add Maul, Emperor (V), Vader (with Blizzard 4 and moving over), etc. Profit almost never uses its first turn to attack the AC, so the DS usually gets 2 to 3 turns of deployment before you have the cards in hand to battle the Forces blocking the AC. You also no longer have the advantage over Jabbas Palace decks since Den of Thieves (V8) allows the DS to raise their converted site by losing 1 Force. The other big problem with Profit is its very hard to build this deck with strong space. The most common choices include the standard; Home One, Tantive IV (V7), Bright Hope (V5), Spiral, and Gold Leader In Gold 1 (V10). The space package is usually small and relies on the Savrip to stay alive. Since most of the deck is based on the ground and freeing Han, some even choose to just leave out space all together. This means against CCT, that you cant easily free Han since they have Jabbas Prize and they can set up space drains with free Executor.  You are taking drains in space while they keep you from draining on Tatooine. Much like Rescue the Princess, this objective rarely wins if it cant free Han. SYCFA Fear is also a big DS deck right now and will deal out too much damage for Profit to win unless they dont play Imperial Decree (V6). <br />

Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Yavin 4 system and Yavin 4: Docking Bay. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Revolution or Force drain at Yavin 4 sites or sectors. While this side up, you generate on more than 1 Force from each Yavin 4 site. Once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one Yavin 4 site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Each Imperial is deploy +2 to Yavin 4. Flip this card if you control three Yavin 4 sites and opponent controls few than three Yavin 4 sites. Place out of play if Yavin is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, may deploy Death Star system without completing Death Star Plans. Once during each of your deploy phases, may take one Rebel Tech, Death Star system, Attack Run or Proton Torpedoes into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your total power +3 in battles at systems. If Death Star is blown away, adds 3 to Force lost for each opponents Death Star site and, for remainder of game, your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a starfighter present with a pilot character aboard are each +2.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Great Shot Kid!, Squadron Assignments, Strike Planning, Luke Skywalker (V1), R2 In Red 5, Advanced Preparation (V3), The Time For Our Attack Has Come (V7), Mon Mothma (V9), Yavin sites, and big starships.  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Yet again, its a movie objective. This one has only gotten better as the game has continued. When it was release in 2000, it was a very very difficult objective to play out. It simply took too many card slots to just blow the Death Star and almost none of them could be pulled from reserve. Plus, it deployed a lot of cards and had no form of retrieval. To fix the problems the deck had, five cards were made that completely change how effective the deck can be.  They are Great Shot Kid!, Advanced Preparation (V3), Rebel Tech (V3), Luke Skywalker (V1) and most recently Mon Mothma (V9)). All of these cards have helped to bring this objective back to the tournament scene. In order to blow the Death Star, you have to get Luke there. If he is going to last long enough without being killed in battle, he has to complete the Attack Run the same turn he makes it to the Death Star. That means that you either have to deploy there directly with a spy ship (or the Tantive IV (V7)) or be carried over on a Nebulon-B Frigate (Death Star 2 expansion). Using these options, you can still move Luke into the Trench.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The deck can win very easily once you blow the Death Star because when that happens, the DS takes a BIG direct hit for 14 Force. Many good dark decks deploy so many cards (CCT, Scum, Ralops) giving them a loss that big can literally cripple them to the point of losing every game. After dishing out the damage, the fun begins. From then on out, one per turn you get to deploy ANY starship you want for free from hand or Reserve and you also get to retrieve 3 Force EVERYTIME you deploy a starship thanks to Great Shot Kid. So Home One goes down for free, then gets killed, then retrieved, and played again for free. This deck totally rules the stars. You will be able to over-power any DS space no matter what deck they are playing leaving you solid +2 drains at systems with piloted starfighters.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to this deck happened shortly after the 1st Edition of this Encyclopia was posted. A version of MBO was created that could auto-blow the Death Star by turn 2 or 3 every single game. The two reasons for this new achievement was the creation of Mon Mothma (V9) combined with The Time For Our Attack Has Come (V8). Plus the version plays 5x Control Combo and 5x All Wings Combo. The pre Redux version of Mothma (V9) allowed you to add +4 to the Epic Event draw. So when you combine that with Luke Skywalker (V1) adding +7, you auto hit on the Epic Event draw unless you drew two 1s. The reason this deck worked was rather than having to draw both Luke and the way to get him there; you can pull TTFOAHC (V8) with the Dont Do That Again Shield. Then, set up Mothma (V9) and General Rieekan (V4) on Yavin 4 sites. Rieekan pulls Tigran Jamiro (V4) to flip and pulls Haven on Yavin 4. Using the Squadron Assignments and All Wings Combo, you get Luke on Red 5 to Yavin with any other ship. Then play TTFOAHC (V8) to deploy the Nebulon-B Frigate from under your starting effect. This ship can carry two starfighters. So you use the Frigate to move Luke over to the Death Star System so he can blow the Death Star. Then use the TTFOAHC (V8) to move the Frigate an additional time that turn back to Yavin 4. This new method auto pulls the ship that gets Luke there and the way to get them back. Plus, since you set up Haven at Yavin, even if they Barrier Luke or the Frigate, you will usually be safe with the 2 destinies from Haven for the one turn you wait before taking out the Death Star. The first version of this deck was totally broken and could not be beat by almost anything. It came out when the Endor Back Door Effects were still the original broken versions. Thats One (V9) allowed you to cancel a battle anywhere on table, not just at Chewies location like it is now. So if the DS tried to battle Luke or the guys on the ground, they were automatically stopped. Since the Re Edit, the deck no longer adds +4 from Mothma (V9) and lost the turn of protection from Thats One (V9). Since you cant auto hit anymore, the deck is Forced to set up extra sites and have a Rebel Tech (V2) on table for adding to the total. The rest of the deck is still solid, but can lose to decks that set up fast and have the ability to kill the characters on Yavin early.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: With a new design, MBO can be a powerful option for LS and is still the worst matchup for one of the strongest DS decks, SYCFA Fear. This is still true even though Maneuver Check (V12) says you cant move ships the same turn they are deployed. You still have the ability to set up the draw and cause big damage. Once you flip, you can retrieve your whole lost pile and take on any DS space package currently bothering you. After flipping, this deck can win by either space beatdown or simply out draining. There is no limit to the amount of retrieval per turn as long as you can pay for it. Besides Hidden Base, this is probably the only deck where you really dont need to ever go to the ground once you have flipped. The deck usually just plays with EPPs to strike a character on the ground and then get retrieved. If you want, you can play with the <> Forest to just pile all of the EPPs there so they have weapons and are completely immune to attrition. The deck can be very easy to play because you do the same thing every single game. Flip, blow up Death Star, and have fun.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: If the Death Star takes more than five turns to blow, you will almost always lose. It can also lose if you take too long flipping the objective and too long to get Luke over to the Death Star. Then the DS is going to be draining and causing the key cards to fall into the lost pile. Two cards can still hurt this deck; Sense Combo and Imperial Barrier. I cant tell you how many games I have played where I have everything I need to blow it and my opponent plays Sense/Uncertain Is The Future to completely change my hand and Force me to start all over. It also hurts when you are trying to flip and one of your guy gets Barriered at the docking bay, only to then get beatdown next turn. Since the auto-win has left this deck, many choose other more reliable options for LS. If you are not good at playing this deck, it can easily beat itself. So make sure if you take on MBO, that you get a good number of practice games in, especially the beginning turns for flipping and blowing the Death Star.  <br />

 <br />
 <br />
Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Chief Chirpas Hut (with Death Star Icon Luke and Lukes Lightsaber there), Endor: Landing Platform and I Feel the Conflict.  <br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Alter, Strangle or Captive Fury. While this side up, your Force generation is +2 at Lukes site. While an Imperial is at Landing Platform, you may not Force drain or generate Force at Lukes location. When any Imperial is at Lukes site, Luke is captured (seized by an Imperial, if possible, even if not a warrior). Flip this card if Luke captured. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at end of each of opponents turns, opponent loses 2 force unless Vader is escorting Luke. At any time, an Imperial escorting Luke may transfer Luke to Vader, if present. Vader may not transfer Luke. Once during each of your turns, if Vader present with Luke (even as a non frozen captive), may shuffle Reserve Deck and draw destiny. If destiny >14, Vader crosses to Light Side, totally depleting opponents Life Force. Flip if Luke neither present with Vader nor a captive.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (V9) or Jedi Luke, Lukes Lightsaber, I Cant Believe Hes Gone (V12), Clash of Sabers, I Feel the Conflict, Jedi, EPPs, Goo Nee Tay, Pod Racing  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: The first of its kind for LS, an objective that can win the game the moment the seven side is completed. Basically, this objective has the ability to simply win the game if you can figure out how to win 4 battles and the opponent is playing with Vader. You can sometimes win with three if you get a good destiny but 4 is usually the standard (Unless Emperor Palpatine is present, then you need 5). A common mistake with this deck is forgetting to ask for the card to put on I Feel the Conflict once you are victorious in battle. Through the years, this objective has really not changed its strategy. Every version is built pretty much the same way. Common versions of this deck try and find ways to alter power. Power is altered through total battle destiny, total power, or simply lowering the power of the opponent; anything to win the battle. Some of the cards that help to do this include; Jedi Presence, I Cant Believe Hes Gone (V12), Clash of Sabers, Smoke Screen, Sorry About the Mess Combo, Aim High (Endor Effect), etc.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck wins only if it wins battles. Of course, there are many ways to do this, so you have to be smart with how you build a deck like this. If Vader has Luke, and you have won the required number of battles, you get to shuffle and draw destiny to win any time you want during your turn. Its that simple. The key is playing the right combination of cards that can give you the victory in battle. You only have to get 1 power higher to win any battle and get a card stacked on I Feel The Conflict. Each stacked card adds +3 to the draw total and unlike the similar DS objective Bring Him Before Me, the LS doesnt cause you to lose one 1 while Luke is being escorted. You put the pressure on the DS to come after Luke since you start the game with him already on table with his lightsaber. The LS has many Jedi and powerful Interrupts to make it easy to win battles. This can be done many ways; making your power higher or making the DSs power lower, adding or canceling destiny, removing or excluding DS characters from the battle, or Reacting. Clash of Sabers, Smoke Screen, Dont Forget the Droids (V8), and Artoo I Have a Bad Feeling About This are a few examples of cards that can change the outcome in a battle.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Two big changes happened for this deck. The first one was the change of Scout Luke (V9), who originally said the DS Imperial was forced to move toward Luke while on Endor. Since the Redux, Scout Luke (V9) now says while he is alone at an Endor site, you may retrieve 1 Force during opponents move phase. Now the LS gets a bonus for Luke being left alone. Unless playing against BHBM, you always want to use this Luke because he also adds one to each of his weapon destinies and require the opponent to pay +1 to fire their own weapons. The second change was I Cant Believe Hes Gone (V12). The original version said that it had to be played as a Just action right after Obi was placed out of play. The ability to add +5 to power for 1 Force could be done more than once a turn but was limited to just sites. The new virtual version says that you can play the card at any time after Obi is placed out of play as long as he is no longer on table. The +5 can now be added to any location once per turn for the same 1 Force. If that wasnt enough, the new card also says that while Luke is captive, once per turn at anytime you may activate 1 Force.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: If you love to battle and be on the offensive side of things, rather than being on the standard defensive, which the LS tends to prefer. This deck can literally pull out a win against what would be an automatic loss. You get to start Luke with his stick before the game has even begun. Now that Qui-Gon and Mace (V9) are around, you have two powerful characters that can be used to battle while Luke is captured. You want to force Vader to be deployed, so it is important to get Luke to any Imperial on the table. If they are playing with no Imperials, then you can use Luke to battle the whole game. The new virtual cards make this objective much stronger than it used to be. Plus with all the new Jedi to play with, there are many ways to fight and win battles over the original meta that existed when this card was made. This is a great deck for beating ground based Imperial decks. It does well against Huntdown, RalOps, Walkers, and Endor Ops as long as you can win some battles. The objective has some direct damage because it says the opponent loses 2 Force a turn while Luke is captured and not with Vader. The DS cant ever battle Luke with an Imperial. Plus it prevents Alien based decks from being able to capture him in fear of losing the 2 Force all game. This is one of those decks where you never know what the player is going to be playing. At Worlds 06, I played against one that started Pod Racing and Goo Nee Tay. Since I wasnt playing any Racing protection, and all my characters were high deploy, this version totally destroyed me. So he was able to win even though he never flipped.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The main reason not to play this deck is that it tends to rely on the opponent playing with Vader to have a good shot of winning. For as long as it has existed, it has had a problem with alien based decks that can simply battle Luke off the table. All of those battles you win will mean nothing. Not only that, but this objective has not been near as powerful with the creation of Darth Maul because he can be played in place of Vader as a character to just throw down and put Luke in the lost pile. Luck comes into play with this deck because you have to win battles to stand a chance and sometimes the difference in a win versus a loss can be decided by just a random destiny draw.  <br />
The new V cards have really made DS aliens much stronger than any time in the game. There are like four different alien based decks that can give this deck problems. While it might seem appealing getting to win the game after winning 3 to 5 battles, TIGIH is not the best choice for LS.  <br />

Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hutt Trade Route and a Jabbas Palace site. May deploy Yarna dal Gargan. Reveal one unique (.) alien from your deck whose lore specifies its species. This card is your Rep. <br />
For remainder of game, your Rep is a leader. Yarna dal Gargan is immune to Alter. You may not deploy insert cards or operatives. While a rancor is at Rancor Pit, Trap Door is immune Bo Shuda. Flip this card if you occupy two battleground sites (must occupy a third with a non-alien of your Reps species if a non-Tatooine location is on table). <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn you may cancel a Force drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep. Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Reps species. When two of your aliens are battling at any Tatooine location, add one destiny to total power. For remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand. Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 battleground sites.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Yarna dal Gargan (V8), Bargaining Table (V8), Ellors Madak (V8), Uh-Oh (V7), and any number of different aliens OR Mains and Toys with Obi start, Krayt Dragon Howl (V8), Tosche Station  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Alien based objective. For years, this objective was almost never played. It just didnt set up very well and had very little staying power compared to other LS decks. This all changed when V8 came out, providing many new aliens that help the deck and 5+ helper cards; Tuskan Breath Mask (V8), Ellors Madak (V8), Yerka Mig (V8), Bargaining Table (V8), and Yarna dal Gargan (V8). These cards completely changed the power of this deck, so much so that it got one of the cards an errata (TBM (V8)). The new V cards made the deck so powerful that a lone alien that normally would have lost the LS tons of force in battle in turn could now absorb the damage and cause enough attrition to break through immunity. The deck was fast and ruthless allowing for huge retrieval and very very long staying power. The deck became so powerful that even after the errata and creation of counter cards in V9, the deck was still a negative playing experience. So the Re Edit went in and changed many of the original cards from V8 that made this deck so strong. TBM, Yerka Mig, and Bargaining Table were all changed to be much less powerful than they were originally printed. Since the change, the entire deck type for this deck has changed again. Even though the Re Edit changed the original strategy from V8, the deck can still be built to be a decent option for LS. The basic strategy of this deck with the new V8 cards was to flip first turn by pulling aliens with Bargaining Table (V8) and Uh-Oh (V7), which it still does. Now, TBM (V8) must deploy to table, is no longer immune to Alter, and requires you to choose between adding ability for destiny or soaking the 7 in battle damage which can only be done once per turn. Yerka Mig (V8) only deploys to the Cantina. Bargaining Table (V8) no longer deploys its pullable characters for free and provides forfeit +1 to unique aliens over the original +2. The bases of this deck has tended to be aliens but the strongest version of this objective is no longer based around aliens but is instead mains and toys.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Agents provides bonuses for playing with aliens. If requires you to reveal a Rep to start the game, which is simply a unique alien that has a species. So Chewie would be the Rep for Wookiees, Kalik or Aven could be reps for Jawas, etc. The deck requires you to occupy two Tatooine battlegrounds site with aliens (plus a third with a non-unique of your Reps species if you or the opponent plays a non-Tatooine location), which is likely to be 95% of the time. The new Yarna (V8) prevents the objective from flipping back. The 7 side provides a destiny to power at any location that has two aliens with different card titles. It also allows you to place a copy of your Rep on the objective to cancel either a Force drain or battle destiny. So that means that when you pick a species like Jawas that have more than one option for Reps, make sure you pick the one that you have the most copies of in your deck list. The last part of the 7 side says once during Control phase, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Reps species. The first V8 version used Kitoniks with Droopy McCool as the Rep because starting with Uh-Oh (V) allowed the LS to pull musicians and provides additional retrieval when you control a battleground site with a musician. This made for a very solid and high retrieval based deck.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Besides the total change to the V8 cards with the Re Edit, the biggest change for this objective was the creation of the D!ck Hat deck or simply Agents starting Obi with Krayt Dragon Howl (V8). Rather than go the alien route, the deck is built to use the objective as a base for mains and toys by pulling Tosche Station with Yarna (V8), then it moves Obi over for instant activation bonus. The deck is so strong because it puts the pressure on the DS from turn 1 and gets going so fast with the extra activation. It was used to win Worlds for 2006 and is still one of the strongest LS options. There are currently many versions of this version of the deck posted on Decktech for further strategy. Besides the new Obi deck, Agents can still be played with Aliens with the creation of Crash Site Memorial (V12). This card makes every site that helps Jawas a desert, plus says that while you have a Jawa at a battleground site, the DS loses force generation there. There are many Jawas that provide added bonus to other Jawas; Aven (V8) and Kalik from Jabbas Palace. When you combine the new Agents with CSM (V12), Jawas are now a viable tournament option.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The new Obi start has made Agents one of the strongest options for LS. With the DS having so many strong options, this deck provides very fast damage early and is currently the fastest LS deck for setting up. Many DS decks have to think about whether or not their current deck is able to beat the speed and power of this deck. So now when you look at Agents you have two completely different paths to take. The old fashion version that plays around aliens and uses the Rep, or the D!ck Hat version, which is all mains and toys with Jedi, SAC, and evasion. Both types can be seen on Decktech for more detailed strategy.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The reason not to play this deck has changed more for this deck than any other from the original post of this article. The reasons not to play it depends on which version you go with. For aliens, you lost the awesome ability that TBM (V8) provided before the Re Edit; now it makes it almost not worth playing this version. Plus Ellors Madak (V8) can now be countered with the Frozen Dinner (V11) shield, which can eliminate the majority of the retrieval. When looking to play the alien version, it will have to be built well in order to win. The damage soak of TBM (V8) is also what kept the deck from auto losing to space based decks. Now, Agents has a very difficult time with SYCFA Fear. As far as the D!ck Hat version, the only real reason not to play it is everyone is expecting it right now. The LS is so weak with options that the DS doesnt have to try hard to know what is strong for LS. Most DS decks are packing as many counters as they can for this deck. The best time for this deck was at Worlds since the majority of players had not seen or even heard of the deck. If the DS wants to tech for the deck, they can start Crossfire (V9) and pull Imperial Justice (non V), which can deploy on Tosche Station for 4 Force. This card says they get completely NO activation at this location. So unless, they are able to Alter the card, they lose 7 in activation.  <br />

(Zero Side) Deploy Cantina, Docking Bay 94, and Tatooine system.  <br />
For remainder of game, opponent activates no Force at your Cantina. Your cards with ability are deploy +6 except Luke, smugglers, freighters, and independent starships. Opponents game text on Kessel System is canceled. While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may take Corellia or Kessel into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if you occupy two battlegrounds with smugglers or have completed two Kessel Runs.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your Force generation is +1 at each system you control with a smuggler. Opponents Force generation at non-battlegrounds is limited to 1. When you have two or more smugglers in a battle, add one battle destiny. Each of your smugglers is forfeit +2. Once during each turn, may play one interrupt from Lost Pile (then place that card out of play). Sense, Alter, and Keep Your Eyes Open may not be played. Flip this card if you do not occupy two battlegrounds (unless you have completed two Kessel Runs). <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Kessel, Version of Luke, lot of Smugglers, Krayt Dragon Howl (V8), Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11), Palace Raiders, Patrol Crafts, Racing Skiffs, Ill Take the Leader, good number of battling and evasion Interrupts  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objectives: The first LS objective to restrict the use of any type of characters. Until this objective, all the objectives could be built with anyone. This one meant that Obi and Leia had to be left out of the mix. It was a very solid deck over the years becoming popular very quickly after its release. It is one of the hardest objective for the DS to flip back among the objectives that can be flipped back. The objective has so many things that it does to help the LS and just completely hurt the DS. If you play this deck, you have to get used to playing with only Smugglers and Luke, as well as a very limited amount of starships to choose from. That is where the real test begins because with this deck, you can either be very powerful on the ground or in space, but it is very hard to control both areas. In the early days, the deck was built around space playing with Captain Han and sometimes putting Luke in space. Then the idea came about to play with non-unique Palace Raiders which could react (deploy or move) on transport vehicles and with the objective got 2 or even 3 destinies when they got matched up with any other smuggler including another Palace Raider.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: It wins by utilizing all of the bonuses the 7 side provides. The first part says all DS non-battlegrounds generate only 1 Force a turn. Another powerful part is the ability to draw an extra destiny when you have multiple smugglers together.  Two smugglers get 2 destinies and +2 to their forfeit, which makes it hard to beatdown when they are protected by either vehicles or in space. The objective causes the DS game text of Kessel to be canceled, which makes it very easy to play Kessel Run over and over again. It can use cards like Nightfall to tech against specific decks like Walkers by allowing your Spies to deploy for free to that planet, so that means Boushh and Lando with Vibro Axe go down for free. Then you add Luke, Han with Gun or Chewie, Engraged to make for a very big beatdown. A very strong part of the objective is completely preventing the DS from getting to play Sense or Alter. Literally, one of the main reasons the deck continues to be a strong deck type. But the strongest part of the deck is being able to play Interrupts from your Lost pile by placing them out of play. Many times the DS player will not be paying attention to what random cards were lost from drains three turns earlier, so you can easily set up surprise beatdowns with Clash of Sabers and Run Luke Run.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The introduction of Obi, JK (V11) and Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) is used to start Obi already in the Cantina. So you start the game with a drain of 3. Since most DS decks can&#39;t set up to fight Obi on their first turn, the LS gets an auto drain of 3. The deck is built with tons of different battle and evasion Interrupts that can each be played twice per game once flipped; Dodge, SATM Combo, Blaster Deflection, It&#39;s a Trap, Rebel Barrier, Clash of Sabers, and Blast the Door Kid! all protect Obi. Since you only get 3 cards in your opening hand, the deck has to play with enough protective cards to draw 1 early.  This is because in WYS, the only copy of Obi that you play is the one you start. If he dies, most of what the deck was built to do is wasted. Besides the new Obi deck, another new strategy for this deck was discovered. The WYS Panic deck is currently being played in some parts of the world. This deck relies completely on Panic to win the game. Panic is a Used Interrupt from Premiere that says if opponent initiated battle where their power is double your power, draw 3 cards, deploy ANYWHERE FOR FREE any characters, starships, vehicles, or weapons, all others are lost. This card is not unique, so you can play it more than once from one battle. The version of this deck uses mainly Ralltiir Freighter Captains since they are Smugglers and then lots of random stuff. Since everything deploys for free, you can play Home One, random characters, etc. The main build posted plays 7x Panic, 8x Captains, and 7x Medium Bulk Freighters. The only red cards in the deck are reactive Effects and some evasion Interrupts. The majority of the deck is stuff that can be played with Panic. The reason this deck works is because even if Panic is grabbed, the ones that go to lost pile can still be placed out of play and played again just as long as you keep paying for them. Your starting Effects are totally based on what the opponent is playing. You have five to choose from in Civil Disorder (V6), Dismantle on Sight (V11), Klor Slug (V2), The Professor (V9), and Wokling (V4). The strategy of the deck can be found on Decktech. This is not a deck that plays normally, so if you decide to play it, make sure to get in a few practice games before you go to a major tournament.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: For as long as WYS has existed, it has always been a very difficult deck for the DS to beat. From my experience, WYS is the second most powerful 7 side in the game behind Rescue the Princess. Every part hurts the DS or make the LS a lot stronger. When you combine the fact that you get to play your Interrupts each twice per game, with the objective preventing DS from playing Sense to cancel them, this deck is very hard to beat. Plus, the deck is very easy to play. It sets up Celebration on Tatooine, with drains at the sites and Kessel then waits for the DS to stop them. If you can stay flipped, your opponent will not have an easy game. Decks like Huntdown and Walkers that play with a lot of non-battlegrounds really take a hit against this deck with the limit of 1 Force generation at most of their sites. The best version of this deck is the non-unique Palace Raider version, so you need to have a good collection of Jabba&#39;s Palace Sealed Deck. The Smugglers get really awesome bonuses with this deck, so you really have a solid format for a LS deck. The deck can also set up Ill Take the Leader, which adds +1 to Force drains at docking bays, and on Tatooine you can play with 3 different ones. The AO allows you to land a starfighter that has been forfeited from a battle at the system. Meaning you can land Han, Chewie, and Falcon, then take back off during your move phase since the action of landing with the AO didnt use your landspeed.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: WYS has always been weak to decks with a lot of direct damage. Since you cant play any Jedi or Leia, Huntdown only has to worry about Luke in order to stay flipped and cause Visage damage all game. If Luke is in space, they prevent him from draining, if he comes to ground, then they either duel him or throw all forces to kill him. Plus now they also have Emperors Power (V11) to add 1 in direct force loss. Huntdown can also take over the Cantina and drain for 2 to 3 all game. The only way WYS can beat Huntdown is if they can keep Vader off the table or cancel Visage. The other problem is the Palace Raiders rely on reacting in order to keep from getting beatdown. If you cant play Run Luke Run or they cancel your React, the the Raider can get beatdown. Of course this deck should play Houjix for those times. Most of the time, this deck can be weak in one of the two areas of play. It is hard with the restrictions to have a powerful force in both space and on the ground. The deck is also very very open to DS Undercover spies because they don&#39;t get to play with Corran Horn. Fozac (V8) says while Undercover, all Force drains at related locations are 1. Since there is no way to get around him, if Luke is in space there is little chance of the spy getting hit with SATM Combo. So Fozac (V8) can literally shut down almost all drain damage in this deck. Although this objective is still strong, its not always the best choice for a LS deck in metas with a lot of Huntdown.  <br />

13 * Plead my Case to the Senate (LS Senate) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Galactic Senate and any other (Episode I) location. <br />
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability <4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. You may deploy cards on your Political Effects to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least one with a peace agenda) at Galactic Senate.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponents hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (+3 for any characters with an order agenda) when drawn for battle or weapon destiny. May use 2 Force at end of a turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Queen Amidala Ruler of Naboo, 8 to 10 other Senators at least 2 or 3 must be Senator Palpatine and one must be Mon Mothma (V9), Strike Planning, 2 to 3 Might of the Republic, Threepio with Parts Showing, all four Political Effects(PEs), Coruscant: Jedi Council, HC&F, Senate Hovercam, EPPs, Entrenchment (V9)  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: LS Senate was originally a broken strategy that took a few years off and has now been made strong again with the introduction of Mon Mothma (V9). When the objective was first released, it was not that strong or even played that much. It was only after Reflections 3 that it became a super powerhouse with the introduction of Shields and Han, Chewie & The Falcon. The deck went on what seemed to be an endless winning streak that only seemed to stop when The Emperor (V6) was released. The only deck that had a chance against it was DS Senate, though the LS had an advantage with the Queen getting to be placed unlimitedly on a Political Effect as long as it was affecting separate actions (one per destiny draw and one per force drain). The deck was a machine that, with all its many parts, was not an easy deck to play. The main reason LS Senate is so powerful is because of Queen Amidala, Ruler of Naboo. She is not a Senator but says she can still be played on the Politcal Effects while a Senator is currently not there. Since it doesnt say she cant already be there, you have the option of playing more than one Amidala on the same PE for cancelling multiple Force drains or during the same battle. So if you are able to draw three battle destinies, you would be able to play two Amidalas plus a Senator to add +9 to your total. Of course, you can also do the opposite to the DS and subtract from their destinies when they get more than one battle destiny. DS Senate has no way to put more than one Senator on any PE during the same turn, so the fact that the LS can put multiples in one turn gives them a HUGE advantage. Besides Amidala, the LS has many powerful Senators that each provide a special ability in the game. The main one that you always want in the Senate is Senator Palpatine because he says you may use 1 Force to add an opponents battle destiny to your total power. Horox Ryyder prevents the opponent from drawing more than one battle destiny at battleground systems, while also preventing you from canceling it. Tendau Bendon says if you have at least one card in hand, once during your Control phase may place hand in Used pile to draw up to four cards from Reserve. Yarua lets you retrieve 1 Force when you initiate a battle at a battleground system. Liana Merian says once during opponents turn, you may target opponents just drawn battle destiny; opponent must use or lose 2 Force or that destiny = 0. Each Senator can totally change how powerful the DS can be in battle.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This objective wins because the Senators and Political Effects provide the ability to alter whatever the DS is doing. You can turn an EPP into a work horse when attacking a site. The PEs allow you to cancel a Force drain, add +2 to your Force drain, add +3 to a just drawn battle destiny, and subtract -3 from opponents just drawn battle destiny. Besides the initial ability of each PE, each one has an added ability while a specific type of Senator is placed on them. Ascertaining The Truth says during your move phase, you may peek at the top 2 cards of any Reserve deck and replace them in any order. I Will Not Defer allows you once per turn to activate 2 Force when opponent initiates a battle. Plea To The Court lets you cancel a just drawn weapon destiny to cause a re-draw in battles where opponent has a weapon and you do not. It abuses cards like A Jedis Resilience to get the Epps right back into hand. The Gravest of Circumstances says that during your turn, you may place any card in Used pile to cause opponent to use or lose 1 Force. When you combine each of these PEs with the power of the Senators, the DS can not win any battle easily. Horox for example says the DS gets only one battle destiny in battles at battleground systems. He says you cant cancel that destiny but the PEs are not canceling the destiny when they are reducing their draw. So the DS should not be able to ever get a battle destiny draw above 4 since you can make it -3. This means if you play with starships that are immune <5, you can never have your immunity to attrition broken through. This makes LS Senate is a very powerful option for LS space decks, much like DS Senate.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: First, Mon Mothma (V9) allows you to pull your drain location since LS Senate almost always starts the Jedi Council Chamber. The Re Edit added a new ability to Mothma (V9) for use in LS Senate. She allows you to take into hand a just drawn card for battle destiny (if its a senator, you can then place in on a PE during that battle, yes this is legal). This deck now has a few options with how it can be played. The Re Edit also changed the original Entrenchment (V9) into a completely different card. Now Entrenchment (V9) deploys on a site and says the LS ALWAYS get the first weapon phase action as well as gives all your characters there defense value +1. So when you have the Theed Palace: Core with Mace (V9) and stick, you ALWAYS send the ability <5 characters to used pile. Since you are playing Senate, you have the ability to reduce their destiny and add to yours. Combine all of that with Palpatine adding their destiny to your total and there is almost no way to remove Mace. Set up Tawss Khaa (V7) and you drain for 5 to 6 all game unless the DS can set up Resistance. You start Wokling (V3) to pull either the Hovercam or Entrenchment (V9) depending on what you play against.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The Emperor (V6) made this deck very hard to win with because he could drop down and just auto kill anyone who showed up at the senate. There was no way around this for years after he was released until Mon Mothma (V9) came out. She alone allows you to flip that much faster since she is pulled with Strike Planning and prevents the Emperor (V6) from shocking anyone while she is there. If that wasnt enough, she also lets you pull a battleground, whereas before you had to draw or play cards that could pull them. The deck has been given a new birth in the current tournament scene. Senate can be very hard to play against and can stay alive for a long time while altering what the DS is doing. LS Senate has a great advantage over DS Senate because there is no Scrambled Transmission (V5) canceling the PEs and protecting the removal of cards with the objective. The only way the DS can totally cancel the PEs is if they play Alter from Coruscant, which is a lost Interrupt.  If you play Wise Advice, you can just re-pull that cancelled PE next turn and it will never leave the table again. They do have Hyperwave Scan (V3) but it just says the PEs go to used pile for 3 Force and only during the LS turn. Since LS Senate is never the most popular choice at tournaments, you will almost never come across ANY of the counters besides The Emperor (V6). As LS Senate begins to become more popular, the creation of a DS version of Scrambled Transmission (V5) may come to pass.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Because The Emperor (V6) still exists, all the DS has to do now is Set for Stun Mon Mothma (V9) and then shock two characters away before she can come back down. It might be a good idea to play more than one Mothma (V9) just in case. Black Sun can give this deck problems since they have so much forfeit in space, retrieval when they battle with Scum and can pull The Emperor (V6) from Reserve first turn. The deck has no real protection from beatdown aside from playing with Houjix. The newest versions have to rethink EPPs with the creation of Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9) in the Redux. If you are not in control over a battleground site, then your EPP weapon draws are 2 EACH. Since half the deck is going toward the Senators, it can have problems against SYCFA Fear when that deck starts doing a lot of direct damage and playing enough power that they can knock your ships out of space. Another weakness this deck has is Monnok. Many times in a game, this deck will have doubles of Amidala in hand ready to be placed on the Political Effects. Nothing hurts more then having to toss them to a Monnok played during the DSs control phase before they drain. On a side note to the weaknesses with this deck, the LS Senate deck is the MOST EXPENSIVE deck to build in the current SWCCG universe because the deck is made with a large majority of the rarest Coruscant cards.  Coruscant is the most expensive set. You will be looking at throwing down a good amount of money if you didnt already own enough of the cards. Since there arent really any counters for the LS PEs, this deck should get more popular.  <br />

 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Wattos Junkyard, City Outskirts, and Credits Will Do Fine.  <br />
For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except unique (.) aliens, Republic characters and starships, and (Episode One) Jedi. Your Destiny is suspended. While this side up, once per game may take Coruscant and/or Tatooine system in hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may no deploy any systems. Maul is immune to attrition. Flip this card if there are 4 or more cards beneath Credit Will Do Fine.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your unique (.) Republic characters are power +1 and forfeit +2. Aliens may not have their deploy cost modified and Imperials deploy +1 to Tatooine sites. Whenever you draw battle destiny, may retrieve 1 force (Force retrieved in this way may be taken into hand.) While Queens Royal Starship at a planet system, once during each of opponents control phases may activate up to 2 Force. Once during each of your control phases, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground site you occupy with a senator.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Master Qui-Gon (V12), Mace Windu (V9), A Remote Planet, Hans Dice (V2), Queen Amidala, random Aliens and Republic characters  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective has not seen much action until recent years. Following the same trend as others before, the objective was too slow and not that effective to be worth playing. Only after new V cards were released has it become even a choice for LS. The main idea is to get out a powerful Jedi, i.e Obi, Qui-Gon, or now Mace (V9) to the Junkyard and do what you can to keep the DS off the site long enough for you to drain 4 times there or win enough battles so that you will collect cards on Credits Will Do Fine and flip the objective. Once flipped, it cant flip back but doesnt really do that much to be worth it. There are a lot of cool things that the seven side could do, the main one is getting to retrieve a card directly into hand WHENEVER you draw a battle destiny.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck can win because the strategy of the objective is literally the easiest one to play of all the objectives. All you have to do is get out a good size party with Undercover protection and Tawss Khaa (V7) at the Junkyard.  Then you just hit them for 3 to 5 card loss ALL game. That is it. You of course can build a version to do more than that but you really dont have to. You are already hurting in both the space and ground departments, so the best way to build this deck is to base it around that lone strategy, any other will make it more difficult to win. Queen Amidala is a good addition to this deck because she adds +2 to defense value of every Republic character in your deck.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change was the discovery of a new way to play this deck. The objective allowing you to retrieve cards when you draw destiny has been ruled to work when you REDRAW destiny as well. The current version of this deck sets up Depa so you always get at least one Redraw a turn. Then you add Hans Dice (V2) which says; Once per turn, if just drawn for destiny, may take this Interrupt into hand to cancel and redraw that destiny. OR Cancel Watto&#39;s Chance Cube. OR If your character of ability > 2 is in battle, use 1 Force to cancel and redraw a just drawn destiny. This card is also non-unique, so you can play it many times during a battle phase to retrieve many cards. This strategy is still very new and the current build of the deck has many other powerful Interrupts like Are You Brain Dead?!, It Could Be Worse, and Blaster Deflection that can also be abused if the Dice is grabbed. You now have a few options in how you build this deck. It is slowly becoming a solid and unexpected choice for LS. The deck also has two new Jedi that they didnt have before; Master Qui-Gon (V12) and Ki-Ai Mundi (V12).  Both of them can provide benefits to the deck that make it that much better. Another way to re-draw battle destiny is with the new Changing the Odds (V12). It says both players re-draw, which would still give you the retrieval.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The most powerful versions of this deck currently play Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start the game with ANY version of Obi you want with his matching lightsaber already at the Junkyard before you even start the game. Combined with the new Mace (V9), Master Qui-Gon (V12), and Yoda, JCM (V12), this objective has been given a new direction. Another idea with this deck is to use that old droid from premiere, CZ-3, who lets you react by deploying CARDS, not just characters but ANY card you want at normal use of force. Then you can combine him with Dont Forget the Droids (V8) to keep the DS from getting ANY weapon or destiny draws in that battle. Since you have the ability to get some strong retrieval with this deck, it has now become a very powerful option for LS. If they decide to change the ruling about the Redraw, then this deck will not be quite as powerful. You might want to get as many games in with the deck as possible before it changes.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest problem this deck has is space. Much like WYS and WHAP, you are restricted to which ships you are able to play. Since the majority of the deck is for keeping and holding the Junkyard. The most common version of this deck choose to leave out space all together. So you have to play very smart in order to have a chance against SYCFA Fear or CCT space. The key to winning games against space-based decks is to try to do as much early damage and retrieval as possible. Against SYCFA, just go after Sidious at the Docking Bay but dont kill him. He is your best source for retrieval and the only character they will give you on the ground. The problem this deck has always had and continues to have is that is can lose to very specific deck types. Scum can beat down the Jedi that are trying to hold the Junkyard. Combat prevents the drain and just knocks the Jedi off the table. Huntdown can Duel off your Jedi and cause direct damage all game. Walkers cause a lot of direct damage and plays on a totally different planet and never has to interact with Tatooine to win. This objective protects against Your Destiny with Luke not being able to be in the deck, but they still forgot about Agents of the Black Sun, which it doesnt protect from, so you take 2 in direct damage all game since Luke will never be hitting the table. The weaknesses this deck has are not as bad as they used to be with the new Dice tech and additional Jedi in V12. You really need to know how to play this deck in order to win with it, so new players should look elsewhere.  <br />

14 * We Have a Plan (WHAP) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Throne Room, Theed Palace Hallway, and Theed Palace Courtyard. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except (Episode I) Jedi, aliens, (Episode I) vehicles, Republic characters, and Republic starships. Your Destiny is suspended. You lose no Force to Vengeance Of The Dark Prince. While this side up, you may not deploy characters to interior Naboo sites. Once per turn, may activate 1 Force. Flip this card if you control Theed Palace Throne Room (with Amidala there). <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you lose no more than 2 Force to any Force drain. Your independent starships are power +2 and immunity to attrition of droid starships is canceled. If opponent just drew a battle destiny greater than three, you may use 1 Force to cancel that battle destiny. During your control phase, opponent loses 2 Force for each battleground site you control with Amidala or Panaka. Flip this card if opponent controls Theed Palace Throne Room.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Theed Palace Queen Amidala, Sabe, Panaka, Qui-Gon, Mace (V9), Obi-wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11), Wokling (V3), Secure Route (V5), Control Combo, Ki-Adi Mundi (V12), Found Someone You Have (V5), usually NO space package <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Known to all as WHAP. When this objective was released, it was completely impossible to flip. The original design forced you to deploy outside Theed Palace and then march in. This usually took 2 to 3 turns and, all the while, the DS had deployed a nice beatdown party to the Throne Room to wait for your arrival. For years, it was just not played. Then the PC allowed the creation of Secure Route (V5), which single-handedly made the deck a tournament contender and it is still being played to this day. Secure Route (V5) changed the way the deck flipped by allowing characters to deploy directly to the Throne Room and provided the ability to take a non-character card back into hand whenever you deployed a Republic character to the same site. That means that if the DS doesnt deploy to the Throne Room on their first turn, the LS can flip very easily on their first turn. Once you flip, the only way for the DS to flip you back is when they control the Throne Room. No easy task with Jerus Jannick protecting Amidala. He prevents any targeting of Amidala while he is with her, as well as acting as a Houjix at the site when he is forfeited. Plus Queen Amidala adds +2 to the defense value of all republic characters as well as makes them all immune to You Are Beaten, Sniper, and attrition <3. That means the only way to get Jannick off the table is to Choke with DLOTS or cancel his game text with 4-Lom With Concussion Rifle. If the deck plays Klor Slug (V2), then the DS cant even Choke him. Once set up in the Throne Room, the objective causes 2 Force loss for each battleground controlled by Amidala or Panaka. Just at the Throne Room, you can deal out a drain of 2 to 3 with an additional 2 more in direct damage. From there the deck just reacts to what the opponent is doing. It now has powerful Jedi in Mace (V9), Qui-Gon, and Obi JK (V11) to attack the DS as well as defend the Throne Room. Wokling (V3) is used to pull the Secure Route (V4) first turn. The start for this deck is almost always the same. With Wokling (V3) always being one of the options, from there you decide what is needed. Some go with Civil Disorder (V6) for getting back characters. Quick Draw (V9) or just SaiTorr Kal Fas (V1) is used for getting the Jedi their sticks. You might see defensive effects started like The Professor (V9) to protect against free Executor or Scrambled Transmission (V5) versus DS Senate. The key is to have the right set up for what you want the rest of your deck to do once you have your force set up in the Throne Room.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck is very strong because of its seven side. The deck provides the LS with a little bit of everything. You limit all DS Force drains on the table to 2 each, so no matter what the DS is doing, you will never get beat by a deck that sets up huge drains on one or two locations. The next part says you can cancel any battle destiny greater than 3 with 1 Force. This isnt restricted to once per turn, but can be played the entire turn. This makes it is very hard for the DS to win battles or kill off characters with additional battle destiny or attrition since the DS cant ever get higher than 3 while the LS has enough Force saved. The final part of the objectives seven side causes direct damage of up to 4 Force a turn while both Amidala and Panaka control a battleground. Once you have control over the Throne Room, it is almost impossible for the DS to ever knock you off of that site, so the objective usually stays flipped all game. You combine the power of Secure Route (V4) letting you take into hand ANY non-character card with powerful interrupts.  This allows you to abuse lost interrupts like Control/Tunnel Vision, Found Someone You Have (V5), Clash of Sabers, and SATM Combo. The other bonus to this objective is the zero side has built in protection from any DS deck that requires you to play with Luke, since you are not allowed to play Luke with this deck. Your Destiny in BHBM and Black Sun cause NO damage no matter what is going on. This means both those decks have to play completely different since they dont have Luke to go after and their direct damage ability is gone. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: With each V set that comes out, this deck only gets better because they continue to get more Jedi to play with. Now you can play with a version of Qui-Gon, Obi (V11), Mace (V9), Yoda MOTF, and Ki-Adi Mundi (V12). With more Jedi, you have more options for attacking the DS and disrupting their strategy while still having them set up in the Throne Room for protection. Since Jedi Lightsaber (V9) gives Yoda 3 weapon destiny draws when defending, he can be great there, while Mace and Obi go fighting. The change of V8 Scum has given this deck new life and it can be found at many current tournaments. Another improvement to WHAP was the introduction of Keep A Little Optimism Here (V11). This Utinni Effect plays on your character, preventing them from moving but targets an opponents highest power Dark Jedi character at a site. The DS target may not Force drain for more than 1 at their location until they reach the Utinni Effect. Since WHAP piles up tons of characters at the Throne Room, this card provides the deck an almost automatic way to reduce a drain down to 1. Besides just random V cards, no real change happened for this deck. It is still a solid choice for LS and is always seen at major tournaments.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The biggest reason to play WHAP is because it can auto-beat many DS strategies. The objective really does a lot to limit how powerful the DS can be both in damage and battling. BHBM and Black Sun can have problems since they never do direct damage. Any deck that relies on high drains at a few locations will take a hit with WHAP limiting the drains. The MKOS decks that add to each battle destiny will do nothing against this deck. Huntdown is mainly all high destiny, so they dont get a battle destiny through very often. Because this deck is completely Episode I based, you will not be affected by any cards that hurt Rebels. Miiyoom Onith is almost useless against this deck only affecting the few male aliens. ROPS does nothing to hurt deployment. Bad Feeling Have I only affects two characters in the deck. The strategy of the deck is also very easily to grasp because you pretty much do the same thing every game. Just get your guys to Naboo and hang out. The most common versions are usually all ground based, so you only have to concentrate on what is going on within one arena. Unless the DS deck is ready to come after the Throne Room or cause more damage faster than you, they will not be able to beat WHAP easily.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The decks main weakness is in space. Many versions of the deck simply choose to not play with ANY space, so the DS is left open to drain all game at systems with no problems. The objective only allows you to play few ships anyway. The Outrider, Falcon (only with Han (V3)), Queens Royal Ship, and the Bravos are your only options. Bravo 1 with Bravo Leader gives you two additional battle destiny when with another Bravo Fighter. This is usually Brave 2, who is the exact same as Mist Hunter (V5) by subtracting 2 from each of opponents weapon or battle destiny draws. Together, they can hold a system but their power is limited, so any DS space deck that can set up enough power will force them to be lost. They dont always get set up very fast so it is usually not worth the cards slots. SYCFA Fear is this decks worst match-up. The DS can easily set up one Destroyer at each system to cause 8 to 10 in Fear damage while still draining for 2 at each one. The best players have been able to get around Fear a few turns with Alter but usually find themselves losing fast if they are unable to knock the Dark Jedi off the Death Star docking bay. The other weakness for WHAP is early attacks on the Throne Room. Maul with Stick early with the right cards can completely destroy the way this deck works. Getting knocked out of the Throne Room early will allow the DS to pile up on the site and completely stop you from ever flipping again. Another weakness with this objective is it doesnt always do a lot of damage. All of the sites are drain one sites that relay on your bonuses to do any damage. The indirect damage can be reduced with Imperial Decree (V6), so if the DS has any way to retrieve cards, they will most likely win the game. A TIE retrieval deck really gives WHAP problems because it has more space than it can handle as well as solid force retrieval all game.  <br />

Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Generator Core, Theed Palace Generator, and Inner Strength  <br />
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain where opponent has a Dark Jedi, and your Force drains at Naboo sites where you have a Jedi may not be canceled. Once during your control phase, may target one opponents character present with your Jedi at an interior Theed Palace site. Target is lost. Flip this card if an opponents Dark Jedi is present at an interior Naboo battleground site.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you may not Force drain or initiate battle at any location where you have a Jedi. Once during your move phase, your Jedi may initiate lightsaber combat against an opponents Dark Jedi present: Each player draws 2 destiny. Loser (lowest total) loses 2 Force (cannot be reduced). If difference is 5 or greater, lost Force must come from Reserve Deck, and losing character is lost. Flip this card and retrieve 1 Force if opponent has no Dark Jedi present at any interior Naboo battleground.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Qui-Gon Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11), Mace Windu (V9), Jedi Knight Luke, HC&F, SaiTorr Kal Fas (V1), Quick Draw (V9). <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Combat was supposed to be the new dueling, giving both sides a way to knock off an opposing Jedi without having to battle. It came out in Reflections 3, the last objective to be released by Decipher before the license was lost. This one was a little broken when it was first released. It allowed you to have protected drains with your Jedi at already large icon sites at Naboo.  The broken part was the ability to make ANY non-Dark Jedi character present during the players Control phase just Lost. That meant it didnt matter who was there, ANY non-Dark Jedi character was just Lost. So from the beginning of this objective, you pretty much had to play with Dark Jedi in order to stand a chance against this deck. This deck played that way until the PC created a Defensive Shield to limit who could be targeted to be made lost by the objective. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (V2) for DS and Affect Mind (V2) for LS changed it so that only spies and droids would be lost during the Control phase.  The card also prevented you from draining for too much by limited the force drains to only 2 if you have two or more Jedi at Naboo sites. It also said the player may only use one Combat card a turn. The shields made this deck more balanced in the tournament environment. The next version of the deck to hit the scene was called a Shield Buster. The idea was to get the opponent to play all their Defensive Shields leaving them open to another strategy that they would normally have been cancelled easily with the other Defensive Shields. An example was when the DS would have to choose between deploying the Combat Shield, then they have two SAC shields, grabber shield, retrieval shields, or Pod Racing shields. Once three of them went down, the deck would set up Odds inserts with the high destiny Jedi in Yoda, MOTF and Jedi Luke. Then you add Screaming Lando for a total of 15 damage from one insert card. Being able to abuse the strategy in your deck that the opponent was no longer able to counter made this version almost unbeatable. If they played their Odds shield, you were left to play your SAC or your retrieval all game. This version was the main and most powerful version of Combat until the PC created Drop (V8) & Thrown Back (V8), which allow the player to play 4 shields.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck wins because it has the ability to remove all the Jedi in an opponents deck and avoid battles, while causing big drains with the high powered Jedi. The deck prevents the DS from every canceling your drains on Naboo while you have a Jedi. So if they dont have a way to come after you, they will not be able to stop the huge drains your deck can produce. The objective forces any DS deck with Dark Jedi to come after you since all Dark Jedi are prevented from draining while not on Naboo. The creation of Mace (V9) created a new aspect for the deck by giving the LS an attack character that could go after the DS while still causing damage on Naboo. It is very easy to set up Combat against a Dark Jedi. Inner Strength allows you to put any card you want under the Jedi that may later be used as the Combat destiny draw, so you are never initiating Combat blindly. The combat is almost an auto-win every time. When the DS loses the Combat, they lose 2 Force, which cant be reduced. The Dark Jedi is lost if the difference is greater than 5 and the loss has to come from Reserve deck. If Qui-Gon, Jedi Master was the Jedi that initiated it, the DS has to lose an additional 2 Force.  This means that in one swift stroke, the DS lost one of their Dark Jedi and 4 cards blind from Reserve. You may only initiate Combat during your move phase, so every deck relies on evasion cards to prevent the Dark Jedi that come to Naboo from battling your Jedi off the table. Rebel Barrier, Its a Trap, Blast the Door Kid, and Dodge are all very popular in Combat decks. Once the attacking Dark Jedi is stopped, the next turn you set up Combat and bye bye Dark Jedi. Then wait for the next Dark Jedi and repeat. The idea of the deck is very basic because you never really have to do anything. Once you set up, if the DS has no way of hurting your drain and stays away from you, you will usually win the game while having put few cards on the table. You can always setup On The Edge with Flash of Insight (V5) or by tracking. The deck also plays SAC for getting around bothersome Effects and Interrupts.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The new Virtual sets have changed how LS Combat is played. Cold Feet (V11) allows the DS to play another Defensive Shield a turn, so the Shield Buster version is no longer an option. Now the deck uses Obi-Wan, Jedi Knight (V11) as one of the main Combat characters. The original virtual version of Obi, JK was made WAY too powerful and allowed you to cancel ANY destiny drawn by the DS while at same site as a Dark Jedi. This included battle, weapon, duel, combat, Ellis, SAC, shock, or choke destiny. For Combat alone, Obi could auto-win any Combat since it was always 2 draws to 1. His text was changed in the Re Edit to use 1 Force to cancel a battle, duel, or weapon destiny against a Dark Jedi, leaving Combat to the way it was originally meant. The edition of this new Obi has given the basic idea of LS Combat new light. Both Obi (V11) and Mace (V9) have made the deck a very popular option for the LS in the current tournament environment. Lets Keep A Little Optimism Here (V11) also works very well in the deck by forcing the DS to come after the Jedi to get around the drain being reduced to one.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The idea of Combat can be very powerful if you know how to play it. You automatically have an advantage over any DS deck that relies on Dark Jedi to win. Huntdown, BHBM, DS Combat, DS Senate, and random Bespin or Endor decks can have trouble with Combat forcing them to attack the Jedi or lose the game. Dueling Huntdown has a better game compared to non-dueling since they can duel off the Jedi and cause 9 Force loss for each one, but the standard Combat will play What Was It? and at least 2 copies of A Jedi Resilience. Just remember to grab the Circle Is Now Complete to limit the number of duels they will get off because it isnt unique and can be played multiple times a turn. Against DS Combat you can use Civil Disorder (V6) to limit their own Combat destiny and remove their combat cards, so if they dont play Ability x3 (V6) themselves, you will automatically have the advantage. When Combat plays the mirror-match against each other, the game is usually timed since neither side is able to initiate battle. The DS has a small advantage because they have Much Anger In Him to cause the LS to lose 4 Force each turn the Jedi doesnt battle. Versus DS Senate, you should have almost an auto-win if you include Scrabbled Transmission (V5) to remove their Political Effects. Without the PEs, Senate will not be able to beat the immunity to attrition Jedi that cause huge drain damage. Plus most DS Senate decks are space based, so if you remove their PEs, they will not be doing as much damage as you are. The hardest match-ups for LS Combat are any DS alien decks because they are not affected by your objective. If your Jedi get captured or beatdown by heavy aliens it can be hard to win. You can still make any Spy or Droid lost with the objective when the DS has the Shield out, so you dont have to worry about 4-Lom, IG-88, P-59, or Mara as long as you can cancel the battle. If they dont have the Shield, you will have a huge advantage making all their characters lost when they come to Naboo.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to play it: Combat has come and gone over and over in a cycle as each V set has come out. Currently you can see it being played but it does have weaknesses. The biggest weakness is SYCFA Fear because their entire deck is in space and does heavy direct damage with drain damage against a usually small LS space package. The majority of LS Combat decks dont play with many ships. You will usually only see HC&F, Artoo In Red 5, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10), Tantive IV (V7), Spiral, Bright Hope (V5) or even Home One. The destiny should remain high when the deck is built, so you dont want to play a lot of the lower destiny starships. The other reason Combat is not as popular is the DS alien decks that also seem to come and go in a cycle. CR (V8) Scum, Court, Black Sun, and MKOS all have ways to fight the Jedi and do solid damage on their own. Since you never have any Dark Jedi to fight, the deck becomes an old fashion mains and toys with you having to keep Jedi alive to win. Usually being able to keep Savrip alive and retrieving a few key cards will be enough to defeat the aliens but you need to wait until you have the Sense for Masterful Move, then make sure to grab that card so it cant be played again. In the end of the duel for Savrip, it should stay alive giving you a way around their power. This card can also be the difference in SYCFA Fear.  <br />

16 * virtual Local Uprising (V) (Speeders) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hoth and Main Power Generators. May deploy Echo Base Garrison and/or Maneuvering Flaps. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not play Hoth Sentry or non-Hoth locations (except Rendezvous Point). T-47 Formation is an Out of Play Interrupt and Immune to Sense. While this side up, during your deploy phase, you may / one exterior Hoth site or non-unique Rebel to Hoth. Flip this card during your move phase if your T-47s and/or non-unique Rebels control three exterior Hoth sites. Place out of play if 1st Marker blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, whenever you must lost Force (except from your card, battle damage, or a Force drain at a battleground), reduce the loss (to a minimum of 1) by the number of Hoth locations you occupy. During your control phase, opponent loses 1 Force for each marker site you control with both a T-47 and Rebel. During your control phase, may use 2 Force to / a card. Flip this card if you do not control two exterior Hoth Sites. Place out of play if 1st Marker blown away. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Commander Luke (V4), General Rieekan (V4), Romas Lock Nevander (V4), T-47 Battle Formation, Frostbite (V4), Maneuvering Flaps (V4) or non V, Echo Base Garrison, any number of speeders that could be non-unique or the named Rogues 1-4, Haven, X-Wings or standard LS Capitals  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: A PC created virtual objective that had a very nice run for a while. The whole time you hung out on Hoth, just doing your thing until you won. This objective is very easy to flip with a very solid 7 side. Basically, you would have flipped by just controlling three marker sites with a Rebel and speeder or non-unique trooper. This could be done very easily with Rieekan (V) and Commander Luke (V) both pulling cards that you use to flip. Once flipped, you just would set up each marker site with a speeder and a rebel, because the objective will cause direct damage for each pair. With Frostbite (V), you can retrieve Force if the pairs are matching, like Luke on Rogue 1, Zev on Rogue 2, Wedge on Rogue 3, or Hobbie on Rogue 4. The objective allows you to take ANY card you want into hand from reserve for just 2 force during your Control phase. It also protects from random force loss by reducing any loss that is not a drain at a battleground, your card, or battle damage to just one force. In the old version of this objective all the direct damage was limited to 1 Force a turn. After the Re Edit, you can only reduce direct damage by the number of Hoth locations you occupy, which is still powerful but now has some limits.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The best things going for this deck are protection under the shields, the ability to &#39;react&#39; the speeders, high force loss with T-47 Battle Formation (which is now once per game and immune to Sense), always having the right card you need by searching your Reserve during control phase, the limit of opponents direct damage, and many ways to set up steady retrieval (Frostbite (V4), Uh-Oh(V7), On the Edge, etc). All you have to do is put Luke at the 4th marker, Wedge at the 3rd marker, and just drain, retrieve and wait. If the DS left you alone, you almost always won. In most games, it will all come down to how long you can stay alive on the Hoth system. Since the objective restricts you deploying ANY other battleground locations besides Hoth sites, you have no other options for space unless the DS gives you another system. For this deck to win, it has to stay alive in space so it can afford to deploy new stuff and pay for the retrieval. If you lose control of Hoth early, most dark decks will not give you another system to occupy. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit totally changed how fast this deck sets up. The first change was taking away the Echo Command Center as one of your starting sites. Then Commander Luke (V4) lost the deploy -2 aboard Rogue 1, so it now requires a whole extra turn to flip no matter what. The rest of the objective plays out the same. It can still set up direct damage of up to 3 at each marker site as long as you have a speeder and a Rebel there. Plus you still have the protection of the Shields. Since the deck is no longer as strong as it used to be, some new versions have been built. The most recent version plays like 20 non-unique speeders and sets up a beatdown with Maneuvering Flap (non V). Since the non-uniques are so cheap to set up, the deck can flip as fast as it did before the Re Edit because it doesnt rely on Commander Luke (V4) or General Rieekan (V4). The problem was that it had no way of attacking DS decks that stayed inside at interior sites. If the DS was smart, they drained at the interior sites and never gave the LS an opportunity to beatdown.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Despite the changes from the Re Edit, Speeders can still be a difficult LS deck to beat. The deck does a little bit of everything with direct damage, retrieval, ability to search Reserve deck, plus the built in protection from DS direct damage. The deck still provides the ability to set up on many sites under the shields before the DS can hope to fight. And even though you might see JQuille (V8) (who deploys through the Shields), Scum is not as popular as it used to be and neither is JQuille (V8), so the odds of playing against him are much less. You get to play with Ice Storm to make characters missing at your marker sites. The deck can also set up Mechanical Failure against attacking walkers since you can find any card in your Reserve when you need it. When playing Speeders, it is important to include one of the two ways to lower the shields. Either Romas (V4) at the Command Center or Echo Base Trooper Officer (V4) at a non-shielded marker site, usually 4th Marker. Speeders is still a good match-up for SYCFA Fear since they dont play any ground, you can easily occupy enough Hoth locations to absorb the Fear damage. The key again is staying alive in space. Since you can retrieve Force during your control phase, the best way to stay alive in space is with Alternatives to Fighting from A New Hope. This card lets you pay 3 Force to cancel ANY just initiated Starship battle. So if they wasted their grabber, you can easily retrieve it after the opponents battle phase to play over and over again.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The Re Edit really took away the speed of this deck. The DS can set up very fast these days, so you cant afford that extra turn it takes to flip with the matching speeders. The matching speeder version was much stronger than the non-unique version since you had immunity to attrition with Echo Base Garrsion as well as retrieval with Frostbite (V4). The biggest hit was the T-47 Battle Formation being made Out of Play. The LS Hoth objective was strong because it could set up fast and be ready to play both T-47 before the DS could stop them. Since you lost a whole turn of big drain, the deck can take that much longer to defeat the opponent. The other problems with the deck still exist. J&#39;Quille (V8) can deploy straight through the shields to ANY of your sites. So you can get caught in a beatdown if you dont have a Houjix. The DS can still put out their own 5th Marker (Ice Plains) which removes the 4th Marker as your second battleground location. That leaves the system as your only battleground unless you are able to lower the shields. The DS can easily play the Come Here You Big Coward shield to prevent any drains or retrieval while the Hoth Shield Rules are in effect. You can only do damage while the shields are down, which leaves all your sites open for the DS to deploy straight through. The deck still has problems with DS space based decks that set up and control the Hoth system from the very beginning of the game. Since it takes you longer to flip, you are not able to send forces to the system as quickly while the DS uses 3 to 4 turns to pile up as many ships as they want. Speeders will always fear Sunsdown Combo being played to reduce all the speeders power and forfeit to ZERO. Most Speeders deck have to play 2x Houjix to stand a chance should this unlikely event occur.  <br />

17 * virtual Watch Your Step (V9) (Corellians) (WYS (V)) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Corellia system (with an unpiloted freighter a Corellian pilot there) and Spaceport City to Corellia.  <br />
For remainder of game, Corellian sites are immune to No Escape. For either player to deploy a card with ability (except a Corellian) to Corellia, that player must first place a card from hand on bottom of their Used Pile. While this side up, you may not Force drain at Corellia system. During your deploy phase, may / a <> site. Flip this card if you occupy Corellia system and your Corellians control two Corellia battleground sites.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, non-blaster character weapon destiny draws are -2 at Corellia sites. Your Force generation at Corellia spaceport sites is +1. Your combat vehicles may deploy or move only to same Corellia site as opponents vehicles. Audience Chamber on Palejo Reshad is treated as Corellia. During your deploy phase, may / one BoShek or a Corellian of ability <3. At the end of each turn, you may use 1 Force to draw the bottom card of your Reserve deck. Flip this card if you do not occupy two battlegrounds.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Dash or a Han to start with Outrider or Falcon, No Questions Asked (V8), Corellians  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This virtual objective had the BIGGEST change from any other since the first post of this article, so much so that this entire entry had to be completely redone. WYS (V8) is still the newest of all the objectives to hit the game. This LS objective turned out to have more problems than either previous virtual objectives made by the PC. The original idea had to be scrapped and completely recreated to the objective described here. The new version is so weak now that it has become a deck that I personally have very little strategy for. Right now, you still get the start of the game with a solid LS ship, either Outrider or Falcon. From there, you have to control two Corellia sites with Corellians in order to flip. The original version of the objective allowed you to flip with any character. Now you start the game with the Corellia <> spaceport site, so the DS can immediately invade the planet on their first turn. Since you have to control two sites with Corellians in order to flip, the deck is MUCH harder to flip fast. The new version requires you to build the deck with a way to deploy two sites in one turn and get out two Corellians to each site. Since there is no way to pull two Corellians in one turn easily, the deck is almost impossible to flip when the DS invades your starting site first turn. That means you have to get a ship to Corellia and land the Outrider/Falcon to flip. The strongest part of the original WYS (V8) was the +3 to deployment of cards to Corellia and that is gone. The DS can easily afford the force to beatdown the very weak Corellians that are being used to flip the objective.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Right now, this is the WORST LS objective in the game. The seven side does NOTHING for the LS to make it worth playing. It has no way to cause damage outside of draining. No form of retrieval or text that hurts the DS in anyway WHAT-SO-EVER. Even DBO makes the DS Force drains -1. The original WYS (V8) was so overly broken that the PC got scared when designing this new version. They didnt really think of anything worthwhile for the objective to do besides getting to draw the bottom card of your Reserve deck at the end of each turn. Since you have to put cards in used pile any time you deploy a card with ability that isnt a Corellian, you are really just getting back the card you had to put back to begin with. The only thing the deck has going for it at all is No Questioned Asked (V8) providing Force drain +1 at Corellia sites. This used to be awesome with Speeders since they were protected by the deploy +3 and you could use T-47 Battle Formation to get drains of 3 at each site. Now the objective prevents you from even wanting to put Combat Vehicles in the deck.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Funny, this was listed as the strongest LS objective at the time of the original version of this article. Now it is the weakest. This section doesnt mean much here since the entire objective changed. Right now it seems fairly certain that no one will ever play and win with this objective unless they build the deck to NOT flip and make it work as a space deck off of the starting ship. You cant even pull Kessel with it anymore. So everything you would use to win has nothing to do with the objective past the starting cards. I personally consider this to be the BIGGEST waste of a Virtual card. What is the point of Ving a card that is as bad as any card in the game??? The seven side uses half the printed space to list out text that hurts the LS, then uses the rest to pull the weakest characters to play with like BoShek. You cant pull No Questions Asked (V8), Kessel, or Corran Horn, all parts of the original that could have stayed with this new version. Nothing about pulling any of those cards makes this deck that strong, so whered they go??  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The absolute only reason to play this deck is as a space based deck that doesnt flip. You do have the Outrider or Falcon already in play to start the game. When you add Strike Planning to pull either General Solo or General Calrissian, the ship becomes a solid presence in space. From there you could pull General Rieekan (V4) to pull Romas (V4), who then pulls all your systems. If you add support cards for space like any Hidden Base deck, this could be another viable LS space option. Your options for the ground would need to build the deck around another planet if you plan to avoid getting a huge beatdown. You could start Uh-Oh (V7) and set up the <> Desert on Corellia with a Kitnok for a drain of 2. Put a Sandwhirl there, and you have the same battleground as Hidden Base. Since you start with the spaceport site, you could put CZ-3 there providing you a reacting Sandwhirl at the adjacent Desert should the first one get canceled by Control. This is still not a great idea but you at least have some options with a different strategy.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: If you cant see the reasons not to play this objective by now, you didnt read the earlier sections. This objective can in no way give you enough power over the DS to be worth playing. As stated previously, the seven side doesnt give you ANY bonus ability over the DS. When you think about the game and ALL the previous objectives listed, each one provides the LS with SOME advantage; Pay 1 to Draw 1, DS Force drains -1, Canceling drains, retrieval, immunity to attrition, added battle or power destiny, game ending duel, add to destiny number, direct damage, SOMETHING! Not this one. The only way this deck will become tournament viable is if someone figures out a way to use the drawing of cards from the bottom of Reserve or if new V cards are made to help the objective. The thought of that in itself is funny since the objective itself is a V card.  <br />

Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Holotheatre and Visage of the Emperor. May deploy Meditation Chamber and/or Epic Duel. <br />
While this side up, during your move phase, may use 4 Force to take Vader into hand from a location you control (cards on him go to owners Used Pile). Add 4 to each players destiny draw from Sense and Alter.  <br />
Flip this card if Vader is at a battleground site and no Light Jedi or Luke is at a battleground site. Place out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force drain at an Executor site.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponent cannot initiate battles or Force drains where opponent has a Jedi or Skywalker. You lose no Force from Visage of the Emperor. While Vader at Meditation Chamber, subtract 2 from each of opponents battle destiny draws. Opponent may not play Sense or Alter. Flip this card is opponent has Luke or a Jedi at a battleground site or if Vader is not on table. Place out of play if you play Scanning Crew, initiate a non-Epic duel or Force Drain at an Executor site.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 versions of Vader, 2 to 4 Visage of the Emperor, 2 to 3 Darth Maul with Stick (or you can just play Darth Maul from Tatooine and get him in space) 2 Zuckess In Mist Hunter, 2 Bossk In Hounds Tooth, 1 to 2 Mauls Sith Infiltrator and No Escape <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: A truly timeless DS objective. It was released in 98 and still continues to be a very solid choice for a good DS deck. All of this time, this objective has been the longest lasting and most played of all of the DS objectives. Like other powerful objectives, it continues to evolve and change to fit the current playing meta. No matter what expansion that Decipher released or what V cards were made, it just didnt matter. Over the years, many different versions have been made of this objective. In the beginning, the hardest part was trying to find a site fast enough to put Vader before you lost too many cards to Visage  When the ability to find docking bays with Imperial Arrest Order was introduced the deck become much faster and more reliable. Then the introduction of Darth Maul With Stick gave the deck the extra attack force it was previously lacking. The main reason for this deck being so powerful is that it directly attacks the strongest LS characters. The original dueling version that uses Epic Duel could place both Obi-Wan and Luke out of the game, leaving the LS with only Leia as a power character. It stayed this way for years, until the release of Qui-Gon and now Mace (V9). With the LS having multiple Jedi to play with and attack with, the dueling part of the Objective had become less powerful until Lord Vader (V11) changed that. Before V11, the best versions of this deck have been built around simply battling and maximizing the direct damage from Visage.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck has always been strong because it prevents the LS from playing Sense and Alter (the same way Mind What You have Learned Does for LS), it causes direct damage at the end of BOTH your turn and the opponents turn with Visage, and gives no icons to the LS to start the game. The most powerful versions of this deck either play with Imperial Arrest Order Combo to pull docking bays for the battlegrounds and activation or else they start Conduct Your Search to pull the Endor: Back Door.  Conduct Your Search can also be used to pull Blast Door Controls to cancel Rebel Barrier and Blast the Door, Kid. Both versions of the deck have their good things and their bad things. The docking bay version allows you to play with all docking bays that have a very high cost to transit away for the LS. The Endor: DB, Executor: DB, and Blockade Flagship: DB all require the LS to play 8+ per character unless they have a way around it. This makes it harder for the LS to warrant playing a lot of characters down to fight off Vader. The downside is you dont have very good drains at DBs. A downside of using an Endor site, whether it is the Docking Bay or the Back Door, is that the site is still considered an exterior planet site, so they can play Lost in the Wilderness on you. The Endor: Back Door does let you get higher drains. You can play with cards like Put All Sections on Alert that works at your Executor sites and Death Star sites to cancel a Rebels game text and prevent them from drawing battle destiny. Huntdown usually has very very good destiny draw average with a good amount of destiny adding cards, usually playing 2x I Have You Now and/or Maul Strikes, 2 to 3 Visages, 2x The Phantom Menace, 2x Masterful Move Combo, 2x Mauls Infiltrator, 1 to 3 We Must Accelerate Our Plans, and 2x Emperor Palpatine. Though some versions play The Emperor (V6) for the built in shock, many times, this deck will win by simply getting a few good beatdowns for high overflow. Then it uses Visage to finish them off.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Huntdown is one of those DS decks that will never truly change but will slightly evolve with each change in the meta. The only thing that ever changes for Huntdown are the options for characters and red cards. Most recently V11 released Lord Vader (V11) which returned Epic Dueling to tournament worthy status. The card says that The Circle Is Now Complete may target ANY Jedi, not just Obi-Wan. This means Epic Duel works on all LS Jedi. So each time a Jedi loses a Duel the LS loses 9 Force and places the Jedi out of play. Since the LS had so many different Jedi, it is nice to finally use one card to target all of them. Of course you still need a Vaders Obsession to duel non-Jedi version of Luke. The rest of his text allows you to not only steal a lost Jedis lightsaber but use it along with another saber for double drains and swings. Along with the new Vader, the DS also got EPP Mara Jade (V12) and a new Aura Sing (V12). The Mara gives the DS a built in weapon along with a spy and saves card slots over playing her saber weapon card. The Aura can be relocated to ANY site that has a Jedi during opponents activate phase and then, once per game, fire a weapon during the opponents move phase. When combined with Quietly Observing, which makes her ability zero if alone at a site, she can automatically knock out any Jedi draining at a lone site like the Theed Core or Tosche Station. To go with the new Aura, V12 also released the Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V12), which can be used by both Aura and Sidious. By combining all three of these new cards, Huntdown can now set up to place all the LS Jedi out of play. Sidious can be deployed alone on one of the Executor sites, while Aura runs all over the table killing Jedi with Snipers and her once per game ability which allows Sidious to then place them out of play. The other big change for Huntdown was the creation of Establish Control (V11). This card is basically Mobilization Points giving you +2 Force generation at docking bays you control as well as pulling Corulag or Fonder from your Reserve.  A benefit of this card is that it has no Defensive Shield that can suspend it. So what once made Huntdown powerful back when DSII was released can now be played again. The standard build of the deck pairs EC (V11) with Imperial Arrest Order for HUGE activation. If you dont fear Nabrun Leids, you can play Ket Meliss (V3), which pulls Reegeesk (V3), Greedo (V3), etc to deploy at the DBs first turn. Besides EC (V12), Huntdown got a boost from Emperors Power (V10), which plays on the Emperor. This card says ALL Jedi are Deploy +1 and Power -1. Then while the Emperor is present with Vader, opponent has to loss 1 Force during their move phase. When you combine this card with Visage and Search & Destroy, you can cause 5 cards in direct damage over one full turn.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Always a good solid choice. This is probably one of the most solid overall DS decks ever. It has a little of everything; SAC protection, consistent direct damage, high destinies, lots of solid characters, and many many ways to build it. You will not feel bad about playing this objective if you really know how it works. The strategy follows a very simply pattern; battle, battle, battle, OR duel, duel, duel.  Then you just drain and let Visage do the rest. But, all you really have to do is get Vader down and let them eat the damage until there is a Jedi or Luke on the ground to deal with. You are playing with usually all high power characters and vehicles. The destiny is high, so most of the time, just having a character that can draw destiny and absorb some attrition is all you need. It helps to be a very good tracker with this deck because, once you find a 7 or 6, you can track it all game to get the maximum damage in any battle. Always a good idea to throw 2x Janus Greejatus from DSII to allow you to put those high destinies back in the deck and then get a new card into hand from Reserve, much like Mirax does for LS. Anyone who can understand how this objective works and set up some good battles on the ground, will have no problem winning with this deck. Huntdown is also a good objective for setting up Flagship Operations since you start with two Executor sites already on the table. The TIE Assault Squadrons from A New Hope become destiny 9 when Flagship Opps is on table, so you can build a deck to auto-duel ANY Jedi with ease. Endor Shield (V11) can pull Commander Gherant, who pulls Executor sites during your deploy phase for 2 Force. You can start IAO to pull the Executor Docking Bay, so it is possible to set up Flagship Opps by turn 2 or 3. This is not the best strategy for Huntdown, but currently the only way to have 9 destinies in the game which can be drawn for any type of destiny.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: This deck can give you instant victory, or an auto loss. It all depends on how you play with it and how long it takes you to find Vader. The key to any version of Huntdown is to get Vader out ASAP. The longer he takes, the longer your deck kills you. If it takes you 10 turns to get him out, then you would have lost 20 total cards all because of your own card. Like most popular decks, this deck has a few weaknesses to some things that other decks can do against you. The biggest weakness for Huntdown is its space package. Because of the importance of good destinies and the use of card slots for the ground, there is not much room for a lot of space. The standard for Huntdown these days will include 2x Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, 1 or 2 Bossk In Hounds Tooth, and 1 or 2 Mauls Sith Infiltrator. Most of the time, you are just going to have to pay for drains on the ground and keep the space in hand until late game. If you come up against a total space deck like Hidden Base, then you get Maul in space on his ship to quickly find the hidden base and block a system. Security Precautions should be a staple in all versions of Huntdown since Hidden Base is usually its worst match-up. Huntdown relies on quick and heavy direct damage to beat a space based deck. The importance of knowing the current meta will be the reason to play or not play this objective.  <br />

02 * Carbon Chamber Testing (CCT)  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Carbonite Chamber, Carbonite Chamber Console and Security Tower with a Rebel (opponents choice) from opponents Reserve Deck (if possible) imprisoned there.  <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, you may deploy from Reserve Deck one Audience Chamber, Docking Bay 94, or East Platform; reshuffle. You may not play Dark Deal. Flip this card if you move a frozen captive to Audience Chamber (or if no Rebel was in opponents Reserve Deck at start of game). <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, your aliens and independent starships are immune to attrition <4 and, once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve 1 Force. While you have a frozen captive at Audience Chamber. Scum and Villainy is immune to Alter and during your deploy phase, you may deploy Scum and Villainy from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Place out of play if there are no frozen captives on table (unless no Rebel was in opponents Reserve Dec at start of game).  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Special Delivery (V6), Kuat Drive Yards (V6), Executor, Mob Points Combo, They Must Never Again Leave This City, Lando Calrissian (V6), Security Tower, Tatooine: Audience Chamber, Flagship (V5), Fear Is My Ally, Ive Lost Artoo (V11)  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective has slowly gotten better over the years. It was one of the first five that the DS had back in 98 and at the time was not the most powerful choice. As time passed, the introduction of more powerful characters and Effects made the objective a good format for Mains and Toys. It was still way too hard to flip because it was too hard to successfully freeze the captive that was given and then move them to the Audience Chamber safely. Reflections 2 introduced Jabbas Prize that allowed you to start the game with a frozen version of Han in place of the Rebel. This got around having to freeze anyone and also took Han out of their deck. Combined with getting to pull your Lando (V6) and deploy him in space to prevent the LS from playing their Lando, you put the opponent at a disadvantage in their character selection. As more time passed, cards like They Must Never Again Leave This City from Reflections 3, Special Delivery (V6), Kuat Drive Yards (V6), and Despair (V6) have made CCT one of the strongest and most powerful decks to be played. Its awesome power lasted for most of 2003 and 2004, until V8 released Thrown Back (V8) and Drop (V8), the starting effects that allows the opponent to activate and draw a card every time you search your Reserve. This really hurt CCT when it was at its peak because it usually searched four to five times in the first turn and then continued to search two to three times each turn after that until mid-game.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck can win by setting up a Free Executor and Lando (V6) first turn every game. It can also pull every Effect that was in the deck with Special Delivery (V6). If that wasnt enough, Flagship (V) lets you take any Admiral or card with Executor in game text into hand during both turns. It sets up systems with Kuat Drive Yards (V6) and gets a bonus +2 drain on the ground with Despair (V6), which also prevents the objective from being placed out of play and opponent from moving during your turn. Because the deck can just search for everything it needs from the Reserve deck, it made for a very solid reactive deck to any and all LS decks that would come against it. CCT has grown to become a DS deck that has so many options for how it can be built. Some versions play all aliens and work on capturing and moving Jabbas Prize to flip. Hes All Yours Bounty Hunter (V6) makes this very easy since it allows your bounty hunter to make two additional moves for free. This means that on the same turn you take Han out of the tower, he can be moved into the AC. Since you can set up the Executor so easily, CCT makes for a very effective space deck. Flagship (V5) deploys on Executor allowing you to pull into hand once per turn ANY Admiral or card with Executor in game text. So it pulls Lord Vader. The possibilities are endless with all the Effects that can be found automatically.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: CCT only took more hits as time went on. The big one being The Professor (V9) which removed the normal free Executor and made it deploy 8. Since CCT uses Force to find the system and Effect, you now have to wait a whole turn to deploy the Executor and since you are using 8 Force more than you had too before, you are also taking away the second turn as well. The good news is the LS must start that Effect in order for it to work. Plus that card is not seen that often unless the meta is expecting a lot of CCT. Since Special Delivary (V6) can pull any Effect from Reserve, the introduction of Ive Lost Artoo (V11) gave CCT the ability to play ANY Interrupt from under your starting effect. So now CCT can be built to find just about any red card in the game. One popular choice is to use Levitation Attack (V6) as the Interrupt to play two Devices of any kind from under your Starting Effect. Since you pull the Ive Lost Artoo (V11), you auto set up any Device on the table. Put a Tractor Beam and Deflector Sheild Generator (V4) on the Executor, set up Binders and Mandalorian Armor on Aura Sing (V12), or redeploy the Carbonite Chamber Console after the LS plays Sabotage (V3). The combination of SD (V6), Ive Lost Artoo (V11), and Flagship (V5) means CCT can be built to pull almost ANY card in the game. Most recently, CCT has become a new powerhouse with the re-introduction of IG-88 (V5) in the Re Edit. Now IG has a built in way to protect himself by being able to cancel any just drawn battle or weapon destiny. He is also immune <5. This new CCT uses Any Methods Necessary to start the game with IG-88, his matching gun, and ship but with a smaller starting hand. First turn, you deploy IG and take Jabbas Prize during your move phase to immediately gain the ability to search your Force pile once per turn for a card. This ability does for CCT what Keeping the Empire Out Forever does for QMC. The rest of the deck plays many different evasion and battle Interrupts, which can be played and found over and over again. IGs Neural Inhibitor (V5) gives IG the ability to capture characters coming to fight him. The best build has a few counter cards for almost any specific LS match-up with the majority of the deck being red cards. This deck is a very solid option for DS because it can react to anything the LS is doing from the very beginning of the game. It is also one of the easiest ways to set up a consistent Force Pile searching engine of any SWCCG deck.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: CCT is one of the top options right now for DS, mainly because of the IG-88 (V5) version of this deck. Thrown Back (V8) hurt CCT when it first came out but doesnt keep players from playing with it. Getting to take away both Han and Lando before the LS can even have a turn is very strong. When playing a space based version, you have no fear of Han, Chewie, & the Falcon. Plus you get out the strongest ship the DS has for FREE every game. One great combo with this deck involves Lando (V6) and Hidden Weapons, which is now an AUTO capture card. All Too Easy can freeze one of the Jedi that comes to the ground against you and you still have the Circle is Now Complete to make Obi out of play. Combined with good space, you have a very good deck to play. CCT is another option the DS has to play with Epic Duel. Usually Huntdown was the only place you would find Epic Duel but CCT has been known to play some dueling since it finds everything it needs, and has the ability to track very early in the game.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: This deck does search A LOT, so what was once a powerful set-up, has now become a solid set-up.  At worse, the Reserve deck searching will give the LS 5 extra cards in their opening hand as well as a 5 more cards in their force pile helping them setup that much faster. The deck also deploys A LOT of cards. The ability to simply find any Effect you want to deploy makes for an average game deploying around 8+ effects on the table. Many games with this deck will not win by more than 25. If you choose to play CCT, you need to make sure you dont get hit for a large force loss early. Any large overflow or big drains will kill this deck fast, so you have to make sure you dont throw out too many effects that you may not need in that game. Save them for cards to lose and only deploy the cards that do the best damage to the strategy you are playing against. Also, mid to late game, use one of the Objective searches first before you choose to deploy an effect with SD (V). That will save you from deploying Effects that you dont really want because the one you were searching for was in your force pile. The popularity of CCT right now makes it a deck that LS players should be ready for and that they build their decks around. Keep that in mind when taking this deck to a tournament.  <br />

03 * ISB Operations (ISB) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any Coruscant location. <br />
For remainder of game, your characters with ISB, Rebel, or Rebellion in lore are ISB agents and spies, and may deploy regardless of deployment restrictions listed in their game text. Flip if ISB agents control at least two Rebel Base locations or if four ISB agents are on table. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one ISB agent. When you have a non-Undercover ISB agent at a battleground site, your Force drains are +1 there and opponents Force drains are -1 at same and related locations. Flip this card if no ISB agents are on table.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 5D6-RA-7 Death Star Droid from Premiere, 8 to 10 ISB agents, Outer Rim Scouts, Probe Droids, Tarkin (V3) <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective was the first to cause all the players in the game to start reading all of the lore on the cards to see which characters got to be ISB agents. In the beginning, this objective was very popular because it was the first deck that could beat Operatives even before that deck got its major errata. ISB was a way the DS could keep characters in their deck all game by getting to retrieve one during their draw phase. Besides operatives, it was good against Tatooine drain decks and any deck that used speeders because all you had to do was put the Death Star Droid out on one of the sites.  It would be safe from battle and just make all of the drains on that planet -1. If it got killed off, then you just retrieve it next turn and redeploy it. This was the objective that made Outer Rim Scouts so valuable because you could build a very solid ISB deck that played anywhere from 6 to 12 of them. They all drew destiny on their own when piloting and were aliens that could be found and targeted for retrieval with Abyssin Ornament. Combined with a good space package, the deck remained solid for years until the game got to the point of being just too fast for ISB to keep up. Currently, there have only been two V cards (Tarkin (V2) and Frozec (V8)) that specifically help ISB. The objective is not as popular because it is too slow in getting set up for the current speed of the game.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The strongest part of ISB is you have the power to completely SHUTDOWN the force loss the LS is causing from drains on the ground and at the related system. The Death Star Droid is the most powerful card in the deck because it is the key to slowing down the LS force drains. If you can set up Imperial Decree in space by controlling Yavin 4 and Hoth, then the LS will have NO drains. It also has the ability to build a deck that can throw down many characters for free with Sunsdown on the planet because all spies deploy for free. This can be done very easily now with Crossfire (V9) allowing you to find the Sunsdown in your Reserve. The DS in general has an advantage in space, so combined with the bonuses of this objective, you can play a deck that is very hard to beat. The ISB Agents also add +1 to drains at their sites. So no matter where you have an agent, your drain is +1 there.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest advance for ISB was the creation of the super damage ISB deck that plays 15 to 20 different ISB agents and many different battleground sites. Mainly on Tatooine, the idea of the deck is to set up all your sites with Location, Location, Location (V5). The deck uses a mix of sites but are usually six Tatooine, one Endor, one Hoth, and one Cloud City. Once all sites are out, you get Sunsdown on Tatooine. Then in one turn you deploy all the ISB agents in hand at once, usually one at each of these high-force drain sites. Since most of them were free, you also set up Maul in ship at Tatooine with Tatooine Occupation. After cloaking, you have a free drain set up of 2 to 3 per site + 6 cards in direct damage from the Occupation, usually equaling 20 to 30 cards in one turn. Since there are now 9 sites for the LS to cover, they never have enough characters to stop all the possible drains. The deck plays almost no doubles except Maul and the Occupation cards, so even though your hand reached into the twenties, you have almost no fear of Grimtaash (LOST) being played to remove all of your double ISB agents. Grimtaash and Sense Combo must be grabbed to keep the LS from changing your hand before you can set up the deployment. Once set up, the LS has a very hard time absorbing that much damage a turn. As long as you dont take too long to set up, this new version can surprise a lot of LS strategies.  <br />
 <br />
Another version of ISB that came out since my first edition of this document was similar to the drop and drain version only it was a beatdown version. The idea was the same by setting up with many Tatooine sites and the Tatooine system with Maul. It also played many different ISB agents to be safe from Grimtaash. The difference was it used the Nighttime Conditions from Sunsdown to play the 2X-7KPR (Tooex) droid which adds +2 to power and immunity <3 to all characters at same site under NTC. Since most the ISB agents are power 2 to 3, they now become 4 to 5. They still deploy for free, so you wait for the right time and then throw down 10+ ISB agents against a few characters draining on Tatooine. You start Battle Order/First Strike, so they must have a Force to play Houjix. To get around any extra Force the LS was saving, the deck plays a few Jawas (Use 1 Force each), Jawa Packs (Use 3 Force each), and Dathcha (Use 2 Force each). With no way to play Houjix, the deck deals out a game ending beatdown with power between 35 to 40, which can be doubled with Vader and Dark Jedi Presence. After the battle, the ISB agents spread out to finish the LS off. Both versions require you to draw up many turns until you have the right cards in hand.  You must remember to grab the LS cards that can change your hand, mainly Grimtaash and Sense/Recoil in Fear. From my experience, you want to play Cold Feet (V11) and a few extra grabbers underneath your starting effect. These decks dont play ANY doubles of cards except maybe one or two. The evasion is usually 1x Barrier, 1x Ghhhk, 1x Ellis, etc.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: These two new versions can be VERY hard to beat. Many will have no idea about them until reading this document. The beatdown version can still set up huge drains and huge Occupation damage after a few battles. It still plays a lot of Tatooine drain 2 sites but leaves out the off Tatooine locations and those extra drains. Besides the beatdown version, ISB can still be built to be a tough match-up for LS. The Re Edit made Tarkin (V2) a pilot, so he is now amazing in space based ISB decks when adding a destiny with Vader. This is great since he already pulls another ISB agent once per game. ISB can also be a great platform for DS Undercover (V3) spies. Just remember to pack something to get rid of Corran Horn. Besides Corran Horn, the LS usually only plays SATM Combo to get rid of Undercover spies. Cease Fire can be played to cancel the Combo, so the best thing to pack 2x Nevar Yalnal from Premiere. This 6 destiny Interrupt plays at any time at a site where both sides have a spy. It says opponents spy is lost if you draw a destiny > 2. This very basic card can just remove Corran Horn before the LS gets to their move phase and can use his text. Since the objective retrieves the ISBs when they are lost, if you play with enough Undercovers, you can easily cover up all the LS ground drains after their protection is exhausted. EPP Mara (V12) works well in the deck too since many play with Sunsdown and dont forget about JQuille (V8) for some quick direct damage, since the Re Edit made him power 5. He also works great against Speeders to cause a beatdown or cancel EBO. Since these new versions are fast and dont require a lot of playing ability to use well. They should make ISB a new option for DS once again. The power of the seven side makes it worth playing with. <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: From playtesting, the beatdown version has few weaknesses, only losing to bad luck with draws or battles. The only bad part is the LS do have a lot of evasion cards to get around the beatdown if your Jawas fail or you have a hard time finding them. Plus you dont do a big beatdown if you either lose the Tooex droid and/or dont have Vader there with Dark Jedi Presence. The deck only plays cloaked Tat Maul in Ship, thats it. So if the LS can kill both ships and knock Occupation off the table, the deck slows down since it has to pay to drain. The worst match-up for this deck would be an EBO that got set up faster than you and did a lot of early damage. MWYHL + 2x Projection + 2x Free Ride Combo can be hard to beat. The multiple grabbers do a lot against decks that play many abusive LS Interrupts like Were Doomed, It Could Be Worse, Nabrun Leids, 2x Houjix. Like most ISB decks, the current versions still set up slow, so you will always have problems with LS deck that set up really fast and do damage. The D!ck Hat deck might be a hard matchup if you take too many turns of damage. The WYS Obi start is not as hard since ISB can almost autowin if you pack the Fozac (V8) and 2x Undercover (V3). With more time, it might be determined that ISB is still not fast enough to be consistent in larger tournaments, only time will tell.  <br />

04 * Ralltiir Operations (ROPS) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Ralltiir system <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy from Reserve Deck to Ralltiir one site or non-unique Imperial; reshuffle. At Ralltiir locations, each Rebel is deploy +2. Flip this card if Imperials control at least three Ralltiir sites and opponent controls no Ralltiir locations. Place out of play if Ralltiir is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. At Ralltiir locations, each Rebel is deploy +2. At all locations, add X to your total battle destiny, where X = number of Ralltiir locations your Imperials occupy. Once during each of your control phases, you may use 2 Force to take any one card into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if opponent controls at least two Ralltiir locations. Place out of play if Ralltiir is blown away. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: <> sites, AT-STs, different types of Imperials, Insignificant Rebellion (V10), Saber 1-4, A Bright Center of the Universe (V9), Aratech Corporation (V9) <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Known to all as ROPS, at one point this objective was THE most popular deck to be played for DS. Its run lasted from 99 through most of 01. Only after more powerful Episode I ideas came out was this deck considered to be a weaker choice. Though it never won a Worlds title, this objective was played religiously by all different kinds of players. It was a very solid strategy that could set up pretty fast and was very hard for the LS to counter. At the time, the LS only had Rebels to play with, so the deploy +2 gave this deck a huge advantage. The standard version would only deploy 3 to 4 sites then set up AT-STs to react. Since you could find any card for 2 Force, the rest of the deck could be built to counter the LS strategy. ROPS was one of the best DS options for years until the Jabbas Palace Sealed Deck released Ounee Ta. The release of Ounee Ta made it hard for the DS to stop the LS characters from deploying fast to the planet with the -3 to deployment at their <> sites. Then a few months later in Tatooine, the LS was given Qui-Gon Jinn. With his immunity to attrition, ROPS became too weak to be tournament playable. For the past years, it was only being played by those who still long for the old times and build versions that seemed to look good on paper, but in the end still lost. Only recently has ROPS returned as a solid DS option.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: ROPS wins because it is a balanced objective. The combination of LS drains being 1, getting an average of +3 to all battle destinies, and being able to take any card from Reserve deck makes the objective very hard to counter. Because you set up on Ralltiir first, then spend the rest of the game either defending Ralltiir or attacking the LS on their planet, you will almost always have constant damage going. Since you have to set up at least one Imperial at each site to get the bonus on battle destiny, if you can set up in space, you will always be draining unless the LS can completely wipe you off Ralltiir, which almost never happens. The deck builds this deck uses will be different depending on which characters you choose to play with. Some versions play many sites and many cheap Imperials to get as much bonus as possible. The larger number of sites makes it harder for the LS to knock all of your characters off table. The downside is you give the LS more options for controls two Ralltiir locations to flip you back, so you need to make sure you have the right balance of sites and Imperials with defense cards. The most common defense has always been the AT-ST reacting to protect the weaker characters. The strategies in ROPS are very specific, so the LS will many times not have the right cards to even make it possible to win. That is one reason ROPS is so powerful. If it can set up and stay flipped, it usually never loses. The LS has to either out damage you with their own strategy or flip you back to win.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: ROPS got a huge boost with the creation of Insignificant Rebellion (V10). It provides protection from Ounee Ta, which had been turned into a Shield for the LS to always have at their disposal. It allows the set-up to be much faster with the ability to activate 3 Force whenever you deploy a site to Ralltiir. As an added bonus, you also get to exchange any card in lost with a different card of the same type from hand whenever you draw battle destiny. The creation of IR (V10) opened up new deck ideas for ROPS. The most popular version being played currently uses Aratech Corporation (V9) to set up the AT-ST with pilot much like Maneuvering Flaps (V4) does for the LS. AC (V9) is stronger since it doesnt have to be matching, just any Imperial Pilot that is ability < 3 will do. The new version of this deck always deploys 4 to 5 sites depending on how many immune to attrition Jedi the LS is playing with. Since it sets up the AT-STs so easily, many of them can be played to react and protect all of the sites. The other two newer V cards that help the current ROPS are Imperial Justice (V10) and A Bright Center of the Universe (V9). IJ (V10) plays to limit battle destinies for both sides to one. They cant be modified or canceled by either side. Since the objective adds to your total battle destiny and not to the draw itself, it still goes through with the bonus added. ABCOTU (V9) works together with the objective making the LS drains -1 by allowing you to retrieve the bonus from a drain once per turn. So if they drain for 3 at Kessel or 3 at the Cantina with a Jedi + Stick it becomes a 1. When played together, all of these new V cards make ROPS a very powerful option for LS.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Insignificant Rebellion (V10) has now given new life to this objective. ROPS is once again a presence at local and major tournaments. The deck can set up easily every game and just sit back waiting for the LS to either come to them or be battled off the table. This strategy combined with the ability to find any card you want during your control phase makes for some very powerful combos. The ground sets up the AT-STs and can play with several different space packages. The most popular versions play with the matching Sabers, usually 2x of Baron Fel and 2x Saber 1, with 1x of each of the other Sabers. Besides Saber 1, Saber 4 is the best because it reacts for free to a system that has an Interceptor with ANY pilot. ROPS usually has two options for where to set up in space. First way evolves putting a Presence of the Force on Ralltiir, so the AO Fighters Coming In can be played to land a forfeited starfigher as well as add 2 to the immunity of each Saber. The LS has a much harder time taking over the system with all the Saber fighters piled up with the AO allowing them to absorb attrition, then take back off. The problem with this method is the POTF can be canceled with Clash of Sabers or Alter. Since you have to have presence in space for Battle Plan or Battle Order some versions choose to play with Fonder or Corulag which is pulled with Establish Control (V11) or the objective. Space is the most important part of ROPS because you have to be able to drain for free to win, having to pay 3 to drain for 1 gets old very fast. When building a good ROPS deck, you want to play a good number of cheap Imperial Pilots that can be flashed with AC (V9) to pull AT-STs. ROPS is a great objective for playing Imperial Domination (V4), which allows you to retrieve Imperial characters for initiating or winning a battle while you dont have any non-Imperial characters or independent starships on table. It also lets you take a just drawn Imperial for destiny in battle into hand for a redraw. This card can be very powerful since your addition to battle destiny with the objective will usually give you the victory. Your characters now have a way to stay in your deck while the objectives attrition continues to put the LS characters in lost pile.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The newest versions of ROPS set up fast, and absorbs damage well. The only weaknesses are the same ones that have been plaguing ROPS since the Episode I cards were released. Jedi with full immunity to attrition are this decks worst nightmare. Since the LS just has to control two locations to flip you back, the most common ways ROPS loses is Mace (V9) coming down and clearing one site, while Tantive IV (V7) and friends take over the system. If the LS can pile up enough stuff at the system and hold the site with Mace, ROPS will never flip back. ROPS is a deck that has to be flipped in order to win. The zero side does almost nothing to hurt the LS, so it is very important to stay flipped all game. Quick Draw (V9) can target the AT-STs, so it is possible to take overflow with Mace (V9) swinging twice. The LS can also play different characters and Interrupts to prevent the DS from reacting like Sense. ROPS will always spread out and rely on the reacting AT-STs to prevent a beatdown. If the react is prevented, the DS can receive huge overflow. ROPS is a DS deck that normally deploys a lot of cards to the table, so large amounts of overflow can easily beat this deck. The other problems with ROPS can be in the damage department. If the version doesnt play Overseeing It Personally, you will only be draining for 1 at each site. The LS can play 2x Projection of a Skywalker on two sites, while Mace (V9) holds a third. That means your five sites with at least one character at each one and you are only doing two in damage. Were Doomed can also kill the damage in this deck since the card rounds down with 3P0 or Artoo on table, the drains of 1 all become ZERO. Since Were Doomed isnt played until late game anyway, the DS can get stuck grabbing a different card earlier in the game. ROPS worst match-ups are decks that do a lot of damage in one turn or have the resources to invade Ralltiir. The key to playing ROPS these days is to know what to expect and build your deck to be as reactive as possible against that. ROPS is not an auto-win for DS but does give all LS decks a challenge. <br />

05 * Imperial Occupation (Non V) (Operatives) *R.I.P* <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy any planet system and one <> site to that system. This system is the Subjugated planet. <br />
While this side up, once during each of the deploy phases, you may deploy one <> site to the Subjugated planet from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if your matching operatives control at least three battlegrounds sites related to the Subjugated planet.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, opponents Force drains are -1. You may retrieve 1 Froce whenever you deploy a matching operative to the Subjugated planet. Your matching operatives on that planet are each forfeit +2 and, when at same site as an Imperial or AT-AT, are each power +2. When you have at least one matching operative in a battle on the Subjugated planet, you may add one battle destiny. Flip this card if you do not occupy at least two battleground sites related to the Subjugated planet.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: A very stupid idea. At first, the original strategy was to play a deck with 25 of your planets Operative because they were broken on their planet. Basically it worked like this; your objective pulled the sites, then once you controlled three, you flipped. The flip side made all lightside drains -1, your operatives added +1 to force drains, deployed for one, forfeit for like 4 or 5, added a destiny at all sites while you had just one operative on the planet, and you retrieved a force every time you simply deployed one to a site. They were even power +2 against a Rebel. This was totally not a Star Wars movie idea, just crap that hurt the game. <br />
 <br />
SPECIAL NOTE: Because of all the problems this objective caused. Decipher created three cards that completely hurt this deck as well as an errata to the rules saying that only one operative may be at a site, anymore would be lost. This objective is considered to be DEAD. Decipher created this idea with no thought of what they were doing. This objective is one that they wish they had never made. It won the &#39;98 worlds for both sides because it was a broken idea. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Nothing, the objective still stinks. You play it, you are doing it as a surprise factor only. The only reason you should win with this objective is against someone who isnt playing with the counter cards or who doesnt know how it works. STAY AWAY!!!  <br />

06 * Endor Operations (Endor Ops) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Endor system, Bunker and Landing Platform. <br />
While this side up, once during each of your control phases, may take one Ominous Rumors or Establish Secret Base into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Flip this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are both on table. Place out of play if an Endor location is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, at each Endor site where you have a biker scout or a piloted AT-ST, your Force drains may not be modified or canceled by opponent, except by a react. Opponent draws no more than one battle destiny in each battle. Your AT-STs are immune to attrition <3. Once during each of your draw phases, you may retrieve one biker scout. Flip this card if Ominous Rumors and Establish Secret Base are not both on table. Place out of play if an Endor location is blown away. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Endor sites, Ominous Rumors, Establish Secret Base (V9), AT-STs, Aratech Corparation (V9), Death Star II, Biker scouts, That Things Operational  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Originally a very difficult objective to stay flipped because it was not that hard for the LS to get rid of one of the Effects that you needed to have on table. For years this objective was only used as a platform for playing star destroyers in space. Many versions would never play with any additional ground sites and just used the bonus drain from Ominous Rumors to drain at systems. Many common versions were called Endor Ops Big Blue because so much of the deck had big power blue cards like the Star Destroyers and AT-ATs to hold the docking bay. As the strategies for the DS changed and got faster, this objective became less and less popular. It stayed in the binder for a good 3 years until V9. Endor Ops can now be built very differently with the new Virtual cards. Establish Secret Base (V9) was the biggest help since it is one of the two Effects you need to flip the objective. The original was easy for the LS to cancel; now it never leaves the table once deployed. ESB (V9) also provides the deck with the ability to deploy Aratech Corporation (V9) or an Effect with Endor in lore or game text. If all of that wasnt enough functionality on the card, it also says that at each site controlled by an AT-ST or Biker Scout, the LS loses the Force generation. Endor Ops can now be built very differently from years past. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The objectives strongest text is the LS being limited to just ONE battle destiny in ALL battles. Since you can flip so easily now, the deck can be built as a mains and toys platform around the limiting of battle destiny. Establish Secret Base (V9) provides the base for how the deck is built. Since the objective pulls one of the two Effects already, you can start Crossfire (V9) to pull the other one in the same turn, so you flip first turn as soon as you have a guy at the Bunker (ESB (V9) requires you to control Bunker to be deployed). The DS Bunker can deploy Endor Shield (V11), which can pull any Admiral, General, Moff, or Commander twice per game (just like Strike Planning for LS). The DS Bunker says the LS may only move here from the Back Door, so the best strategy for protecting the Bunker is to not deploy the Back Door. Then use Endor Shield (V11) to pull Commander Praji (V2), who then pulls a pilot of ability < 3 during your control phase. So the LS has only one turn to invade the Bunker with a spy before Praji pulls Corporal Derdrum (V5), who prevents both spies and Jar Jar from deploying to same site. If IAO is also on table, the LS is completely prevented from ever being at the Bunker unless they play their own Back Door. Once the Bunker is safe and you have flipped, the rest of the deck can be anything. You can choose to play a ground-based version with reacting AT-STs or Speeder Bikes OR you could also play a space-based version that uses the bonus drain of Ominous Rumors. Many options exist with this deck now, yet there is still no solid version out there to use as the one example.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: This is probably the objective that got the most updated information since the first posting of this document. At the time this article was created, Endor Ops was still not being played very much. In the past year, some new ideas for the objective have come around. One version uses the system Gall with Dreadnaughts and Turbolaser Batteries (which are also Blasters in their lore like Quad Cannons). Gall says if you control, once per battle you may make any just hit target LOST. Since they are used in space, you have the ability to make any one ship you hit in battle LOST, like having a Dr.Evazan in space. The deck sets up Rendili StarDrive to allow the Batteries to deploy and fire for free, plus it adds +1 to each of the weapon destiny draws. The basic idea of the deck is to set up a Dreadnaught at each system with a TB and also uses Defensive Fire (V5), which adds 2 to EACH TB weapon destiny to hit any ship and make them Lost. Since the objective prevents the LS from drawing more than one battle destiny, the DS can set up Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin to prevent the LS from ever getting destiny. Blizzard 2 (V4) can protect Tarkin and provide added power making the site very difficult for the LS to beatdown. Although this new idea is different and sometimes effective, it can lose against a LS deck that does fast damage. The TBs can sometimes have trouble hitting if you are unable to play Defensive Fire (V5). If the LS never battles your Dreadnaughts, you will not be able to knock all of them off the table.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This objective has many new ideas that can now be played with it. One ongoing strategy around Endor Ops is building the second Death Star. The Death Star II provides a different way to play Endor Ops. Rather than concentrate on flipping the objective, this deck will set up all the DSII sectors. It can play Endor Shield (non-V) and once all the DSII sectors are deployed can deploy That Things Operational. This Epic Event will cause direct damage while it occupies a system other then Endor. The loss is increased by 1 for each related battleground site you occupy. The DSII can use the Superlaser Mark II to target capital ships with 3 weapon destiny draws. For the DSII to be built, the deck uses the Starting Interrupt, Operational As Planned, to take the DSII system, Moff Jerjerrod, and another Effect into hand. You then draw 6 cards instead of the normal 8. The usual Effect to start is Desperate Counter, which pretty much has to be started since it provides the protection text for the DSII should the LS try to blow it up. It can pull both Combat Response and Imperial Arrest Order, so you are not hurting that bad by not being able to start 3 Effects. Unlike the first Death Star, this one doesnt require the LS to use an Epic Event to blow it up. Any starfighter can fly into the sectors and attempt to blow up the DSII once they reach the Core. The good thing is it is easier to stop them if you play the right cards. In order to move between each sector, the opponent must draw a movement destiny. Thanks to Desperate Counter, for each TIE you have at the DSII, the draw is -3 (limit -9). The best TIE for protecting the DSII is Scythe 1 because it can fire a weapon during your move phase. This allows you to shoot down the LS starships as they try to move through each sector. You need Moff Jerjerrod to have any chance of building the system. He prevents spies from deploying to same DSII site and pulls the Superlaser Mark II and DSII sectors once per turn. Since Endor Shield (V11) can now pull any Moff, you now have a choice rather to continue to use the Starting Interrupt or just use Prepared Defenese and start Endor Shield (V11). The problem with using Prepared Defenses is you dont have any way of finding the DSII system, so for this type of deck to work you really have no choice but to use Operational as Planned. For years players have tried to find a way to make the building of the DSII strategy work but the current build deploys WAY too many cards. You have to have cards to cause damage, defend the DSII, and battle the opponent. Since the game has become so fast, there is no way this strategy can be used on a regular bases to win. This strategy probably requires cards to be pulled from underneath your Starting Effect. If they made an Effect that could be started with Prepared Defenses and it pulled the system and all three sectors from underneath your Starting Effects, the strategy could become fast enough to be worth playing. Plus the ability to start 3 different Effects would open the deck up for different builds. Hopefully there will be helper cards when and if the DSII set is Virtualized.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Although many aspects of Endor Ops can be powerful, unless you are playing a very specific design, the majority of decks built around this objective are going to lose. This is another DS Objective that deploys a lot of cards and doesnt really do a lot once flipped. There are currently some new versions being played that are doing well in tournaments and this objective has gotten a lot better. There has not been enough talk about what has made this deck better, so I dont have more reason to play this objective beyond the ideas listed unless you are playing a unique version like the Dreadnaught version described above or a new one that no one knows about. It would be wise to try another DS option until more information is available on what makes this strategy work. As new sets continue to be made, it is very possible that Endor Ops will become the new top tier option for DS.  <br />

07 * This Deal is Getting Worse All the Time (TDIGWATT or Dark Deal Objecitve) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy one Cloud City battleground site. May deploy Secret Plans and/or All Wrapped Up.  <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases may take Bespin system, Bespin: Cloud City, Dark Deal or Cloud City Occupation into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Cloud City, Jabbas Palace, and Special Edition characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay when deploying to Bespin locations. Flip this card if Dark Deal on table and you occupy Bespin system and Bespin: Cloud City.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, Surreptitious Glance may not cancel Dark Deal. The Planet That Its Farthest From is suspended if targeting Bespin. Opponent loses 8 Force when you play All Too Easy. At each Bespin location you control with an Imperial, your Force drains may not be modified by opponent. If you have an alien/Imperial pair in battle, your total battle destiny is +2 (or +4 if alien is an Ugnaught). Flip this card if Dark Deal is canceled, if opponent controls Bespin system or if Bespin is blown away. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Im Sorry or Im Sorry (V12), Executor, They Will Never Again Leave this City, Obsidian TIEs, Cloud City locations, Bespin, All Too Easy, Dark Deal  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: When the Cloud City set first came out, one of the most popular cards for the DS was Dark Deal. It was a new strategy that was introduced as the DSs version of EBO, having to control a number of locations before it could be played and then the opponent having to occupy a number of locations to cancel it. Just like EBO, it was very hard to set up fast because back then you had to draw the sites, the TIE for the sector, and the effect. Because of the overwhelming love for this effect, this objective was created to allow the DS to set up this strategy much faster and have the ability to keep it longer. The objective finally pulled everything that you needed to flip except two more sites. So even though you could play this objective, it was still not as fast as it should be. When the Tatooine set was released, Im Sorry provided the last piece of the puzzle by pulling two Cloud City interior battleground sites once per game. Finally you could play this objective and set up Dark Deal to get a bonus in both power and drain and it could be done quickly, usually by the second or third turn. This did make the objective more popular but you still had to control three Cloud City sites with a TIE controlling the Cloud City sector in order to deploy the Dark Deal Effect. Since you already started the game with one site on table, the LS had one turn to invade the site keeping you from getting out DD. It was also hard to find the TIE needed to occupy Cloud City. Since nothing found the TIE for you, most of the time you had to get lucky drawing it or play cards to get out TIEs. The slowness of this objective still made it hard to play. With the speed of the game today, it is hardly seen at tournaments.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The strategy of this deck is to set up Dark Deal as fast as possible. Since the objective pulls the system, Cloud City sector, Occuption, and the Dark Deal Effect; all you have to do is build the deck to set up the sites with characters and the ship at Cloud City. Dark Deal provides a Force drain bonus of +2 at each site, plus +4 to total power in all battles at Cloud City sites. The LS has to occupy 5 Bespin locations to cancel it. The objective protects it from any other method of canceling Dark Deal. Since you will have the system, sector, and the minimum three sites out, the LS does have the ability to cancel it. The problem is they rarely have enough Force in one turn to deploy enough cards to five different locations and keep from getting beatdown next turn. The LS is usually forced to battle at a few locations, then after a few turns, spread out to cancel the Effect. Completing Dark Deal and occupying the system is the key to the whole objective. Once both have been satisfied, it flips to the seven side. If you no longer occupy the system or the LS cancels DD, then it flips back. A speed version is usually the most powerful build for this objective. You want to set up Dark Deal as fast as possible and start doing heavy drain damage before the LS can set up and come after you. Since you pull Bespin, the deck can easily set up the free Executor with They Must Never Again Leave This City just like CCT. One of the most common versions play some type of troopers that set up cheap so you can usually have DD going by turn 2 or 3. Cards like Stunning Leader, Trooper Assault, and Cease Fire can keep the weaker troopers alive to drain and prevent the LS from spreading out. Another version uses cheap aliens like Reegesk or Greedo to flip quickly.  Other versions try and set up a solid character at one site with some form of reacting power to protect the other sites. This works well with AT-STs for exterior sites or Comlink if you want to deploy stuff as a react. Another version sets up Sunsdown at Bespin so you can deploy all your spies for free. This makes for a very fast DD set up once the sites and TIE is out. EPP Mara (V12) works well at the Carbon Freezing Chamber, since the seven side of the objective causes the LS to lose 8 Force when All To Easy is played.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest change to this objective was the creation of Im Sorry (V12). This new version of Im Sorry can pull Obsidian TIEs, non-unique Cloud sectors, and Floating Refineries. It also causes 1 Force in direct damage during your turn when you control two cloud sectors with TIEs. Since this V version pulls the TIE, all you have to do is build the deck to pull the other two sites. The objective still pulls everything else you need, so the best option would be to play Ket Maliss (V3) to pull the CC: Docking Bay, then use the card to pull a character once per turn to set up DD. KM (V3) can pull Greedo (V3), Reegesk (V3), Hem Dazon (V3), Dannik Jerriko, or Beedo. Since you usually go first and can pull one during their turn, you should be able to set up DD on turn two if you find the last site. Voyeur (V5) is a basic way to pull the third site since it can just flat out pull ANY battleground site. Sonic Bombardment can pull the Security Tower. Lando System (V5) can also pull the Tower since it says Lando in the game text. Those three options are the only way to find the third site short of drawing it. Since the whole deck relies on getting the third site, the best bet would be to play 4 total sites in the deck, 2 to 3 Voyeur (V5), and maybe one Security Tower. The Voyeur (V5) can only pull battlegrounds, so you might want to play 5 total sites so you have a good chance of getting one of the locations or one of the Interrupts that pulls them in your opening hand. You can also play 2x Unexpected Interruption to pull ANY Interrupt into hand. The more cards you put toward pulling the final site, the better chance you will have of getting one in your opening hand. It is always a good idea to play with more than one site because the LS may take over your starting site, forcing you to deploy additional sites. Finding the TIE was always the hardest part of setting up DD, so Im Sorry (V12) has really changed the speed of this deck. Besides DD, this objective is a good platform for using Weather Vane (V6) and the Chasm Walkway. The Re Edit removed the Vane (V6) ability to cause the player who has a character on the Vane to lose 1 Force. The good thing is Vane (V6) still provides +2 in Force Generation if you have the Cloud City sector on table and makes the LS character that is relocated from the Vane captured if a Bounty Hunter is on Cloud City. Maul With Stick or an immunity to attrition Maul with his Double-bladed stick work very well at holding the Walkway all game. When you combine all of that with The Phantom Menace, Maul is very hard to hit and totally immune to attrition. Since he comes back during your control phase, this strategy works very well for getting around Battle Plan should the LS attack Maul on their turn. The only way to knock him off the table is multiple characters who draw destiny that arent Jedi. Maul gets 2 swings, so the LS have to come with at least 3 characters or you have to miss. Maul, YA already adds +1 to each draw when targeting Jedi. If you add the AO Fighter Cover, while you occupy Bespin, he gets another +1. Since the deck will usually be starting Mob Points Combo to set up the Free Executor, Maul only needs a 1 and 2 to hit Mace (V9). This strategy used to be stronger with the original Combat Readiness (V8) setting up the system, CC sector, and Chasm to start the game, plus 4 effects. Now you have to take a few turns to set all of that up. The LS can play Entrenchment (V9) to always get the first weapon phase action at the Chasm. The deck can set up Occupation with the docking bay or the Tower to put the captured characters coming off the Vane. The only real problem is the speed. Since you only start the game with one location, it can usually take up to 3 turns before everything is in place.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Im Sorry (V12) has opened up new options for this deck. If you play enough cheap characters and dont get bad luck with important cards being in your Force pile, it is possible to set up DD during your first turn. Plus this objective has the ability to set up the free Executor. If you dont set it up on the first turn, the best versions of this deck can still set up DD by second or third turn. When you combine the drain bonus of DD with the damage of Bespin Occupation, this deck has the ability to do some serious damage in one turn. Just by having the five main locations set up with DD and Occupation, the LS would have to lose a potential 14 cards in one turn (thats if two of the three sites are drain 2). That doesnt include Im Sorry (V12) damage in the clouds or the fact you might have a POTF or lightsaber adding to drain. Whether you go with spies, troopers, or just aliens with Ket Maliss (V3), the key will always be speed. This objective can only beat specific LS decks if it can set up fast enough to cause damage before the LS is ready to come after you or set up their own strategy. The seven side prevents the LS from modifying your drains but they can still cancel them. You also have no way of preventing the LS from canceling your drain bonuses with Jedi Test I or Menace Fades. So if you hope to beat a LS deck that plays with those cards, you have to pack ways to get around them. The only way to get around Test 1 is to play with Failure in the Cave and Dagobah: Cave. The idea is to wait until you have completely set up DD, then the FITC will give you at least 2 turns of draining if they play with 5 sites and The Way Of Things. The earlier you can play it, the longer it will take them to complete all 5 tests. Getting around Menace Fades can be done with a battling version that can keep the LS from controlling a site or system. Most LS decks take a few turns to even set up MF and since you usually go first, you will already have an advantage. Menace Fades can be hard to get around but it doesnt automatically beat this deck. They have to keep it going all game and get around the Occupation, not always easy to do with the Executor holding the system.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The same reasons to not play this deck exist now as they did two years ago; speed and effectiveness. MWYHL with Jedi Test 1, Speeders/EBO with Menace Fades, HB with Menace Fades, and any deck that goes first can be a problem for this deck. There are many LS decks that start doing damage from turn one like any deck that starts Obi with KDH (V8). So if you dont get DD going within the first few turns, you will not be able to do enough damage or keep it going long enough to win. The effectiveness of this objective is not always worth playing with. Since it can be hard to keep presence at Bespin, you rarely stay on the seven side. Plus the majority of versions built dont even use the abilities of the seven side. This is another DS deck that can deploy a lot of cards to the table, so if you start taking early damage before you get DD going, it can be hard to come back. The LS has a lot of powerful Jedi to throw down and knock your characters off the sites. Make sure to always have a defensive card ready if you play the speed version with weaker characters. Another problem for this deck is Ultimatium, since your deck is mostly built to set up the three sites for drains, it hurts to be capped at drain 2 per location. While this has never been the strongest DS objective, there will always be one or two players who love DD and try to make it work in major tournaments. As far as I know, noone has ever won a big tournament nor qualified for Day 3 playing this objective. This one should best be saved for specific meta tournaments or if someone finds a way to constantly set up DD by turn 2.  <br />

08 * Court of the Vile Gangster (Court) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Audience Chamber, Great Pit of Carkoon and Dungeon.  <br />
While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one docking bay or Independent Starship from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Bounty hunters are forfeit +2 and immune to Goo Nee Tay. You may not play Scanning Crew. Each player loses 1 Force at end of each of their deploy phases unless that player has a non-droid character at a Tatooine battleground site. Flip this card if you have two captives (or a captive of ability >2 at any Jabbas Palace site(s) <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy Sarlacc, Rancor or Rancor Pit from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Captives targeted by Trap Door are immediately relocated to Rancor Pit (do no draw destiny) and Trap Door may not be canceled. Opponent loses Force equal to forfeit value of each opponents character eaten by a Rancor or Sarlacc (place that character out of play). Flip this card if you have no captives at Tatooine sites and opponent has no characters at same site as Rancor.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Some version of Jabba, Bounty Hunters, Cards that Capture, Independent Starships, Creatures; Rancor or Sarlacc, Den of Thieves (V8), Scum and Villainy, Hidden Weapons  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: The classic capture objective. This deck was made and groomed to be the best objective for playing with Bounty Hunters who want to capture. The whole idea of the objective is to capture a guy, then feed them to one of your creatures. If the LS stays away from Tatooine all together, they will pay for it. The objective cause 1 card direct damage while a player doesnt have a character present at a Tatooine battleground site. Whenever you finally feed someone to either the Rancor or the Sarlacc, the character is placed out of play, the LS loses Force equal to the forfeit of the character eaten, and the Rancor Pit lets you retrieve Force equal to the same forfeit. At first, this was not that easy because the LS Epps could easily cut through the Bounty Hunters that were trying to capture. Only after the V cards were made did this objective gain a lot of momentum. Cards like Jabbas Influence (V6) to pull aliens and make your Bounty Hunters power +1, Lando (V5) to auto-hit with Hidden Weapons, and Krayt Dragon Bones (V3) which allowed you to keep those creatures under your Starting Effect (Fear Is My Ally) as well as add two additional Ferocity to the Rancor making him a 10 + destiny. All of the alien based decks have gotten better with each Virtual set. There are always new aliens, weapons, or Effects that do more to help the aliens win.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This objective is still one of the BEST retrieval decks the DS has. It wins very easily if the LS is already focused on Tatooine for their strategy; i.e. Profit, WYS (NON V), Hyperdrive, Agents, and any Obi start or CP (V8). It is SO easy for you to both capture and feed any of their characters to the Rancor or Sarlacc that the LS will have trouble deploying their ground on Tatooine. Even if you capture a powerful character like Mace (V9), he can still sit in jail until weaker characters are deployed to try and free him. Currently, this deck has many many options for how it can be built. There are many powerful Bounty Hunters that have no problem capturing any character in the game. The key is to set up the AC with Jabba the Hutt (V8), Scum, and a few friends.  Then you wait. You have None Shall Pass (V8), which sends any LS character (except Leia) deploying to a Jabbas Palace site to bottom of the LS Force pile. You can also play Stunning Leader and Barrier to keep your AC crew from getting wiped away. Then on your turn, you drop one of the many options for capturing and try to take away the LS character. Trap Door is played without having to draw destiny (thanks to the objective) to send the captive immediately to the Rancor Pit. Since the Rancor deploys for free from under your starting effect with Krayt Dragon Bones (V3), it can be set up as soon as you deploy the Pit. Once a few LS characters have been eaten and placed out of play, you will usually have no lost pile while the opponent will have fewer characters and have lost Force from the Forfeit of the characters eaten. The other bonus to this deck is it can pull all of your Independent Starships from Reserve, so you are not weak in space either. You can set up Jabbas Space Cruiser (V8), Zuckess in Mist Hunter, Boba Fett in Slave I, Dengar in Punishing One, IG in IG200, and even Mauls Sith Infiltrator. Of course, Mauls ship would have to deploy to a docking bay and shuttle up once you got Maul out. Besides the ships, the objective also pulls docking bays. This means you can still get to any planet the LS is playing on as long as you play with that systems related docking bay. The standard docking bays you will use are usually Hoth, Endor, Cloud City, and the <> from Special Edition which can go to Tatooine, Naboo, Corellia, Datooine, and a ton of others. The majority of LS decks that play on Hoth already play the docking bay which may already be shielded by the Main Power Generators, so you dont usually want to play with that one in that match up. You can also consider leaving out Endor since LS Endor decks are not as popular anymore. Endor can be good for a random battleground for draining and setting up Search & Destroy since it requires the LS to pay +9 to transit there and +7 to transit away. If you come up against a LS deck that has no counters for capturing, you will have a very easy game no matter what their strategy is doing (unless its all space or heavy evasion). Binders can be very powerful in this deck allowing one Bounty Hunter to carry more than one captive at a time. Put one on IG With Gun or 4-Lom With Gun and the LS has no way of fighting the droid to release the captives. Plus you can play Droid Shutdown to protect them from SATM. You can use Hes All Yours Bounty Hunter (non V) to transfer a captive from Fett to the droids. Then when the time is right, feed the captive to a creature or put them in jail for a quick 2 Force retrieval per captive thanks to the Jabbas Palace: Dungeon text. Boba Fett SE (V8) is probably the best all around capture character for this deck. He can auto capture with his game text, has a matching weapon that captures adding +2 to capture and +1 to Force Drains while escorting, and also gives you a target for Hidden Weapons which paired with Lando (V5) is either captured or Immediately Lost.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Court has become somewhat popular with the change of the original V8 Scum. The DS can choose to play this deck and capture over playing a beatdown version. The biggest addition to Court was Bounty (V12), which plays on a just captured character, then returns to your hand after retrieving 4 Force when you transfer the character to a prison during your Control phase. This new Bounty can be found either with All Wrapped Up (V8) or with the Fanfare shield since it is now an Immediate Effect. The Dungeon provides an additional +2 retrieval; you get 2 more with Scum, then whatever the forfeit was from the character that was eaten by the Rancor. All of that together makes Court a very powerful option for DS. Besides Bounty (V8), Court got some new characters to play with. The biggest being Aurra Sing (V12). As mentioned already with other decks, this new Aura can relocate to any site with a Jedi during the opponents activate phase. Then once per game, she can fire a weapon during the opponents move phase. If you play Quietly Observing, she is ability 0, meaning the LS has no way of getting around her besides SATM (also Hans Gun (V2) or A280 Sharpshooter Rifle (V9), but no one plays with those). You can sit in front of the LS party and use Snipers to capture characters with Feltipern Trevaggs Stun Rifle (V9). This new capture weapon can deploy on any Bounty Hunter and adds +2 to the draw. When you add Hermi Olde (V8), you get another +2 to ANY non-lightsaber, non-permanent character weapon destiny. If you have You Cannot Hide Forever out, it would only take a 3 to capture Mace, Qui-Gon, or Yoda. If you add Lando (V5), then you only need a 2.  The final piece would be to give Aurra Sing some Binders so she can hold all of the characters she captures. The rules for relocating say you cant do it while escorting a captive unless the card letting you relocate says so. This is where the docking bays come in so you can get Aurra back to the Dungeon. You can make her trip faster with Hes All Your Bounty Hunter (V5) letting her move 2 additional times for free. Establish Control (V11) is great in Court since it already pulls the docking bays. Plus it gets your system for free draining.  Another change came in the Advanced Rules document with the changes to creatures.  They are not as powerful as they were before the rules change and anyone considering playing this deck should re-read the Advanced Rules document for the creature rules to make sure they know how those cards will play now. <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The ability to capture is a very very powerful mechanic for the DS. With characters like Mace (V) and Qui-Gon who are completely immune to attrition, it is nice to be able to just take them away from the LS. Capturing is also great for setting up beatdowns. When the LS has two or three characters together at a site, you can capture the stronger ones taking them out of the battle immediately, leaving the weaker character to take battle damage. On top of all of that, you can retrieve your whole lost pile. The objective even provides direct damage for LS decks that stay away from Tatooine. The LS currently has some problems with this deck. If built correctly, most LS decks will not be able handle the many different types of capturing. Besides All Wrapped Up (V8) and Feltiperns Gun (V9), the DS has Hidden Weapons, Boba Fett SE (V8), Fetts Gun (V6), IGs Gun (V5), Dengars Modified Riot Gun, and IG-88 With Gun. You may not see this at your local tournaments but as time goes on, more and more Court decks will be seen taking out the LS Jedi.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest weakness this deck has is in space because the majority of the deck is ground based around capturing and battling. This decks worst match-up is Hidden Base with weapons since most LS starship weapons have no problem shooting down the Enhanced Bounty Hunter ships. The space package in this deck is usually meant for defense only or getting around Battle Plan/Order only.  It will have a problem putting up a fight against most LS space decks. The most popular thing to do is get Maul in Ship going at a system as a way to keep presence in space while still being able to play Scum. Jabbas Space Cruiser (V8) is a standard ship to include since it reacts to bring in a ship and pilot for free. Gela Yeens (V6) is very important if you want to stay alive in space against weapon-based LS space decks. The deck also has problems causing fast damage against decks that it cant fight like MWYHL or Speeders. Since the Speeders protect the characters from capture, they can be hard to beat when you are unable to hit the vehicles with P-59 or Dengar With Gun. Speeders can set up and do damage much faster than Court, and Frostbite (V4) gets back all the cards lost from the direct damage. It is important to play with JQuille (V8) to get under the shields. MWYHL can shutdown all drains with Test 1, Honor Of The Jedi, and Projection Of A Skywalker. If you come up against the Asteroid version, your ships will not survive and they will be doing 4 to 6 in damage depending on how many they play with.  <br />

09 * Set Your Course for Alderaan (SYCFA) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Death Star and Alderaan systems and Docking Bay 327.  <br />
For remainder of game, Revolution is canceled and Commence Primary Ignition may target only Alderaan, Yavin 4, Hoth, or a Subjugated planet. While this side up, one during each of your deploy phases, may take one card with Death Star in title into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. You may not Force drain at Alderann system. At Death Star sites, your Force drains and battle damage against you are canceled. Flip this card if Alderaan is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may deploy one battleground system from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your Star Destroyers deploy -2 (or -1 Victory-Class) to Death Star system. Your Force drains at battleground systems where you have a Star Destroyer are each +1 (or +2 if that Star Destroyer is Imperial- or Super-class). If Yavin 4 system is blown away. Adds 3 to Force lost for each opponents Yavin 4 site. Place out of play if Death Star is blown away.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 2 or more Emperor Palpatines and/or Darth Sidious, lots of unique and non unique Star Destroyers, Fear Will Keep Them in Line (V),  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is another movie objective. It allows you to literally recreate the blowing up of Alderaan. The deck can be built many different ways. When it came out, it was built as a Mains and Toys platform because at the time, it provided the largest amount of activation of any DS deck.  It also allowed you to pull additional Death Star sites for even more activation.  For a short time, there was the Brangus Glee deck based around this objective. With the introduction of V cards, the deck became even more powerful with the creation of Fear Will Keep Them In Line (V2). Fear deploys on the Death Star and deals out direct damage of 2 for each battleground system you control with a Star Destroyer. This means SYCFA Fear is the fastest way to set up large amounts of direct damage. When building this deck, you have to decide if you want to flip or not. The majority of versions will not flip since the zero side protects the DS from beatdown at the Death Star sites. SYCFA is the best platform for ANY DS space deck because you can set up Darth Sidious or Emperor Palpatine at the docking bay to drain for free. Since both those characters are immune to attrition, the only way the LS can remove them is with a weapon or by canceling their game text or immunity to attrition. The majority of current LS decks will have no way to cancel the immunity to attrition and will use weapons to try to eliminate these characters, so the best way to keep your characters on the table is with Force Field or Lightsaber Parry. LP can only be played if your Dark Jedi has a lightsaber as well. Since you dont care about fighting at the docking bay, Force Field can be the best way to protect your characters from lightsabers. Since both of the Dark Jedi characters you would use are ability 7, the LS will have a much harder time hitting them with non-lightsaber weapons. Some builds use Wipe Them Out, All Of Them (V9) to protect the Dark Jedi from permanent weapons. If you do decide to flip the objective, you will lose the protection from battle damage, thus losing your best Tech to get around Battle Plan/Order. The seven side does provide bonuses in space. The biggest being the +2 to Force drains at systems you control with a Star Destroyers. If you combine this with FWKTIL (V2), you can deal out MAJOR damage with little fear of beatdown since there is no way for the LS to make your starships forfeit 0.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck wins by setting up Star Destroyers at systems to drain, then playing FWKTIL (V2). If you do play with FWKTIL (V), you will not be able to play Kuat Drive Yards (V6) to pull the systems. To find the systems you have two choices. One is playing with Voyeur (V5) to deploy any battleground or you can play with Commander Merrejk who can simply pull the systems while present at a Scomp Link. Once the systems and Destroyers are in place, there is nothing left to do but wait and cause damage. If the LS is not playing with much space, you should have an easy victory. The standard LS space package with non-space based decks is any combination of Home One, Tantive IV (V7), Bright Hope (V6), Spiral, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10), and HC&F. Besides doing a lot of damage with drains and Fear damage, the deck can set up HUGE beatdowns. When building this deck, you have to decide rather you want to play 10 to 12 Destroyers with more red cards to work them OR 16 to 26 Destroyers for large amounts of beatdown. The second version usually plays half unique and half non-unique. The idea is the same, set up on at least one starship at each system, sit back and wait. Once the LS goes to space, you can beatdown with multiple ships or powerful Interrupts and Effects. The most popular Effect for this deck will always be Lateral Damage making the opponents ship power AND forfeit zero. The easiest way to beatdown the LS in space is by preventing their movement. The LS has many ways around having to battle in space and stopping that is important.  Once you deployed your squad to fight, you should play Gravity Shadow or Theyve Shut Down the Main Reactor if they try to move away. GS requires you to draw destiny greater than the pilots ability of a LS starship that just began to move away. This is great if they have more than one ship together, you can wait until they move one away, then trap the other one. Since they already moved, they will not be able to move back to protect the ship. Since you have to draw destiny, this is not a guaranteed way to stop them. TSDTMR only works at systems where your Destroyer has a weapon or tractor beam. The upside is all you have to do is pay 2 Force and it works automatically on the ship being targeted. Besides prevent the movement of the ship, TSDTMR also says the ship may not apply ability toward drawing destiny. It is also a USED Interrupt over Gravity Shadow which is LOST. GS is also restricted to being played only after the opponent decided to move, while TSDTMR can be played ANY phase on ANY turn. The other reason to go with TSDTMR is because the beams can be deployed from your Starting Effect with Levitation Attack (V6), while weapons have to be in your Reserve deck itself. When you combine the damage from Fear with this ability to almost auto beatdown ANY LS space deck, you can see why SYCFA is currently one of the strongest and most powerful options for the DS.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: SYCFA Fear has only gotten stronger with each Virtual set. The creation of Endor Shield (V11) totally changed how this deck was built. The original version required the deck to play multiples of Commander Merrejk plus an average of 2 to 4 Imperial Commands to pull him. ES (V11) can be started and just pulls Merrejk first turn. So your deck is freed up slots for more starships or red cards. Since it pulls two characters, you can also set up Admiral Chiraneau automatically for higher drains. The Re Edit also only helped the deck by removing all of its worst match-ups; Speeders, MBO, TRMs, and WYS (V9). All of them used to give SYCFA a hard game. Now, each one is either gone totally from the tournament scene or just not as strong as it used to be. Speeders lost a turn of T-47 Battle Formation, takes many more turns longer to set up, and now requires the LS to occupy Hoth locations to limit the direct damage. MBO used to be an auto flip and would blow up the Death Star no later than turn 3. Now the draw is no longer automatic and can be slowed down with Maneuvering Check (V12) preventing their starship from moving the turn it was deployed. TRMs took a hit with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V10) hurting the EPPs weapon destiny draw, making it almost impossible to hit the Dark Jedi at the docking bay unless they have control of another battleground site. WYS (V9) was a very hard match-up, and now no longer even exists as it did before since the Re Edit totally remade what the objective did. SYCFA can setup fast with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V9) making ALL DS capital ships deploy -2 while you have more DS systems on table. Since the non-unique Imperial Class Star Destroyers deploy -3 to a system where you have a unique Destroyer, they deploy for 3 EACH. All of these changes to the game have elevated SYCFA Fear to one of THE most powerful options for DS. Currently, whenever a LS deck is built, it has to consider how well it would do against SYCFA Fear to know if it can win a major tournament. A counter card was released in virtual set 13.  The counter card is Alderaan (Blown Away) (V13) which causes you to flip SYCFA to the seven side.  The impact of this card on the tournament scene is not known right now but several LS decks can take advantage of this card; TRMs and Hidden Base being two of the obvious choices.  The DS now can not count on their objective being on the zero side all game unless they take into account this new card.  Some other help the LS got from the new V sets and Re Edit was Hans Toolkit (V11) and Red Squadron 7 (V12). Hans Toolkit (V11) deploys on Han or Falcon, while Han is piloting the Falcon at a battleground, ALL Effects for both sides that are not immune to Alter are suspended (excluding POTF, Empeors Power, and S&D). This means as long as you can keep the Falcon with Han alive, Fear does NO damage. The best option for this would be at Bespin: Cloud City since no capital ships can deploy there. Red Squadron 7 (V12) is the matching x-wing for either Corran Horn or Keir Santage. This new LS starship can once per game put a non-immune to Alter Effect at same system in owners used pile. The ability of this ship only happens once and only provides the LS a way to get the Fear (V2) Effect off the table for at least a turn. Since Corran Horn is a spy, the x-wing can deploy directly to the Death Star.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This deck has the biggest reason to play it over any other for DS. At the moment, SYCFA Fear is literally the worst match-up for more LS strategies than any other deck. The ability to set up damage of 10 from just the card Fear alone and then drain for 6 to 8 in one turn means this deck does A LOT of damage. Then you add the power of the Star Destroyers which all have forfeit of 9 with their power of 7 to 9 each and the LS has a very hard time knocking you out of space. Then the objective provides the ability to set up your drain for free while being totally protected from beatdown. This means you can focus the whole deck on working well in space. The LS has no space based deck that can do everything this deck can. Even if you come up against a very heavy space oriented Hidden Base, you will usually have way more ships than they do and, if they play with ground, they had to use way more card slots to set it up and hold it against all the various types of DS ground strategies. The majority of LS space decks will have to pay to drain while you drain for free with no worry. A few of your extra slots are usually for 2 or 3 Undercover spies, which provide a few turns of drain protection while the LS tries to find Corran Horn. Arica, U-3P0, and Kedar the Black are the most popular. Even if you dont want to play with Destroyers, SYCFA is a great platform for a TIE Swarm deck. You can set up Sienar Fleet Systems on Wakeelmui automatically with Crossfire (V9). Mob Points Combo pulls Wakeelmui, so all of that can be set up first turn. SFS lets you retrieve a card WHENEVER you deploy a TIE and even lets you get 3 cards when you deploy a Squadron. You still drain for free at the bay, so the TIEs can set up fast drains and play All Powers to Weapons to get +2 in power and total immunity to attrition. Since you arent playing with as many Destroyers, you can play the non-V Dreaded Imperial Starfleet to cancel drains. When you combine DIS and the Death Star Gunner trick with Strategic Reserves you would be canceling two drains a turn, plus retrieving. The TIEs dont have the solid power or Fear damage the Destroyers have but set up much faster with Kuat Drive Yard (V6) pulling all the systems. Combined with the retrieval, either version can be a solid choice for DS. Of course, the main SYCFA Fear with the Destroyers is currently the best version to go with.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The Re Edit changed what hurts this deck. Besides a quick MBO, there is no real auto loss for this deck. All the current strategies for LS have problems with some aspect of SYCFA Fear. In order to keep Fear damage going all game, it is important to always play at least 2 to 4 Controls in the deck to cancel Alter or Imperial Atrocity(V6). When one of these is played to the table, it can auto absorb 3 in your direct damage. WHAP relies on this card to have a chance of beating SYCFA since they dont usually play any space. The most popular ways to beat this deck are setting up ground damage as fast as possible while the DS is setting up. It will usually take SYCFA Fear at least three turns before it is ready to do serious Fear damage. This means the Obi start decks can sometimes be a problem since they start the game with a drain of 2 to 3. Since this deck doesnt play any real ground, the LS can spread out early and do damage without having to deploy a lot of characters. The LS can play I Hope Shes Alright (Search & Destroy for LS) to cause direct damage before Sidious hits the table. Padme (V11) does another 2 direct damage while non-Jedi Luke and Leia are on table. It is always important to play Imperial Decree (V6) in any build of SYCFA for any LS deck that relies on direct damage to win the game i.e. WHAP, Profit, and Speeders mainly. The key for beating SYCFA Fear is keeping the Fear (V2) Effect off the table, keeping some presence in space, and/or knocking the Dark Jedi off the docking bay. Having to pay for drains can really hurt since the unique Destroyers can still be costly. This deck can also be beat with Mantellian Savrip. The LS can stay alive in space to drain for free as long as Savrip stays on the table. Remember to always play at least one if not two Masterful Move (non-combo) to keep Savrip off the table. No Celebration will stay in play with this deck, so you have no reason to play the combo. The DS always has the advantage over the average LS space package with this deck even when you arent doing much Fear damage early. Once you knock all their ships off the table, as long as you drain for free, you should have no problem winning the game. The impact to SYCFA of Alderaan (Blown Away) (V13) is not yet known.  It isnt known whether that card will be a staple in all LS decks, how it makes the DS play SYCFA, or if the card will never see play. <br />

 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Throne Room, Insignificant Rebellion and Your Destiny.  <br />
For remainder of game, Scanning Crew may not be played. Opponents cards that place character out of play  <br />
may not target Luke. You may deploy Emperor (deploy -2) from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponent may deploy Luke from Reserve Deck (deploy -2; reshuffle) or Lost Pile. If Luke is present with Vader and Vader is not escorting a captive, Luke is captured and seized by Vader. Vader may not transfer Luke. Flip this card if Luke captured.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, lose 1 Force at end of each of your turns. Once during each of your turns, when Vader, Luke (even as a non-frozen captive) and Emperor are all present at your Throne Room, you may initiate a Luke/Vader duel: Each player draws two destiny. Add ability. Highest total wins. If Vader wins, opponent loses 3 Force. If Luke wins, shuffle Reserve Deck and draw destiny; if destiny >12, Luke crosses to Dark Side, totally depleting opponents Life Force. Flip if Luke neither present with Vader nor a captive. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 2 to 6 Emperor Palpatine / The Emperor (V6), multiple versions of Vader (usually Lord), any number of ways to cause you to win a battle, docking bays, Conduct Your Search, Establish Control (V11), You Are Beaten  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Much like There is Good in Him for LS, this objective has the ability to simply end the game by dueling. Unlike TIGIH, you have to lose the duel first, shuffle your Reserve, and then draw a random destiny in order to win. This can be set up late game by putting cards in your used pile with Drop (non-V), Reactor Terminal (non-V), or Janus. If you activate all but 3 of your Force, once you lose the first duel, you only have one card left in the Reserve to shuffle and draw. BHBM has been a strong objective for DS because the zero side allows you to continually deploy the Emperor from Reserve all game for -2 force. Common versions of this deck play with IAO Combo to pull the Death Star II: Docking Bay, the Endor: Docking bay, and maybe another random choice. If you dont want to go with the docking bays, some newer versions start Conduct Your Search to pull the Endor: Back Door for your DS drain site. This version will also play a way to pull docking bays or rely on Rise My Friend to get Vader with Luke to the DSII: Thrown Room once Vader captures him. Over the years, the versions of this deck have changed only slightly to include the more powerful cards that can be used to win a battle. Cards like Maul With Stick, Blizzard 4, and Boba Fett, BH provide that extra power this deck was lacking during the early years. A very popular trick with this deck involves setting up Emperor Palpatine with Janus at the Throne Room, then every turn you use the Force Lightning the Emperor pulls as the card you put back with Janus. This allows you to get only new cards into your hand while never having to put back anything else. The Force Lightning can be grabbed if you play it for anything other than this recycling mechanism.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Just like TIGIH, this deck can win very easily if you can just figure out how to win enough battles so you can cross Luke to the DS. Most of the time, players who play this deck win the game playing the classic DS strategy of battling over and over and getting large amounts of overflow. The majority of the time, this deck will win without crossing Luke because of how quickly it can setup. Much like Huntdown, the constant battling and overflow takes it toll on the LS. BHBM is always built for battling, so it always attempts to disrupt the LS strategy. Because battling and winning the battle is your number one priority, every version plays with cards that either help you or hurt the LS. One way to do this is a version with many high-destiny characters like multiple Emperor Palpatines or if you dont own them you can sub them out for Tech Nor from A New Hope. Combined with creatures and Tauntaun Skull from Special Edition, you have the ability to place one of the 6 destiny characters out of play to add that destiny number to your total power. If you set up Emperors Power (non-V), you can add a destiny by losing the top card of your Reserve. Adding 6 to power with at least 2 destinies can almost guarantee you to win a battle. If you play with Womp Rats/Bubo and Krayt Dragon Bones (V3) to clear away a few characters before you battle, you will have a better chance of having a higher total power as well. Other cards like You Are Beaten to exclude characters and Set for Stun to just bounce characters back to the opponents hand are also good choices. Dr. E is very popular in these decks since he makes any hit character Lost. Either version of Dr. E is good while the Combo version of him gives you higher power while the non-combo version lets you operate with Disarmed. Capturing can also be a good way to win battles. Boba Fett SE (V8) can be a good option for removing someone through capturing. You can also use IG-88 With Gun or Hidden Weapons. Many versions start Crush the Rebellion to pull I Have You Now for an additional destiny in battles verse Rebels of ability >2. Most of the time, Luke will not be in a battle since Vader can just come down and capture him, so you will rarely get more than one destiny from IHYN. Crush is also good for canceling Clash of Sabers since you never want to have your big character excluding from battle. If you play enough SAC though, you dont usually have to worry about it. Human Shield can be a great card in this deck for turning a weapon from the LS against Luke or you can forfeit Luke in battle.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest help to BHBM came from Establish Control (V11). The original BHBM used IAO and Mob Points to set up huge early activation. Since the Dont Do that Again Shield suspends Mob Points, using the docking bays fell out of use. EC (V11) brings back the +2 activation for controlling docking bays and you get to pull a battleground system (Corulag or Fondor). Many versions of BHBM already used Fonder in the deck to play the Executor, so its nice getting to pull it first turn. Most of the updates for this deck are the same for Huntdown since both decks battle with the same characters. EPP Mara (V12) is a great addition to BHBM freeing up the card slot for her stick. Besides those cards, the main idea of BHBM is the same. All the current versions set up the same way and wait for the LS to deploy something to battle. The deck is always a solid choice getting to capture Luke and being able to end the game all at once. The problem still exists with the start. Since it only gives you one location, any LS deck that goes first and do fast damage can hurt. TRMs did take a hit with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9), so BHBM has a better chance in the current environment.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: BHBM can be a very powerful deck for DS. Many LS strategies rely on Luke in some form to set up or hold their strategy. Speeders have Commander Luke (V4), MWYHL sometimes uses Son of Skywalker (V5), Hidden Base uses Luke Skywalker (V1), Combat uses Jedi Luke, Profit uses Master Luke, and then you might see new decks with Luke (V10) + Beggers Canyon. BHBM is the reason that every LS deck, no matter what, should have at least one copy of Luke. Your Destiny causing 3 Force loss can hurt over the course of a game. Even Agents will play a Jedi Luke just in case. The other thing about BHBM that makes it worth looking at is being able to pull the Emperor from Reserve. The Emperor (V6) going down first turn can really disrupt the LS strategy. Profit allows you to start Dr E and EPP Mara, then you download the Emperor (V6) to auto shock anyone who comes down. This also works with Agents that sets up in the AC. You have the ability to set him up before they have BoShuda, so every turn a character there gets shocked. This forces them to battle the Emperor off before they can set up their strategy. LS Senate has to worry about the Emperor (V6) too. As soon as Mon Mothma (V9) is killed or Set For Stun is successful on her then the LS Senate is just shut down. When you play this deck, you can decide rather or not you want the Emperor to be an attack force, by going to where the LS is, or as a base for your other cards by placing him in the Throne Room with Emperors Power (non-V version for adding destiny or V11 version to cause direct damage and power -1 & deploy +1 for Jedi). The Emperor (V6) can be an excellent way to remove characters before battle when you combine his text with the regular Force Lightning to almost auto hit ANY character. Some other ideas that have come out lately involve using the AAT Tanks with the Commander Battle Droid you pull with Endor Shield (V11). The non-unique AATs say you add 2 battle destinies when with a battle droid. So you get out the Back Door with Conduct Your Search, pile up two of them to get 4 destinies and sit on that site. If the LS arent playing with Quick Draw (V9) or Savrip, they will not be coming to fight you there. The tanks can be great offensive tools too. Just one tank with Emperors Power would get you 3 battle destiny, plus you can set up the Tauntaun Skull to add another 5 or 6 to power. This makes the tanks an almost auto win to any ground battle. Besides specific ideas for winning battles and causing damage, the basic strategy for BHBM has stayed the same. If you like to battle, and the way this deck feels, then give it a try. It has won many games over the years, but is currently not the strongest option for DS.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The downside to this objective is you are restricted to when you can deploy Vader because as soon as you do, they will automatically get to deploy Luke from their Reserve (or even their lost pile) for Vader to escort. When you have Luke, you will flip and then begin to lose 1 Force from your objective. Losing force for your own cards is not good.  Games have single-handedly been lost just because the LS was able to stay away long enough while the objective itself caused the deck to lose. The other problem with this objective is it has a hard time with LS objectives (WHAP and Hyperdrive) that simply get around Your Destiny and never even have Luke in their deck. These objectives dont ever have to worry about you getting the auto victory by crossing Luke. Both those decks can just pile up their characters at one site and wait. Since it never matters how many battles you win, you have to out damage them to have a chance. If your deck isnt built to do enough damage on its own, you will have trouble beating these decks. Heavy space decks can also be a problem. Since the majority of your deck is used for battling on the ground, your space package is always very basic. Just like Huntdown, you usually only have enough space to have presence and battle when needed. Hidden Base with Quads can easily shoot down all your ships and spread out for massive drains. You take the retrieving Luke Skywalker (V1) away but if you cant fight and win in space, you will not be able stop all the drains. Plus your objective would just be hurting you while you are unable to battle. Search & Destroy is another staple for this deck. The most important part is getting them to come to the ground. BHBM is a good deck for a specific meta. It always does well when Luke based decks are running wild.  <br />

11 * My Kind of Scum (MKOS) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Desert Heart and a Jabbas Palace site. May deploy Well Guarded. Reveal one unique (.) alien from your deck whose lore specifies its species. This card is your Rep.  <br />
For remainder of game, your Rep is a leader. Well Guarded is immune to Alter. You may not deploy insert cards or operatives. While frozen Han on Table, Rebels are immune to No Bargain and Bad Feeling Have I. Flip this card if you occupy two battleground sites (must occupy a third with a non-unique alien of your Reps species if a non-Tatooine location is on table). <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn may cancel a Force drain or a just-drawn battle destiny by placing here from hand a copy of your Rep. Once during each of your control phases, you may retrieve a non-unique alien of your Reps species. While Jabba and Bib on table, your battle destiny draws are each +2. Wounded Wookiee is destiny +3. Unless a non-Tatooine location is on table, your aliens are forfeit +2. For remainder of game, your Rep may deploy from here as if from hand. Flip this card if you do not occupy 2 battleground sites.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: version of Jabba, version of Bib Fortuna, Greedo (V3), Ket Meliss (V3) and multiple other random alien cards. <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: The brother to Agents in the Court for LS, this objective also plays with aliens in Jabbas Palace and reveals a Rep at the start of the game. Unlike Agents though, this deck has seen a ton of tournament play.  It wasnt until Agents got A LOT of help with V8 that that deck turned into a steady tournament deck. Both MKOS and Agents have pretty much the same zero side. They also flip the exact same way. MKOS just has a stronger seven side because it adds +2 to ALL battle destinies while both Jabba and Bib are on table. This is much stronger over Agents getting to add a destiny to power where they have two aliens. The main reason this objective was stronger was because the DS has always had more powerful aliens. The V8 cards were made to allow the LS aliens to be played, while the DS already had powerful aliens and just got more ways to set them up. MKOS plays the same way as both Court and CR (V8) Scum. The only difference is you have the Rep to play on the objective and the ability to retrieve a non-unique alien of your Reps species. The rest of the deck plays the same way; play lots of aliens, Scum and Villiany, control the Audience Chamber, spread out on Jabbas Palace, battle, and sometimes capture. As with all the others, if you play DS aliens you have to play some version of Jabba. Currently Jabba the Hutt (V8) has been the most popular because he has the best all around text. This Jabba doubles the power of one alien present without maintenance and pulls Scum & Villainy.  He is also totally immune to attrition and to being targeted by weapons or Interrupts while present with an alien leader. Court and Scum always play this version of Jabba but MKOS has a choice based on what strategy you want to play. Regular Jabba from Special Edition is great for decks that try to use non-unique aliens to beatdown since he says all aliens deploy -1 to same location. Since S&V also makes all aliens deploy -1, all your deploy 2 aliens go down for free. Skrillings with Pote Snitkin at the AC is the most popular non-unique beatdown force. This strategy is less popular with the Yavin 4 Sentry (V2) Shield adding +X to non-unique deploy cost. Mighty Jabba is also seen with MKOS in versions that play multiple destinies since he adds a battle destiny when with an alien leader.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: MKOS can be played many different ways. The most popular versions played today use Greedo (V3) and Ket Maliss (V3) to abuse the seven side letting you cancel a Force drain or battle destiny by placing your Rep on the objective. Ket Maliss (V3) once per turn takes into hand Greedo, Beelo, Hem Dazon, Dannik Jerriko, or Reegesk. Beelo replaces Greedo when you deploy him, so the strategy has you deploying Greedo from your objective, Beelo replaces him and sends Greedo back into the deck to be re-pulled and played all over again on the objective. Once Beelo dies, you retrieve him with Scum and repeat the whole process. Jabbas Influence (V6) is played to once per game download the non-unique Rodian (V3) to flip the objective. MKOS is a deck that allows you to set up with Twilek Advisor (V8) as the starting Interrupt. Twilek (V8) lets you take into hand and/or deploy up to three Effects with Jabba in the lore or game text. This means you can start with both Den of Thieves (V8) and Hutt Bounty (V8) even though both are not immune to Alter. Other popular choices are Power of the Hutt, Desilijic Tatoo (V5), and Jabbas Influence (V8). Versions will usually include Stunning Leaders to protect from beatdown and Oo-Ta Goo-Ta Solo (V3) to add additional destiny draws. OTGTS can be pulled by Greedo (V3) so most versions will include one. Besides the set up and abilities of the objective, MKOS doesnt play much different from other DS alien decks. Most versions dont have the system, so you usually dont have Occupation set up. It also has no way of pulling Tatooine battlegrounds like LS Agents does, so the best option is to use Jabbas Palace as your other starting site to pull the rest of the JP sites. You can usually build the whole deck around just the JP sites like Scum and use None Shall Pass (V8) & Barriers to protect them all from LS deployment. The most common versions will set up in the AC with Jabba, Bib, and friends. Then spread out on the other sites to cause the most in damage. Galid is played to add +1 to Force drains at all JP sites. Space is usually matching bounty hunter ships with Combat Response but you can also play the built-in Enhanced ships to save slots in your deck. Since Ket Maliss (V3) also pulls docking bays, you could play a version that starts Establish Control (V11) for tons of activation as well as pulling Fondar or Corulag to drain for free. MKOS tends to work the same way as most Scum decks by setting up at the JP sites and react to the LS strategy. Some use capturing but the majority prefer to battle over and over to get the most out of the Scum retrieval and the ability to cancel battle destiny.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit at first made all DS alien decks weaker since many of the powerful V cards were altered. Jabbas Influence (V6) originally made all Bounty Hunters power +2 and allowed you to download a non-bounty hunter alien once per turn. Now the Bounty Hunters get +1 to power and the once per turn was changed to once per game. This really changed how powerful MKOS could be. Hutt Bounty (V8) was also a card that really made all DS alien decks broken by adding to activation and allowing you to reduce the power of ANY LS character to zero wherever you had a Gangster. Now you can only reduce non-Jedi characters at Jabbas site and the activation applies to related sites you control. Hutt Bounty (V8) still says all your battle destinies are +1 and since the objective makes them +2 as well, you get +3. Den of Thieves (V8) says your battle destinies are +1 wherever you have an alien with Plotting to Kill Jabba in their lore. That means you can build a version of MKOS today can set up +4 to all battle destiny draws. There are currently five DS characters that have Plotting to kill jabba in their lore; Bib Fortuna, JQuille, Bane Malar, Ree-Yees, and Velken Tezeri. Power of the Hutt pulls Bib, so you have no problem getting him out with Jabba. Once the Hutt Bounty (V8) gets deployed to Jabba, the AC would have the +4 right there. The rest of the Plotting characters can be used to fight the LS wherever they deploy. JQuille (V8) and Ree-Yees would be your best options since you usually save Bane (V7) for drain protection.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The +4 destiny version of MKOS can be very hard for the LS to counter. Can you even imagine the possibilities since there are many alien and droids that add battle destinies? If you had Might Jabba, Bib, and Broken Fett, you would have a base of 16 from 4 destinies BEFORE you draw. 4-Lom with Gun adds one with Jabba or Zuckess. IG-88 With Gun adds one when alone or with another Bounty Hunter. Broken Fett adds two with ANY Bounty Hunter or Vader. Crossfire (V9) adds by placing it out of play. Jabbas Through With You adds one when your Bounty Hunter fires a character weapon. There are so many ways to set up multiple destinies both on ground and in space that you have a huge advantage over any LS deck. In all the years of playing this objective, the +4 to destiny version is by far the most powerful. The DS alien decks are all good since they have so many powerful V cards to boost their ability. The key is deciding between the strategies of going for beatdown power, capturing, damage, or attrition.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Like most DS alien decks, this one also has problems with LS space decks. Since the majority of the deck is based around the ground, the space package is weaker. The addition to destiny draws does make it stronger than a regular deck but you still have to fear starship weapons shooting down your ships. The standard for all DS space decks should be Tatooine Maul and Mauls Ship. From there you can play with Mist Hunter (V5) and Zuckess (V7) because you can add 4-Lom, IG-88, or Fett for additional destiny. Plus the -2 to weapon or battle destiny makes it hard for the LS to knock out of the sky. The other problem this deck has is it relies on the control of the AC with Jabba to win. All DS aliens decks can be beat if the LS can deploy into the AC and defeat Jabba. If Jabba is knocked off the table, you will not have Hutt Bounty (V8) nor the +2 from the seven side. Scum & Villainy is usually gone too if the LS takes over the AC. All DS aliens decks can be difficult to beat but they all have the same weaknesses. The good thing is because you have so many options for how to play with the aliens, it will usually take a few turns before the LS knows what you are doing. Just make sure to play Gela Yeens (V6) to protect at least one ship from being targeted by their weapons (unless the LS plays Choke of course).  <br />

12 * Agents of Black Sun (Black Sun) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Imperial City (with Xizor there) and Coruscant system.  <br />
For remainder of game, your aliens with Black Sun in lore, bounty hunters, and information brokers are Black Sun agents, Emperor or Independent starships. During your control phase, each of your Bounty Hunters may make a regular move to an adjacent site where there is a bounty. Scanning Crew may not be played. Flip this card if Xizor is at a battleground site and Luke is not at a battleground site.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once per turn, may place a card from hand in Used Pile to peek at cards in your Force Pile. Once during each of your battle phases, may peek at top X cards of any Reserve Deck, where X = number of locations you occupy. For each Black Sun agent in a battle, attrition against opponent is +1. During your control phase, opponent loses 1 Force for each battleground location occupied by Xizor or Emperor. Flip this card if Luke is at a battleground site or if Xizor is not on table.  <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Prince Xizor (V7), Guri (NON V and/or V7), lots of Bounty Hunters, The Emperor (V6), Information Exchange (V7), Stinger (V12), Scum & Villainy, Desilijic Tatoo (V5), Ket Maliss (V3) <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Just like Watch Your Step (non-V), this was the first objective that restricted who could be played in the deck. This is currently the only DS deck that starts a character at the beginning of the game. When it first came out, it was made into one of the strongest decks that could be played. Back then, it played with an unheard of 6x Emperor Palpatines so you would get one in your opening hand and always have him on the table all game. The extra destiny 6 cards in your reserve didnt hurt much either. As time passed, it seemed to die off because it was limited on who it could play with and usually missed not being able to play with Vader or Maul. The PC decided that this deck needed some help, so they created a good 8 cards to help this objective. The two strongest being Prince Xizor (V7), which made a larger number of characters into Black Sun agents as well as provide forfeit +1 to all them. He also pulls Unexpected Interruption, so you now have the ability to find ANY Interrupt you want from your deck. The other powerful V card is Information Exchange (V7), which allows Scum and Villainy to deploy on the Imperial City and lets you deploy ANY card with Black Sun or Xizor in their lore. This means you can pull The Emperor (V6) just like BHBM. Information Exchange (V7) has totally changed how powerful this deck is because it can pull almost every powerful character. Because it allows Scum to work in this deck, all your aliens deploy cheaper and give you 2 Force retrieval when you initiate battle. The possibilities for the deck have changed but the idea behind it has not. Get Xizor to a battleground, keep him alive, battle the LS and keep Luke off the table. The original version had problems in space since your only option for Coruscant was the non-battleground version from Special Editions. Since the Coruscant set released a battleground version of the system., it is much easier to set up both ground and space for free draining.  You also have the option of sending Xizor to space from the docking bay since the objective just say he has to be on table. The direct damage also works in space.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This deck has a lot of things going for it now. Besides Information Exchange (V7) letting you play Scum, the DS has many other V cards that have made this deck very solid. Like all DS alien decks, you have Bounty Hunters as your attacking force allowing you to capture or cause beatdown. The difference with Black Sun is you can play with cards that greatly increase your characters forfeit. Desilijic Tattoo (V5) says all your Bounty Hunters and Independent starships are forfeit +2 and defense value +1. Ket Maliss (V3) says your Agents are also forfeit +2 and defense value +1 while Emperor Palpatine is not on table. So if you want to play the forfeit bonus version of the deck, you cant play the old fashion Emperor but must instead use only The Emperor (V6). Xizor (V7) adds another +1 to Black Sun Agents forfeit, so with those three cards EACH Bounty Hunter is forfeit +5!! Greedo (V3) is forfeit 9, Bossk (V5) is 10, Dengar (V5) is 11, Fett is 12, etc. Den of Thieves (V8) protects the forfeit of your aliens with ability < 3, while Zuckess (V7) says ALL Black Sun agents may not have their forfeit reduced at same and related sites. This deck can be very hard to beat if the LS deck is forced to battle in order to win. Since you are constantly retrieving 2 Force when you initiate battle, you keep getting the characters back into your deck that are forfeited. Ket Maliss (V3) pulls Greedo (V3) over and over to play for 1, forfeit for 9, retrieve, and repeat all over again. First Strike gives you another retrieved Force when you initiate as well as makes the LS lose a Force. Besides the bonus to forfeit, Black Sun can be a better option for DS aliens because of the objective. The seven side of this objective provides deck manipulation. It lets you peek at cards in either Reserve deck during your battle phase so you will either know what your destiny draw is going to be or what your opponents draw is going to be. You can also look at the cards in your Force pile simply by putting any card back in your Used pile. The objective doesnt require you to reshuffle, so you know what cards you are using and which ones you will get to draw. If that wasnt enough, you also cause added attrition in battle with your Black Sun agents and direct damage while the Emperor or Xizor are at a battleground.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit did a lot to fix the problems with this deck. Before, Jabbas Influence (V6) said you had to play Emperor Palpatine for S&V to work, while Ket Maliss (V3) said you had to play The Emperor (V6) if you wanted the forfeit bonus. Since both cards are useful in Black Sun, the Re Edit fixed this problem by saying S&V worked with any Emperor while Xizor is on table. Black Sun is now being played with just The Emperor (V6), which loses the immunity to attrition and the destiny of 6.  This does add the built in shock and the ability to be pulled from Reserve with Information Exchange (V7). The original Guri (V7) was stronger by adding a destiny with Xizor. The Re Edit removed her additional destiny and ability to protect her forfeit but she still adds +1 to Force drains at Coruscant sites and can be forfeited to satisfy battle damage while in battle with Xizor. The non-V Guri is still a powerful option for this deck since she prevents the LS from drawing more than one battle destiny as well as prevents the LS from targeting Xizor with weapons. Most versions will play with one of each to be used as needed. The space package in this deck got better with Stinger (V12). Now you can play Stinger (V12) with Combat Response since the V version removed the permanent pilot. The cool thing about this card is it gives you a built in Threepio, With Parts Showing text only you dont have to put a card down. Once per turn, you can just take the top card of your Reserve deck into hand. Since the objective lets you look at the card before you battle, you will know if you want that card to begin with. It also says you take from Force pile if Chewie or Leia on table, so you can use this function after searching your Force pile with the objective. Since Guri was usually used for protection of Xizor, you can use IE (V7) to find both Stinger (V12) and Guri, then load up Xizor, and fly up to the system for protection. Aurra Sing (V12) is also a great addition to this deck since she can relocate to sites where opponent has a Jedi. This makes it harder for Jedi Luke to hide. Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V12) can be played on Aurra, so the deck finally has a lightsaber for killing off hard to hit characters like Mace and Qui-Gon. What really hurt this deck was the change of Ability, Ability, Ability (V6) in the Re Edit. The original said you could take a character into hand when you initiated battle and now you just retrieve a character. This is still strong and is still worth including in the deck, but not as powerful as having the character already in hand to battle next turn.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Black Sun is truly a powerful option for DS. The listed strategy can be put together to make a very versatile powerhouse. Unlike the other DS alien decks, this one has the BEST space package since the forfeit of all your Bounty Hunter pilots is so high. Not to mention you can just pile up other aliens to absorb attrition and battle damage. This makes it VERY hard to knock the DS out of space. The objective also provides manipulation, so you have the added ability to know what is going on with both decks before you make a decision. Black Sun has very good retrieval all game as long as S&V is going strong. Rather than have large amounts of retrieval at once like Court, BS retrieves from battling over and over and over until the LS is out of characters. Black Sun works very similar to LS Agents since it constantly retrieves the characters to be played again and again. This makes it a good choice for DS if you want a deck that can be hard to out damage. Black Sun gets the most Timed Wins of any DS deck. Any LS strategy that deploys to the ground and relies on its ground forces to win will have trouble against this deck. It does well against Combat, Hyperdeal (since the objective cant play with Luke, but doesnt prevent them losing the direct damage), Agents, QMC, TIGIH, and WYS.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest weakness this deck has is it relies on Xizor staying alive to win. If he can be killed, the objective cannot be flipped to its seven side, so much of your time is spent trying to protect him. The deck also has to keep Luke off a battleground as well, so you have a problem if you come up against Commander Luke (V4) in Rogue 1 because all he has to be is at the site not present. The other problem with this deck is it doesnt always do a lot of damage by itself. The majority of builds only play the docking bays as battlegrounds. If the LS gets Jedi Test 1 or Menace Fades going to cancel the drain bonuses and puts Projections on your sites, you will only be doing damage from the objective. Throw Luke into the mix and the objective is flipped meaning you do NO damage. Bane (V7) is very important for keeping at least one drain free from losing the bonuses. Even though the space package is better with the added forfeit, this deck can still be beat with starship weapons. Some versions of Hidden Base put Commander Luke (V4) at a desert with a Sandwhirl. Since it can also play Menace Fades and cancel two drains, this can be a hard match-up. Black Sun will always be strong when the LS has decks that set up on the ground.

13 * My Lord, Is that Legal? (DS Senate) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Galactic Senate and any other Episode I location. <br />
For remainder of game, Rebel and Imperial leaders of ability <4 are politics +2. Counter Assault and Surprise Assault are canceled. Your Republic characters are immune to Goo Nee Tay. Cards on your Political Effects may deploy to table. At Galactic Senate, weapon destiny draws are -6, creatures are lost and game text of non-Republic characters is canceled. Flip this card if you have 3 senators (or 2 senators, at least 1 with a blockade agenda) at Galactic Senate.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during your control phase may use 3 Force to place up to two random cards from opponents hand into their Used Pile. Once per turn may take a Political Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Your senators are destiny +2 (or +3 if senator has an ambition agenda) when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. May use 2 Force at end of any turn to place all cards on your Political Effects into Used Pile. Flip this card if you have less than two senators at Galactic Senate.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Lott Dod, 7 to 10 other Senators, 2 to 3 Squabbling Delegates, all 4 political Effects, Naboo system <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Much like LS Senate, this objective was a broken strategy for multiple years. This deck has stayed powerful even after LS Senate had dropped off with The Emperor (V6) making it too hard to play. DS Senate didnt have to fear any such character. Even with the creation of over five V cards that hurt DS Senate, the deck still seemed to find a way to win. Despite not getting the awesome ability of Queen Amidala, RON, the deck has a different ability. Lott Dod is by far the strongest of all DS Senators letting you take any card from Force pile into hand just like Keeping the Empire Out Forever and IG-88 (V5), only it is limited to your Control phase only. In other decks, this is a strong ability but in Senate it is pretty much broken because it provides you with a Senator any time you need one and allows you to react to the LS while still using all of the Political Effects to make things go your way in battle. Even though V cards can be played to counter this deck, the LS has to play those cards and those cards are totally useless against any other match up.  Ds still finds ways to win even when those V cards are used. DS Senate is a great platform for many different kinds of decks because each Senator does something to hurt the LS or help the DS. Besides Lott Dod, you have Baskol Yeesrim to cause direct damage for each Naboo location you control. Aks Moe makes all your capital ships power +2 and drain +1. Orn Free Taa lets you take a card just drawn for destiny into hand (if its a Senator, you can then be placed on your Politcal Effect, yep this is legal), and he can go back in your deck. Passel Argente makes opponents non-unique vehicles and starships each deploy +2 and power -1. Tikkes says you get +2 Force generation at battlegrounds you control and suspends Honor of the Jedi. Yeb Yeb Ademthorn says during your turn you may peek at opponents Reserve deck, use 1 Force to place the card in Used pile or lose 1 Force to make it lost. Since you only have to have two Senators to stay flipped, you usually have Lott Dod with one of the other ones. If your strategy requires the use of another Senator, then you find him with Squabbling Delegates and save the rest to be placed on the PEs.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Just like LS Senate, DS Senate wins by playing cards that can battle and do damage on their own combined with the power of the Political Effects to make the pain even worse. The standard set up for this deck is pretty much the same. Set up the Galactic Senate with a Lott Dot and another Senator and flip. The most popular builds of this deck will deploy the Tatooine: Desert Landing site if the LS started a system.  They usually start Naboo if the LS doesnt start a system. The majority of the deck is space with matching ships with the ground being EPP Maul and EPP Vader. The standard for the space package is to use matching pilot ships like Zuckess (V7) with Mist Hunter (V5), Baron Fel with Saber 1, Bossk (V5) with Hounds Tooth (V5), and either Dengar (V5) with Punishing One (V5) or Boba Fett (non-V) with Slave I (V7) since he deploys as a react for free. The matching ships all have high immunity to attrition, when you combine them with the PEs, they are also impossible to kill. The space will invade the system and usually disrupt the strategy. If the LS is playing a ground based deck, you start Naboo to set up the space asap. The PEs allow you to cancel a Force drain, adds +3 to just drawn battle destiny, subtracts 3 from just drawn opponents destiny, and adds +2 to your Force drain. Besides the initial ability from placing a Senator on the Political Effect, each PE provides an additional ability when a senator is already stacked there. Accepting Trade Federation Control allows you to activate 1 Force during your draw phase, while opponent has to use 1 Force (if possible). Motion Supported lets you, once per turn, lose your just drawn destiny to substitute one from hand. Our Blockade Is Perfectly Legal allows once during your turn to cancel a react or an attempt by opponent to move away from battle which can be huge versus QMC. This is Outrageous! allows you to place a card from hand in lost pile to shuffle and take the top card into hand. If the LS dont play counter cards for DS Senate, they will not be able to win very easily.<br />
<br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The main idea of DS Senate is the same as it was before any v-sets were made. None of the newer virtual cards have done all that much to affect what this deck does. Even the Re Edit seemed to have no affect on this deck. A few characters like EPP Mara (V12) make it better by providing a spy with a built in weapon. Plus you have new options with the Stinger (V12) and Guri in space as a matching pilot ship. The Re Edit did change what LS decks this deck has to worry about. Speeders used to be a difficult game if the LS could stay alive at the Hoth system. Now Speeders is much slower than it used to be, so it is almost impossible to take back Hoth before the DS has total control. WYS (V8) was also a hard match-up for this deck but now doesnt even exist anymore. With the change of the V cards, more Obi start decks have come to life. One with Agents and one in WYS, which can both set up huge drains from turn one. DS Senate is a great counter for these decks because you have the PE that cancels drains that can be set up first turn if you are able to flip depending on your opening hand.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: DS Senate is still a very popular choice for DS. At any major tournament, there will always be at least one. The PEs makes the deck very powerful but the objective is also another reason to play this deck. Since this deck is so easy to flip, you usually have no problem first turn by getting Lott Dod and another senator together as long as the LS doesnt start Civil Disorder (V6) to add +2 to the deploy cost of the Senators. The seven side makes all your Senators either destiny +2 or +3 when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. This makes the destiny in the deck very very good since all the Senators become destiny 5 or 6 and are constantly recycling. The objective also allows you to pay 3 Force and place 2 random cards from opponents hand in used pile. When you add a few Defensive Fires, you can remove 3 cards in one turn from the opponents hand, greatly changing the possibilities of the LS. All the PEs can be pulled by the objective and the only way to flip back is if the DS has fewer than two Senators at the Senate. You have no fear of weapons in the Senate since the objective adds +6 to each draw. You can even play a Coruscant Guard to make any character without politics forfeit 0. Once you build the main deck with Senators, PEs, 2 to 3 Squabblings, and Senate Hovercam; the rest of the deck can be just about anything. You can build a ground-based version around the AAT Tanks or use capital ships with Aks Moe since you get power +2 and Drain +1. I even played around with a deck that set up the Death Star docking bay with Reegesk (V3). When the LS came after him, you drop Lt Suba with multiple Stormtrooper Garrisons for free for a game ending beatdown. The possibilities are endless since you can search your Force pile and add/subtract to multiple aspects of the game. DS Senate will always be an option for DS even with the counter cards.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The main reason to stay away from DS Senate is the many counter cards that have been made throughout the different Virtual sets. The main ones are Scrambled Transmission (V5), Leia (V3), and Civil Disorder (V6). Scrambled Transmission (V5) protects the LS from removing cards while you have less than 13 cards and allows the LS to lose 2 Force to cancel any Political Effect. This can be huge since they can wait until you have a Senator on one then make it lost so the loss in Force is equal for both sides. Since most DS Senate decks only retrieve when they play Squabbling Delegates, it is almost impossible to get back the PEs once the LS makes them lost. Leia (V3) lets you place any Senator out of play (as well as herself) by losing 1 Force. The LS can wait until the Senate deck sets up to decide which Senator to place out of play. Sometimes the LS will choose Tikkes or Baskol over Lott Dod if their strategy sets up a lot of direct damage or has no way of holding three battlegrounds to get around HOTJ. Civil Disorder adds two to the deploy cost of each of your senators making it hard to flip first turn which slows the deck down. Another counter is the Coruscant Alter which can target the PEs.  Since they are Lost Interrupts, they dont get used much with the SAC shields sending the PEs back into the Reserve deck. The counter cards dont mean auto victory for the LS but they do change how powerful the Senators can be. The game can be tough for the DS when the opponent plays with all three counters; Scrambled Transmission (V5), Leia (V3), and Civil Disorder (V6).  The most popular decks that play ST (V5) are Combat and TRMs but you might see them in any LS deck if DS Senate is expected.  <br />

14 * No Money, No Parts, No Deal (WATTO) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Wattos Junkyard and Mos Espa. <br />
For remainder of game, Wattos Junkyard is immune to Revolution. If Watto at Wattos Junkyard, opponent may use 8 Force to place Watto in Used Pile and you may retrieve up to 4 Force. While this side up, Qui-Gon is power +3. Opponent loses no more than 1 Force from your Force drains at Tatooine sites. Flip this card if Watto present at Wattos Junkyard and you occupy Mos Espa.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, once during each of your deploy phases, may place a card from hand face down on your side of the table and opponent must choose to lose 2 Force (you place card in Used Pile) or use 2 Force (you may deploy that card for free). If opponent uses 2 Force and you cannot deploy card, lose 2 Force and card is lost. Opponents non-unique aliens are each deploy +3. Flip this card if Watto not present at Wattos Junkyard or you do not occupy Mos Espa. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 3 to 4 Wattos, Executor, Maul With Stick or Tatooine Maul, battle evasion cards <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: This objective is very different from the other darkside objectives because just like Hyperdrive for LS, it is completely designed around playing at just two sites; the Junkyard and Mos Espa. Of course, the Junkyard is the same site that Hyperdrive has to defend. Unlike Hyperdrive though, the DS is NOT restricted on what characters they can play with. This deck can be built with any number of Imperials or alien forces. For years this objective was a very solid strategy allowing the DS to either cause direct Force loss for 2 or get to play ANY card they want for free. The DS Junkyard with Watto present is also a very powerful site by preventing the LS from drawing ANY battle destinies. So the only way for the LS to knock them off the site is to get lucky with their weapons. The downside to this deck is the LS can simply put Watto back in their deck just by using 8 Force. This will let the DS retrieve 4 Force but if they should get Watto of of the Junkyard early, it can have a major affect on how the deck plays out. Watto is the key to the deck and must be protected for the deck to work. Besides the ability to deploy cards for free or cause the direct damage of 2 Force, the objective doesnt do much. It does say that opponents non-unique aliens are EACH deploy +3. When you combine that with the Death Star Sentry Shield adding +X for each non-unique character deploying to same site, Watto auto wins versus alien decks that focus on those characters. AITC with non-unique aliens doesnt have a prayer. The deck wins because it puts a solid hold on the Junkyard, which is very hard to disrupt. The reason Watto wins is because the best builds focus on setting up a fortress at the Junkyard and then setting up on Mos Espa and the system. You set up Tatooine Occupation for additional damage and just wait. The main deck doesnt do a lot of damage but starts the damage early in the game and has the ability to fight off the LS consistently all game.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This objective puts the pressure on the LS by forcing them to come to fight Watto early unless the LS strategy can set up and do a lot of damage without the DS being able to stop it. The normal strategy with this deck is to deploy Watto with the Junkyard text. Always deploy use the once per game first even if you have one in your hand since you will most likely need to redeploy him again. Then play a characters like Ephant Mon to Mos Espa with Power of the Hutt or Admiral Ozzel with Endor Shield (V11). This will flip the objective and most of the time, you could sack the Mob Points Combo you were starting with to pull Carida, Rendelli, or Executor, and find Search and Destroy for yet another Force loss. Some new versions choose to play with Crossfire (V9) and pull the Occupation since you are getting the added destiny. You can use Wattos text to find his Chance Cube and then use it as the card you place in used pile for the 2 Force loss since, in the majority of games, the LS will not have the Force saved on their first turn. Just makes sure to not give up too many searches with Thrown Back (V8). The majority of the time, the LS will not be able to deploy anything worthwhile on their first turn to fight Watto. So you can take the next turn to fortify the Junkyard and set up in space. You can play with Kuat Drive Yards (V6) to pull the system. It is very important to never pay for drains with this deck because you should always be using Force for more deployment or your red stuff. The deck always plays evasion. The most common is Imperial Barrier. When you combine Barrier with regular DrE, you can set up Disarmed the following turn. Remember you can deploy cards for free with your objective if the LS pays the 2 Force, so the trick is to wait until you believe they will put down the Executor. Never put down a red card while they have Force saved unless you are feeling lucky. The best strategy is to always just lose the 2 Force and try and get around the direct damage with HOTJ or Imperial Atrocity (V6). This prevents the DS from ever deploying stuff for free as well as forcing them to put some key characters and ships back into their deck. A very powerful card in Watto is Broken Concentration because it allows you to pay 2 Force and move the top card in opponents Force pile to the top of their Reserve deck. If you keep Force saved, it requires the LS to save 4 Force at the end of their turn. This can be very hard mid to late game when they deploy stuff, battle, retrieve, and still need to draw cards.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: At first, Watto was not seen very much with the creation of Thrown Back (V8) since the most popular versions could search 4 to 5 times their first turn, thus providing the 2 Force for the LS to pay at the very beginning of the game. Since the deck needs the direct damage to win, players were staying away. Once more V cards were made, the deck had more options for setting up, attacking, and defending that it didnt have previously. Endor Shield (V11) provides the deck with another option for pulling the second character to go at Mos Espa over the original Power of the Hutt. Luke, Luke (V11) also provides the deck with a way to protect against some drains and force the LS to come after them at the Junkyard. EPP Mara (V12) gives the deck another EPP to help fight off the Jedi that come calling. Plus the overall change to what the LS are playing has made Watto a popular option. TRMs is no longer the deck it used to be with Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V9) but dont expect to never see TRMs either. Speeders no longer gets 2x T-47 Battle Formation and can take two extra turns to flip. Some new ideas for Watto include setting up the AATs with Commander Battle droids pulled by Endor Shield (V11).  They add two destiny and their cannons can fire at adjacent sites. You can set one up at Mos Espa and hold it all game with no worry. If you dont want to go with all the cards for the Tanks, you can choose to play multiples of Blizzard 4 since it is power 8 and pulls an Imperial warrior each time it is deployed. Since the Junkyard is a much harder option to go after, most players will choose to go after Blizzard 4 at Mos Espa. When you add Crossfire (V9) destiny and any additional power from the system, they lose stuff while you just deploy another copy of Blizzard 4. Watch out for Heroic Sacrifice (V4) taking away your destiny and causing you to lose a 1 a turn to keep it in play as well as Mechanical Failure causing a huge beatdown. Its always a good idea to play at least one Ghhhk in the deck for that random time the LS gets lucky against either Watto or Blizzard 4. <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The deck is much like Hyperdrive in the sense that it does the same thing each game and simply hangs out on one or two sites. So because of that, you will not have to think that much to play this deck. Most of the time you are just battling at either Mos Espa or the Junkyard and dont have to go the opponents sites. The great thing about the power of this objective is you can flip it back at the end of your turn. Then on your next turn, deploy another character to Mos Espa to flip it and either cause the 2 Force loss or get a card out for free. Always make sure you are paying attention to your opponents Force pile because this deck allows you to get cards back in your deck that normally would be stuck in your hand. If your opponent doesnt have any force or maybe just 1 saved, then you can put ANY card you want down with no fear. If they do have a lot of force, then you would be safe to put a high deploy card like the Executor down as that player could choose to pay and not lose the force. Then you get that Executor out for free. The reason Watto can be hard to beat is the LS usually gives up their own strategy to come after the Junkyard. The whole deck is built to fight and protect that site, so the LS is doing exactly what you want them to do. The deck can set up a lot of direct damage that is tough for the LS to handle. MWYHL doesnt usually stand a chance if Broken Concentration gets out early and you start hitting them with early damage. When playing Watto, make sure to know when to go after the LS and when to hold back and wait for them to come to you. You can get stuck wasting attack forces leaving Watto to the wolves on the following turn. The majority of Watto decks require more red cards to attack and defend over cards with ability.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Watto is a different kind of deck to play. It does do the same thing every game but the options for fighting having you choosing between going to the LS locations or waiting for them to come after you. It usually takes a higher skilled player to win consistently with this deck. When you come up against Thrown Back (V8), you have to be careful in how many searches you give up. Plus the same card that hurts DS Senate also hurts Watto. Scrambled Transmission (V5) lets the LS peek at the card you put down so they know if you try and bluff a red card when they have the force saved. If Speeders can set up and start doing a lot of damage as well, you can have a tough game. The Speeders objective will only require them to lose 1 Force, so if they play Scrambled Transmission (V5), they will know when to pay the Force and when to just lose 1. Since you dont have a huge space package, you usually have problems with Hidden Base. Tat Maul + Ship with Security Precautions does help but the new versions of Hidden Base that play starship weapons can easily shoot down the ship as soon as they hit the table. Watto can get locked down by Hidden Base very easily. TRMs can be tough as well since Watto doesnt activate much Force. They will usually have more characters than you and SAC can hurt if it ends up getting Watto killed more than once. EBO and LS Senate can also be tough since they can set up HUGE drains in space pretty early. Watto can be a very awesome deck for DS but you really have to know what you are doing to make it work.  <br />

15 * Invasion  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Naboo system with Blockade Flagship there, Naboo: Swamp, and Droid Racks. <br />
For remainder of game, you may not deploy cards with ability except Federation starships and characters with Trade Federation in lore. Civil Disorder is canceled. While this side up, once during your deploy phase may deploy a Naboo site from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. Opponents Force icons at Naboo system are canceled. Flip this card if you control Theed Palace Throne Room (with a Neimoidian there) and Naboo system.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you lose no more than 2 Force to any Force drain. Your battle droids deploy -1. If you have two Federation droids with different card titles (or a Federation droid and a Neimoidian) in battle at a site, draw two battle destiny if unable to otherwise. Your droid starfighters are immune to attrition <3. If opponent just drew an Interrupt for battle destiny, once per battle you may place that card out of play. Flip this card if opponent controls Naboo system or Theed Palace Throne Room.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 2 to 3 Gunrays, 3 to 4 Mauls, 2 to 3 Darth Sidious, At Last We Are Getting Results (V12), The Phantom Menace, Blockade Flagship, Daultay Dofine (V12), a mixture of battle and destroyer droids.  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: The DS version of WHAP. It also is completely run around Episode I which prevents you from playing with Vader or even aliens. Your only power characters are Maul and Darth Sidious. When this objective was released, it did get some playing time because at the time, the LS only had a moderate space package and this deck really didnt have to fear any of the characters that might come after it. The deck plays completely around the Trade Federation, so you are not affected by cards that target Imperials or aliens. Battle Droids and Destroyer Droids have presence icons, so even though they dont have ability, they can still provide presents and control locations. The bad thing is that you dont get destiny from your lack of ability. This means for the objective to stand a chance of winning, they have to flip and stay flipped so you get two destinies unless able to otherwise when you have two droids or a droid with a Neimoidian. For years, this deck has not been very popular because the entire strategy requires you to keep presence at BOTH the system and the Throne Room. WHAP only has to hold the Throne Room. You do get to start the game with Blockade Flagship already at the system, so all you have to do is make sure it doesnt get killed which is not an easy thing to do. The DS has no Secure Route (V4) to get cards back but they do have a new Virtual card that completely changes how the deck can be built and played out. At Last We Are Getting Results (V12) says you can play with ANY Maul, your droids get defense value +2, and ALL opponents immunity to attrition is -3. This means that ANY starship can be easily killed with you drawing two destinies. In order to hold the Throne Room, it is important to set up a version of Nute Gunray. With how Invasion works, you want to go with Nute Gunray, Neimoidian Viceroy from Theed since the one from Coruscant has to be on the Blockade Flagship to provide a huge bonus. Gunray NV makes all your Episode I droids in the deck destiny +1 when drawn for weapon or battle destiny. That means your average destiny is going to be 3 or 4. He also pulls Take Them Away which can either subtracts from a just drawn battle destiny or provides an automatic way to cancel Undercover. His text makes him immune to attrition < the number twice the number of your droids present which usually wont be all that high. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The idea of this objective is to do the exact same thing as WHAP by controlling the Throne Room, only you can directly deploy there easily first turn. The great thing is you start the game set up in space, so once you flip you are doing good damage and set up to drain for free. It can be very easy to get the Firepower (V6) shield going with this deck. In many games, you will have no problem flipping first turn if you get the right cards in your opening hand. If you are not ready to control the Throne Room, make sure to wait before deploying it with the objective. You dont want the LS piling up a force there before you are ready. From my experience, Maul can be a huge key to how powerful this deck can be. Since you can now play with any version of Maul, the best overall is going to be Maul With Stick. You can play 3 to 4 as your main attack force on the ground. You want to play The Phantom Menace anyway to pull your Neimoidians, so he would be defense value +2 and immune to attrition against Jedi with his built in double swinging stick. Another option would be to play one of the Mauls with built in immunity. Each one does a different thing; Tatooine Maul would be good as a back up for holding space because you would automatically beat decks that dont put a lot of characters in space and instead rely on permanent pilot ships like the Home One, Spiral, HC&Falcon, Tantive IV (V7), Bright Hope (V5), or Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10). Tatooine Maul can set up on the ground with his double-bladed stick and get +2 to drains, then shuttle up when needed. If you want a guaranteed hit when swinging, then go with Maul Young Apprentice since he adds +1 to each destiny draw when targeting a Jedi. If you want a cheap deploy Maul for fast set up, go with Lord Maul. Considering the original Invasion for the past years has been restricted to only Lord Maul, he is no longer the best option. In my opinion, any of the other three would be better. The problem is keeping control of the Throne Room and the system together. Invasion doesnt have the power of Secure Route (V) to get cards back but it does have power with its droids. They do a lot of good things when you pair them together. Much like the movie, they only work when many of them are in a group rather than on their own. Because of that, much of the deck is devoted to characters rather than interrupts and effects. The objective lets you start with Droid Racks already on the table, which is like a Bacta Tank for DS only you can put as many droids there as you want when they are lost from table and only cost 2 Force to take one into hand. You have two choices when it comes to which droids to play. Some just use a mixture of all different ones but the best overall option would be Destroyer Droids because they all have built in weapons and became defense value 5 with ALWAGR (V12). There are also specific red cards that help the DDs. Master, Destroyers allows you to target a LS chararacter present with at least two of your DDs, target is prevented from using weapons and is power -2 for remainder of turn. The card also says you can lose 1 Force to take into hand up to 3 non-unique DDs. Rolling, Rolling, Rolling is a Used 5 destiny Interrupt that also lets you take into hand one non-unique DD or lets you relocate a DD to an adjacent site during your deploy phase. The DDs even have a drain canceller like Den of Thieves or Dread Imperial Starfeet. Where Are Those Droidekas?! can cancel drains by placing a non-unique DD from hand and then can be played for 5 Force. The only difference is you can do it while one is already on it.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The biggest help by far was At Last We Are Getting Results (V12) providing new ability to the deck. But that wasnt the only change Invasion got. The Redux changed Jedi Lightsaber (V9) which originally made any droid hit Lost. Now it just makes them forfeit 0 like any other stick. The droids can hold their own at sites without Mace (V9) coming to kill three of them. The other big help for Invasion was the addition of Daultay Dofine (V12) which says the Blockade Flagship is immune to attrition <9!!! Then while an Episode I AO is on the table, the BF may NOT be targeted by weapons and may not have its power reduced. This card turns the Blockade Flagship into a TANK. The BF already pulls ANY Neimoidian once per game, so you can set him up as your very first action during your deploy phase. Then if all of that help wasnt enough, Dofine (V12) also takes into hand Gunray or Haako once per game. This means if you have enough Force, you would be able to deploy both characters and flip first turn. The better idea would be to go ahead and set up the space and wait until you have a solid force in hand to deploy all at once to the Throne Room on your second or third turn. If you play with some evasion like Stunning Leader and Barriers, anything is possible. The new Dofine (V12) has totally changed the power of the Blockade Flagship. The only way to knock it out of the sky is with attrition. The best option for keeping the LS from getting too much attrition is with Guri. The objective still lets you play with any droid you want and that includes Guri, IG-88, and 4-LOM. The new Stinger (V12) gives you an added ability with drawing cards from your Reserve or Force pile and can be set up with Combat Response since it no longer has a permanent pilot. Once she is there with the Blockade Flagship, the opponent will be limited to just one battle destiny. There is like only a handful of ways the LS can get a single destiny to be 9+, so you would be in good shape all game at the system.  One of those ways was to use Darklighter Spin to get around the single destiny limit.  The AR changed how the single destiny limit functions and it remains to be seen how much Darklight Spin recieves play after that change. The space force used to be the hardest part of playing Invasion because the LS could also come down and knock the Blockade Flagship out of the sky. It isnt as easy any more.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The three new V cards have greatly changed how powerful this deck can be. The seven side is strong, preventing the LS from draining anywhere for more than 2 Force. You always get two destinies with two or more droids and you even have the ability to place opponents Interrupts out of play when they are drawn for battle destiny. This can be done once in every battle on both turns. It is not as powerful as WHAP being able to just cancel the destiny but you are still causing cards to be lost and never played again. You can really hurt WYS with this ability. Since the deck has only had these new cards for a short while, there have only been a handful of ideas that have come to surface. Once you set up control at both locations, the rest of the deck is up to the player. You can play lots of droids to spread out or pile up on a few sites. You could play the AAT Tanks at the Battle Plains for a very constant drain of 2. One ability that many dont think about is Darth Sidious being able to add a battle destiny to any Neimoidian for just 1 Force while on Coruscant. The easiest way to set this up is by pulling the SE Coruscant: docking bay either with IAO Combo for Nabrun protection or Begin Landing Your Troops since it adds +2 to forfeit of your Republic characters. Since Sidious is alone, you can also place Jedi out of play if they come to battle your droids on Naboo. There is no perfect way to build this deck right now and no one has found a perfect attack force since your only power character is Maul. This is the only DS deck that restricts you from playing ANY Imperials or aliens. This means you have to try very new and unfamiliar ideas for battling and causing damage. I do believe there is enough good strategy from new cards that make Invasion tournament viable. It might not beat everything, but it will at least have a better chance from years past.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The new cards have made this deck A LOT better. It is still too early to say for sure whether or not this deck can win consistently. For that reason, you might not want to take this to a major tournament unless you have playtested A LOT. Right now, you really only lose to specific match-ups. You might have a slight advantage over WHAP because you will be totally set up in space draining for free, while the LS probably doesnt even play with space. Both of you will be fighting for the Throne Room and they might have the advantage in that battle with the objective canceling destiny draws. This would be a good deck for using Sidious to put those hit Jedi out of play. Make sure to grab the A Jedis Resilience or Escape Pod (V2) if they start abusing them with Secure Route (V4). As far as other LS match-ups it will totally depend on what they are playing. The standard LS cards will hurt you; Savrip, SATM Combo, Clash of Sabers, etc. Since you need two droids together to get the two destinies, the LS is open to causing beatdown if they can separate them or exclude them from battle. To be safe, you may need 3 or more droids together when you are in a battle.  This is probably the biggest problem for Invasion because you need a lot of cards on table to hold sites or battle the opponent.  A very powerful card in this deck is Droid Shutdown, which totally protects the targeted droid from ANYTHING for remainder of turn. Its also destiny 6 and a Used Interrupt. You should probably have at least 3 to 5 in this deck. The best idea is to just play with AAT Tanks with Commander Droids pulled by Endor Shield (V11) for the exterior sites and pile up Maul, Gunray, and friends in the Throne Room. Consider using Forced Servitude if you play this deck.  Invasion can be a good deck now but by no means is it the strongest option for DS.  <br />

16 * Let Them Make the First Move (Combat) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text:  <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Theed Palace Generator Core, Theed Palace Generator, and Deep Hatred.  <br />
While this side up, opponent may not Force drain where opponent has a Jedi, and your Force drains at Naboo sites where you have a Dark Jedi may not be canceled. Once during your control phase, may target one opponents character present with your Dark Jedi at an interior Theed Palace site. Target is Lost. Flip this card if an opponents Jedi present at an interior Naboo battleground site.  <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, you may not Force drain or initiate battle at any location where you have a Dark Jedi. Once during your move phase, your Dark Jedi may initiate lightsaber combat against an opponents Jedi present: Each player draws 2 destiny. Loser (lowest total) loses 2 Force (cannot be reduced). If difference is 5 or greater, lost Force must come from Reserve Deck, and losing character is lost. Flip this card and retrieve 1 Force if opponent has no Jedi present at any interior Naboo battleground.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: 4 Lord Mauls, 3 Vaders, 2 to 3 Emperors, 2 to 3 Darth Sidious, Force Field, Stunning Leader, Imperial Barrier, and good space.  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: Just like LS Combat, this objective was very powerful when it first came out. It was very easy for the DS to set up fast and force the LS to stop the drain of 4 produced by Lord Maul and his Double-Bladed lightsaber. For years, this objective could only be stopped by an equally good LS Combat deck or LS Senate. Only until the creation of the V cards did it take a back seat to other much stronger DS options. The PC created a shield to limit who was to be made lost by the objective. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (V2) for DS and Affect Mind (V2) for LS changed it so that only spies and droids would be lost during your control phase, as well as prevented you from draining for too much by limited the Force drains to only 2 per site if you have two or more Jedi at Naboo sites. It also said the player may only use one Combat card a turn. The shields made this deck more balanced in the tournament environment. The next version to hit the scene was called a Shield Buster. The idea was to get the opponent to play their three Defensive Shields leaving them open to another strategy that they would normally be able to get around with the other Shields. Example, the first sheild they would play was the Combat Shield; from there they may play some combination of the two SAC, grabber, retrieval, Pod Racing shields. Being able to abuse the strategy in your deck that the opponent was no longer able to counter made this version almost unbeatable. If they played their Odds shield, they were left open to SAC or retrieval all game. This version was the main and most powerful version of Combat until the PC created Drop (V8) & Thrown Back (V8), which allow the player to play 4 shields.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The power of DS Combat comes from the fact that there are now many many Jedi for the LS to play with. Since the majority of LS decks play with many different Jedi, you put them in a bind by preventing them from Force draining while not on Naboo. Of course, this means they will have more to throw at you in hopes of killing your Dark Jedi. You have an advantage since your Drains where you have a Dark Jedi cant be canceled and that forces the opponent to come to you in order to win. The majority of the time, unless the LS deck is space based, it will not be able to win if it never comes to Naboo. Many of the most popular LS decks play with Jedi as their main fighting force.  So you will be playing against them like 90% of the time. DS Combat has a lot more options for space compared to LS Combat. The majority of them go with matching bounty hunter ships and maybe Baron Fel on Saber 1. You start Combat Response and play 2 to 3 Short Range Combos to set them up fast. This strategy is popular because those ships are pretty cheap and can be set up by second turn after you get Lord Maul down. You also have the option of setting up a Free Executor by just playing Bespin, Mob Points Combo, and TMNALTC. This is a new idea but might work since you need high destiny in the deck to begin with. You can play 2x TMNALTC, 2x Were The Bait (V6), and 3x WMAOPs. The system can be pulled by starting Kuat Drive Yard (V6). The Executor almost never leaves the table once it gets deployed, so you can warrant the slots for the set of Effects you need to deploy it for free. You replace the lower destiny from matching pilots with high destiny Effects and Interrupts. DS Combat is another deck that can work well with Tauntaun Skull. You can play with some high destiny characters like Tech Mor or Emperor Palpatine. Tauntaun Skull says you add their destiny number to your total power by placing a copy of that character out of play. You can do some surprise beatdowns on alien based decks or decks that play on Naboo like WHAP. Another aspect of DS Combat that you dont hear about much is Dueling. The objective doesnt prevent you from Dueling as well as playing Lightsaber Combat. You start the game with Deep Hatred already in play, so you will always have a huge advantage Dueling. Most dont think about using this for Combat because it tends to focus around Lord Maul, while Dueling is usually focused around Vader. Since the DS doesnt have as many Dark Jedi to play with, it makes sence to play it. You dont even have to do Epic Duels. You can use old fashioned Circle Is Now Complete or Vaders Obsession against Obi or Luke and add Focused Attack to make sure you win the duel. If they dont play the Affect Mind (V2) Shield or Civil Disorder (V6), the Obsession alone can win games since you can set up a HUGE card Force swing with the Duel damage and the retrieval. You can also use the Dueling cards as Combat cards should you find yourself not wanting to Duel or you are without a Vader.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: As mentioned with LS Combat, the powerful Shield Buster version is no longer a viable strategy with this deck since the creation of Thrown Back (V8) and Drop (V8) allowing you to play 4 shields and We Dont Need Their Scum Either (V11) which lets you play another shield from you Starting Effect. Since there is now no limit to the number of shields that one player can play. The original idea for DS Combat is the only real option for this deck. Set up a Dark Jedi and wait. The LS got Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (V11) to play with in LS Combat, while the DS didnt get a new Dark Jedi character. They did get a new stick with Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V12). This means Sidious can now be a powerful Dark Jedi at his own site since, once you make the LS character lost, they can be placed out of play. He didnt seem worth it when he didnt have a stick that was worth playing but now he can be a great addition to DS Combat. Besides the new stick, DS Combat really didnt get much help from new Virtual sets. It remains a decent option for DS but still not the most powerful. The Affect Mind (V2) shield plus Civil Disorder (V6) make this deck open to weaknesses.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: DS Combat can be a great surprise to a meta that expects the IG-88 deck, DS Senate, Huntdown, or SYCFA Fear. It requires the LS to play completely different than they are used to versus any other DS deck. Remember to always play Much Anger In Him for when you play against LS Combat.  Since neither of you will be able to initiate battle and will track the same destinies, they will lose 4 Force a turn. This can be the difference in winning the game and having it timed. Both Combats are probably the one deck where you really need to play both Ability x3 (V6) AND Barriers. In most games you will be playing the Barriers but you still need the Ability x3 (V6) against LS Combat and LS Senate. Since most LS Combat decks play with Civil Disorder (V6), you dont want them to have the advantage. You will almost always win games against decks where they dont have the shield. If they leave you alone, you drain for 3 to 4 all game. Another trick for this deck is to make sure you play 2x DrE (non-combo) and 2x Disarmed. Since you are unable to battle once you flip, it is nice being able to operate on any Disarmed character once you play it during either Control phase. If you played with DrEs gun, he could deploy in front of a Jedi and if they dont play their own Disarmed the following turn, you make them lost during their Control phase. This works very well with DS Senate since you will already be starting Blaster Rack (V1), and you should have a Barrier or Stunning Leader to protect DrE. This can be another way DS Combat can beat LS Combat. DS Combat is a deck where there really isnt a good example of one on Decktech that has won major tournaments. Hopefully as the game continues there will be more options for this objective.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The DS is SOOOO much stronger than the LS right now that there are just too many more powerful options to go with that should be considered before this deck. SYCFA, Senate, and the IG-88 deck are all better options. Plus all the alien based decks can do more damage and give the LS more problems. MWYHL with 2x Projection can hurt too since you will be limited to drains of one at each of your Naboo sites. DS Combat only has Search & Destroy for direct damage, so it can lose against the Asteroid version of MWYHL that does damage without having to come to the ground. DS Combat will always be weak versus space based decks like Hidden base and EBO. The good thing is the Re Edit changed Rebel Planners (V6), so there is no way to cancel the drains on Naboo. This helps versus HB but still doesnt give you the victory. DS Combat never plays enough space to handle all the drains the LS has and some of them can be quite large. So if you come up against a HB that plays ground, you might have problems. You can lose if they knock your space out of the sky and force you to pay for drains. EBO can set up huge drains as well and doesnt take as long to set up. This deck also has to worry about Obi-Wan Kenobi (V8) since he can drain over the objective. Many decks are using Krayt Dragon Howl (V8) to start Obi at the beginning of the game. You dont usually battle with DS Combat, so he can do serious damage if you are unable to kill him early. Remember to try and keep Lord Maul on Naboo, and use Vader or Sidious to fight. New builds might consider a different version of Maul and try leaving Sidious on Naboo for Combat. It is too soon to tell what will be the popular playstyle for this deck. They can simply use Sidious on a lone site to limit the times the LS can play the same Jedi to Naboo. In my experience, DS Combat has not been a very popular option but there may be another amazing build for it that is waiting to be played.  <br />

17 * virtual Imperial Occupation (V) (Walkers) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Game Text: <br />
 <br />
(Zero Side) Deploy Hoth system, Ice Plains, and Main Power Generators (Light side). May deploy Imperial Decree.  <br />
For remainder of game, AT-ATs deploy -1 to Hoth. You may not play Colo Claw Fish. Revolution is canceled. While this side up, AT-ATs may move for free. Rebels are deploy -1 to Hoth sites. Opponent loses no Force to You May Start Your Landing. During your Control phase, may take into hand a (Hoth)AT-AT, (Hoth) Epic Event, AT-AT Cannon, Death Squadron, or Electro-Rangefinder. Flip this card if Main Power Generators is blown away. <br />
 <br />
(Seven Side) While this side up, Rebel Base Occupation is canceled and Walker Garrison is an Out of Play Interrupt and immune to Sense. Rebels Deploy +1 to Hoth sites. Your total battle destiny at Hoth system is +1 for each Imperial there. Unless opponent controls a Hoth location, your Force drain bonuses may not be canceled. Once per turn, when you deploy an AT-AT, may take into hand one card (except a vehicle or Interrupt) from Lost Pile. May deploy from Reserve any Marker site.  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Blizzard 4, Blizzard 2 (V4), Tempest 1, Blizzard 1 (V4 or non-V), version of Veers, version of Vader, Target the Main Generator, Walker Garrison, 3rd Marker, Sando Aqua Monster, Tatooine Maul, Mauls Sith Infiltrator, Imperial Decree (V6 & non-V), and You May Start Your Landing  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Objective: The first DS objective created by the PC. It was the exact opposite to Speeders and another great movie objective. For a long time, Walkers was the strongest DS deck to be played. Only with the creation of stronger LS decks did this deck become less powerful. Even though the deck could be beat, it was considered way too strong.  It was able to blow the shields by turn 3 since the objective could pull Blizzard 4 to set up Vader. The PC ended up having to completely change this deck the same way they changed Speeders and WYS (V8). The basic idea is still the same. Get out a non-maintenance Walker, equip it with AT-AT Cannon (V4), get a high enough ability pilot on the Walker, and blow the shields. The minute they go, the LS loses 8 Force from the Shields, then another 1 direct damage from You May Start Your Landing since the Walker only has to occupy the site. From there, you set up at least one Walker at the different non-battleground Marker sites, usually 4th, 5th, and 6th. YMSYL lets you pull the 3rd Marker and Walker Garrison, if you started the game with that card on table. You can pull those two cards and deploy the 3rd Marker after you blow the shields. It is VERY important to never deploy the 3rd Marker until after the shields are gone. Your forces at the 3rd Marker can get stuck which means, unless you are playing the Electro-Rangefinder, you will have to deploy to the Plains and move over. The LS can throw as much as they want at you on their next turn because you gave them a site to battle you at. The Hoth shield prevents you from deploying directly to the 3rd marker until the shield is blown away, which means that you will not be able to fortify the Walker that was moved over the previous turn. Once the shield has been blown away, you can spread out and have a solid force set up on the 3rd Maker. You can play Walker Garrison once per game (now that its an Out of Play Interrupt) to drain for 10 to 15. The good thing is they made it immune to Sense. So the only way to cancel it is with T-47 Battle Formation. The best strategy is always to blow the shields first before you think of doing anything else with this deck. If you fear a spy coming down first turn, some versions play with Corporal Dedrum (V5) who prevents opponents spies and Jar Jar from deploying to same site. He can be found by Blizzard 4 or Commander Praji (V2) since he is both a pilot and a warrior. Walkers can be very easy to play since you win the majority of your games doing the exact same thing. Most of the time when the LS leaves you alone, you will auto win the game.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This objective wins because it can set up very fast damage that is almost impossible to cancel. The deck sets up on Hoth, so the DS has Imperial Decree at the start of the game to cancel all the LS drain bonuses. When you combine that with Imperial Decree (V6), Walkers can absorb both drains and direct damage very well. The deck also causes damage from non-battleground sites with You May Start Your Landing. The LS doesnt have as many ways to get around direct damage other than Honor Of The Jedi, so they usually have a tough time taking damage all game from YMSYL. The loss of 8 Force can also cause some key cards to be lost since most of the time the cards lost will come blindly from the Reserve deck. The deck doesnt rely on the use of Walker Garrison to win. Most of the time, by the time you are ready to play it, the opponent would already be well on their way to losing the game. The Garrison just finishes them off. The most powerful part of the objective is the ability to take ANY card you want from your lost pile back into hand once per turn when you deploy an AT-AT, and the AT-AT doesnt have to deploy to Hoth for this benefit to work. This used to be what made the deck so powerful, the Re Edit changed it so you cant take certain cards into hand. This is not near as powerful as before but it does allow you to keep your space and key power characters in play. Plus you can still take into hand Effects like Lateral Damage to abuse again and again.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit changed how this deck could be built and played. Much like the LS objectives that were changed, this one became a very different deck from the original design. Now you can only find the Hoth icon AT-ATs. You cant pull Blizzard 4, Tempest 1, or the non-unique AT-ATs from the two player expansion. For some reason this was considered broken or too fast of a setup, so it was changed. Since you cant find Vader automatically anymore, this deck can take longer to blow the shields. When it was first changed, the answer to the problem came by starting Sando Aqua Monster and playing 6x Combat Readiness (V8). If you got a CR (V8) in your opening hand, you played it as your first action. Then it was placed on Sando so you had an auto 5 as your Epic Event draw. However, the Errata to Combat Readiness (V8) removed the ability to stack this card on your reserve.  Since you knew your draw would be a 5, you could realistically blow the shields with any ability 3 pilot. Since Endor Shield (V11) pulls any Admiral, Moff, General, or Commander, you can pull the character that you need. If you start Inconsequential Losses (V9), you pull the Cannon when you deploy the AT-AT. So first turn, you pull the AT-AT if you didnt already have one. Blizzard 1 (V4) plays for just 4 Force. Veers (V10) deploys for 1 Force, so they can both go down for just 5. If you also pull Ozzel, you have a destiny just in case. If the LS doesnt get someone to the Ice Plains to keep you from controlling it, you auto blow the shields with the 5 on Sando, 3 from Veers, and 1 from the site. Your deck gives you 5 Force to start, so can always set this up against any LS match-up. Although you will have more problems against LS decks that go first since they have the ability to deploy to Hoth before your first turn. If they provide you just 1 more Force, you can use Blizzard 1 (non-V) to add another +1, so it doesnt matter if they deploy to the 1st Marker and move over. Besides this faster version, another option for setting up fast is to play a Free Executor version. You set up the Free Executor by starting Mob Points Combo and Kuat Drive Yards (V6). You have to play 3x WMAOPs, 2x TMNALTC, and 2x Were The Bait (V6). This gives you more than 73% chance you will get one in your opening hand. Once the Executor goes down, you can use Endor Shield (V11) to pull Admiral Piett, who then pulls Battle Deployment, which then pulls ANY vehicle. You dont have to do all of this on the same turn since it would give up a lot of searches for Thrown Back (V8). This version simply provides the ability to pull Blizzard 4 to set up Vader or Mara (V12) as well as continually pull vehicles after flipping. Plus the Executor is the hardest ship to knock out of space, so you set up a very solid presence in space that should survive all game to drain for free. You also increase the average destiny in the deck by replacing the lower destiny cards from its space package with 5 destiny WMAOPs, 5 destiny TMNALTC, and 7 destiny Were The Bait (v).  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Walkers will always be a strong strategy because you are playing a deck that is based around powerful ground vehicles. The Re Edit did change how you set up and do damage and how long it takes you to blow up the generators. You no longer get 2x Walker Garrisons a game. This was sometimes what it took to win games against specific LS decks and now it is gone. Walkers can still be a powerful deck. You can slow down the LS damage very well with the Imperial Decrees and you have many options for red cards on Hoth. Ice Storm is always a popular card for making characters not in vehicles missing. You can play Sunsdown on Hoth with Frostbite (non-V) to cause 2 direct damage loss for each missing character. A very under played card that can really surprise some players is He Hasnt Come Back Yet. This Interrupt targets any LS character alone at ANY Marker site, is destiny +3> ability, targets are made missing. Endor Shield (V11) changed how the deck starts because you no longer have to play Imperial Commands to find General Veers (V4). Some versions choose to play with Krayt Dragon Bones (V4) which pulls both One Arm (V4) and Wampa (V4) from under your starting effect Fear is My Alley but that strategy may see less play with the Advanced Rules change to creature rules. There are also many chooses for the space package. Some play with bounty hunter ships and Tat Maul in space, yet others chose to play with Star Destroyers to benefit from the Prepared Defenses Text. Endor Shield (V11) has become a standard start for Walkers, so you can easily set up both General Veers (V4) on the ground and Thrawn in space. While you get a bonus from playing Imperials at the system, the best choice is the bounty hunters because they are much cheaper and can be redeployed from Lost pile after deploying AT-ATs. The new speed version of Walkers is probably the best strategy since you can cause key LS cards to be lost after their first turn of play. The speed version doesnt start You May Start Your Landing, so it is very important to always play 2x of them, plus 2 to 3 copies of We Must Accelerate Our Plans.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Walkers is one of those DS decks that do the exact same thing every game. All decks that do the same thing can be a blessing as well as a curse since your opponent will always know exactly what you will be doing each turn. Because Walkers was so strong for so long, many LS players have experience playing against it. There are many things that can hurt this deck. The main one is not being able to blow the Shields. If you get killed early from attacking LS characters or just bad luck with draws, it will take much longer to blow the shields.  The longer you take, the longer the LS can cause damage. Walkers usually deploys a lot of cards, so it can have a hard time winning if it has to eat several turns of damage or loses a key card. The other weakness is the system. Walkers have to be able to set up in space to drain for free. Your direct damage can be limited by multiple copies of Imperial Atrocity (V6). Since the Re Edit prevents you from getting back Interrupts when you deploy AT-ATs, you no longer have the ability to play Control over and over again. This means the Atrocities stay in play more often, especially against WHAP and Secure Route (V6). Walkers can still be a powerful option for DS but you may have a harder time winning since you have one less Walker Garrison to play. You really need the 8 damage from the Shields to go through or it can take a long time to win. LS has many forms of retrieval, so you have to make sure you are constantly causing damage. You also have to worry about spies like Corran Horn coming down first turn to kill your AT-AT that you have just set up to blow the Shields. Profit will always be Walkers worst match-up because they can pull spy Leia and her matching blaster rifle which makes vehicles lost when hit. This strategy is not as powerful as it used to be when the LS could play Colo Claw Fish and stack a destiny to kill your walker through attrition but it can still be trouble with some lucky draws.  <br />

01 * Thrown Room Mains (TRMs) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Location(s): Yavin 4: Throne Room <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Twix sites [two or three icons for LS and none for DS], Jedi, SAC, EPPs, Wokling (V4), Insurrection Combo, Scrambled Transmission (V5), The Professor (V9)  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Truly, this deck has been the longest running power house for the LS. No matter what set came out, this deck only changed and evolved from the time of Premiere till today. A version of this deck has been played by at least one player at every Worlds tournament since 1999. The idea has always been the same. LS goes first, deploys LOTS of twix sites (two or three icons for me, none for you) for activation.  Then, disrupt the DS to strategy and react. This deck has only changed to play with the most powerful characters and starships that were available. Literally this is one of the last decks for either side that still start only one location without an objective or Epic Event being played. One of the original designs that really put this deck on the map was when the Starting Interrupts Careful Planning / Combat Readiness (NON V) from Endor came out. The deck would start the Yavin 4: Throne Room, like normal, then with CP also started two related <> sites, which were the Farm and Swamp. On the first turn, the LS player would use the Swamp text to find a Nudj that would absorb the DS icon. Then the next turn, find the other Nudj giving you 4 icons that were safe from direct deployment from the DS. From this build, as cards were made that could pull locations, the deck became that much stronger getting more of its sites out faster without having to draw them. The deck will probably always be a part of the game of SWCCG because it is the most basic idea of how the game was designed. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The reason TRMs will always be a solid choice for LS is because it chokes the DS of Force. The average build will usually set up 8 to 12 icons for the LS and only give up 1 or 2 for the DS. It neednt give up any to the DS at all in most games.  Many DS strategies require Force to be affective. Players get used to playing against LS decks that give away DS force icons like Hidden Base, which provides 5 to 8 DS icons, or Combat, which gives the DS 4 icons to start the game. Since the deck sets up so much Force and gives away so little, Goo Nee Tay has been a staple in all versions of TRMs. Most builds will play 2 or more copies to make sure it is in play asap. Since you are already choking the DS of Force, having to pay +2 to deploy just about every powerful character can make it almost impossible to fortify a site.  The Force choke can be increased by the use of Revolution on the DS locations. Besides the choking of Force, TRMs is totally a reactive strategy. The whole deck is built to react to WHATEVER the DS is doing and disrupt it. No other LS deck can do this as well as TRMs. By utilizing cards like Mantellian Savrip, Goo Nee Tay, and SAC[Sense, Alter, Control], TRMs can give any DS strategy problems. The standard build always plays with some type of Jedi. Either EPPs to save card slots and act as striking characters OR matching weapons and immunity for more staying power once deployed. There is never too much of either ground or space. Since you dont have a specific strategy to set up with the deck, your 3 Effects you start the game with from Heading to the Medical Frigate are almost never the same. Because you are playing a reactive deck, you usually will start a different Effect per match-up. The Professor (V9) for Free Executor decks, Scrambled Transmission (V5) for Senate and Watto, Civil Disorder (V6) for Combat and Senate. You might play with Inserrection Combo to pull docking bays and prevent the DS from using Ellis for attack. Some play Quick Draw (V9) to keep the matching weapons in the deck when characters are lost, plus it pulls SaiTor Kal Fas(V1) which pulls the weapons when you deploy your characters. The SAC protects you from different aspects of the DS strategy as well as can be used to keep the Savrip on table all game. Sense combo played after the DS pulled an important card into hand has ruined the start of the game for many DS decks.  Savrip is your main defensive card since it keeps your stuff on table when you get beatdown or would have to lose to attrition. The other staple with almost all TRMs decks is Threepio, With Parts Showing. This Threepio puts your high destinies back into your deck while letting you take new cards into hand from Reserve. Since you have no way to pull all your twix sites other than interrupts, Threepio provides the most effective way to cycle through your whole deck while also setting up large destinies to track. When you combine all of these aspects together, TRMs provides the LS with a very powerful deck option.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: TRMs finally took a hit with the Re Edit creating Wipe Them Out, All Of Them (V9). This new Effect deploys on a site and says all permanent weapon destiny draws are -2 unless that side controls a battleground. This card has greatly changed how TRMs can be built. For it to work successfully against all types of decks, TRMs has to consider that card and be built with matching weapons instead of the EPPs. You also need to play with twix sites that are on the same planet as another site to get around the retrieval portion of WTOAOT (V9). The big change is that now you will most likely have to play with a battleground site in your deck. The original strategy only played with Kessel and used the reactive aspect of the deck to simply take over the DS battlegrounds. Since the LS now has to be controlling a battleground to have a chance of hitting anything with EPPs, newer versions have been using the Theed Palace: Generator Core, the Naboo: Battle Plains, or just docking bays. The Generator Core is the best ground location for LS and can be very hard for the DS to wipe out. It cant be pulled by anything you can start other than Mon Mothma (V9) after starting Strike Planning. Wesa Gotta Grand Army can pull both the Battle Plains as well as Boss Nasss Chamber (twix site). Rebel Leadership (V12) can pull any War Room once per game. So you can get out the Yavin 4: War Room much easier to get around WTOAOT (V9). Since the DS finally has a counter card for this deck, the popularity of TRMs has declined greatly. Even though very few choose to play WTOAOT (V9), the fear of its existence has caused players to look at other options for LS.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Although TRMs took a hit with WTOAOT (V9) it can still be a great deck for LS. TRMs is still the worst match-up for many DS strategies. Since your goal with every game is to disrupt whatever the DS is doing, many DS decks cant handle the constant pressure. This is one of those decks that play out completely differently for each and every game. Most LS decks will do the same thing for either the set-up or damage for the whole game. TRMs is not like this. The key to the deck is getting your sites out early. If you have trouble finding them, it can mean a long and slow game, so make sure you build the deck around the activation first. EPPs can still be played if you dont fear WTOAOT (V9) or you build the deck to always control a battleground before you battle. The deck will have a very basic space package, usually a mixture of Home One, Bright Hope (V5), Tantive IV (V7), Sprial, Gold Leader in Gold 1 (V10), and Han, Chewie, & the Falcon. After the locations, characters, and ships, the rest of the deck can be tailored to what you feel like. TRMs has always been a great meta deck because you can switch out different red cards for what you expect to face. The other positive aspect of TRMs is the fact that it doesnt deploy many cards during the game. The deck doesnt rely on lots of Effects and locations to win because it never sets up a specific strategy. If you havent noticed by now, the majority of strong DS decks deploy a decent amount of cards to the table. So you will always have a huge advantage not having to put out as many cards. You have like 10 extra cards to lose for damage over the majority of LS strategies that deploy those 10 cards to the table. Besides decks that play WTOAOT (V9), there is no auto loss for this deck. Every match-up against TRMs will have the possibility of victory. Because of how long it has existed, there are many many different versions posted on Decktech.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Because of WTOAOT (V9), TRMs is not as powerful as it used to be. The current build of TRMs is still a solid deck but nowhere near as strong as it used to be. Since the build is somewhat different now, the popularity has changed for the deck. While you will always see at least one version played at every major tournament, many areas have gone months without seeing any versions being played. TRMs is one of the LS decks that has the ability to beat itself. As long as it has existed, TRMs is has lost when it has bad opening hand draws. If it takes too long to find the sites and/or Threepio, the DS is able to set up and begin doing damage. If the DS is given enough turns to set-up and fortify their strategy, TRMs will have a much harder time playing catch-up. Huntdown can be a hit or miss against TRMs since it also chokes the LS of Force.  If you never find your sites, you will not be able to deploy Jedi to flip their objective. So you take Visage damage and drains while you continue to draw more cards into your hand. I have even heard stories of all the locations being in the last 8 cards of the decks lifeforce. You cant do anything without Force. TRMs took a hit with Imperial Decree (V6) too because it allows the DS to generate off of the Twixes you have deployed.  Keep that in mind when you go to play this deck.  <br />

02 * Tatooine w/ Careful Planning (V8)  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Tatooine battleground site (Starting Location), Tatooine system, another Tatooine 1 icon site.  <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Tatooine: City Outskirts, Tatooine: Beggers Canyon, Tatooine: Wattos Junkyard, Jedi, Credits Will Do Fine, matching weapons, Quick Draw (V9), Luke (V10), Tatooine: Tosche Station <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: The Re Edit changed how CP (V8) could set up locations. You now have to start a battleground site as your Starting Location, then you must play the matching system and another related site that cant provide more than one LS icon. This means that the most you can ever activate from Tatooine CP (V8) at the start is 6 (including yourself). So you now have to decide which sites to set up for a specific strategy. The first one can be any Tatooine site as long as it is a battleground. Since you are limited to a 1 icon site from CP (V8), you always want to start a 2 icon site as your starting. The most popular is the Jedi Outskirts because it can deploy from Reserve any Jedi once per game. From there, there have been a few different ideas to play with. The main one has been Wattos Junkyard. This version is called NON-Hyperdrive since it plays the same sites as the Hyperdrive objective, as well as start Credits Will Do Fine as one of the 3 starting Effects. You set-up a Jedi with stick at the Junkyard, play Rycar Ryjerd(V2) to pull two Effects and/or Devices that can beef up the Jedi, then begin draining and causing the DS to stack cards on Credits. They have to stack cards whenever you Force drain or win a battle at the Junkyard. Since this direct damage stacks the cards, it cannot be canceled by the DS.  The stacked cards are like placing cards out of play and the DS is unable to retrieve or play with for the rest of the game. Since you arent playing the Hyperdrive objective, you have no restrictions on which characters or starships you can play. So you get the bonus of Credits without the weak space package. Some popular cards you might see are Into The Garbage Shoot Fly Boy (V2) which is a Used 6 destiny that adds a battle destiny at the Junkyard. Mantellian Savrip and Nabrum Leids are also very popular in these builds. The NON-Hyperdrive is really the most popular LS build on Tatooine with CP (V8). There have been a few random builds with other sites like Tosche Station or Beggars Canyon, but none of them have become a solid strategy for LS.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Besides the NON-Hyperdrive strategy, the LS can also set up Tosche Station with the Outskirts. Qui-Gon from Tatooine can deploy for 6 from Reserve on your first turn. If you start SaiTor Kal Fas(V1), you can always provide his matching weapon. Then Rycar (V2) can give him Lightsaber Proficiency for Force drain +1 and +3 to power in battle. Meditation adds a battle destiny and +3 to your weapon destiny total on the turns following its deployment. Whether you go with the Junkyard and Credits or Tosche Station for activation, you should be able to set-up a powerful Jedi first turn. The rest of the deck can be just about anything. You can play a regular Mains & Toys strategy with battling Interrupts, SAC, and a mixture of ground and space. You can just set up the Jedi and make the rest of the deck space. You can do a beatdown with Luke + Jedi Presence + Courage of a Skywalker since you will already have a Jedi deployed on table. The possibilities are almost endless. There are more cards that play on Tatooine than any other planet in the game, so when you build a CP (V8), you can go many different routes. The Moisture Farm can be set-up with Owen & Beru Combo to play Harvest. Tatooine Celebration can provide constant retrieval. Even alien based decks can be played around CP (V8) although the Agents In The Court objective is usually preferred since Yarna (V8) can pull any Tatooine Location.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit really changed the popularity of playing CP (V8) with Tatooine. The original design allowed you to play with more options for sites as well as start the game with 4 Effects. Players are choosing to play the Agents In the Court objective for all Tatooine based decks since it can pull any Tatooine location with Yarna (V8). In the current game environment, the only build you will see with Tatooine CP (V8) is the NON-Hyperdrive version. The only other option sets up Beggers Canyon with Luke (V10). This Luke is a built-in Hidden Base requiring the DS to pay 1 Force to either draw a card or retrieve a Force while he pilots a T-16 alone at the canyon. He adds a destiny while piloting the T-16 as well as downloads any T-16 once per game. A good strategy starts the City Outskirts with system and canyon. You set up Luke and a Jedi at each site and then put a Wrist Comlink on Luke, which allows your characters or vehicles at adjacent sites to move as a React. If the DS goes after Luke (V10), you can protect him with Mace (V9) or any Jedi set-up at the Outskirts. A new rule called Heroic applies to a few characters and starships. This rule says that any character that is Heroic must be targeted by weapons first before any other card. Players set up R2-D2 (V3) at the adjacent site (since he says Heroic in his lore). If you put him with See-Threepio (V8) who says R2 may not be targeted by weapons, the DS is TOTALLY prevented from targeting anyone since the Heroic rules require the Heroic character to be hit before any other character. If more players start using this to protect sites from battle, it might get changed but for now this rule is just waiting for someone to break it.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Tatooine CP (V8) can be a very powerful deck. It can be a hard deck to beat if the DS is unable to stop the damage from the Junkyard or kill Luke (V8) at Beggars Canyon. I have only listed a few ideas with Tatooine. Since there are something like 22 different Tatooine sites, there is no telling what awesome deck is waiting to be built by someone. Once a good deck is discovered, other players will build different variants of the same basic idea. There are still MANY ideas that no one has tried with Tatooine CP (V8). It may not be as solid as Agents but you still have different options.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The main reason not to pay Tatooine CP (V8) is because almost every good strategy ends up better if built around Agents In The Court. Since Yarna (V8) can pull ANY Tatooine location, you have no limit to what you might want to do with that objective. It may not be as quick as CP (V8) starting two different sites over the two sites that Agents requires. The game is very fast now, so most strategies that you would be able to set up wont be doing damage or be open for DS beatdown. At the moment, the LS has few options for what can win. So there is no specific reason to play on this planet over another since you still play with the same Jedi.  <br />

03 * Hoth/EBO w/ Careful Planning (V8)  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: 3rd or 4th Marker (Starting location), Hoth system, Hoth: Shields <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Echo Base Operations, A New Secret Base, Strike Planning, General Rieekan (V4), Tigaro (V4), Echo sites, X-wings, matching starfighters, Luke Skywalker (V1), Commander Luke (V4), Organized Attack, Hoth Sentry  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: For as long as the Hoth set has existed, the LS has been playing the Hoth: Shields and Echo Base Operations. The Shield Rules say while the Hoth: Shield site is on the table, the DS has to deploy to the outer-most Marker (usually the 4th) and march in. This makes it very difficult to set up a beatdown against the LS. EBO plays on the Main Power Generators [MPGs] once you control three Echo sites. Once in play, this Effect says that at all systems your Force drains are +2, your starships deploy -1, and your total power is +3. In the beginning, EBO could take a very long time to deploy since you had to draw new cards in your hand to set it up. EBO was never an overly popular strategy since it took so long to set up. Then A New Secret Base came out in the Third Anthology to completely reawakening the EBO strategy. This Effect deploys on the MPGs as well and allows you to take into hand any two Echo sites, a site & Effect with Echo in title, or any 2 LS icon battleground system. It doesnt require the search to happen during a specific phase, so you can always search for the next card you need before you activate. With just one card, the LS can find everything needed to play EBO by turn 3. All you need is the characters to control the sites. In the early days, players would play with many different low deploy characters to make sure to get out as early as possible. There was no way to search for ANSB, so it had to be started in order to set up the EBO deck. When the game changed and expanded to being able to start 3 Effects, the popularity of this style of EBO went away. It returned as new Virtual cards opened up new ideas for design. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: After years and years of different cards being designed for the game, CP (V8) has finally created a way for EBO to be set up by turn 1. The best way to set this up is by making the 3rd or 2nd Marker your starting location. Then you deploy the system, and your 1 icon site is the Hoth: Main Power Generators. Since the Shield Rules require you to have the 4th Marker on table you can go in your Reserve and deploy it as well. So you start the game with four locations on table. This gives you six for activation + whatever the DS provides. Your starting Effects should be Insurrection Combo, Strike Planning, and A New Secret Base. CP (V8) lets you start all three. In order to get out EBO first turn, you have to get either the EBO Effect or one of the four Echo sites in your opening hand (cant be docking bay). Your first action will be to take two more Echo sites or site and Effect depending on your opening hand. The easiest way to set up the characters for EBO is by starting Strike Planning to pull two Generals (usually Rieekan (V4) and McQuarrie since they both deploy for just 2 Force or Mon Mothma(V9) to pull a system). Rieekan (V4) can pull any card during your deploy phase that has Hoth in the game text or ANSB. Rieekans first search is Tigran Jamiro (V4) because he deploys for FREE to Datooine, Yavin 4, or Hoth. Each character goes to a different Echo site then EBO is deployed to the 1st Marker. In order for the DS to cancel the Effect, they have to occupy five Hoth locations. Since they have to march in through the Shields, it will take a long to time reach the most interior Echo sites. The rest of the game is spent pulling systems and getting your space out for drains of 3 to 5 at each system. The majority choose to play with X-Wings. You can spread out and use evasion Interrupts like Barrier, Hit & Run, Alternatives to Fighting, and Hyper Escape to keep the DS from causing beatdown. ANSB prevents you from playing S-Foils but you can still set up Incom Corporation to add power +1 and ability 2 pilots to all X-Wings. Combined with Organized Attack, each X-Wing is power 5 and deploys for 1 and is immune to attrition. Plus you add the +3 to total power from EBO. Any DS deck that plays little space will lose to this deck since it can now set up HUGE drains by turn 2 or 3.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Funny thing is EBO wasnt put in the 1st Edition of this document to begin with, so this section doesnt really apply since the entire listing is different. I really dont know why it was left out but never-the-less, it wasnt listed. This entry is complete and should provide all players with an excellent idea for how EBO can be set-up in todays environment. While EBO is the main and most popular strategy, Hoth CP (V8) is not only limited to just an EBO strategy. You also have the option of doing just sites, without ever deploying the Hoth Shields. Since the Speeders objective limits you to only one T-47 Battle Formation a game, you can build a Hoth CP (V8) that can play multiple T-74 BFs a game. It can be more effective than the direct damage from the Speeders Objective since the DS has Imperial Decree (V6). And it would not be affected by the DS playing the Ice Plains. If you start the 3rd Marker and 2nd Marker as the two sites with CP (V8), you can use Mon Mothma (V9) with Strike Planning to find the 4th Marker. Each drain with T-47 BF at those three sites would be 10 a turn. All Snowspeeders and Rogue Speeders React on Hoth, so you can set up Commander Luke (V4) on Rogue 1 at the 3rd Maker, then set up non-uniques at the other two. Should the DS come calling, you can set up Ice Storm to make them missing. One under-played card is Frostbite (non-V) which says each player must lose 1 Force for each character at Exterior Hoth sites under Nighttime Conditions (lose 2 if Missing). The majority of DS decks only play with Blizzard 4 as a vehicle. If you play with Heroic Sacrifice (V4), they will be losing Force to keep Blizzard 4 in play. If they dont want to come after you on Hoth, you have HUGE drains all game. This idea is new, so you would have a great eliminate of surprise. Plus, since you play all three marker sites, you have a better chance against Walkers over the regular EBO strategy.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: EBO can be very hard to beat once it is setup. The damage can get so high so fast that you end up losing before you even know what is going on. EBO destroys many DS decks that focus on the ground; Huntdown, BHBM, Watto, Combat, MKOS, and Court can all have problems. The CP (V8) version gives you the option of also playing with Menace Fades. It is important to set up some form of ground so you can drain for free against Battle Plan/Battle Order. Since you are playing on Hoth, the best option is always Commander Luke (V4) and Rogue 1. If you add Wedge, RSL you would be canceling a battle destiny and drawing two yourself. If you play Echo Base Garrison, you can pull Commander Luke (V4) and make all matching Rogue immune to attrition <6. Since you have to play the Echo Med Lab (V4) for EBO anyway, you can add a 2-1B (V4) which is pulled by the Lab to put any Lost character at same or related sites in used pile once per turn. You can cycle Luke back into your deck and replay him all over again during your turn. The 4th Marker is your battleground and outermost Marker, so you can easily play Ice Storm against attacking DS characters. The majority of the time the DS will never come to Hoth, so you will have Menace Fades and free drains all game. Hoth Sentry can be a great edition to this deck because you already play with General McQuarrie who doubles all the Sentry modifiers and applies all three at once. The Sentry with McQuarrie makes opponents EVERYTHING deploy +2, requires total +2 ability for battle destiny, and power +2. Unless the DS deck has enough ways to get around Ice Storm and survive a battle against Luke in his speeder, they will not be coming to Hoth, so you can drain for Free and have Menace Fades going all game.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: While EBO can auto beat many DS decks, it also has problems with specific DS strategies. The worst match-up will always be Walkers. Since the majority of card slots go for setting up EBO and space, you dont have enough ground to hold off the DS from blowing your Shields. When they are blown away, you lose 8 Force, and the ability to play both EBO and ANSB.  Some Hoth decks use Echo Base Sensors against this match-up to slow the Walkers down. Any version of EBO has to play with Commander Luke (V4) and Rogue 1 so you have some aspect of defense against Walkers. EBO also deploys A LOT of cards. At any given point, you could have 25+ cards on the table. This means you dont have as many cards to lose from drains and damage. It requires a lot of thought when deciding what to deploy because it can be very easy to OVER deploy with EBO. When this idea was created, the DS didnt have much of a space package to counter the drain bonus of EBO. Since the current meta plays decks like SYCFA and Senate, the DS is no longer as weak in space. EBO can be beat very easily if it cant stay alive in space.  <br />

04 * Naboo w/ Careful Planning (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Naboo: Theed Palace Core (Starting Location), Naboo system, Naboo: Underwater Entrance <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Jedi, Entrenchment (V9), Wokling (V4), Launching the Assualt, Home One, Quick Draw (V9), Sai Tor (V1), SAC <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Many probably have no idea about this deck. It has never been posted as a top tier deck. Since it has never been played at a major tournament, the strategy for this deck still remains hidden. This was the deck that Team TN worked on before Worlds 06. Two of us even played it in the Team Tournament (which we won). It has a lot of awesome things going for it. The reason we stopped playing it was because it gave up too much Force. Just like LS Combat, you give the DS 4 icons on their first turn. Plus, since you start the system, you give them a place to start deploying their ships. The reason this deck was built was because if you start Wokling (V4), you activate 8 Force from JUST your cards. So in every game you play, you will always have enough Force to deploy Mace Windu(V9) first turn. The strategy of the deck works like this. You get a Jedi + Stick to the Core (preferably Mace (V9) since he gets two swings). You use Wokling (V4) to pull Entrenchment (V9) and deploy it to the Core. The Core says any hit characters of ability < 5 go to Used pile. The Entrenchment (V9) says you ALWAYS get the first weapons phase action plus all your characters are defense value +1. This means Mace (V9), Yoda, or Qui-Gon become defense value 8. Since you always get the first weapon phase action, you will always be able to send a threatening character to used pile (Fett, IG-88, 4-Lom, Snoova) OR just hit Mara, Vader, Sidious, or Maul since they are the ONLY DS attacking characters with ability higher than 5. You might see The Emperor (V6) there but if they dont do it first turn, it isnt giog to happen. Yoda + Stick also makes a good character for this combo since he auto hits anyone in defensive battles. In space, you have the option of starting Launching The Assault on Naboo as one of your three Effects. This card adds +1 to Force drains there and lets you pull Home One once per game. This is literally the ONLY deck which has the ability to deploy Home One on your very first turn. Since you already get 8, if the DS gives you 2 or 3 + a few pulls from Thrown Back/Drop (V8), you would have the 12 required to get Home One out. Of course, the most common strategy is to set up ground first, then space second. The rest of the deck is all mains and toys playing all the Jedi, SAC[Sense, Alter, Control], and red tricks. The space is very basic usually Home One, Bright Hope (V5) x2, and Tantive IV (V7). Some choose to play with Han, Chewie, & Falcon for added staying power. While still other versionss play Chewie, Engraged for setting up huge ground beatdowns with Jedi Presence. For added activation, you can play 2x Wesa Gotta Grand Army which pulls Boss Nasss Chamber and the Battle Plains. In most games, once you set up, if the DS leaves you alone, you can set up the Plains with another Jedi and do some heavy drains. It is a nice place to drain mid-late game with another Jedi. The Plains dont have to be used in this deck though. <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The reason this decks wins is because you set up as fast with ANY Jedi you happen to draw in hand. The Core + Entrenchment (V9) is literally THE most powerful LS location when you have a Jedi + Stick set up there. It is almost impossible for the DS to knock you off the Core with you ALWAYS getting the first weapons phase. SAC is used to defend the Entrenchment (V9) as well as get around a possible Hidden Weapons, Sniper Combo, or You Are Beaten. You also set up in space very easily without having to use a lot of card slots. This deck can play like TRMs with you reacting to what the DS is doing while also doing steady damage all game. You always start Wokling (V4) and either Quick Draw (V9) or SaiTorr Kal Fas(V1) to pull sticks. The third Effect can be totally based on what you are playing against. If they play Senate or Watto, you start Scrambled Transmission (V5). If they seem like they will try to do a free Executor, start The Professor (V9). Versus Combat, you start Civil Disorder (V6) (you also could use this versus Senate but doesnt do as much since you give them so much Force). Anything else, you just start Launching The Assault. The cool part is should you have to start something else instead of Launching The Assault, you can still pull it with Wokling (V4) should you draw the Entrenchment (V9) in your opening hand.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: This deck is a totally brand new idea since the Re Edit created Entrenchment (V9). The strategy didnt exist in 05 to have a chance of being posted in the first edition. This section doesnt apply for this specific deck.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This deck can be built many different ways. Once you set up your Jedi, the rest of the deck can be just about anything. You can play Jedi Presence + Courage of a Skywalker beatdown with Luke. Since you start draining for 3 so quickly, the DS will be coming after you (unless they have a way of cancelling the drain). Since you will already have the Jedi in play, you can easily set up beatdowns with Rebel Barriers or Nabrun Leids. You can start Rycar Ryjerd(V3) for pulling Lightsaber Proficiency, Bionic Hand (V6), Mercenary Armor (cancels Imperial Barrier and adds +3 to power) etc. If you play the 6 destiny Jedi Luke, if he has stick + Bionic (V6) + LPro or Merc Armor, he would be power 13. Courage adds ability to power, so he becomes power 19. Then you double it with Jedi Presence, so Luke becomes power 36!!!! If Chewie, Enraged is also there, you would get another 18 to power. So if you get Mace, Luke, and Chewie in battle, that would be total power of 60 BEFORE destiny with just 3 characters. This combo has won me more games for LS than ANY other LS strategy to date. And it doesnt have to be played in ONLY this deck. As a mains and toys platform, Naboo CP (V8) can be very very solid. This is a deck that can provide HUGE amounts of activation for you from the very beginning of the game. The original design of Careful Planning (V8) allowed for many different types of decks to activation 7 to 9 on their own. Now this one is the only one left. This makes it worth playing. Having the ability to ALWAYS deploy Mace on your first turn means this deck can disrupt some DS strategies very early. This was one of the reasons the LS was stronger before the Re Edit since there were many LS decks that could deploy any Jedi first turn.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest reason to stay away from this deck is the starting of 4 icons for the DS. Since they will always go first against this deck, it can really hurt giving them so much extra Force to set up their strategy. If someone knows what you are playing, they can go after the Naboo system very quickly and begin draining there. DS Senate does this better than any DS deck. It will take a whole turn of Force to get out Home One, so you leave yourself open if you have a small hand or need to fortify the ground. DS Combat is this decks WORST match-up. You have to make sure you play BOTH the Affect Mind (V2) defensive shield and Civil Disorder (V6) to have a hope of winning the game. Since the Generator Core is your starting location, they will convert yours. This means you can be drained there for 5 from Lord Mauls double-bladed stick. It is very important to draw up a few turns to make sure you have enough SAC to win the battles. Combat will be playing Barriers and Stunning Leaders to prevent you from fighting. Since DS Combat is not very popular right now, this deck can be a valid choice but make sure you practice to know how to counteract the different DS strategies.  <br />

05 * Endor w/ Careful Planning (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Endor: Rebel Landing Site (Starting Location), Endor system, Endor: Ewok Village <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Scout Luke (V9), General Solo (V9), Mon Mothma (V9), Endor: Back Door, Thats One (V9), I Wonder Who They Found (V9), Count Me In (V9), Strike Planning, General Madine  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: This deck was created right after Virtual Set 9 created the back door Effects that were originally BROKEN by all accounts. The power of those cards made this deck very very popular as a LS strategy. The original Scout Luke (V9) deployed for FREE on Endor, so he alone made it worth playing this deck. General Solo (V9) could pull ALL the Back Door Effects as well as the Back Door site. Most of the time Mon Mothma (V9) would pull the site leaving Solo open to pull one of the Effects. After the Redux and Re Edit, this entire deck idea changed. All the Back Door Effects were dumbed down to the point of being almost a waste of a card slot. The change to Careful Planning (V8) changed the starting sites. Now you have to play the Ewok Village or docking bay. The rest of the deck can set up the same way with Strike Planning pulling both Mothma and Solo to set up the deck. From there, you just play mains and toys with Jedi, red tricks, and normal LS fun times.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The deck used to be broken with each Back Door Effect providing a special ability. They can still have an affect on the game but are much more limited. All of them can be placed Out of Play to do something where before they were just Lost or Used. I Wonder Who They Found (V9) can cancel a targeting, Thats One (V9) can cancel a battle at Chewies site, and Count Me In (V9) can cancel a Force Drain at a related site. None of them can make or break a game anymore. The strategy for this deck is not very powerful when you can play with Tatooine or Naboo and do much more.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: The Re Edit changing everything about the deck and virtual set 11 put the nail in the coffin. The #1 reason players are not playing this deck is because of Endor Shield (V11). The LS has been able to play Strike Planning since the Endor set was released. All this time, the LS could play the Endor system as a battleground system that acted like a twix location with Strike Planning preventing the DS from activating the icons while not playing Endor Ops. The CP (V8) version made this strategy that much better since you could set up 3 locations and only give up 2 icons to start the game. Endor Shield (V11) is basically a Strike Planning for DS, so if you come up against a DS deck that plays it, you will not be activating from your icons at Endor either. Your starting locations will then only provide you 3 icons over the original 5. You would not have enough Force to play both Mothma and Solo on your first turn, so the set-up for the deck is gone. If someone wants to play Endor CP (V8), they will have to design a totally new strategy over just mains and toys. It might be possible to create a trooper deck with the new Faithful Service (V12) which says ALL your scout warriors are now Troopers. So you can play the non-unique Endor: Forests which require additional +1 Landspeed to move (like deserts) unless your character is a Scout (like Jawas). Many DS decks only play Blizzard 4 as their vehicles, so you might be able to play a heavy Scout trooper version that battles and drains on Endor. Then the Troopers can be placed back in the deck with Faithful Service (V12) the last moment before the DS loses the game. This one card means you dont have to worry about over deploying troopers since no matter what happens they will be going back into your deck the moment the last DS cards is lost.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: At the moment, I dont have a good reason to play this deck over another LS strategy. There have been no proven decks with Endor CP (V8) since the Re Edit, so I am unable to provide a very good strategy for playing this deck in tournaments. This is one of those decks that will require more original ideas from deck builders in order to see more action.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: There is no reason to play this deck right now. Endor Shield (V11) is literally being played by more than half the DS decks out right now. So the odds of having minimal activation on your first few turns are very high. Plus there are many other planets that can do much more with different aspects of the game. Endor went from being one of the strongest options to play, to being as bad as it used to be before any Virtual cards were made to help it. Perhaps as more players try to create new strategies for this deck a new strategy will be found. For now, if you are not someone who builds their own deck from scratch, stay away!!!! <br />

06 * It Is The Future You See (V12)  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: ANY One (NON-Coruscant or Special Edition) location <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: MWYHL, Luke (V11), Tatooine: Slave Quarters, Twixes, Revolution <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: It Is The Future You See (V12) has completely opened up a new deck design for LS by creating a new way for the LS to go first over starting the Yavin 4: Throne Room. Just like TRMs, you only get one location to start the game. And it cant be a Coruscant or Special Edition location. This is probably because they didnt want Hidden Base getting to go first and they didnt want you to be able to start the Coruscant: Jedi Council Chamber since that would have been the most popular choice. The Epic Event is started in place of a Starting Interrupt. From there, it says you are required to start Battle Plain and Do or Do Not plus ANY third Effect that is immune to Alter. Of course all players should be playing the combo versions of both Battle Plain and Do or Do not. The card goes on to say that no insert cards may be played. So even though you lose the ability to start two Effects of any kind, you start the game with 3 shields already in play. From there you have yet another decision to make, whether or not to be a Jedi or An Agent of Evil. By choosing Jedi, you keep the Epic Event on your side and for the rest of the game may stack cards from hand on top of the Epic Event by paying X Force where X is the number of cards stacked. You may then use the stacked cards in place of Force by turning them over. At the beginning of your turn, they turn back over to be used again. What this does is provide you constant Force to use all game. So you are no longer affected by DS cards that can manipulate your Force pile and attempt to leave you weak to First Strike beatdowns. Should you decide to choose the Agent of Evil route, you may immediately take any Luke and any 1 site into hand. The Epic Event then deploys on opponents side of table adding +3 to the DS total battle and duel destinies. With so many different options for both Jedi and Agent of Evil strategies, IITFYS (V12) has no end to the possible deck designs.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This card has only been out a few months and in that time there have been a few very solid options for this deck. The main build is of course MWYHL since this Epic Event used to be a Jedi Test. You can now play a training MWYHL and go first, so you start training before the DS even has a turn. The Epic Event also provides you extra Force for setting up faster. This new card can be very powerful with Dagobah since you can play 2x Stone Pile to remove two random cards from opponents hand. There are currently three ways you can play through Dagobah. You can do MWYHL and do training from just 1 all the way to 6 and basically play a regular MWYHL strategy with a different start since you cant start the same 3 Effects. If you dont want to train, you can just use the MWYHL set up for activation and play any other strategy. Some choose to start just Dagobah without the objective so your characters can retrieve on Dagobah. You lose the protection from SAC and the auto pulling of SOS, Yoda, and Daughter, but gain more options for setting up on Dagobah like the old days. The third idea is to just start Yodas Hut and play the deck like TRMs with just twix sites. Since you can pull any Luke and any site with Agents of Evil, the most popular choice has been Luke (V11) and Beggars Canyon. Because you can go first, you are able to set up the Luke (V11) on your first turn every game. His text works like Hidden Base saying while he pilots alone at a Beggars Canyon, the DS must pay 1 Force to draw a card or retrieve a Force. The most common strategy with this is to start Rycar (V2) and set up Meditation and Im With You Too (V9). The Meditation gives you another battle destiny, while IWYT (V9) says you can lose 3 Force to cancel a battle destiny. There is no limit to how many destinies you can cancel per turn, so the DS will never be able to kill Luke with attrition. If you combine this with MWYHL and training, you will be retrieving the 3 Force you lost with each completed Jedi Test. If you dont want to worry about training, you can start ANY Tatooine site to be adjacent to the Canyon. If you give Luke a Wrist Comlink with Rycar Ryjerd(V2), the characters set up on the adjacent site may move as a React to any battles at the Canyon. The most popular site for this strategy is the Slave Quarters since it is a twix site that can pull Shmi Skywalker once per game. She can pull Threepio, With Parts Showing, so you would have his text going from turn 1 as well.  Combine this deck with Revolution on the DS locations for more Force Choke. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: This is another deck that didnt exist the first time around. Moving on. <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Currently, this is by far the freshest idea to hit SWCCG in YEARS. For the first time ever, the LS have another option for going first in the game. The odds of playing a game where the LS goes first is not higher than it was before. Going first can have a HUGE affect on the out come of the game. Your stuff gets in play before your opponent. You will drain first on average before the DS when you go first since they have to choose rather to continue setting up their decks initial strategy or stopping yours. The LS is all about running away and reacting to the stronger more powerful DS. So they can play the game differently going second versus a DS deck that goes second. TRMs has been such a powerful option for the majority of the game because of the ability to go first in the game. SO, we now have a card that has created a completely new way to go first. You now have SOOOO many options. Even though the DS is stronger right now, this new Epic Event has just started to become a new idea. There is no telling what new deck is still waiting to become a top tier option for LS. Because this is the newest option, you have more reason to try this strategy out than any other. The surprise factor is the easiest way to beat a great player because they dont know exactly what your deck is doing. They might lose a card to a drain that could have made a difference simply because they didnt know what the deck does. For now, the only strategy I have has been listed but please feel free to create some new ideas combine strategies from other decks. It is possible this new idea will become the new TRMs.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The main reason not to play this deck is because it is somewhat unproven. If you are a player that requires experience with a specific strategy in order to make it work, then you might not be ready for this. The LS doesnt have as many options for decks that can constantly defeat everything. This deck does lose the ability to start two specific Effects, which can be a problem when you need the third Effect for a counter card like Scrambled Transmission (V5), Civil Disorder (V6), etc. It is way too soon to say tell which DS decks give this strategy trouble. From my own experience, SYCFA Fear continues to be its worst match-up since you almost never play with Alter having to start Do or Do Not. And most decks that have been built with this Epic Event are not based around space, so you will have a hard time dealing with all those Destroyers. I am sure as time goes on that this Epic Event will open up many new powerful strategies for LS. For now, it might be a good idea to play around with some ideas before going to a major tournament.  <br />

Dark Side: <br />
Non-Objective decks: <br />
 <br />
 <br />
01 * Tatooine w/ Combat Readiness (V8) (Scum) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Location(s): Tatooine: Jabbas Palace (Starting Location), Tatooine system, Jabbas Palace: Dungeon <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Jabba the Hutt (V8), Hutt Bounty (V8), Power of the Hutt, Jabbas Influence (V6), None Shall Pass (V8), Imperial Barrier, Ellis, Tatooine Maul, Bounty Hunters  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: DS Tatooine CR (V8) will always be known as Scum. This amazing strategy started when the original V8 Combat Readiness (V8) allowed you to start the system, Palace, and AC to start the game. Then with added help from V8 Effects and characters, the broken Scum deck was born. The combination of these cards made this DS option more powerful than any other DS strategy at the time. Much like the Back Door Effects for LS, many of the original V8 cards that made this deck too powerful were changed in the Redux and Re Edit of the Virtual sets. The most powerful cards were Hutts Bounty (V8), Jabba the Hutt (V8) and Jabbas Space Cruiser (V8). The worst of them being Hutts Bounty (V8) because it provided the deck with extra activation, +1 bonus to total battle destiny, and the ability to reduce ANY characters power to 0 once per turn at the same site as a Gangster which was the most powerful part of the card. The Gangster didnt even have to be in the battle to hurt the LS character. There was no way around this card short of playing Alter.  The problem was that the card could be redeployed next turn with All Wrapped Up (V8) pulling any card with Bounty in title. The deck itself was a perfect machine and provided all the necessary mechanics for playing against just about any LS deck. It could even give the broken virtual WYS (V8) deck a run for its money back when that strategy was going strong. The deck gets its name from one of its most important cards, Scum and Villainy.  That card made 90% of the characters deploy -1 and let you retrieve 2 Force whenever you initiated battle. The Re Edit changed all of the broken cards from Scum. Jabba no longer doubles all aliens present, just one non-maintenance alien present. As a bonus, he can pull Scum & Villainy once per turn rather than once per game. Hutt Bounty (V8) can no longer be pulled by All Wrapped Up (V8) and must deploy on Jabba himself, so you cant pull it with Crossfire (V9) either. It still adds +1 to total battle destiny but only adds the activation bonus to Jabbas Palace sites you occupy, and only non-Jedi characters may be made Power zero. Plus it only works at Jabbas site and not for any Gangster. While Jabbas Space Cruiser (V8) was also a very powerful card, it was not altered in the Redux. The PC changed the rule on capital ships being able to deploy without a pilot. So you couldnt just deploy it with Power Of The Hutt for it to sit there until you add the right characters or the defensive cards.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Scum will always be a powerful option for DS because it uses the same tools the other DS alien based objectives use to win games. All of the new Virtual cards for aliens can benefit this deck. There are several reasons that the non-objective Scum can be a better choice over just playing Court Of The Vile Gangster, Black Sun, MKOS, or CCT aliens. Since you can start the game with both the system and Jabbas Palace on table, you never have to worry about defending sites outside of the Palace. The start of the game is always the same. Get out Jabba the Hutt (V8) to the Audience Chamber, set up S&V, maybe add Ephant Mon with Power of the Hutt, and wait. The following turns have you setting up aliens at different Jabbas Palace sites to both drain and cause direct damage with Tatooine Occupation. Unlike other DS alien decks, this one plays ONLY Jabbas Palace sites. They use None Shall Pass (V8) to prevent any LS character (other than Leia) from deploying to a JP site. Combine that with Imperial Barriers and the LS can have a lot of trouble invading the Palace. The original version usually played the Palace, Audience Chamber, and Lower Passages (all Jabbas Palace battlegrounds that provided two icons). The new CR (V8) only lets you have 5 total icons to start the game, so if you want to stay set up within Jabbas Palace, you have to play the Dungeon, Rancor Pit, or Entrance. The Dungeon makes the best option since you already capture with Boba Fett (V8), IG-88 with Gun, Snoova with Axe, or Hidden Weapons. Just like all DS aliens decks based on Tatooine, you should always use Gailid to the AC to add +1 to Force drains at all JP sites. Once set up, the deck can win two ways; either by sitting back causing damage or by battling and causing overflow. The deck greatly relies on S&V + Jabba staying in play to win. While this might seem simple for the LS to thwart, the LS has to be playing the counters for getting into the Palace without being weak to either beatdown or capture. Since the change of Hutt Bounty (V8), this is not as hard as it was when Mace, Obi, or Qui-Gon could be made power 0.  <br />
 <br />
What Change Since 1st Edition: Much like WYS (V8), this was probably the deck that had the biggest change from its original design. Besides the cards mentioned previously, the deck also took a hit with Jabbas Influence (V6) being changed. The original version made ALL bounty hunters power +2 and allowed the DS player to deploy any non-bounty hunter alien from Reserve Deck ONCE PER TURN while Jabba was on table. The Re Edit changed the card to provide power +1 to bounty hunters, and the once per turn was changed to once per game. Since the change to the original version made it so you couldnt pull aliens every turn any more, the speed beatdown aspect of the deck changed. Despite the changes, there are more than a few players that are totally in love with Scum and continue to play it even today. The new versions still start Jabbas Influence (V6), Power of the Hutt, and a random third Effect. While the previous version always started All Wrapped Up (V8) to pull Hutt Bounty (V8), the new version will start Crossfire (V9) to pull either Occupation for damage or Security Precautions (V4) for additional activation while also getting around Goo Nee Tay. The basic idea remains the same, set up Jabba with your aliens to fight LS. Scum will always be a very interactive deck because it has the ability to go after every LS deck that plays ground characters. It also usually leaves characters on table for the LS to battle.  The space remains the same with the Space Cruiser (V8) leading the pack, supported by Mist Hunter (V5), Mauls Ship, and either Punishing One (V5) or Hounds Tooth (V5) depending on the player. Tatooine Maul has become standard in most Scum decks since he doesnt suspend S&V while he is piloting in space.  He also provides the deck the option of playing SAC for adding protection.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This new design of CR (V8) Scum is still being played today. Many still find the overall strategy around the Jabbas Palace sites to be one of the best options for DS. While Mace (V9) can always be a problem if he is able to deploy to the AC, the majority of games played will see the LS trying to do their own strategy. Scum works best if it can be on the offensive side of the game. If the LS is able to constantly pressure the AC with characters, Scum will usually have a much harder game. Any LS deck that has a specific strategy can be hard pressed against Scum. The DS can set up good activation after the first turn and they still have Power of the Hutt to pull characters. Plus if you dont play with SAC or counters for None Shall Pass (V8), the LS can waste turns of Force by trying to deploy to the Palace sites. No Bargain can be a good card that adds +2 to deploy of Rebels while no Imperials are at Palace sites. If you also play Bad Feeling Have I, Jedi Luke would cost 12 Force, then goes to the bottom of Force pile from None Shall Pass (V8). The Re Edit did change how broken Scum used to be but the basic strategy around DS aliens can still be very very powerful. The Re Edit also removed the problem decks that Scum used to have troubles with. TRMs was the worst match-up since their whole strategy was to disrupt the DS strategy. While you will still see TRMs being played, the deck is not as popular since the creation of Wipe Them Out, All of Them (V12). Still the DS player has to actually play the card to see any benefit from it.  Virtual WYS (V8) could also beat Scum and it no longer even exists as a playable deck. While the LS continues to be the weaker side right now, any DS alien based platform will have a good chance of winning. Should you decide to give Scum a try, there are TONS of posted versions currently on Decktech.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Scum can be beat. While it was almost impossible to beat it before, this new version is by no means unbeatable. The biggest weaknesses will always be the space because they dont play the deck to battle in space but on the ground. Just like all DS alien decks, they play enough to stay alive in space to drain for free and keep the LS space package on edge. Decks like Hidden Base Quads can win once the entire space package has been lost, you wont have Occupation and will be forced to pay to both drain and retrieve cards all game. Scum can lose to MWYHL is it is not able to cause enough damage fast enough before the LS is ready to come after them. The Asteroid version of MWYHL can be hard for Scum to beat since they are able to cause damage all game and none of the DS ships will survive the fields with some tracking. Scum always has to worry about TRMs since all TRMs does is battle and go to the Palace constantly the whole game. Scum can also have trouble with the new AITC Obi deck or D!ck Hat. Since Obi starts the game already in play, he is already set up to disrupt the aliens. While you can still win games with this deck, the DS has more powerful options that have fewer bad match-ups. Although nothing I could ever say about this deck would make some players stop playing it.  <br />

02 * Bespin w/ Combat Readiness (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Location(s): Any Bespin battleground site (Starting Location), Bespin system, Cloud City: Security Tower, Docking Bay, or Dining Hall <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Executor, Lando (V6), They Must Never Again Leave This City, Tractor Beams, Overloads, AT-ATs, Endor Shield (V11).  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Bespin CR (V8) was another deck that took a big hit with the Re Edit. One of the strongest things going for DS was the ability to start Bespin, Cloud City, and another 2 icon site. When you played the Weather Vane (V6), your total activation from just your cards was 9!!! The original CR (V8) also let you start 4 Effects, so you could start with Were the Bait (V6) (for pulling Free Executor Effect They Must Never Again Leave This City), Mob Points Combo, Vane (V6), and another random Effect. Since you activated so much Force, it was very easy to set up Maul, Executor, and even Lando (V6) first turn. In most games, the LS just deploys stuff to set up and doesnt battle, so you could always get a card stacked on Firepower (V6) or retrieve the CR (V8) to play in the game. The best strategy going for this set up was getting either EPP Maul or Maul YA + Stick to the Cloud City: Chasm. For those that dont know, the Chasm text says ANY hit character is Immediately relocated to the Weather Vane (V6). The Vane (V6) said any new character coming to the Vane causes 1 Force loss. At the beginning of each players Control Phase, any character on the Vane would have to relocate to any Cloud City site. If a bounty hunter was on Cloud City, that character is immediately captured. Capturing can only happen by the DS so it never mattered if Maul got hit because he was just relocated back to the Chasm on the DS players next turn. Since Maul gets two swings it was very easy to send multiple characters to the Vane. It was impossible for the LS to beatdown Maul as long as he was able to constantly hit the characters trying to come after him. This idea was a very solid strategy for DS because it was VERY fast and made it difficult for the LS to defeat Maul at the Chasm. The Re Edit completely changed the possibility for this deck. Were The Bait (V6) was changed to no longer be immune to Alter, so the purpose of playing the card was lost. The card can still pull any card with Bespin or Cloud City in lore or game text but since you are not able to start it, the point of playing the card is almost gone. To make it at least helpful, the new version also cancels Its A Trap. The Weather Vane (V6) no longer causes 1 Force loss when characters are placed there. The rest of the deck is pretty much the same. The biggest change was with CR (V8) which no longer starts 4 Effects and was changed to no longer be able to start Cloud City. Since you cant start the Sector, there is no point in playing the rest of the deck. So with one swift stroke, the deck lost the activation, Vane (V6) power, and easy setup of the Free Executor like CCT. Besides the Vane (V6) version of Bespin CR (V8), the other design came from a speed version of Dark Deal. Since you could still do the same thing as the Vane version by starting the system, sector, and site, it was very easy to play a deck that could set up Dark Deal by turn 1 if you got the right cards. Since the Re Edit has changed how this deck can be played, the popularity of using Bespin with CR (V8) has dropped greatly.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Much like Endor CP (V8) for LS, this deck went from being VERY strong to almost not being played. Currently the only version being played, that I know of, is completely space based. Your goal is to still set up the Free Executor. This time your starting sites are the Lower Corridor because it is -1 Force drain and the Security Tower. You still start Mob Points Combo, Dreaded Imperial Starfleet (V9), and Endor Shield (V11). In order to have a chance of deploying the Executor first turn, you have to play 2 to 3 copies of TMNALTC and 3x We Must Accelerate Our Plans. You still pull the Executor with Mob Points, so in most games you should be able to have the Executor in play no later than turn two. You always pull Lando (V6) with the Tower before you activate. If you dont draw either card to play the Executor, use a search of your Reserve Deck for something and see if one of them ended up in your Force pile. If so, just draw up until you have it. Once the Executor is in play, you get Lando (V6) and Captain Bewil (V6) on the Executor. From there you set up a Tractor Beam and Deflector Shield Generator (V4) on the Executor with Levitation Attack (V6). The Endor Shield (V11) is there to pull Admiral Chirneau and Thrawn creating the super Executor. This doesnt have the damage the SYCFA Fear does but it does have other things going for it. Instead of using many Star Destroyers or a strategy based around the Death Star, this deck can use those extra card slots for more tricks. The main strategy for this deck is beatdown. You use a combination of In Range, Theyve Shutdown the Main Reactor, and Lateral Damage to create HUGE beatdowns against the LS. The vast majority of LS decks have no counters for Tractor Beams, so once they decide to deploy to space to either stop your drains or drain for free them, you set up the kill. For example, the LS deploys Bright Hope (V5) and Tantive IV (V7), very very common these days. If the Executor is in range, you can move in front of them after deploying a few more Star Destroyers and playing Lateral Damage targeting Tantive IV (V7). Then they have their turn. Sometime before their battle phase you play Theyve Shut Down the Main Reactor on Tantive IV (V7) to prevent it from moving and applying ability for drawing battle destiny. From here, the LS has ONE turn to fortify the two ships. They might have a Houjix or maybe they just deploy a bunch of ships to be forfeit. In any case, the LS will almost never battle you. Since they are unable to move the Tantive IV (V7), they are stuck waiting for the next turn. On the following turn, you can deploy even more stuff and battle. You play In Range to capture the Bright Hope (V5) if they didnt deploy stuff to Tantive IV (V7). Once you capture Bright Hope (V5), Tantive IV (V7) will be left to the wolves with no destiny, no power and no forfeit. So they will lose WHATEVER your total power is. GG if they dont have a Houjix. Nothing you set up with this deck is all that hard, its just different from the standard DS deck you might see.  <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: As mentioned earlier, this deck changed completely with the Re Edit. It can be said that Bespin CR (V8) is seen less often than even Endor CP (V8). All the previously popular ideas around any viable Bespin CR (V8) no longer seem to exist. Only new ideas like the one posted in the previous section are seen. This entire deck entry could be considered a change from the original. All I can say is it was nice while it lasted. As far as other options for playing this deck, the most recent has come from Im Sorry (V12), which can pull Clouds from Reserve to set up on any system. If you want to try and set this up without using the Dark Deal Objective, there might be a solid strategy out there. Im Sorry (V12) also pulls any Obsidian Squadron TIE, so you now have an Effect to set up a new strategy in the Clouds. If you play a similar setup with the battleground site and Security Tower, you would have a battleground site for draining for free plus a non-battleground site for putting the Tibanna Gas Miner, which adds +1 to Force drains at each Cloud sector. The Clouds have the power to set up huge drains very quickly. They also restrict deployment of Capital ships (unless the state they can deploy like starfighters), so your TIEs are safe from more than half the most popular LS starships being played today. This deck could still play the Free Executor or you could just use matching ships and Combat Response. One idea could set up Exterior Cloud City sites, then play AT-STs which React. You can set up Bespin Occupation on the system and do HUGE damage all game on multiple sites. You would have heavy drains + direct damage of 2 from Occupation and 1 from Im Sorry (V12).  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The new Cloud idea may be the best option for Bespin CR (V8). The Clouds themselves have created a whole new problem for LS to deal with since they can only deploy starfighters, which can easily be shot down with SFS Laser Cannons on Tie Interceptors. You will also see Tallon Roll from regular TIE LNs. For years in the early days, Clouds had been very strong and hard to defend against.  Since the game became so much faster, they were not seen since there was no way to search them out. Since Im Sorry (V12) can finally search for both the Clouds and TIEs to deploy to the Clouds, there is no telling how popular this new strategy will become. Both the Cloud City and Special Edition sets have created multiple cards that benefit or provide bonuses to the Clouds. An entire deck type can be built around Bespin CR (V8) and Im Sorry (V12). You can even build a new speed Dark Deal with those two cards. The original speed Dark Deal had to find the TIEs either with Combat Response for flashing matching ship/pilot or other cards that could pull TIEs. Now you still play the same strategy as before with ways to pull Cloud City sites, only you dont have to use as many card slots for the TIEs. It is possible a new speed Dark Deal will become popular as more players learn the strategy of these new cards. There have been many popular Im Sorry (V12) versions of this deck posted on Decktech. <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Although the Clouds strategy has become a new option, Bespin CR (V8) has become just another option for a DS deck type. There is nothing about the deck that is just plain amazing like it was before. Some still choose to go with the Bespin Dark Deal Objective for setting up Cloud City sector over the new CR (V8) version described here. Much like the LS Endor CP (V8) deck, this one just isnt as good as it used to be. While you might see a random strategy come up, the popularity is just not there anymore. For the time being, keep your eyes open for how powerful the Cloud version might become. Until then, there might be more powerful choices for DS that would have a better chance of winning against more types of LS decks. Also, any deck that plays Clouds is going to deploy a good amount of cards to the table, so make sure you can set up big damage fast or you can get beat by LS decks that start dealing out damage quickly.  <br />

03 * Hoth w/ Combat Readiness (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Hoth: 3rd Marker (Starting Location), Hoth system, another 1 icon Hoth site  <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Walkers, General Veers (V4), Veers (V10), Endor Shield (V11), Walker Garrison, Outflank (V9), Sunsdown, Whipids, JQuille (V8)  <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Hoth CR (V8) has never been that popular as one of the set-ups for CR (V8). While there are many different strategies that can be played on Hoth, the other systems like Tatooine have seen more action. Since the creation of CR (V8), there have been two different ways to go when playing on Hoth. The main one is around Walkers since the Objective now only allows you to play Walker Garrison once per game. If you designed a deck around CR (V8), then you could play Walker Garrison as many times as you want in one game. Before the Re Edit changed CR (V8), you would start the Ice Plains and Mountains, thus allowing you to start You May Start Your Landing. This Effect can only be deployed if the Ice Plains (5th Marker) are already on table. Starting the Hoth: Warroom is a solution but seems to not be the best choice.  The decked works much better being able to start the game with YMSYL because it pulls the 3rd Marker and one Walker Garrison already. Since you are able to play both Walker Garrison all game and Rebel Base Occupation, the need for YMSYL is not as important. The cool thing is you can still play with it in the deck for added direct damage once you set up. The easiest way to set up Walker Garrison quickly is by starting the 3rd Marker, 6th Marker (Mountains), then pull the docking bay with either IAO Combo or Ket Maliss (V3). If Veers (V10) is set up on a different site from the Mountains, each non-unique 2-player AT-AT would deploy for 2 each to the Mountains. The best set up would be to have General Veers (V4) on Blizzard 2 (V4) at the docking bay. Then you get a non-unique AT-AT to each of the other sites. You protect all the sites with Outflank (V9), which is better than Barrier. The reason you want Veers at the docking bay over the 3rd Marker is because you have to keep the ground battleground going for Occupation, plus if they play Optimism (V11), it doesnt take away the larger drain. If you dont want to play with Imperials, the other option for Hoth CR (V8) is a deck built around Whipids. This deck was better then Jabba the Hutt (V8) doubled all aliens and not just one. Whipids are power +2 when on Hoth and forfeit +2 from JQuille (V8). This deck can be found under my Decktech page but its not the same deck without Jabba.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The best option for this deck is Walkers. It can win because it has so many different ways to cause damage. Besides the drains from Walker Garrison, you have 2 to 4 in direct damage from Rebel Base Occupation (depending on how many battlegrounds you have), and 3 to 5 in direct damage from YMSYL. From there you can play Frostbite with Sunsdown to cause more direct damage. Some tricks with this deck come from two cards that you never see being played. Exposure is a great card for Hoth CR (V8) because it can remove opponents characters present at your exterior sites while you have Nighttime Conditions going. You dont have to draw destiny, just use X Force, where X equals the total number of characters present (including your own, but yours should all be protected on Walkers). This happens during your Control phase, so you can clear out ALL the sites then hit them with a Walker Garrison. Another option is He Hasnt Come Back which can make any alone character at a Marker site missing if you draw destiny +3 > their ability. Not too hard to set up with Outflank (V9) being a Used 6 destiny Interrupt. Plus you always have Trample to abuse with ANY Walker based deck. This strategy is very basic when you think about it. Just like the Walker Objective, this deck plays the same way every game. Only you no longer have to worry about having to blow the shields. Even though you lose the 8 in direct damage from the shields getting blown away, just one drain from Walker Garrison can be just as bad, and there is NO limit to how many Garrisons you could play. If you work in some retrieval, then you would have the ability to play it every turn while you occupy the required sites with AT-ATs. The space for this type of deck can be very very basic. The DS can use Maul + Cloaking Ship to keep presence in space all game to drain for free. Unless the LS plays starships weapons and SATM Combo, they will not be able to ever knock Maul out of space. Your whole deck can be entirely ground based. Then you play 2x Tat Maul and 2x Ship. If you want Maul set up really fast, you can play 3x of each, and start Combat Response. The impact of virtual set 13 with the new AT-AT: Deployment Platform (V13) is not known yet.  The complete immunity to attrition this site adds to non-unique At-Ats seems like it is made to be fit into this deck. <br />
 <br />
What Change Since 1st Edition: Even though Hoth CR (V8) wasnt posted in the 1st Edition of this document, this deck did change greatly from its original design. As mentioned earlier, you could play two very different types of decks based on Hoth with CR (V8). The Redux and Re Edit changed so many different cards that both decks are completely different now. While most of the changes were good for the game, I dont see anything broken about being able to start the Ice Plains with the system and another site. It did make sense to limit how much activation and Effects could be started but there was nothing broken about this Hoth deck. You were even limited to just two Effects when you were starting the Ice Plains and Mountains together. This deck was getting to be pretty good before it was completely taken away. In my own opinion, I believe the original CR (V8) had more options for design. It was broken getting to start 4 Effects and being able to set up huge activation to start the game, but there was no limit to the combination of locations. Now you always have to start a battleground site in order to play this card. I dont believe the card had to be designed this way. This deck had just become a decent option for DS with Endor Shield (V11). Now we will never know. <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: Even though there is some strategies that can be based around Hoth CR (V8), no one has been brave enough to post a deck around it. There are clearly some good possibilities but they stay hidden to the masses. For surprise factor alone, this deck could be a very good option for DS. It would be possible to set up very quickly.  You would only have to worry about the Main Power Generators when playing against Speeders or EBO, and the majority of games you will have the advantage on Hoth. With any Hoth based deck, the LS could face any number of problems. Besides the already mentioned Sunsdown, going missing, and direct damage, the DS also has Wampas with Krayt Dragon Bones (V4). The virtual Wampa (V4) is ferocity 5 + destiny with KDB. Then they get another +2 if One Arm (V4) is also on table. Considering the highest power character for LS is Chewie Enraged at power 9, you have a good chance of eating just about any character you want. Even Mace (V9) and Qui-Gon can be eaten since you would already be one higher than their printed power before you ever drew destiny. Creatures may take a hit because of the new Advanced Rules on creatures but the impact of the new creature rules remains to be seen.  Sando Aqua Monster is a great card for this deck because you can set up destinies for anything that cant be canceled. Until someone decides to start playing with this strategy, no one will ever know how amazing a DS deck based around CR (V8) could be.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Yet another DS strategy that is unproven. So many players these days only play decks with a proven track record, decks that have been tested and designed by someone else. They use decks that have been taken to a few events and posted on Decktech. Just because this deck is a new idea doesnt mean it cant win. It just means the players as a whole have little experience against it. This is one of those decks that should be played by those who know how to play it. If you want a deck that is already proven, then stay away from this one. Make sure you playtest any new idea before taking it to a major tournament. This decks main weakness is space since the main version only places with Maul like the ISB drop and drain deck. Should you come up against a fast Hidden Base or EBO, you will have a hard game. Unlike regular Walkers, this deck can usually beat Hidden Base because you can easily get two full turns of Walker Garrison in before they have even flipped. Plus you are playing multiples of Maul + Ship, so you should be able to stay alive in space long enough to finish them off. If you fear EBO, make sure to pack at least one purple Epic Event card to blow the shields and at least one AT-AT Cannon (V4). If you cant blow the shields, you will not be able to handle the large EBO drains. Remember to do your best to never leave a random non-unique AT-AT alone without either a Ghhhk or Outflank (V9). Mechanical Failure can mean auto loss if you get caught sleeping. Other than that, there is just no out right bad match-up for this deck. Hopefully there will be someone out there who gives this deck a try.  <br />

04 * Naboo w/ Combat Readiness (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Naboo: Theed Core (Starting Location), Naboo system, Naboo: Theed Palace Hallway or Swamp <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Maul with Stick or Maul YA, Blaster Rack (V1), Force Field, Ket Maliss (V3), Battle Plains, AAT Tanks, Battle Droids <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Naboo CR (V8) is another deck that no one has really seen before. This deck is an incomplete idea that I have been playing around with over the past year. The cool thing is even after the Re Edit, this deck can still be set up the same way it was before only losing the 4th Effect to start the game. There has not been a DS Naboo deck with CR (V8) that was posted to Decktech. The idea for this deck came from wanting to find a way to use Maul Young Apprentice in a deck besides the Bespin CR (V8) Vane (V6) deck. The original version started the game with Security Precautions (V4), so you activated 9 all by yourself just like the Bespin deck. After the Re Edit, SP (V4) now requires you to occupy the site in order for the Effect to stay in play. Since you can still start the same locations with the post Re Edit CR (V8), the deck requires you to start Crossfire (V9) to pull the SP (V4). The basic strategy for the deck is simple. Set up Maul YA with Double-bladed stick at the Core. Just like the LS, you can send any character with ability <5 to used pile when hit. Since Maul gets two swings, it can be very easy to knock any LS character off the site. The reason you want Maul YA is because he adds +1 to each swing when targeting a Jedi. Any hit Jedi Master then become power -3. So if Mace (V9) or Qui-Gon come calling, you not only make them forfeit 0 but power 3. You can easily set up overflow with Crossfire (V9) and Maul Strikes adding battle destinies. Since you are playing Mauls Double stick, you can drain for +2. Once you set up at the system, you can set up the Admirals Order Fighter Cover, which adds another +1 to each of your weapons destinies at related sites from system you occupy. Since you lost the 4th starting Effect, your start can be Blaster Rack (V1), Combat Response, and either Crossfire (V9) for pulling SP (V4) OR you could play Ket Maliss (V3) to pull Dannik Jerriko. The original version would start all 4, and tried to place the lost characters out of play. The main reason to play Ket Maliss (V3) is because you can pull cheap deploy characters to protect Maul at the Core. Since Maul YA is immune to Clash of Sabers, the LS can never battle the Core without Maul being involved unless they can hit him first and play SATM Combo. By adding scrubs to Mauls site, you add forfeit for any attrition and a waste of swing should the LS target one of them since they just go back in Used pile. Then you just re-pull them next turn. Dannik Jerriko (non-V) can be a great edition. This card lets you put any just lost character in battle at same site out of play for just 1 Force. The character goes underneath Dannik, so if he is killed or placed in Used pile, he loses those characters, but they stay out of play. The (V3) version of him lets you place ANY card from opponents lost pile out of play for 1 Force but you have to win the battle. The (non-V) doesnt require you to win the battle. So the LS has a choice, go after Maul with a weapon or Jerriko.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: Naboo CR (V8) can win because it can set up very fast with the starting activation of 7. It is very easy to set up the ground first turn with Maul and then space with a matching ship second turn. You spend the rest of the game defending the two locations while you drain for 6+ all game. Fighter Cover also makes your starfighers power +3 when armed with a weapon. Since Maul holds the Core, the best option for space is Baron Soontir Fel on Saber 1 with a SFS Laser Cannon. In the previous version I played, the deck played Mist Hunter (V5) and Slave I (V7). This deck used Boba Fett (non-V) from Cloud City because he adds +2 to maneuver. The ship adds +2 to manuever, so he is a base manuever of 8. The deck played 2 to 3 Short Range Combos to set up space fast. Since he can deploy for free as a react, it was nice surprising the attacking LS with an addition 7 power, +8 in destiny that cant be canceled or modified since it wasnt drawn from Reserve. At the time, this deck had problems with the Endor Mains deck playing the Back Door Effects. Since there is no more Endor Mains deck, there is a good chance this deck could be an excellent option for DS. Just like the LS Naboo deck, the Core with loaded Maul is almost impossible to defeat. Most players find this out the hard way since they always think they can go after Maul. Once you have the AO set up, you only need to draw two 2s to hit Mace. Once Bane Malar (V7) is in place, there is no way the LS can do anything to the Core drain besides reducing the drain to 1 with Lets Keep A Little Optimism Here(V11). The deck must play SAC to keep Optimism (V11) away from Maul. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: Besides the 4th Effect and change to SP (V4), this deck didnt change at all. The entire strategy that was there from the beginning still exists. As mentioned above, this deck is going to be very new to many of you reading it right now. If you dont want to worry about the Ket Maliss (V3) stuff, you can try another option for this deck. Since you are able to start the Theed Palace Hallway, you can once per game deploy any battle droid. There are many that can help this deck. There are two unique battle droids add +4 to the deploy cost of either Jedi or Smugglers. Another battle droid can reduce forfeit value and another allows you to place ANY card from opponents Reserve deck out of play by losing 2 Force if you just verified the deck. For this text to work the droid has to be present with another battle droid. If you get just one in your opening hand, you can easily set up two droids by pulling the one you need from the Hallway text. Since you are playing with droids, you can play Droid Shutdown to protect them from being targeted by anything that turn. The Hallway is Force drain -1 for LS, so it makes the best option for your third starting site. The original CR (V8) gave you more options. For those that dont believe in the Core idea, the other option for DS with Naboo CR (V8) is building a deck around the AAT Tanks. Endor Shield (V11) can pull the Commander battle droids, so you can easily set up the AAT Tanks with the required pilots. The idea behind this deck is the same as the Core version only you start the Battle Plains instead. You still give up 5 icons and lose one yourself, but you gain the broken power of the tanks. While Tanks can be played in many different platforms, the Battle Plains is the best possible option since they are each power +2. While the Core text is very powerful, once you set up two AAT Tanks at one site, there is no way the LS is coming after you without help from Savrip or Quick Draw (V9).  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: The main reason to play this deck is because it is totally new. No one will be expecting this deck at a local tournament. Since you activate so much Force so early, you can easily set up very fast and start dealing out damage. Since Maul is your main option for ground, the rest of the deck can be just about anything. If you dont want to use matching ships, you can also play Motti (V2) and Star Destroyers. Motti (V2) says each Destroyers is power +5 if armed with a weapon. If you use Heavy Turbolaser Batteries, you get another +2 to power. So each Destroyers is power +7. If you set up power 20+ at any system, the LS is going to leave you alone. This gives you a solid hold of both the system and Core for Battle Plan and Firepower (V6). Once the LS figures out they cant handle you at either location, they will have to try their own strategy in order to win. This can be a great match-up for TRMs since you are never choked on Force and already have an advantage by the LS having to come to your locations in order to win. The deck can play Stunning Leader, Imperial Barriers, Force Fields, You Are Beaten, etc to keep the LS on the defensive all game. While this deck is not being played right now, it can be a very solid and different choice for DS.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The biggest reason to not play this deck is the start. Just like the LS Naboo deck, this one gives up a lot of icons to the LS to start the game. While the LS gives up 4 icons, the DS gives up 5!!!! Of course there are many DS decks that have given up that many icons to the LS after their first turn of play. So it isnt that big of a deal unless you are playing against TRMs. Even though you can beat TRMs, they will get the first turn, so depending on their deck, they can easily deploy to your Core first turn. Once you are set up though, it will not be easy for any LS deck to defeat you at the Core. The whole deck is built around the Core and space. The other reason not to play this deck is the fact that it is a new idea. This is not the best option for a player looking for a proven strategy to play at a major tournament. Whether you use the Core or Plains, both versions are up in the air. While I have had very good success around this strategy, there is not much else I can add about its ability to win in the current environment. For the time being feel free to try out the aspects of this deck with friends and wait until you feel comfortable playing it.  <br />

05 * Endor w/ Combat Readiness (V8) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Locations: Endor: Any Battleground site (Starting Location), Endor system, another 1 icon Endor site.  <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Mains, AT-STs, Scouts, Bikers, Aratech Corporation (V9), Back Door, Bunker <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: Endor CR (V8) is another DS strategy that is not all that popular. While there were a few versions that were played when CR (V8) was first released, the popularity of Endor with CR (V8) is all but gone. The main reason for this is the LS constantly playing Strike Planning to take way the activation from the Endor system. The Re Edit took away the ability to start two 2 icon sites for DS. Now you have to start either the Endor: docking bay, bunker, or non-unique Forest. If you happen to play against a LS deck that starts Strike Planning, your starting activation goes from 5 to just 3. The lack of activation in the current environment makes this deck very unpopular. With the game constantly changing and more deck types being created all the time, DS players are choosing to play other options that can set up faster and keep steady activation all game. Endor CR (V8) just doesnt do this as well anymore. There are some interesting aspects around Endor for DS, the more powerful strategies are based around Tatooine, Hoth, or Bespin. If the DS does choose to set up around Endor, it will usually always be with the Endor Ops Objective since it gets around Strike Planning and does more to set up a strategy on Endor. The most you can do is play with AT-STs or Biker Scouts at multiple sites since they can React. The virtual cards that help Endor based decks dont really do much for a basic CR (V8) deck. The majority help the Objective.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: This is one of those DS decks that I am not as confident about since there is nothing special going on with it. If there was going to be a deck built around it, the best option would be a mains & toys platform with EPPs, SAC, fun red cards, and AT-ATs to set up and drain on Endor. There are three sites on Endor that can drain for 2 each; Back Door, Dark Forest, and Forest Clearing. The original CR (V8) would start two of them. This deck played A Dark Time For The Rebellion (V4) and used both the Hoth: Wampa Cave and the Dagobah: Cave for additional activation. The strategy was based around a DS TRMs style by reacting to the LS strategy and attempting to disrupte it. At the time, it did pretty well since the CR (V8) idea was still new. A few versions were even posted on Decktech. When the original Scum deck was created, the majority turned to DS aliens leaving the idea around Endor forgotten. Today, this is not being played as a DS option. While I normally have some excellent strategy for each deck, this one is lacking. In time, there should be more ideas that come out of this type of deck. Maybe if a virtual card that can prevent Strike Planning from cancelling your icons, then this deck would open up more. <br />
 <br />
What Changed Since 1st Edition: This is yet another deck that really didnt exist during the 1st Edition of this document. There was no real strategy section for this deck in the last Edition, so there is nothing to write as far as it changing. If anything, the deck got Endor Shield (V11) to pull stuff and set up that much faster. Endor Shield (V11) is one of those cards that would be in 99% of all Endor CR (V8) based decks.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This is currently one of those decks you should be staying away from. There are a few ideas that can be used to at least make the deck viable to win games. One idea would be to use Location, Location, Location (V5) to pull all the non-unique Forests. Then you set up Emperor with Overseeing It Personally to drain +1 at each site you have an Imperial present. If you put a Scout at each Forest, they can move, while the majority of LS characters would require +1 landspeed. Outflank (V9) can be used very well in this deck to protect the characters spread out at each site. The majority of decks are going to be ground based. Regular Endor CR (V8) would not usually be the best option for a DS space based deck unless you would trying to hold the battleground site to drain for free. With all the different aspects to the game, ALL the other planets currently have more going for them. Tatooine, Hoth, and Bespin can all win more constantly over any deck based around Endor. Even the Endor Operations Objective is not as proven as the other platforms. Until new options arise, it would be wise to look at one of the other DS decks listed here.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: Endor provides the DS with Scouts and another place to use Walkers. The problem is there just arent any really powerful red cards that can benefit the DS at Endor versus another planet. Endor has no Occupation card for direct damage. No Decree for getting around drains. No Ice Storm or Sandwhirl for making characters missing. All DS alien based deck happen around other planets. If you do go with Endor, it is all Imperial based. Imperial Domination (V4) makes sense with this deck type. For the time being keep your eye out for any new ideas for playing this deck. It will stay un-played while the potential of your opponent playing with Strike Planning is high and your activation remains at just 3 total from your three locations.  <br />

06 * Imperial Council  <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Starting Location: SYCFA Objective OR Death Star: Conference Room and Orb Mandell <br />
 <br />
Popular Cards to Look For: Death Star sites, Imperials, Bounty Hunters, There Is No Try Combo (V12), Blown Clear (V12), Crush the Rebellion (V12), Laser Gate (V12) <br />
 <br />
Idea Behind Design: The Imperial Council is the newest deck idea for the DS created by the PC. The DS got this strategy rather than a brand new Objective to equal out the two sides since the LS currently has one extra Objective to play with. The PC created a few specific virtual cards that combine to form a totally new strategy. The idea is to set up specific Imperial characters to the Death Star: Conference Room to build up Influence. The whole deck works around There Is No Try & Oppressive Reinforcement (V12). This card deploys on the Conference Room and creates the entire strategy around the Imperial Council. It says you may NOT deploy ANY Episode I icon cards and no aliens (except Bounty Hunters & Mara Jade). This means no P-59, no Sidious, and of course no Maul. Your Starting Effect is in play to start the game before this card, so you can still use them but thats it. From this setup, TINT Combo (V12) makes the Emperor and all Moffs, Generals, and Admirals into Imperial Council Members who each have Influence +1. For each member present at the Council, you gain an additional DS Force Icon, (this is not a bonus in activation, but an additional icon sort of like a Jedi Master). During each Control phase, you can use 2 Force to take into hand any Imperial Council Member, Laser Gate, or Political Effect (PE). It goes on to say your cards may be played from your PEs and any PE that is canceled goes to Used pile. Since TINT Combo was used to do all of this, you will have to play SAC or multiple Controls to protect your red stuff. Virtual Imperials were released in V11 and V12 for this specific strategy. The first character was Sim Aloo (V11), who adds a battle destiny at the Council. Officer Evax (V12), Janus (V12), and Colonel Wullf Yularen (V12) followed Sim in the next set. The four of them each have printed Influence of 1 or 2, then get the additional +1 from TINT Combo. Once you set up the Imperial at the Council, your total number of Influence is used to apply different aspects to the game. Each of the new Virtual Imperial Council Members can do a specific thing based around the total number of Influence you have. Much like regular Senate, this strategy places cards on the PEs. Currently there are two PEs that were made for Imperial Council; Blown Clear (V12) and Crush the Rebellion (V12). Both do the exact same thing except that one works in space and the other on the ground. Basically you deploy an Imperial Council Member with the required text onto one of the PEs. While this Imperial is on the PE, you may target one character or starship in battle to be power and forfeit X where X equals the total number of Influence you have at the Council. This aspect alone provides you an automatic form of beatdown against lone characters or starships. When you add the new abilities of each Imperial Council Member, this deck could become a new powerhouse for DS.  <br />
 <br />
How It Can Win: The idea for this deck is completely brand new. So much so that no one has mentioned playing with it or what the best build would be for a deck. In creating the cards for the Imperial Council, the PC designed a new Starting Interrupt to set up all the cards needed. Imperial Code Cylinder (V12) lets you start the game with Ord Mantell and the Death Star: War Room on table. You may then start TINT and two more Effects (cant be You Cannot Hide Forever or Endor Shield). While this does get both the Conference Room and TINT Effect in play to start the game, it doesnt give you much for activation and prevents you from playing Endor Shield (V11) (which auto pulls two Imperial Council Members). Even though the PC took the time to create a Starting Interrupt for setting up this new strategy, they didnt prevent the DS player from using the SYCFA Objective. Since SYCFA can pull ANY card with Death Star in title, you can get the Conference Room in play on your first turn the same way. Plus you dont take ANY battle damage on the Death Star. Also, because you are playing the Objective you are not prevented from starting Endor Shield (V11). Since the TINI Combo deploys on a location, you can start Crossfire (V9) to take it into hand to start the game. Considering the fact that you would be activating 5 through SYCFA over just 3 from the Starting Interrupt, it makes way more sense to set up the Imperial Council around SYCFA. The only reason you would want to use the Starting Interrupt is because you dont have the docking bay in play for the LS to deploy to and move over. Once you deployed Tarkin (V3), the LS would be prevented from deploying any spies or Jar Jar to all Death Star sites. If you also have Imperial Arrest Order in play, there would be no possible way for the LS to ever deploy or move to the Conference Room unless they played their own Death Star docking bay. While it might turn out later to work better with the Starting Interrupt, I see no reason to not use SYCFA since you never take battle damage. You can also set up a Laser Gate (V12) in between the Conference Room and another interior Death Star site to cause the opponent to lose 1 Force to move a character through the Gate. Once you decide how you want to set up this deck, from there you have to decide how the deck will play out. Because you can still play with Bounty Hunters, there are many different possibilities. You cannot play with Maul, so your only powerful ground character is going to be Vader or EPP Mara. It would make sense to play the stronger ground based Bounty Hunters to go after the LS Jedi. Snoova would be a good choice since he is just as powerful as Vader and has the ability to easily capture any character. If you decide to play SYCFA, you would put the Death Star: Detention Block in between the docking bay and Conference Room as a place to put the characters you capture.  <br />

What Changed Since 1st Edition: Of course this didnt exist at the time of the first Edition of this document, so I am using this section to provide more possible ideas for Imperial Council. There are many possibilities for your space package. You could even play a combination of both Imperial and Bounty Hunter matching ships. Much like other DS strategies, the matching ships can be a very solid way to both beatdown and hold presence in space. Since you have Blown Clear (V12) to reduce the power and forfeit of a starship, you can play Lateral Damage to hurt two different LS ships in battle. The majority of the time, the LS will only have 2 to 3 ships at one system, so you would have the advantage if you decided to build a space based strategy. It could be as simple as just using Victory Class Destroyers with weapons, so you can play Theyve Shut Down the Main Reactor to prevent ships from moving and drawing battle destiny. It would even be possible to build a SYCFA Fear deck around the Imperial Council. Since this is a completely new idea, there is really no telling what could be built from it. As long as the main deck builders are still playing their favorite decks, no one will be playing this strategy.  Player have to decide to do some playtesting around the different aspects of the deck to discover its uses. By the time there is a 3rd Edition of this Encyclopedia, there will be much more to write about the Imperial Council.  <br />
 <br />
Why I SHOULD Play It: This is a great deck for playing something REALLY new. Not just an idea based around older ideas but a completely original strategy for DS. Almost every aspect of Imperial Council is new and the abilities of the PEs make it worth a look. For now, I dont have a great deck idea for how this strategy should be played. It will take players throwing some ideas together to see where it goes. Anyone who decides to play this deck in a tournament will be putting the LS opponent in a new situation. No one is prepared for what you might be playing with this deck. So you have a huge chance of the opponent making mistakes; deploying cards without knowing what to expect or losing cards too early that may have made a difference. The key will be to playtest your idea against the popular LS decks. If it does well, then you might have a new powerful DS deck that no one has any experience with. When the original virtual WYS (V8) was brand new, no one knew how to play against it and lost because they made mistakes by trying to take over Corellia. This deck could turn out to be just as strong as soon as someone decides to play around with it. Will you be the next player to design a broken deck for SWCCG?? This deck is probably your best bet. Dont be afraid to give it a try while the strategy is still brand new.  <br />
 <br />
Why NOT to Play It: The same reason to stay away from the other new ideas posted in this article. Imperial Council is completely and totally unproven. There is no standard build from which to alter and no one has been playing it at major tournaments. While this is still un-tested, it may not be the best choice if you are trying to qualify for Worlds or play in a big tournament. Unless you feel like you have found something strong, it would be wise to go with something you might be more familiar with. As time passes, I see this strategy becoming very very popular. There might even be a broken build for the deck already out there that no one has thought of. Do you feel lucky??  <br />

FINALLY!!!! You have reached the END of this article. As you can see, this one was much MUCH LARGER than the first one. It was a lot of fun going through each deck and trying to decide what to write about. As I mentioned in the beginning, there was no way to list out EVERY possible idea or strategy for every deck. All I can do is update and add information based on my own experience and from speaking with players. You should find a majority of incorrect information has been corrected or deleted completely. While I know some decks have better strategy than others, you should find that every single entry has something that can be used to build a solid version to play in tournaments. I hope everyone got something from the time I spent putting this together.  <br />
