<br />
Here is a 4 part series of blog posts from my PC blog.  The series talks about learning to play swccg at a high performance level.  Hopefully each and every one of you can learn something from reading this, just as I did from writing it.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
Installment #1: How &quot;To Learn&quot;<br />
<br />
This article is the first in a series of articles that will describe various aspects of learning swccg. Probably, they will be far different than other articles you have read before that only focus on the technical aspect of the game (ie. learning to track, build decks, play a specific decktype, etc). In other words, the key phrase will change from &quot;to learn how to [insert technique here]&quot; to a simpler one that is much harder to master: &quot;to learn&quot;.<br />
<br />
A key aspect of an important message is the authority attributed to its speaker. So, you may ask, &quot;Who are you Mr. Throdo?&quot; (And it might be with a scoff!). Well, you are right in either case to ask such a pointed question. And undoubtedly my answer will not suffice. I am not a World Champion. I am not a State Champion. Surely I do not have as much experience as some of you. On the other hand, I have done a large amount of reading about different gaming professionals (mostly chess professionals) and believe that I have garnered a lot of useful information from them. Furthermore I have tried to be a student of this game, learning its ins and outs and applying them in practice. These article installments will hopefully be a successful combination of all my experiences and knowledge in order to achieve the goal of successfully writing how to learn to excell at swccg. Now, for those of you who want &quot;to learn&quot;, listen! I am writing this information in order, first of all, to quicken and further my own swccg learning. Why am I sharing it with all of you, especially when I don&#39;t know how exactly it will turn out? I have no clue! With that said, lets get started.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, one definition: what is &quot;to learn&quot;? Well of course, the process of achieving excellence in swccg. Some of what I say though will not only apply to this game, but instead to all learning.<br />
<br />
Second, two questions: why should we pursue excellence? and what lets top players be better than those who want to be top players? These questions are not easy, and I believe their full answers to be entwined and hopefully partly explained by the following discussion. An obvious answer to the former question though must be that we would pursue excellence because we enjoy the process and result of learning.<br />
<br />
So, what is the process of &quot;to learn&quot;? Here I must explain two possible mindsets. Both are available to us on our journey of learning. 1. &quot;I am just bad at math!&quot; 2. &quot;I do not understand this math, but I can try hard and succeed!&quot; The first attributes both success and failure to their unalterable natural ability (&quot;I am bad at math, but good at science, so its okay to do poorly on my math tests as long as science is okay!&quot;). The second believes that with hard work they can improve in any area of learning, to move from novice to master. Their favorite swccg card must be The Circle is Now Complete!<br />
<br />
The point of bringing up these two mindsets is to lay a foundation of belief that a student of the game can learn and improve. Of course, natural ability does play its role, but the key mistake with the first mindset is that natural ability cannot be changed, or in other words the one with a better natural ability will always win. With this I vehemently disagree! Capablanca, a great chess master and a child prodigy who was astounding his countrymen as young as 5 years old, was not dethroned from his World Champion Chair by a different child prodigy who had done the same thing at 4 years old. No no! Instead he was beaten by the great Alekhine, who was a mediocre player until his late 20s! Is that conclusive research? No. But I bet you can deal with it.<br />
<br />
Someone who believes that hard work can overcome great challenge is much more resilient in battle than one of the other mind. The first responds by trying to master a hard problem, while the second responds with a feeling of helplessness. Is it a conscious descision in either case? Not in full, but it is only consciously that such descisions can be improved upon. Another benefit to having a mastery mindset is that when faced with the inevitable short-term loss you will have greater chances of continuing well. You will understand a concrete reason to why you lost that tournament game and will believe that with hard work you can later improve in a similar situation. Compare that to the belief that it was hopeless and you will never be able to beat &quot;Player X&quot; or &quot;Deck Y&quot;. If someone of this helpless mindset suffered a loss, psychologically they would be much more poorly affected than one of a mastery mindset when the next tournament game was to start. A person with the mastery mindset will be much less affected by the psychology of the moment than one of a helpless mindset.<br />
<br />
Here is the key to all I have said: &quot;to learn&quot; it is of the utmost importance to embrace a long term commitment to achieving excellence despite momentary failures. Speedbumps do not hurt a car with a good driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
To end this discussion, I would like to apply it directly to one part of SWCCG. To what must we attribute our tournament failures?<br />
<br />
Just last weekend there was a four player swccg tournament in Hollywood. Will Smith, Matt Damon, and Denzel Washington invited me to play (thanks guys!) and even payed for my plane ticket (how nice). Little did I know they had all been secretly studying up on this fun little game! Arn&#39;t they supposed to be busy making movies anyway? So I thought, &quot;Wow this will be a breeze&quot; and I brought my trusty decks Iggy and goldenrodhat! Well let me tell you what, hanging out with them was way cool, but I totally lost. Like EVERY GAME. What is up with that yo?!?!!1 It was total roshambo. I mean every pairing was wack. For real. Check out the decks I had to face: Will Smith&#39;s I Am Legendary Starfighter, Matt Damon&#39;s Bourne 4: The Bourne Invasion, and Denzel&#39;s Court of the American Gangster! If only I had brought some different trusty decks then they would have got owned. I mean it would have been devastation!!<br />
<br />
Now obviously, deck matchups are a reality in swccg. But should anyone be able to say that they deserved to win a tournament they lost when they were the ones who chose which decks they played? I mean, if I can&#39;t win against 3 hollywood stars, what should I attribute it to? That I suck? Or should it be that I did not work hard enough and that the quality of the work I did was not high enough? I think that this last bit is the truth. The best players will be able to work through the rock, paper, scissors roshambo to understand what decks have the least bad and the most good matchups and then make a qualified deck choice from them based on their understanding of the meta.<br />
<br />
And so, with that we are left with one last question: how do we do this thing called &quot;to learn&quot; in order that it will be done correctly and with the most benefit to us in the long run? The foundation for this is laid; hard work can improve our game. So please, check back and look for my next installment regarding goals and results.<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
Installment #2: Results<br />
<br />
Here is the second instalment of my blog series regarding how to learn to achieve excellence in swccg. If you missed the first, skip down to its post below and check it out! In it we laid a foundation for hard work based upon a healthy mindset and saw some of the psychological helps that it will bring. The current discussion now moves into the area of results: their importance and how to deal with them. And by results I am talking about tournament results!<br />
<br />
So, how important are our results? Some would say, they are not important at all, especially if you had a good time and met some cool people while you were achieving them. In a way, that is correct. But not in this discussion. Remember our goal: to achieve excellence in swccg. With that as a premise, results can become very important. The only thing of importance even. But are they really all that matter? No.<br />
<br />
Consider the following example from my own life. When I was playing this game in its early years, I rarely lost. My decks were much better and I would play much better than all of my opponents. But who were they? Just some local scrubs. Never did I challenge myself in real tournaments (although this was because there were none where I lived). Would you say that since my results were excellent that I had achieved excellence at swccg? Maybe you would. But I wouldn&#39;t. Possibly I had achieved excellence at &quot;bad card swccg&quot;, but that is not truely the game we play.<br />
<br />
What I have learned since then is that results cannot be all that matter in achieving excellence. Instead, we must learn to balance our short-term successes (and set-backs!) with a corrent long-term process of learning. And therein lies the key to my failure in the above example. I had the constant short-term successes, but I was not dedicated to a long-term learning process to achieve true excellence in swccg. If I had been, I would have sought out harder opponents to challenge me technically and psychologically.<br />
<br />
So what then, actually is a result? If I win (or come in last in) a tournament does it mean anything within that kind of long-term outlook or is it worthless? To this I would say that these results are meaningful. First of all, its fun to participate and especially do well in tournaments! That cannot be stressed enough. Secondly, a tournament placing is a good evaluation of where a player currently stands in regards to his achieving the kind of excellence we are describing. And with that lies a key implication, that results are transient. Fleeting. Changing. One day, if I am #1, then I am only #1 for a day. It takes constant work, hard work, to continue to excell. Take for example the New England Patriots. 16-0 record! What do you think they did after they had won 15. Or after they had secured first place in their division. Or after their first win, when they could have said &quot;Ohhh look at us we&#39;re undefeated!&quot;. Did they throw a week long party to celebrate? No. Instead, they enjoyed the victory for a short while, and quickly got to work, looking ahead to their next opponent.<br />
<br />
Here is the key: we must incorporate our short-term results into our learning process. Even within the games that we win, there are mistakes. So all the time we should be trying to recognize both our technical and our mental mistakes. And then, win or lose, we must give our best effort to excell. We&#39;ve got to put ourselves out there in a position facing failure in order to be stretched into our outer limits. The results that come from these experiences will teach us more about ourselves and the game of swwcg than any of our other experiences.<br />
<br />
Alright! Well I hope you enjoyed that installment. Please feel free to comment below. I don&#39;t know how many of these there will be, but I do already have one more written out describing performance psychology! Personally I put a lot of emphasis (if you havn&#39;t already noticed) on the mental side of this game instead of just the technical. Check back soon to read my thoughts on that subject!<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
Installment #3: Performance Psychology<br />
<br />
It is undeniable that psychology impacts playing swccg, just as it does all areas of life. In this, there is risk and reward. If I am in an undesirable psychological state (such as being worried about life events outside the game), my play will naturally suffer. On the other hand, if I am in a proper psychological state, I will more naturally be able to play to my limits (the best of my current ability) with a creative flow of thinking. There are two necessities to having such a creative flow: to be relaxed mentally and to not be distracted.<br />
<br />
There are a couple simple things that can cause our thinking to be worn out and not relaxed such as not sleeping much (or at all) before an event and also becoming worn out as a long day of play goes on. For instance, Worlds Day 2 requires 8 hours of play! If I haven&#39;t splet much the night before I will surely be too tired to play my best before the day is through. Taking a good night of sleep for granted, there are other ways to condition your body and mind to succeed throughout a long day of thinking. The most simple one is to have days where you perform some mental activity for long periods of time (it does not have to be swccg, although that is good too). Truthfully though, that kind of training would probably only be worth it if there was some kind of professional swccg circuit. Definitely if I was a poker player I would want to get used to long times at the poker table.<br />
<br />
Distractions can be a constant threat to any mental concentration. There are a couple ways to respond to them: to be upset, to avoid them before they happen, and to withstand them (have resilience). Obviously, the best of these is the latter, but it is also the hardest to achieve because of the many forms distractions can take. Some can be simple such as a bad odor or loud noises or even a song stuck in your head. Others can be more complex such as the possibility of someone cheating or an opponent&#39;s rude demeanor.<br />
<br />
Take for example the recent MPC. There has been a lot of talk about a couple of Patrick Dinelle&#39;s games and the arguments arising between the players involved in them. I really have nothing to say as to who was right and wrong, and really to me (and this discussion) it doesn&#39;t matter. But take this example to heart and learn from it. Through some series of events in Dinelle&#39;s game with Justin Desai Dinelle wanted to go back and force drain, as he did not think he had passed into his deploy phase, but Desai did think so. Desai would not budge on his opinion, while Dinelle did by going on and completing his deploy phase actions and not calling the TD over for a ruling on the situation. Here is the example: the strictness of Desai&#39;s play and adherence to his position caused Dinelle to be put in an uncomfortable situation. He was not able to withstand and excell through this kind of distraction from what he was used to and, as he said himself on his blog, he played the rest of the game poorly because of it. Here is the point: distractions like this occur in every swccg tournament. The Dinelle-Desai version is just the most recent publicity of it. I&#39;m sure you can think of other times when you were playing that had similar occurances (I know I can!). These conflicts are a type of psychological distraction.<br />
<br />
So how do we deal with these distractions? We must build up our mental resilience. Everyone is used to playing under normal conditions (although &quot;normal&quot; might be different to different people). From there the first step is to recognize that there are distractions and we have different ways to deal with or avoid them. The second is to choose to deal with them as previously noted. Then it gets a bit hard: training to deal with psychological distraction. The main thing here is to recognize that it is possible to use outside distractions to our advantage. We must accept them and the emotions they conjure within us and in order to use them and and heighten our creative thought. Iin that moment of upsetting distraction, we can choose not to lose the thread of our thinking, but instead to be stimulated through the experience into more positive and useful creative flow. It is only through consistently being aware of these interchanges (that we unavoidably are confronted by psychological distraction and we will react one way or another in turn) that we are able to consistently improve upon our reactions. Sometimes there will be setbacks, where we won&#39;t be able to view fully the whole situation until after we&#39;ve calmed down, but in those moments we need to rise up and objectively decide what we could do better in that position if it occurred again.<br />
<br />
I truly believe that a lot of what we have discussed here is not only applicable to swccg, but to many aspects of life. This kind of intelligent preparation and cultivated resilience is the proper base for psychological success not only in swccg, but all areas of life. <br />
<br />

Installment #4: Momentum And Spirals And Stuff<br />
<br />
After reflecting on the last installment of my article series, I decided that there is a ton more about performance psychology to discuss. And I&#39;m definitely not going to get to all of it now, but here are some thoughts I&#39;ve had.<br />
<br />
The last installment discussed a general mindset for dealing with outside distractions (outside meaning not originating with yourself). Today I will describe my thoughts on what to do when you have to deal with your own mistakes and the psychological tension between you and your opponent.<br />
<br />
There is an especially problematic mistake that I have seen many times, in myself and others, that I would call the downward spiral. One mistake causes another which causes another, ad infinitum. And of course, its not that I have to keep making mistakes after I start, but what really happens is that I am moving along through time, making decisions as needed. Then I realize one of those decisions I just made was wrong and I get hung up on it, not moving forward along with time like I was before. I get left behind and that causes me to make another mistake. This downward spiral is especially dangerous when at one point I was clearly ahead (and enjoying it of course) and then I realize that somehow things stopped going my way. The real evil of a downward spiral is that often that first mistake really isn&#39;t so bad and if that was the end of it, the game wouldn&#39;t be lost.<br />
<br />
An example of this occurred at the last local tournament I was in (luckily it wasn&#39;t me this time, but instead my opponent). I was playing a fun dark deck (Endor Clouds!) against a MWYHL asteroids. My deck had a little kick but really wasn&#39;t prepared for the damage control of a mwyhl. Great Warrior, Projection, Asteroids to my system to cancel that drain. Bam wow I do like 1-2 damage/turn after that. He&#39;s retrieved most all his lost pile. But I am trying my best to stay in it (I sent some guys to Dagobah) and I&#39;ve got my Imperial Decree (v) on the table so I&#39;m sure its going to be a timed game, 1 pt win for him. So my opponent goes to make his Test 4 draw, and he draws like a 3 or something I dunno. And he says, &quot;Ok a 3, I pass.&quot; Now I hadn&#39;t been counting the destiny that much up to that point, but this one I count and see that he didn&#39;t pass (he was 1 short, 15 instead of 16). And my opponent sees that Yoda&#39;s Hope is no longer on the table. Now I didn&#39;t know if it ever was (maybe I should pay more attention) so I say, hey if its not there we can&#39;t count it. But he is upset because it was there and it must have gotten shuffled back in his deck. Well I don&#39;t let him search through and get it out because I know he&#39;s going to timed win anyway so it doesn&#39;t really matter. And the TD agrees so thats that. But no, not to my opponent. That one mistake of somehow shufffling that card into back into his deck (we&#39;d been moving them around a good bit see) got him hung up and he couldn&#39;t get over it. So he starts to draw like crazy, and before you know it its about gg. He doesn&#39;t have enough life force to get the timed win so he just draws up.<br />
<br />
One small thing (he would have still timed won the match even after missing the draw), started the downward spiral, and time left him behind. Instead of thinking towards the future, how it was still an easy timed win for him, he got hung up on his mistake and ended up throwing away the win.<br />
<br />
Now that example is pretty uncommon. I don&#39;t think that this downward spiral happens a lot in locals or practice games or friendly games and what have you. Instead I think it is mostly in the tense games, the championship ones you want to win SO badly. Its then, when its all on the line, that its hard to move on when you know you&#39;ve made a mistake and its nobody&#39;s fault but your own.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there is an opposite side to this psychological momentum--being on the receiving end! Its great when the momentum is going your way.<br />
<br />
Take an example from my DragonCon 07 report when I was meeting up with the only other undefeated player. This guy was from out of state and he had won Dagobah regionals earlier in the year I heard (his name is Travis but I don&#39;t remember his last name). Myself on the other hand, hadn&#39;t even been back playing for a full year, so I definitely thought I was slated to lose. But no matter; I gave it my best shot. And soon enough early in the game I had an advantage. My opponent was faced with some hard decisions and I could see it in his face--he thought he might lose. He was also taking a pretty long amount of time to decide what to do on these tough decisions. But I didn&#39;t rush him, instead I just sat back in my chair, chomping my carrots with a smile on my face. Confidence. This guy didn&#39;t know me, didn&#39;t know that I felt like a freshman at the senior prom with no chance to score. All he saw was trouble on the board and my big smile. GG. Game over. That momentum won me that game, and the next when we were paired again.<br />
<br />
So this kind of stuff really happens. Sure, its all connected to concrete gameplay that needs attention too, but if any of us are going to achieve excellence we have to recognize the psychology of the moment.<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s the key: avoid the downward spiral. If you make a mistake or if you feel like the momentum is not on your side, don&#39;t despair. Take some time and regain your clarity of mind! Take some deep breaths, go off into your own little world for a minute, whatever it takes. Its going to be different for you than me. On the other hand, if you feel like that momentum is going your way, you gotta ride it. Maybe its just putting on a certain attitude, or maybe it goes so far as talking your opponent into making a move they wouldn&#39;t normally do (&quot;You sure about that?&quot; --this has worked for me!).<br />
<br />
And no matter which way the psychology of the moment is going, you&#39;ve got to remember this one thing, this one thing that will benefit you no matter what the situation. Always be searching for the advantageous play. Never ride autopilot. If you&#39;re ahead, don&#39;t slack off. Figure out how you&#39;ll drive your advantage home. If you&#39;re behind, give your opponent hell! Do whatever you can to make life hard on him. Whatever it takes, don&#39;t mentally quit. Even if you don&#39;t get the come from behind win, you still will have helped your differential and have a better game to look back on for kicks. <br />
