There was a lot already spoiled, although I do not know what exactly, and hope that there is still some useful info in here for everyone. The set will be available this week, but this has info on almost all cards already. So here goes, as always not really in any particular order<br />
<br />
1.	My, Quite the Colony<br />
<br />
As expected, Quite Mining Colony (QMC) in all it s variations is getting quite the boost. First, there is Access Denied (V), a new start-able (deploys on table and is always immune to Alter) Effect, which makes your Rebels of ability 4 or higher immune to attrition <4. This will work wonders on your EPP characters, when they happily swing their permanent weapons at Vader and cohorts, not worried by that stupid untracked 3 anymore. Beldons Eye (V) is another start-able Effect, that will take care of the space part of the deck, since it once per game allows one unique independent starfighter and/or matching pilot from hand or reserve deck for free. Wedge in Pulsar Skate, Dash and Outrider, Bo Sheck with anything else you get the idea. The new Beldons Eye will also provide some weapon protection, but all this only works when playing QMC. There is also the Weather Vane (V) Effect, but more on that later. <br />
To round this chapter off, we have Kebyc (V), who lets you activate extra Force for each Cloud City (CC) site you control, and makes your aliens deploy 1, and opponents aliens +1. The second part works nicely into the whole deploy choke theme featuring Corporal Kesaric, Tigran Jamiro (V, set 4), the Spaceport Docking Bay (not on CC though), Goo Nee Tay of course, and the Bespin system as well. It takes a good deck builder to figure out at which locations it would be impossible to deploy for the DS under these circumstances, and would still allow you to do enough damage with all these cannon fodder characters out. <br />
The other Kebyc (V) part with the 1 deploy for your aliens could be incorporated into another nice beat down deck. I have tried building decks around that, but maybe the better players out there can misuse it more efficiently. Use Herc Seff (V, set 5), since leaders deploy 2 to his side, and the Coruscant (expansion) Effect You Have A Lot Of  Guts Coming Here, which makes your unique rebels of ability = 3 power and forfeit +1 (+2 on CC or Jabbas Palace). So, deploy Herc for 2, and than leaders like Wedge or Ackbar for 2 (they are power 5 each for 1-2 deploy on CC then). With Keybec (V), who subtracts another 1 from aliens deploy you could also add Boss Nass and Captain Tarpals for free. Also cool is the Anti Senate Leia for free, or a power 8 screaming Lando. Combined with Yoda (V, set 5) a 3 deploy Jedi, and Jedi Presence you can get some major beat down going. <br />
<br />
<br />
2.	Battle Tech<br />
<br />
I am not talking about big mech-like things duking it out with each other. We just had that in  Matrix again. No, this is about the new sub-theme from this set, which will make all the battle evasion that much harder. We call those cards Verpisser cards here in Germany, and I guess there are just enough letters and syllables in there to give you a good idea about what that means. When asking the players what they wanted the most in a poll on the PC site, a majority of the answers cried for more battles and interaction. So, gone are the days of hiding and cancelling battles. No evasion card will be save anymore, once this set hits the net. <br />
For the LS, Impressive, Most Impressive (V) cancels most of these cards, namely Imperial Barrier, Stunning Leader, You Are Beaten and All Too Easy. Stunning Leader is further cancelled by the aforementioned Access Denied (V), and you also have to lose 2 Force to exclude  characters from battle with the new defensive shield Weapons Display (V) out. <br />
The shield, and its DS counterpart Firepower (V), also have another function, once you control 2 battlegrounds (a site and system, which you need for Battle Plan/Order anyway), and your opponent deploys any ability card and does not battle during the same turn. You then get to randomly select a card from the Lost Pile and either take it into hand, or stack it on the shield. During your move phase you can then relocate (that is teleport, not walk around for any newbies who just switched in) X characters, ships or vehicles to a location the opponent occupies during your move phase (X = cards stacked). I urged the lords in the PC to call these Offensive Shields, because there is a lot of offensive potential in there, especially with decks like Speed Deal. The old Effects Ability, Ability, Ability and Chasm both could hurt in combination with these new shields, and the Set Your Course For Alderaan and Watto objectives both build a solid platform for them, the first having an almost unconquerable site, and the second using Wattos site and a system (at least in Italian style) anyway. <br />
The DS shield Firepower (V) also lets the LS player lose 2 Force in your battles each time they move away from a location both players occupy. Boba Fetts and Lukes new virtual guns further prevent moving away from battles altogether. Captain Bewil (V) does the same, and he is also cool, because he is a little Lodd Dott, searching your Force Pile for any interrupt during your control phase. He also pulls Restricted Access, a destiny 4 Effect that (kills inserts or) deploys between your CC sites to increase the movement, if you do not happen to have a Lift Tube. There are two other new virtual battle pushing and start-able Effects, Civil Disorder and Ability, Ability, Ability, that allow you to either activate 1 when initiating battle, or to take a non-cheesy (no permanent weapon or maintenance cost) character from Lost Pile into hand. You can also lose a card to make a Combat card lost, and the Effects make the deploy of Senators +2. Watch out for Civil Disorder (V) though, as it makes several of your Leias, among them the new one from this set, deploy +2 as well. Yes, she is a senator, go check the Current Rules Document. Finally, there is Slip Sliding Away (V), which cancels that other remaining Verpisser card Path Of Least Resistance. <br />
<br />
<br />
3.	Lil Blue and Big Blue<br />
<br />
On the space front, there is not too much new, but the cards in this set are very nice. First of all, the new virtual LS capital starships, Bright Hope and Redemption, which both have some more playable deploy/forfeit/armor/hyperspeed statistics, and an ability 2 pilot. The first one not only deploys and moves like a starfighter, but also has this very handy function that cancels a battle destiny, if together with another capital starship. So, the Bright Hope (V) with Wedge RSL and Spiral with Hobbie par example, would cancel 2 destinies. It is a 4 card combo, but one that secures you a system. The Redemption (V) is also nice, since it lets Bacta Tank deploy for free (pay 3 for a ship now, and you get a 4 Force tank for free), and reduces the cost of X on that by 2. Together with 2-1B it would be X 4. Although I must add that I still like the function of the original underused Redemption, which lets patients deploy for free, and would be a top ship, if it had any reasonable deploy cost.<br />
The LS also has the 4 destiny interrupt We Will Find Han (V). With the Used part you can deploy Han (or the Falcon Combo, since we are speaking of space) from Reserve Deck, while the Lost part deploys him/it from Lost Pile. Although having no ships of their own in the set, the DS has two start-able Effects that will push their big blue stuff even more. Kuat Drive Yards (V) gives all your unique imperial class star destroyers an additional ability 2 pilot, immunity <4, and deploy 1. You can also pull battleground systems with it for 2 Force. So, when you start this (to get the Bespin system), Mob Points Combo (to pull the Excecutor), and the new We Are The Bait (V), which in turn pulls They Must Never Again Leave This City, you are almost guaranteed to get a free Executor first turn. It costs you all three starting Effects, but might be worth the slots. Check it out!<br />
<br />
<br />
4.	Bob The Builder<br />
<br />
If my son could read, this would be his favourite title. I am talking about the other Bob though, namely Boba Fett (V), that is only the CC one, not the Special Edition guy by the way. Well, the new virtual Boba is immune <4, flies, pilot 3, forfeit 7 and has armor 5. These stats (and the cool picture) alone make him a nice alternative to P-59 in some decks, and he also makes your retrieval with bounty cards immune to Aim High. Once during your control phase, Bob pulls the following cards:<br />
<br />

Woah, seems like Bobs gun is one of the toughest new cards out there. The old machine gun pistol was not bad either, but this thing shoots at vehicles (read: speeders) to hit and at characters to capture at same and adjacent sites. To give my boss in the rules department a break for a change, let me clarify that Bob can to shoot out of the battle, but that the target has to be captured by any warrior (not necessarily Boba) at the same site as the shot victim. <br />
Using He s All Yours, Bounty Hunter (V) and Vaders Bounty (V) would ensure a kill of almost everything by the way, but would cost you two lost cards to add 5 to Bobs destiny.<br />
His old buddy Vader is up to no good either. With The Emperors Prize (V) the LS will suffer for playing space or speeder Luke, whenever Vader is at an unreachable site and has this Utinni Effect on him, since they will lose 1 Force during their move phase (this does not work with Bring Him Before Me decks though). For BHBM you can use the even worse card I Am Your Father (V), an Immediate Effect played after Vader kicked his son in a battle or duel to make him lose a Force. He then also loses 1 Force each control phase as long as Vader is at a battleground, and when he is killed, you get to track this 6 destiny Effect back into your Used Pile.<br />
<br />
 <br />
5.	Dark Deal Carbon Chamber Testing Terror<br />
<br />
The DS objectives based on Bespin or Cloud City will both get some serious additions to make them even more competitive than before. For Carbon Chamber Testing (CCT) you get the new start-able Effect Despair (V), which makes your Force Drains +2 where you have Jabbas Prize (that strange Carbon Han card), and the drain may not be cancelled or modified. That means that the drain stays at 3 unless you move to the Casino or play a Presence Of The Force on the Carbonite Chamber, since your Vader Lightsaber bonus or whatnot would be a modification as well. Also, your opponent deploys +1 and cannot move from that location during your turn. Finally, the flip side of CTT cannot be placed out of play, so once you bring a captive to the JP Throne Room, it stays that way. This is best done by using He Is All Yours Bounty Hunter (V), a 4 destiny interrupt pull-able by Bob the Builder to allow your bounty hunter (BH) to make two more moves with a captive (bringing it up to moving 3 times). That should be a first or second turn flip with flying Boba. Once there, Jabbas Influence (V) will make your other BH power +2, and Jabba can download a non-bounty hunter alien to his site per turn. That is why I would not recommend using the Starting Interrupt with the BH, gun and ship. You can always go the extra way (if it fits your plans) to pull Mighty Jabba with the JP Audience Chamber, and then get Chall Bekan to his site to draw two destinies there, and take a Rodian (V, set 2) into hand at the same time. That guy in turn downloads Fett, Iggy or any of the BHs you cannot deploy with Jabba otherwise. If you want them directly at the Audience Chamber deploy the Rodian directly there via Jabba of course. And replace the Rodian with a free of charge Beedo, who is easily pulled with Ket Maliss (V3), and lets Broken Bob add 2 destinies (But all this is an old hutt : ). Jabbas Influence (V) also turns your gangsters into information brokers, and allows Palpatine to be used with Scum And Villainy when Xizor is on table. This is useful for CCT to back up your virtual Iggy with the Emperor, but more so for the Agents Of The Black Sun objective. You can now use Scum with it, and use Jabba (and other gangsters) to work with Information Exchange, an Effect that cancels battles for losing 1 Force (there was a card that makes this function used, but I could not find it anymore). Jabba will further use his virtual Influence to help the objectives Court Of The Vile Gangster and My Kind Of Scum.<br />
But back to CTT. Another start-able pusher for that is Special Delivery (V), which has a nice text that allows you to capture characters the opponent just wanted to save by using the Bacta Tank or Jedi Resilience. But the real special delivery comes in form of  downloading any (!) Effect per turn, if the Carbon Chamber Console is on table. We Must Accelerate my carbon frozen lower Twilek backside from now on, if you catch my drift. That is where you get the Presence Of The Force from, that I talked about earlier. You can also pull Flagship (V, set 5) to give the (from now on more often seen) Executor 2 destinies in battle and get Lord Vader.<br />
For the latter, there is We Are The Bait (V), which mainly helps Vaders drains and bonuses at a CC battleground site, and is an easy tracked 7 destiny when you get clobbered by some mains. It also pulls the following cards:<br />
<br />
Cloud City Occupation 	direct damage hurray<br />
Dark Deal   			all the mean things you can do on CC<br />
I&#39;m Sorry			grab two free CC sites for not playing Barrier <br />
They Must Never Again Leave This City without a free Executor<br />
Weather Vane			Ill get to that later<br />
Weather Vane (V6)		Ill get to that later<br />
<br />
We Are The Bait (V) provides the free Executor as mentioned above. If you want that for CCT as well, then I recommend starting with Mob Points (pull Executor), Kuat Drive Yards (V, pull Bespin) and Special Delivery (V). The latter pulls They Must Never Again Leave This City, and Jabbas Influence (V) to get you all the other things you need. The combinations for Dark Deal and CTT enhancements with these new Effects seem almost endless, they just have to be optimised to keep it to as few cards as possible. I hope I gave you some ideas.<br />
<br />
<br />
6.	666  Number of the Beast<br />
<br />
There is certainly no shortage of destiny 6 cards in this virtual set 6, as you have seen by some cards mentioned already. Many of these high destiny cards have an equivalent on the other side of the Force, and might prove to be interesting concepts. First, we have the new Down With The Emperor(V) / A Day Long Remembered (V) Effects with a kinda maintenance cost of using three for LS, or losing 1 for the DS, respectively. These beautiful destiny 6 cards also go to the Used Pile if not maintained. They further cancel all immunity to attrition, and let the opponent lose Force for lost battles and (dark) Jedis. (It is good that they do not work with EPPs as originally planned, otherwise your permanent weapons would be running amok.) <br />
And combined with Draw Their Fire/First Strike, Scum And Villainy, and Imperial Domination (V, set 4) these new Effects can hurt more than just your head. <br />
Next up are Imperial Atrocity (V) and Imperial Propaganda (V). These non-unique 6 destiny Immediate Effects put a little stop to the age of direct damage (first by 2 and later) by cumulatively reducing such damage to a minimum of 1. Speeders, walkers, queens, gangsters, occupations, fear keepers and similar nasties will have it a lot harder from now on.<br />
Impressive, Most Impressive (V), the 6er evasion canceller already mentioned, also has an original second function of taking the first action during the opponents weapon phase, if he attacked, or it allows you to take 2 actions in a battle you initiate. The also already discussed DS counterpart (which is only a destiny 4 though) was He Is All Yours Bounty Hunter (V) with the 2 additional moves. I like these new concepts. They seem small, but actually open the door for all kind of mischief, like removing two targets with Shining Lando (the one with the axe) and Master Luke in Profit, before the opponent can do anything.<br />
And last but not least, there are the new Weather Vanes on each site. They are no destiny 6 cards, but work well with several high destiny interrupts to bypass a battle. These are for<br />
<br />
Light Side:<br />
Desperate Reach -> destiny 5 that relocates a guy from WV to any CC site in move phase, <br />
 	         and you maybe already use to cancel Imperial Barrier anyway<br />
Fall Of The Empire -> relocate character at end of  a battle you won to Weather Vane (WV)<br />
Fall Of The Legend -> destiny 6, relocate lost character from a duel/battle on CC for 2 Force <br />
 		  to WV, and also pulls WV itself<br />
Into The Ventilation Shaft, Lefty -> destiny 6, relocate character from a CC site to WV Rescue In The Clouds -> destiny 5, place character (say Jedi Luke: ) from WV to Used <br />
 			      Pile. Also deploys ships as react to battles in the clouds <br />
The Bith Shuffle & Desperate Reach -> destiny 5, as above but with tracking ruin machine<br />
<br />
Dark Side:<br />
Heart Of The Chasm -> lost destiny 3, rearrange CC sites, cancel Off the Edge, pull WV itself<br />
Shattered Hope -> lost 3, relocate a lost character at end of a battle you won to WV<br />
Slip Sliding Away -> used destiny 3, use 3 to make a character on WV lost, cancel Into The <br />
Ventilation Shaft Lefty, or relocate card from top to bottom<br />
Slip Sliding Away (V) -> the new version cancels Path Of Least Resistance, relocates your <br />
      character from WV to CC, or theirs from CC to WV (in the move phase)<br />
<br />
As You can see, the DS kind of sucks destiny-wise, but has the advantage in deployment, since WV is unique, and if DS has it out, then LS cannot play it anymore. This is good tech against QMC by the way, if that is strong in your area, because the +2 activation at Cloud City is cool, even if you are not on CC yourself. For the LS, it could be used as tech against The Deal Is Getting Worse All The Time, when you yourself play Throne Room Mains (and can start with WV). The DS version lets you lose a Force for each character placed there, and captures them when returning, so it is used offensively. With the LS version you get to draw a card each time a character is placed there, and can relocate them back to CC. With all the anti evasion, Verpisser card hate from this set, it is interesting to see that a new battle bypass is opened up with Into The Ventilation Shaft, Lefty. Use that interrupt to relocate (this is no moving away in my opinion) and get the hell down to WV and back in time to drain during your control phase. Sweet.<br />
Also mentioned should be the Chasm Walkway site, which immediately relocates any hit characters to the WV. Sounds familiar? Together with the Naboo: Theed Generator Core one could build a nice Whack them all away forever deck with cards like Double-Maul and Impressive, Most Impressive (V). The research for the WV related cards above was by the way done by my buddy Luke Badger from next door to down under. Thanks big guy! (you did not think some-one would notice, huh?) Speaking of Luke<br />
<br />
<br />
7.	Lando, Lobot, Leia & Luke lose less<br />
<br />
In Lights lamest (head)line! Lets start with the big cloud baron himself, with Lando Calrissian (V). There is only a DS version in this set, but it could be the card with the best statistics in the game. For only 2 deploy, you get a power 5, forfeit 7, pilot (and ability) 3 dude who can also add or subtract 1 from any destiny draw (that makes him power 6 in a way). This is what Kir Kanos was meant to be. Calrissian can also pull A Real Hero (ARH), which in turn pulls DS Lobot as a destiny 4 Used function. Although this Lando cannot be replaced anymore, ARH has a second lost function, which lets the pair add 2 destiny on CC or cancel an opponents destiny, if he is together with Han. I believe that this cannot be used with The Prize in a CCT deck though, because he is frozen and cannot be targeted in any way. Should the opponent have his Lando out faster than you, and there is no reason for that because you can deploy him with the Security Towers text, you could also use I Had No Choice (V), an Immediate Effect that deploys on Screaming Lando to cancel his game text. You could also retrieve a Force during each of your control phases, but I honestly doubt that he would be around till then.<br />
LS Lando will still remain useful though, because of the new Lobot (V), who downloads any alien (probably axe swinging) Lando for free as a react. You could also play the new Surreptitious Glance (V) to let them add 2 destiny to power and 1 battle destiny in battles you defend. They would actually draw 5 destinies that way on Tatooine, if I see that right.<br />
Poor mans Yul Brunner also works with other aliens like Angry Chewie by the way, maybe something to give Dr. Evazan and Pal something to think about after you Blast The Door, Kid. He can further deploy a Cyborg Construct on himself from reserve deck, and the new Locutebot of Borg will then be able to take up to 6 cards from your hand to protect them from Monnok & similar cards or to set up some tracking, if you find a way to lose the device, or to return it to Used Pile. Rycar Ryjerd (V, set 2) comes to mind, since he makes your cards from lost characters go to Used Pile. But the Professor Xavier look-alike with the wheelchair on the wrong end of the body also works well with Computer Interface (V), a destiny 3 Used interrupt that allows you to look at the top 3 cards of your Reserve Deck, take any or all of them into hand, and put the others back in any trackworthy order. And no, there is actually no limit to the jokes I could think up for this guy :- )<br />
The character with the most virtual and non-virtual personas is also back in this set, namely Princess Leia (V). She adds a destiny with Han or Vader and reacts to sites with imperials. <br />
The following cards are pulled by her (as the text says, but with short info):<br />
<br />
Leias Blaster Rifle -> destiny 3 gun, shoots at vehicles too, destiny +1 and the target is lost!<br />
Leias Sporting Blaster -> destiny 5, target lost if > defense value<br />
Leia of Alderaan (V) -> unique rebels deploy 1 to her, and DS Repuplic characters (senators <br />
likely) are deploy +2 and forfeit 2. Unfortunately it deploys on her, so you cannot use it effectively with Senate killing Leia (V, set 3)<br />
Leia of Alderaan -> beef up non-unique rebels and ships at rebel base locations<br />
Reflection -> use 3 Force to retrieve 1 Force<br />
<br />
Last of the bunch is her horny brother Luke, who gets no new card himself, but 2 equipment cards. The first is the already mentioned Lukes Blaster Pistol (V), which twice (!) targets a character or (basically non-AT-AT) vehicle to make it lose all immunity. The target also iexhaust and forfeit 3 if destiny +2 > defense value. Not too shabby, if you have 5-8 of these things in your binders. The second house tool is the Bionic Hand (V), that actually slipped in and out of this set during play testing (not because it was bad or broken, just because something has to go eventually). But it is back to add two to power and defense value of Luke, and also to exchange one card from hand with any interrupt from lost pile during a battle at a battleground. Finally a good use for this destiny 7 device. <br />
<br />

8.	Credit Dofine <br />
<br />
Okay, I just watched 2 seasons of Alias (great show), so I could not resist the title, which makes no particular sense, since we are not talking about any Neimodians. But we talk about Profit. That objective not only gets help by the mains cards from the previous topic, but also a big boost due to the new start-able Effect Seeking An Audience (V), which allows you to download Artoo, C-PO, Chewie, Lando or Leia once per turn. The latter should be the Bikini Princess from Reflection 3, since she should free Han immediately, if the DS did not back up their two aliens with a non-alien character during their first turn. Virtual Seeking An Audience will also enable you once (by placing it outta play) to take any character into hand from Lost Pile, probably your likely to be killed Han. Combined with Racing as it was once popular, you may have several opportunities to keep Han save in the Podrace Arena or with trusty old Ben Kenobi. And although the objective is still not as strong damage wise as We Have A Plan (or as easy to keep flipped for that matter), this Effect will bring Profit back to the big leagues, especially with easy deploying your major mains, and fishing for the rest you need with an early pulled Naked Threepio. <br />
Another objective ripe for a come back is Hidden Base (HB) in any form, meaning either as it was meant to play, or as a force generating platform. The new start-able Effect Rebel Planners (V) allows you to deploy a system from under your Starting Effect once per turn, which is huge. I would rather have those shield cards as high destiny effects in my reserve deck than any  locations. Further, virtual Rebel Planners makes the HB flip side reduce the drains to zero instead of cancelling them, which will give Walker decks some trouble. And last but not least you get to exchange your HB system between tourney games, and so make something a reality, that many players felt was necessary to begin with. Strike Planning, combined with General Riekaan and Broken Boy from 2 virtual sets ago could bring us a third variant to play the objective in form of Speed HB, since a second to third turn flip should not be a problem. Just to give a short reminder: Strike Planning pulls Generals Rikaan (V) and Lando. The latter deploys with Gold Squad Falcon (via your third start Effect Squadron Assignment) to the Rendevouz Point for 3 bucks in turn 1, so that you have somewhere to deploy Rikaan (and it is useful later). You deploy Endor (system 1) from Starting Effect also in turn 1. If you have 2 Force from your opponent play Rikaan and deploy Romas Nevander (V) for 2 more, or maybe Haven on Rendevouz Point, if you have Broken Boy in hand and get only 1 more Force from opponent to deploy him as well and to pull another system (number 2). This would be an ideal round 1. Next turn, you deploy the Hoth system with Rikaan, another system with Romas, and one from under your Starting Effect (bringing it to 5 in turn 2), probably Kessel and Coruscant first for fast big drains. Any key cards, cheap capital ships or systems in the starting hand would speed it up, and bad draws or activation could slow it down a turn, but you get the picture.<br />
There is also a new little Effect for Watch Your Step (and mayyybee QMC). It is called All My Urchins (V) and allows you to place one just forfeited card in Used Pile per turn, but that is not immune to Alter, and can only be played with heavy drawbacks in deck construction, so I doubt that it will see much play. The already mentioned Civil Disorder (V) though, could enhance the We Have A Plan (WHAP) deck quite a bit. You can battle, take the topmost (likely republic) character into hand, and forfeit the battle guy. Next turn, you deploy the one you took into hand, and take another card into hand, thanks to Secure Route (V, set 5). Battle, and take the previously forfeited guy into hand, and welcome to loop city. <br />
<br />
<br />
9.	Well Dressed Threepio, Superstar<br />
<br />
We really seem to have a thing for superstars here in Germany. First there was Brangus Glee from Bastian Winkelhaus and/or Martin Falke, then came Daniel Kuebelboeck, and believe you me, it is way better if you have no idea what I am talking about, and now I try to put the label on another skinny and goofy dude. Anyway, take any R-rated version of Threepio (not the good naked one), and deploy the new Hopping Mad (V) on him, which uploads:<br />
<br />
How Did We Get Into This Mess -> destiny 4 to recycle cards and draw same amount plus 1<br />
Mantellian Savrip -> forfeit stuff from hand instead (now harder to be cancelled)<br />
Thank The Maker -> now a Used destiny 3 interrupt played in opponents turn after he drained <br />
 	           you for at least 3 to draw destiny and retrieve amount!<br />
We Are Doomed -> destiny 5 Used interrupt that cuts drain damage in half (round down)<br />
<br />
This is only for you guys being too lazy to check all your old Premiere cards out. Hopping Mad (V) itself is another destiny 6 Effect by the way, that you can put back with C-3PO (V, set 2). So, what are the most creative ways to get rid of this new golden boy for the DS. First, there would be E-3 PO (V), who plainly cancels Threepios text and that of cards on him where present. Worse is that he pulls E Chu Ta, which is now also weapon and battle destiny +3. This CC Used interrupt cancels the game text of another character present with him (say Qui Gon with stick), or you can use it to initiate a battle between your droids without presence (and both add a destiny). This could really hurt with IG-88, 4-LOM and Guri. The Episode 1 droids are not counting, because of their presence icon, as far as I am aware.<br />
You could also use the new destiny 4 Used interrupt Levitation Attack (V), which allows you to deploy one or two devices from under your Starting Effect. So get that Restraining Bolt and Caller already and simply steal the damn Threepio for yourself to use, and another old fashioned possibility becomes more easy. You can of course also fetch other useful devices with this, like Mauls Electrobinoculars, several Tractor Beams, or that Electro Rangefinder for your Walkers.<br />
<br />
<br />
10.	The Best Of The Rest<br />
<br />
Keep Your Eyes Open (V) is a good Used destiny 5 interrupt for the LS, that lets you look at the top cards from Reserve Deck or Force Pile and leave it or take it into hand. This is especially useful combined with Flash Of Insight (V, set 5), which allows you to see the top card from Reserve Deck, and use your then tracked 5 with more certainty. The new Courage Of The Skywalker (V) is lame, except for the fact that you can use it with Leia to duel, since the non virtual version would have been the only one helping you in a duel (by adding a destiny) unless you are a master of tracking. <br />
The DS has got the hammer card Brief Loss Of Control (V). It cancels control, or prevents your opponent from controlling a location (or the Senate) for remainder of turn. And it has the mean function to cancel the game text of all characters with ability in a battle until the end of turn. This can lead to some serious beat downs, especially when used in an Invasion deck or with Iggy with Gun. This is also the nail in the coffin for those previously invincible draw a destiny unless able to otherwise guys.<br />
Another super strong DS card is the new Imperial Decree (V). It is start-able (even in addition to your 3 Effects in a Walker deck) and reduces direct damage by X (minimum 1), where X is the number of battlegrounds you occupy. To add insult to injury, you can also lose 1 Force at the beginning of your turn to activate based on your opponents Force icons instead of your own. The age of the twixes might yet come to an end.<br />
Last and certainly the beast is The Emperor (V), that lousy Reflection 2 card. He comes with a build in Force Lightning (game text, no card pull), which is even free in battles. His destiny 1 and immunity to attrition <6 is made up by the ability to deploy and work (at politics 4 to boot) in opponents Senate. So the next time that Leia tries to place your Lott Dodd out of play, go ahead and toast her first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is all from me for now. Again, I do not know what was spoiled exactly from the set, since I am not too frequent on the message boards, but I hope my research gives you some good ideas anyway. At least it might spare you the What the sith did E Chu Ta do again? questions, and give you a short reminder about what the old pull-able do.<br />
A hearty thanks to the whole play testing group for some info, especially Chris Gogolen for pointing out a thing or two I did not notice. He also recognized that Brief Loss Of Control is shortly called BLOC, which is kind of funny. Also thanks to Doug Taylor and Eric Locken for providing some info.<br />
<br />
Please understand that there may be some last minute changes with the actual release. Also, kindly consider the effort it takes to write something like this (almost 10 pages in Word dammit), and rate nicely. Next up is the probably most eagerly awaited Expansion of all times, Shadows Of The Empire, but until then we sure have to decipher quite some unpredictable meta game and tournament system. But the Players Committee and Deck Tech are working on that as you read this, and if they do only half as good a job, as they did with this set and the web site you read it on, we should be in for a long playing life.<br />
<br />
May the Force be with ya<br />
