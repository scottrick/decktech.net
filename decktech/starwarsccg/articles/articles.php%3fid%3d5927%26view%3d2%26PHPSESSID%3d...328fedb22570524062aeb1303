It is merely to entertain.  I am going to relate my personal experience with &quot;getting out of Star Wars&quot;, how it has been thus far getting back involved, and my plans for the future.<br />
<br />
For some, this will be a walk down memory lane.  For others, they will be jealous of a piece of my very fortuitous luck.  And still for others, they&#39;ll just find some entertainment in this story, and perhaps nod their heads at some of the things I relate...&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been there!&quot; or &quot;I remember that!&quot;<br />
<br />
I am writing this in hopes of getting back to my old form for Star Wars articles, and to pump up our somewhat lackluster offerings as of late (with some notable exceptions, of course--for a quality article along these same lines that may not bore you as much as this one might, see &quot;A New Era?  Or Perhaps It&#39;s Over...&quot;.  And for solid super quality, the &quot;Top 10 Things about V8&quot; will definitely do the trick).<br />

<br />
Okay, everyone gone by this point?  If not, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>&quot;Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!&quot;</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Christmas, 2001.  Rumors had been swirling about the demise of the Star Wars license for several months, but they were just that at this point--whispers.  My brother and I, along with my younger cousin, all got our typical Star Wars Booster Christmas from Santa, something that had become a yearly tradition for us since 1997.  Heck, in 1998 we had a MASSIVE ice storm in our area, knocking out the power....and yet my brother and shredded three boxes of Special Edition with only the dim light of a few candles to help us see.   &quot;Sweet!  I pulled a Vader!  No, wait, that&#39;s just an Eriadu Operative.&quot;<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
So we had been concerned with the power creep edging into the game, but we still wanted to play, so collect we must.  I remember my brother got a box of Reflections III, while my cousin and I got some Theed and random Reflections packs.  We pulled some great cards, built some new decks, all was good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three days later, I get a call from my friend Brian Buchanan from The Deep, the once and great bastion of all things Decipher.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, man, did you hear?  Decipher lost the license for Star Wars.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I mean, sure, there were some who suspected, but I had still been in denial.  After all, there was the promise that when Worlds was cancelled, &quot;hey, no worries, we&#39;re here playtesting new sets furiously.&quot;  (This obviously couldn&#39;t have been the case, knowing what we do now).  And to announce it a few days AFTER Christmas?  Yeah, make sure everyone gorges themselves on cards for the holidays and THEN drop the bomb on them.<br />
<br />
And people wonder why I still nurse a grudge against Decipher today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact was, though, that at the time I was mostly angry with Lucasfilm for yanking away our license.  Decipher had been underhanded, sure, but they would&#39;ve kept the license if they could.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now a few weeks prior to this, I had tried Decipher&#39;s new Lord of the Rings game.  While I wasn&#39;t enamoured with it, I wasn&#39;t quite ready to part with my Decipher fix, and once the license was gone it was official.  I was going to start playing Lord of the Rings, and sell all of my cards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>I&#39;m shakin&#39; the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I&#39;m gonna see the world!</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was obvious what I needed to do.  If I was to hit the ground running with LOTR, I had to part with my Star Wars cards.<br />
<br />
Some of you may remember this time, and most of you probably remember it with a slight pit in your stomach.  I remember seeing FLOCKS of Star Wars collections hitting Ebay with such a fervor it would make your head spin.  Everyone, everywhere was convinced the sky was falling, it was all over, time to bail out.<br />
<br />
Selling my collection was a very tough choice.  I&#39;d been working on it since 1996, after all, and a LOT of cards I loved where in there.  I&#39;d look over my collection and see four Emperors.  Eight Vaders.  More Mains &#39;n&#39; Toys than you could shake a stick at.<br />
<br />
I just couldn&#39;t part with it all, I began to realize.  I made up my mind then:  I would sell it all, except for the Episode I stuff.  Only the biggest mains and AIs from Episode I were selling for much anyway, so it didn&#39;t seem worth it to part with cards I&#39;d only purchased months before.  This also allowed me to keep my six Mauls.  &quot;If anyone wants to play an Episode I tournament, I&#39;ll be ready for it,&quot; I thought to myself, completely unironically.<br />
<br />
<br />
And up my collection went.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thankfully, because I did have so many great cards, my collection didn&#39;t go for the pittance I saw some other collections go for.  I actually got more than $200 for it.  Of course, I had spent more than $200 on the game in the past year, much less my whole time collecting, but I took what I could and spent the money on three boxes of Fellowship of the Ring.  It appeared my time with Star Wars was done.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, a funny thing happened next.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town!</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There was a guy named Kevin who had played lots of Star Wars with us at one of the shops.  He also played Magic quite a bit and had bought into LOTR.  I went up to a Saturday Magic tournament with a friend of mine (this was about a month after I&#39;d sold my cards).<br />
<br />
When Kevin saw me that day, you could see an idea forming in his head.  He made a bee-line for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, do you still play Star Wars?  They aren&#39;t making it anymore, are they?&quot;<br />
<br />
I told him no, and I had in fact sold most of my collection.  All I had with me that day were a couple of Magic decks I had cobbled together, a small box with about 300-400 Magic cards in it, and a small binder with some OK rares in it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to trade your Magic cards for my Star Wars stuff?  I&#39;m desperate to get rid of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understood where he was coming from.  But he was truly afraid that all of his cards were worthless and he&#39;d be stuck with them for the rest of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;What sort of stuff do you have left?&quot;  I asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, all kinds of good stuff.  Some Vaders, Tarkin, some other stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was interested.  It WOULD be nice to have a couple of Vaders again.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, all I have is this stuff here.  I&#39;d like to keep my decks, and this box has been picked through to build those decks.  There&#39;s not really that much great stuff in here.&quot;  (I wasn&#39;t lying.  I hadn&#39;t bought too many Magic packs since Tempest, and had been through MAYBE 1/2 box of Invasion at this point, trying to get back in the game).<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; he said.  &quot;That&#39;s fine.  I just want to get rid of them.&quot;  I knew he was seriously desperate to get rid of his stuff, because the rares in my binder were....let&#39;s just say less than exciting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sure.  I&#39;ll take a look at what you&#39;ve got.&quot;  He left to go to his car, and I envisioned getting a binder or two with a few mains in it, some things to tide me over, remember the good old days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine my shock when he carted in THREE *huge* four-wide boxes (3000+ count EACH) and set them on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um....you&#39;re...um...sure you want to do this?&quot; I asked.  I was incredulous.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, man, I want to get rid of all this stuff.&quot;  His disgust with what he had deemed useless, worthless cards was palpable.  He probably thought I was the sucker at this point for even wanting any of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So we shook hands, I gave him everything but the decks I had on me, and I went home later on to see just what was inside.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was agog.<br />
<br />
<br />
Inside those boxes were:  5 Vaders, 2 Mara, 2 Tarkin, 2 of each EPP except Obi (only 1), 3 Falcons, several copies of &quot;lesser&quot; mains like Cap&#39;n Han, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and the like....about 80 Reflections foils, including Yoda, Ben Kenobi, the Executor, and more....about half of an Endor 18 card foil set.....Boba Fetts, Walkers and Star Destroyers of all kinds....I literally could not believe my good fortune.  <br />
<br />
I picked out everything I could possibly want, and still had enough copies of mains and &quot;decent&quot; rares to sell in two MORE Star Wars lots.  Those two lots in fact paid for my two boxes of Mines of Moria.<br />
<br />
It was likely the closest I&#39;ll ever come to winning the lottery, sad as that may be to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini&#39;s...</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, though, I would soon learn of the toll that the license being lost had truly taken.<br />
<br />
We tried to hold tournaments for the next three weeks after that, but no one showed up.  We&#39;d had 12 players for an EPISODE I tournament of all things only four months prior and now, we couldn&#39;t break four people.<br />
<br />
I learned that there was a smaller group of players till playing at the Deep in Huntsville, but they were using the new &quot;Virtual Cards&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now maybe here I have to admit to being a little shortsighted.  You see, when I learned that the point of Virtual Cards was to slip a small piece of paper in your cardsleeve to grant your old cards &quot;new&quot; text, I scoffed.  It just seemed so....silly.   (Self-conciousness in a Star Wars CCG player--the irony would practically choke you).<br />
<br />
So, even though I&#39;d received a King&#39;s bounty of Star Wars cards, unless I wanted to use the new V cards, my time with the game really was over.  However, I&#39;d experienced such seller&#39;s remorse the first time parting with my collection that I was not about to do it again.  The odds were that there would be no &quot;mega-collection&quot; dumped on my door ever again, so if I got rid of these cards, I&#39;d never see them ever again....again.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And thankfully I didn&#39;t, because before 2002 was over, Decipher began their long, steady decline of LOTR by introducing strategies and counter-cards that most players didn&#39;t want, and for the first time ever in a Decipher game&#39;s existence....a BANNED list.   Ye gods....this wasn&#39;t the company I once knew and adored.   I said, &quot;I&#39;m outttttttttaa heeeeeeeereee&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>I wanna live again, Clarence, I want to live again!</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Time for a BIG fast forward, to the semi-modern day.  Sorry for the whiplash!<br />
<br />
<br />
Decipher&#39;s WARS was on the horizon...a new game using the old mechanics, those old familiar force drains and activations and battles and weapons and....well, it sure sounded nice to me.  In fact, although I had been burned before, I made a promise to Mike Blumberg that if it was a good game and Decipher hadn&#39;t screwed it up inside six months, I would buy into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must be a prophet by this point, because the rotation system for WARS was announced what, a month ago?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I&#39;m not here to argue the merits of rotation, or banning, or Type II, or any of that stuff.  That&#39;s a personal judgement call.  To me, though, all of that stuff is as good as poison.<br />
<br />
But something had been ignited again.  I wanted to play Star Wars!  I missed that old game.  Who could forget all of those good times, using some of my favorite movie characters of all time?<br />
<br />
<br />
So I told my brother....&quot;Hey, let&#39;s start building Star Wars decks again.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
He was understandably dubious.  The last time we had played Star Wars in the summer of 2002, he had a rather bad experience against my WYS deck.  See, I had an EPP Han and a Railitir Freighter captain chilling at the cantina, with EPP Luke next door at the docking bay.  So he drops Maul, Darth Vader, and Grand Moff Tarkin on Han and RFC, and initiates.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how this story goes?  Stop me if you heard this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t Underestimate Our Chances.  Run, Luke, Run!  Blaster Deflection on Maul&#39;s swing at Luke.   Luke hits Maul with his saber, Blaster Proficiency Lost and POOF, there goes Maul.  I zap Tarkin, he&#39;s forced to cancel the shot because of how quickly this battle is going downhill.  I play Don&#39;t Get C<b></b>ocky.  So now I&#39;m looking at five destiny (EPP Han w/ Luke, two smugglers with WYS, my normal destiny, and Don&#39;t Get C<b></b>ocky for two more) vs. his ONE.<br />
<br />
When the smoke cleared, he lost by *20*...tripled to *60*....<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, I can&#39;t blame him....you drop two Sith and a Grand Moff on Han and one of his smuggling buddies....you expect that to be enough.  Let&#39;s just say he was a little burned by that experience, and we went a looooooong time without playing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am digressing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
So anyway, I promised him, &quot;Look, I won&#39;t start out building the old cheese again.  Huntdown is strictly forbidden.  No WYS.  I&#39;ll play fun stuff, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, the three of us (my cousin never sold his cards, nor did my brother) made a pact:  we would have playable decks by Christmas time.  We may not be able to shred the old Star Wars packs anymore and would have to settle for the Raw Deal holiday Lethal Library set, but by golly, Star Wars would live again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>Zuzu&#39;s petals... there they are. Well, what do you know about that!</u></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So I start building decks again, and I can&#39;t believe how awesomely cool it feels to be pawing through these cards again.  I thought I&#39;d start with a Rebel Strike Team deck for fun, and maybe a Bring Him Before Me for dark.  We still wouldn&#39;t use V-cards, and just sort of agree to ban the cheesiest of stuff--Senate, Podracing, y&#39;know, pretty much most of the objective-based strategies released in the last year of Star War&#39;s life (funny how that works out).<br />
<br />
Then I hit a bump in the road.  I realized that my inherited collection had some holes in it.  It was embarassing to realize that I didn&#39;t own a single copy of Squadron Assignments (I have no idea how this happened), but would have to use Get to Your Ships! instead.<br />
<br />
More troubling, though is realizing you don&#39;t own a Bring Him Before Me.<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, I knew I&#39;d need to acquire these cards.  And a big shout out to Nick &quot;The Quick&quot; Jones for hooking me up thus far on some of the stuff I didn&#39;t even realize I was missing.<br />
<br />
In my haste of looking over the &quot;goodies&quot; I&#39;d gotten in my mega-Magic trade, I hadn&#39;t noticed some of the stuff I didn&#39;t have.  Well, I&#39;d just have to buy them, wouldn&#39;t I?<br />
<br />
But then the realization hit me--I was spending money on Star Wars again.  And I knew it was pretty awesome just knowing I had Star Wars decks either already built or in progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
What was it that monkey said in <i>The Lion King</i>?   &quot;It is time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**********************************************************<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>You see George, you&#39;ve really had a wonderful life. Don&#39;t you see what a mistake it would be to just throw it away?</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you made it this far, and for that I both thank and commend you.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what&#39;s next for this little saga?  Well, we&#39;ve decided that we&#39;re going to try and have a Classic Environment, &quot;No V-card&quot; tournament in February.  We&#39;ve got to start out slowly, you see.  After that, maybe we&#39;ll look at doing more.  There&#39;s a bunch of guys I play Raw Deal with who said they might be willing to give it a try, and there&#39;s tons of boxes and collections out there for a VERY reasonable price.<br />
<br />
And those kits from the Star Wars Player&#39;s Committee...I have to admit, I&#39;m VERY impressed with those.  For a few bucks each, there are some real prizes in there for the players to compete for.<br />
<br />
Now, there is the matter of Theed, Coruscant, and Reflections III being difficult to get ahold of, and if that becomes a stumbling block we may just keep it Reflections II and before...maybe with V-cards, maybe not.  Who knows at this point?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All I know is that I want to play Star Wars again.  Where does the story go from here?  Who knows....but I&#39;m glad to welcome and old friend back again.  Let&#39;s see how the ride ends this time, out of the hands of Decipher and firmly in the hands of the players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>I know what I&#39;m gonna do tomorrow, and the next day, and the next year, and the year after that.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays to Everyone, and thanks for reading this VERY long-winded tale.  Was there a point?  I&#39;m not sure....but it sure felt good to tell it!<br />
<br />
