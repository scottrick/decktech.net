Hopefully this article will give newer players, and perhaps even more experienced ones, some insight on which shields are good and when they should use them. Two of the comments were cut/pasted from the dark shield mirror.<br />
<br />
<b>A Close Race</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. If you just lost a Podrace, your Force loss is limited to half the difference between the winning race total and your highest race total (round up). While you occupy three battlegrounds, Watto&#39;s Box is suspended.</i><br />
<br />
An easy one to start  do not play this shield. Ever. Traffic Control (v) is strictly superior.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Never play this. Ok, you <i>might</i> want to think about it if youre playing podracing yourself and are afraid of losing the race against the DS player, but thats going to be a very rare situation.<br />
<br />
<b>A Tragedy Has Occurred</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. Once per game, may use 1 Force to stack one Interrupt just played here. To play any new Interrupt of the same name, player must first stack it here and use +1 Force for each Interrupt in stack, even if Interrupt is normally free.</i><br />
<br />
This one is also easy  always play this shield! As with the dark mirror, this is an extremely versatile shield which should be pulled early in most games to stop your opponent recycling useful and/or high destiny used interrupts. Cards to watch out for and grab are Imperial Barrier, None Shall Pass (v), Masterful Move (especially if youre running savrip), Short Range Fighters/Watch Your Back, Imperial Command, Elis Helrot, Imperial Artillery, Outflank (v), squabbling delegates and many others.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Its difficult to think of a situation when you wouldnt want to have this shield under your starting effect and, indeed, the only reason you wouldnt pull this early (to grab an interrupt when its played the first time) is if you think youre going to run out of shield pulls (eg. You need to pull both anti-sense/alter shields).<br />
<br />
<b>Affect Mind (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While Inner Strength not on table, opponent may only use 1 combat card per turn. While opponent has 2 Dark Jedi on Naboo, you lose no more than 2 Force to Force drains at opponent&#39;s Naboo sites. Let Them Make The First Move may only target droids and spies.</i><br />
<br />
This is a mirror of the dark shield I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing (v) so Ive repeated my comments from there. The most useful part of this card duplicates the effects of ultimatum against Light Saber Combat (and some other) decks when less stringent conditions are satisfied. However, if your deck is likely to be able to set up ultimatum or menace fades reliably in the first few turns (eg Hidden Base, QMC, WYS), then you probably dont need this shield. If youre playing, say, a reactive mains deck like TRM vs LSC, though, then this is much more useful because not only will it mean you dont take crippling force loss while you set up your strike, it will encourage a the DS player to spread out early to continue doing decent drains and then make it more difficult for them to clear your chars off naboo with either the finger of death or saber combat. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> This can be an important card if you either cant neuter LSCs drains from resistance/menace fades or if your deck needs to send Jedi vs a LSC player. But its kind of useless in a light side LSC deck <br />
<br />
<b>Aim High</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Whenever opponent retrieves X cards, opponent must first use X Force or that retrieval is cancelled. (X is equal to the full amount of Force allowed to be retrieved, regardless of the number of cards in opponent&#39;s Lost Pile.)</i><br />
<br />
You might think this is less useful than the DS mirror because Dark has less retrieval generally, but I would consider it pretty much as important as secret plans because when the dark has a retrieval, they can really abuse it. This card will be very useful for you against decks like Court, Retrieval Ties, CCT, Imp Domination (v) decks, ISB (flip side, fozec), scum and senate. Additionally it helps against cards like first strike, Imperial reinforcements and some duelling cards (vaders anger (v), deep hatred (v)). I probably wont get pulled as often as secret plans, but youll regret it if the dark player is retrieving and you dont have it.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Very close to an auto-play, only leave out if youre really tight on slots.<br />
<br />
<b>Another Pathetic Lifeform</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While opponent has a non-unique alien or non-unique starfighter in battle, opponent may not draw more than two battle destiny.</i><br />
<br />
This is a key card for all those dark decks which pack non-unique tie fighters or jawas and play those super abusive non-unique destiny adding cards. Or it would be, except shoe decks and cards dont exist.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Im probably missing something, but I cant see why this card exists and I cant see why youd use it.<br />
<br />
<b>Battle Plan</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. For either player to initiate a Force drain, that player must first use 3 Force unless that player occupies a battleground site and a battleground system.</i><br />
<br />
As with its dark mirror, battle order, this is an extremely powerful shield. It does a great job of punishing un-balanced decks. The only reasons why you wouldnt play it is if youre pretty sure your opponent is going to pull battle plan on you or if youre playing an unbalanced deck yourself (eg. WHAP, hyperdrive, HB) and you dont want either of battle plan/order to hit the table. Even then you might want to keep it, cause it might hurt your opponent more than it hurts you. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Pretty much an essential shield, just make sure not to pull it if your opponent has already played battle order :). Also, in Rescue the Princess, Cell 2187 (v) only makes leia ignore battle order, not battle plan, so you might not want to pack/use it in that deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Disarming Creature (v)</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. Colo Claw Fish is canceled. Bane Malar affects Force drains only at his site. During an attack (except at a pit), your characters at that site may fire character weapons at participating creatures.</i><br />
<br />
Somewhat less useful than the dark mirror, Frozen Dinner (v), simply because dark creatures arent as abusive as Ellors (v) which is what the other card is designed to hurt. Some decks like HB or MWYHL will want to pack this for its anti-bane text, just in case your opponent is playing ree yees, but most decks wont need it for that. And most decks arent <i>too</i> vulnerable to creatures now that WYS(v) predux is gone. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> This is a fairly marginal shield, although if you know your opponent is going to be playing creatures or you have a particular reason to want to make sure Bane (v) cant do his thing at multiple sites, you might want to play it.<br />
<br />
<b>Do, Or Do Not</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Sense and Alter are now Lost Interrupts. When any player makes a destiny draw for Sense or Alter, and that destiny draw is successful, that player loses 2 Force.</i><br />
<br />
A double edged sword and a very powerful shield for that reason. Its fairly unnecessary if youre playing MWYHL because your opponent wont be sense/alter-ing your cards that often. Its also usually a bad idea if youre running sense/alter yourself (but even then, if youre out-SACed then you might wish you had it). So if you want to keep your interrupts and effects hanging around, this is a great card because sense and alter will be a much less attractive option for your opponent if they have to send three cards to the lost pile to cancel one of yours. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Should be in many types of deck, but is a lower priority for anti-SAC than wise advice in many cases, because that card keeps your cards in play. You might find that you dont have enough shield pulls to play this and all the other shields you want, but its a useful card in a lot of decks nevertheless.<br />
<br />
<b>Don&#39;t Do That Again</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Once per game may take any Immediate Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. While opponent occupies no battleground systems, Mobilization Points is suspended.</i><br />
<br />
This is a much more important card than the dark mirror, Fanfare, because Mobilization Points (combo) is a moderately common card because its very versatile. This shield is particularly useful in Throne Room decks because you can pull it first before your opponent has a chance to grab, say, the executor. Its also a good card because there are a number of very useful light side immediate effects, such as Imperial Atrocity (v), What Is It?, Legendary Starfighter, Advantage A Gift, A Vergence in the Force and The Time For Our Attack Has Come (v) which might find their way into your deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> You should definitely play this if your deck has an immediate effect in it, and you should think about playing it even if it doesnt because suspending mob points, even for a couple of turns, can be very useful.<br />
<br />
<b>He Can Go About His Business</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. Cancels Responsibility Of Command and You Overestimate Their Chances. While Brangus Glee on table, once per turn you may search opponent&#39;s Lost Pile and place all docking bays found there out of play.</i><br />
<br />
Brangus decks are dead and buried because they need to devote a good number of cards to that strategy which are made completely useless by this card, so that text is pretty obsolete. And Responsibility of Command is a very marginal card, which requires the dark player to run Hoth: War Room to have any real chance of getting to play it, so cancelling that doesnt justify using this card either. And by the time your opponent plays overestimate, itll be too late to play the shield.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Maybe a brangus deck could be revived, cause I dont see much reason to play this shield in pretty much any deck..<br />
<br />
<b>Let&#39;s Keep A Little Optimism Here</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. While you occupy a Renegade planet location, operatives are forfeit = 0, operatives do not add to Force drains and your Force drains may not be reduced. (Renegade planet is defined on the Objective card Imperial Occupation.)</i><br />
<br />
And, moving right along, operatives are <i>truly</i> dead and buried and you should be able to beat them even without this shield. As an added reason not to play it,  Let&#39;s Keep A Little Optimism Here (v) is a pretty good card and this is unique.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> An easy choice  dont play it.<br />
<br />
<b>Only Jedi Carry That Weapon</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. For opponent to steal a weapon from target character using a non-[Episode I] card, must first draw destiny. If destiny +1 > target&#39;s ability, weapon stolen. Otherwise, attempt fails and stealing card is placed out of play.</i><br />
<br />
This is quite a useful shield, much more so than the dark mirror because light side matching weapons are quite common and, consequentially, many dark decks play weapon levitation. If you are playing matching weapons, or even just mace (v) and his saber, you really want to think about both packing this and pulling it before any battles take place at your jedis location.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Probably the only reason you wouldnt use this is if you dont have any non-permanent weapons, because weapon levitation can really ruin your day.<br />
<br />
<b>Ounee Ta</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. At each opponent&#39;s <> site, your Rebels are each deploy -2 and your Force generation is +1.</i><br />
<br />
Although the two decks this was originally built to hurt, operatives and RalOps, are either dead or immune to this, its still possibly worth including because the <> spaceport docking bay is reasonably common in hunt down or BHBM decks which want to be able to send their vader around to chase down your jedi/luke.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> If youve got room, put it in. It can give you a nice little bonus if a <> site hits the table.<br />
<br />
<b>Planetary Defenses</b><br />
<i>Plays on any interior site. This location may not be targeted by Proton Bombs.</i><br />
<br />
A shield with a very specific purpose, its absolutely necessary in certain decks and a waste of space in others. If you have an interior location which is essential for your deck, then you should play this on the off chance that some random person playing bombers will completely shut your deck down with a silly bomb. Such decks are senate, whap, LSC and perhaps AITC, profit and WYS (audience chamber and cantina respectively). In other decks, this obviously isnt worth including.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> If youre extremely vulnerable to bombers, put it in, if youre not, dont. Its that simple.<br />
<br />
<b>Traffic Control (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. You lose no Force to opponent&#39;s Boonta Eve Podrace. Opponent&#39;s Force retrieval from Boonta Eve Podrace may not be canceled. Unless opponent occupies more battlegrounds than you, Watto&#39;s Box is suspended. When played from An Unusual Amount Of Fear, does not count against your thrice per game limit.</i><br />
<br />
There seem to be fewer dark than light decks which can do well with podracing, so this is perhaps less useful than the dark mirror. Having said that, dark podracing causes a significantly larger force swing than light pods if Wattos box is out so its perhaps useful.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Dont play it if youre playing pods yourself or if youre really tight on shields. But if youve got room or your deck is particularly vulnerable to early game damage (eg. Mwyhl) then you should have this on the off chance your opponent is playing pods.<br />
<br />
<b>Ultimatum</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While you occupy at least 3 battlegrounds or opponent occupies no battlegrounds, you lose no more than 2 Force from each Force drain or &#39;insert&#39; card.</i><br />
<br />
This is pretty much an essential shield, it will save you from many huge drains the dark side can pull off with cards like mauls double saber, despair (v), I-TO (v), chirnau, ominous rumours and senate. This card is pretty much essential, and the anti-insert text on the end is gravy because it means you probably dont need to include insight.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> The only reason you wouldnt play this is if you have absolutely no chance of occupying 3 battlegrounds and have other ways of neutering drains (eg. Mwyhl). Other than that, this should be in almost every deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Weapons Display (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Whenever opponent excludes any character(s) from battle, they lose 2 Force. At end of opponent&#39;s turn, if you control two battlegrounds (a site and a system) and opponent deployed a card with ability and did not initiate a battle, you may retrieve 1 Force.</i><br />
<br />
This is a very versatile shield, but you have to be careful not to play it in preference to other shields which might be more important in the game (eg. Battle plan, anti-sac) because while retrieving one force is good, youll probably only get to do it a couple of times per game at the most. Having said that, you are beaten and stunning leader are both common dark cards and making them lose force to play them is a good thing. Just a note on the exclusion loss, it doesnt work against mauls cloaking infiltrator unless for some silly reason your opponent has left another ship at the same location as a cloaked maul, in which case you can initiate a battle where maul is excluded and, thus, make them lose 2 force.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> A versatile shield which should find its way into pretty much every balanced ground/space deck and even unbalanced ones to make your opponent pay for excluding characters.<br />
<br />
<b>Wise Advice</b><br />
<i> Plays on table. Your Immediate Effects may plays for free. Whenever opponent cancels your card with Sense or Alter, place that canceled card in Used Pile.</i><br />
<br />
The free imm effect text is useful if youre playing What Are They Trying to Push on Us, but its the anti-SAC text which makes this a pretty essential card. Unless your objective gives you sense/alter protection (WYS, MWYHL) then you really want to play this to keep your interrupts and effects like flash (v), honor, goo and revo around.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Unless youre unafraid of your opponent sense/altering your cards, pack this and pull it pretty much as as soon as they get a dark jedi on the table.<br />
<br />
<b>Yavin Sentry (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Opponent must use an aditional X Force to deploy a non-unique card (other than a Jawa or Tusken Raider), where X = the number of copies of that non-unique card at that location.</i><br />
<br />
Ive actually found myself including this card fairly regularly thanks to the popularity of SYCFA with non-unique ISDs. Its not uncommon for such decks to want to put 2+ ISDs at the same location and this can really slow them down in bringing the big beat/overwhelmed down on you. Theres not many other common decks that this is useful against.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> The anti-SYCFA function is enough to justify including this in many decks, imo, but if youre unafraid of hoards of ISDs jumping down on you (eg. WHAP) then dont bother.<br />
<br />
<b>Your Insight Serves You Well</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Cancels Scanning Crew. If an &#39;insert&#39; card was just inserted or revealed, it is canceled.</i><br />
<br />
Both inserts and scanning crew are pretty abusive and while inserts can be dealt with with ultimatum, this is the only effective way of cancelling scanning crew (excepting sense). Thankfully thats not such a popular card due to the fact that this shield exists, and many good LS characters arent rebels (eg. Mace, obi, JK) but it might possibly make a resurgence because so few people play the shield. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> If you have a lot of rebels in your deck, you might want to think about including it if you have room.<br />
<br />
<b>Your Ship?</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Cancels A Dangerous Time. Each player may play only one card with &#39;sabacc&#39; in title each turn. You may cancel an opponent&#39;s card with &#39;sabacc&#39; in title by losing 1 Force from hand.</i><br />
<br />
Not such a useful shield. A Dangerous Time is annoying, but not especially so particularly  considering the popularity of control & tunnel vision which can mess up the effects of it pretty easily. Sabacc is not so scary either, although being one of the few ways available to force you to draw destiny, it can be dangerous in the wrong situation. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> A marginal shield at best.<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b> <br />
As with the dark shields, Ill summarise roughly grouping the shields. <br />
<br />
<b>Versatile - 7</b> (should be in most decks) <br />
A Tragedy Has Occurred <br />
Aim High<br />
Battle Plan <br />
Don&#39;t Do That Again<br />
Ultimatum<br />
Weapons Display (v)<br />
Wise Advice<br />
<br />
<b>Niche - 8</b> (include in certain decks, usually depending on meta) <br />
<br />
Affect Mind (v)<br />
Disarming Creature (v)<br />
Do, Or Do Not<br />
Only Jedi Carry That Weapon<br />
Ounee Ta<br />
Planetary Defenses<br />
Traffic Control (v)<br />
Yavin Sentry (v)<br />
<br />
<b>Useless - 5</b> (forget em in all but the most extreme circumstances) <br />
<br />
A Close Race<br />
Another Pathetic Lifeform<br />
Let&#39;s Keep A Little Optimism Here<br />
Your Insight Serves You Well<br />
Your Ship?<br />
<br />
Theres 15 cards in the first two categories, so it might look like youll have to make tough shield choices in most decks, but thats somewhat deceptive. You dont need Planetary Defences, Do or Do Not or Only Jedi Carry that Weapon in a lot of decks. And some of the other niche shields are truly niche, and only of marginal use even when theyre used so even if you have to leave them out you wont be too disappointed. All in all, picking light side shields is substantially easier than picking dark ones, the only thing which is slightly more difficult is that its reasonably rare for the LS to include an effect version of a shield, unlike the DS (secret plans, code clearance).<br />
<br />
To finish off, heres my standard list of 12 shields to put under thrown back. Im assuming a balanced mains deck with matching weapons and a decent sac package. <br />
