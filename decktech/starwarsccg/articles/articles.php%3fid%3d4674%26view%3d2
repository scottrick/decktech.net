And now, Article #2...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this second article, the topic of discussion will be the Classic format.  But before delving into that, I&#39;m supposed to take a moment to offer a rebuttal on some of the points made by Jonathon Chu in his previous article.  There is much of what he said that I agree with, but since this is intended as a &quot;rebuttal&quot;, I will focus on the things that I don&#39;t agree with. <br />
<br />
#1) - The Local Uprising (v) Objective<br />
Having playtested the objective extensively now, I am forced to think that Chu&#39;s observations on the card were made &quot;at a glance&quot;, and that he probably hadn&#39;t yet used the objective much (if at all).  I could be mistaken, but that&#39;s the impression I get.  He talks on numerous occasions about all of the different things you can choose to do with the text that allows you to use 2 force to pull any card from your reserve deck.  But in reality, you won&#39;t do very much with that text.  The deck puts a LOT of cards on the table, and your life force becomes very small, very fast.  If you activate enough force to do the things you need to do, you&#39;ll barely HAVE a reserve deck at all, so the odds of it containing the key card you hope to find are not very good.  <br />
<br />
I&#39;m not convinced that the &quot;non-unique speeder swarm&quot; decktype he suggests is even viable at all.  I see a number of problems with that idea.  Firstly, the objective is already prone to overdeployment.  Using a swarm of 10+ speeders instead of relying on the card efficiency of the unique ones, will just dig you deeper into that hole.  Second, the deck cannot effectively use the new Frostbite, since the retrieval is based around sites that you control with *unique* speeders.  Making the deck even more card-intensive while stripping away its primary form of retrieval doesn&#39;t sound like a recipe for success to me.  Thirdly, the deck would open itself up to pitfalls that a more standard version would not be susceptible to.  Clearly, Monnok would become a concern.  The Death Star Sentry shield could also be a problem, and Passel Argente would be even worse, if you were to run across someone who was still trying to run Dark Senate despite VLeia.  (It would take a brave soul indeed to risk using Dark Senate, but it&#39;s not completely out of the question.)<br />
<br />
In the version of the deck that uses unique speeders, he mentions that you could start Squadron Assignments, and combine Hobbie with Wedge to set up in space.  While starting Squadron Assignments with this decktype IS a decent idea, setting up in space with Hobbie and Wedge is probably NOT.  Wedge is far too important on the ground, and without him, Hobbie wouldn&#39;t be too effective in space.  <br />
<br />
#2) - Imperial Occupation (v) Objective<br />
I agree with most of Jon&#39;s analysis on this card.  But I think there are two things about the decktype that he overestimates.  One, I believe he overestimates the usefulness of starting Krayt Dragon Bones to pull One Arm to pull the Wampa Cave (in fact, I think he overestimates the usefulness of the Wampas in general), and two, I think he overestimates the usefulness of the text on Prepare for a Surface Attack which allows the deployment of Star Destroyers from reserve deck.  Walkers are not amazingly cheap.  Star Destroyers are not amazingly cheap.  Deploying both of them on the same turn is not something that (in my experience) you can often afford to do, and still have the force to carry out the rest of the turn the way you want to.  That&#39;s not to say that I&#39;ve never used the text, because I have.  I just don&#39;t think it will be useful with the kind of consistency he indicates.  <br />
<br />
#3) - The Creature Effects<br />
I mostly agree with everything he said here.  But I don&#39;t expect to see a major increase in the amount of Wampas and Krayt Dragons used in final confrontations.  <br />
<br />
#4) - Other cards in vset #4<br />
This is where Chu listed several cards from vset #4 that he decided were &quot;virtually useless&quot;.  Several of them are.  But there were also a couple of them that I don&#39;t agree are useless.  Those would be:<br />
A) - Echo Base Trooper Officer - The usefulness of this card seems fairly obvious to me.  It allows for the lowering of the shield without using Romas Navander, and therefore you escape all of that potential Wampa silliness in the Echo sites.  <br />
B) - Maneuvering Flaps - Sure, EBG pulls the pilots and Luke pulls the Speeders, so why would you need the pilots and speeders to be able to pull each other?  Simply because it increases the pace at which the deck sets up.  When playtesting the LU objective, I used the Flaps in absolutely every game.  It was never once a wasted card slot.  Chu says that the only real justification he could see for this card was if you were wanting to get the RSL version of Wedge (from DSII) on Rogue 3, rather than Commander Wedge.  Well, of course you would want that.  It is having that version of Wedge on Rogue 3 that makes your Speeders untouchable.  If you were to use Commander Wedge (or put Wedge in space, or not use Wedge at all) then the dark side could actually contend for control of the north ridge, and that would be extremely bad for this decktype.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, so now, on to our regularly scheduled programming.  <br />
<br />
Ah yes, the Classic Format.  The timing for this article is interesting, given the fact that the PC has just announced a significant change to the rules for this format.  Namely, Epps are back.  And that includes all characters with a &quot;permanent weapon&quot;.  Everyone from Lando w/ Ax to 4-Lom w/ concussion rifle.  To be honest, I think the format could probably work either way.  With Epps, decks will have greater card efficiency, and will generally just be &quot;better&quot; in an overall sense.  Their presence will also deter people from trying to get away with abusive &quot;drop and drain&quot; tactics, like those used by Pacific Blue ISB, or Speed Deal.  And what would the advantages be of a Classic format that did NOT involve Epps?  Well, there probably aren&#39;t any advantages to that.  But that wouldn&#39;t have been a big enough obstacle to keep the format from being playable and enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
Brangus/Ketwol have also mysteriously disappeared from the banned list.  At first, I thought this must simply be a mistake, but having talked with one of the Advocates, it sounds as if they were removed intentionally.  Why, I cannot imagine.  Without a doubt, Brangus is an unstable &quot;combo deck&quot;.  It devotes numerous card slots to its Brangus combo, and if the combo never comes together, then the deck may collapse.  But when the deck IS running on all cylinders, it creates a first-rate &quot;Negative Playing Experience&quot;.  Brangus was not on the original banned list for Classic.  But after some of the early events, Brangus proved to be so overbearing that it needed to be added to that banned list.  So I&#39;d be interested to know why anyone would think it is okay to let him back into the format now, (ESPECIALLY at the same time that EPP Vader makes his return...) and why they don&#39;t expect Brangus to pick up his domination of the Classic format right where he left off.  <br />
<br />
So what do we still have on the banned list?  Well, all maintenance cards, for starters.  When the Epps were banned, I think it would have been fine to allow these cards.  But with the Epps back in, it is probably best to keep these nasty cards on the sidelines.  There&#39;s nothing particularly &quot;Classic&quot; about how it feels to be pummeled into the ground by Epp Han/Chewie Enraged, or Epp Vader/PCP Fett.  <br />
<br />
Also still banned, the WYS objective.  This seems a bit random to me.  Of all the objectives out there, why was this one selected to be added to the banned list?  I don&#39;t see any reason why WYS doesn&#39;t fit in this format perfectly well.  And it isn&#39;t as if it would take over the format, either.  There are plenty of DS strategies in Classic that could give a good WYS deck a run for its money.  <br />
<br />
Inserts are still banned as well.  Good riddance.  &#39;Nuff said.  <br />
<br />
And lastly, all cards with an Episode I icon.  Of cousre, this was the whole basis for the Classic Format in the first place.  The core theory behind Classic was the exact opposite of the &quot;Episode I tournament&quot;.  It was a &quot;No Episode I tournament&quot;.  The other changes were made to give the format a more &quot;Classic&quot; feel, or (in the case of Brangus, for instance) to eliminate a strategy that was overpowered in the format.  Unfortunately, two of the most important cards in the history of SWCCG, are Episode I cards.  Those two cards are &quot;Fear is My Ally&quot; and &quot;An Unusual Amount of Fear&quot;.  With these two cards come the defensive shields.  And defensive shields represent the single biggest step forward in SWCCG since the introduction of objectives, in Special Edition.  So naturally, to exclude them from a format is to take a giant step BACKWARD in the game&#39;s progress.  <br />
<br />
A &quot;sideboard&quot; of some sort for this game was long, long overdue.  I can&#39;t believe it took until R3 for Decipher to implement one.  It would have been useful from the very first days of premiere, but was very badly NEEDED by the time of the Dagobah expansion.  And has been very badly needed ever since.  Of course, having defensive shields in Classic would eliminate the need for some of the other bannings.  Inserts would no longer need to be banned.  It would be okay for Brangus to stay off the banned list.  And since I already think that the banning of WYS is questionable, it surely wouldn&#39;t be needed if the Useless Gesture and Code Clearance shields were available.  Now that we&#39;ve played with the shields for a while, trying to go back to the old style of play would be....difficult.  There would be something very wrong about seeing your opponent play ICBW on 3 of your drains in the same turn, without you being able to grab it.  There would be something very wrong about watching your opponent&#39;s sense and alter cards keep going to their used pile instead of the lost pile.  But most of all, there would be something incredibly sick, vile, and twisted about suffering through the mortifying experience of having your opponent drain you at 3 different sites, for 2 force apiece, without occupying a battleground system!!  Oh, the horror!  &quot;This simply can&#39;t be happening to me!&quot;, you would think to yourself.  &quot;We&#39;ve moved past the Dark Ages of SWCCG, haven&#39;t we?&quot;, you would ask.  &quot;These kinds of atrocities are no longer permitted, are they?&quot;  Well, evidently, in the Classic format, they are.  And that is what keeps the Classic format from being...hmm, how should I put this....good.  The solution, of course, is simple.  Just change the line &quot;All cards with an Episode I icon&quot; to &quot;All cards with an Episode I icon, except Starting Effects and Defensive Shields&quot;.  Problem solved, and you have yourself a fun, functional format.  I really enjoy alternate formats, always have.  I loved playing in &quot;Highlander&quot;-rules tournaments for Magic: The Gathering.  I played Type II.  I played Type 1.5.  I played Extended.  I played &quot;Mirage Block&quot; events.  I played &quot;Tempest Block&quot; events.  In SWCCG, I played Bespin and Beyond.  I played Endor/DSII scenario tournaments.  I even played some Episode I tournaments.  And if the defensive shields were put into Classic, I&#39;d play it too.  I think it would be very enjoyable, and I would certainly look forward to participating in it.  But without the shields....thanks, but no thanks.  <br />
<br />
So should Worlds (or other large events) have a Day 1 that is in this Classic Format?  In a word, no.  A lot of players would be strongly opposed to this idea, for quite a few good reasons.  Many players either have no desire to play in the Classic format, or haven&#39;t had a chance to do so.  Either way, they&#39;d have no experience with it.  They wouldn&#39;t have built a lot of different decks, wouldn&#39;t have playtested, etc.  Getting a whole bunch of these kinds of players together for a tournament would result in a lot more games than usual being won on the basis of luck, because so many people were &quot;underprepared&quot;.  The results of the tournament could end up vastly different than if the format had been the one that these players have known and practiced for years.  And if Day 1 were Classic, but Day 2 were the regular format, then players who had to fight through Day 1 would have to build and playtest two sets of decks.  This would just create a larger disadvantage for them against the &quot;already qualified for Day 2&quot; players than they would have otherwise, because those players could allocate all of their preparation time (however much time that might be) to regular decks, without having to concern themselves with a whole other format, and a whole other set of decks.  I think that a lot of the players trying to get into Day 2 of such an event would be more than a little upset that they would be forced to expend the time and energy to build and playtest an entire other set of decks, for use in a format that they might not even like (or want to participate in) at all.  So I don&#39;t think that the idea of a Classic Format Day 1 is a good one.  Especially not when the format hasn&#39;t even been tried and explored enough to know if it even WORKS how the PC hopes it to.  The use of defensive shields would cover up a lot of potential loopholes and problems, but even then, it wouldn&#39;t be wise to use the Format for Day 1 until the player base is a LOT more familiar with it.    <br />
