And, perhaps more importantly, what&#39;s the deal with virtual set five?  Well there&#39;s only two people who can adequately answer those questions, and one of them is Doug Taylor.  You may remember Doug from a previous Friday Times article when virtual set four was released.  Well now he&#39;s back to give us the lowdown on the newest set, and what changes in the meta the Player&#39;s Committee is hoping to make.  This is the one stop you need to make to get all the information on the current state of the game, and a little on its future as well.<br />
<b>JT: Lets talk about speeders: why the errata?</b><br />
DT: Well, our goal with any and every deck is for it to be viable, and yet not so strong that it dominates completely. We just were getting too many reports about the Speeder decks dominating tournaments and causing NPEs (negative playing experiences), and we therefore decided to tone it down some.<br />
<b>JT: Are you concerned the errata is going to make people not play the objective anymore?</b><br />
DT: That&#39;s always a concern. Of course, the goal is not to neuter a deck completely, but to hurt it just enough that it is still strong and enticing to play, without being a &quot;no brainer&quot; that becomes an auto choice because of its dominance. At my State Championship two weeks ago a player placed third using each of the Hoth objectives, so I&#39;m quite sure that it&#39;s still strong enough in the hands of a good player.<br />
<b>JT: Rather than making the errata, why didnt the Players Committee simply create a stronger anti-speeder virtual card, besides virtual Take Evasive Action?</b><br />
DT: The problem with &quot;bullet&quot; cards is two-fold. First of all, the very nature of a bullet means that people would have to play with the bullet card, and besides that they would need to either have it in hand (if it&#39;s a character or interrupt), or start with it (if it&#39;s an effect). That either further dilutes decks or takes up a valueable starting effect slot. The second problem with this method is that it takes a long time for it to get all the way to the player&#39;s hands. We&#39;d have had to wait through the entire State Championship season, and a lot of areas might have been frustrated to see Speeders wrecking everything in sight. We preferred a more immediate solution in this case, one that allowed for a more balanced Championship circuit.<br />
<b>JT: Do you expect the Walker objective to gain more popularity with the speeder errata?</b><br />
DT: I think it certainly helps the Walker deck, when the Speeders are taken down a peg. One of the decks the Walker deck struggles against the most is it&#39;s direct counterpart that also plays on Hoth, and less Rebels playing in the snow means more chances for the Walkers to dominate. :)<br />
<b>JT: I think most would agree that speeders are very advantaged against walkers. Why was the walker objective made so weak to speeders?</b><br />
DT: It really wasn&#39;t intentional, and I think it&#39;s more of a fact that the Walker deck came first (design-wise), and the Speeder deck came along in the design process later, giving us a little less time to get it exactly where we wanted it to be. I think if we had gotten about two more weeks (or so) to playtest and hone the LS objective, it would have been closer to the version you have now (post errata), and I think it also would have been more equal with its Dark side matchup. Testing has shown that the Dark side can do really well against it (when teched out to stop it). The problem is that the cards used to tech against it don&#39;t do anything against most other LS decks, and thus become wasted slots that you&#39;re not going to devote to a deck you take to a tournament.<br />
<b>JT: What was the goal you had in mind when you created the MWYHL helpers?</b><br />
DT: Obviously the main help MWYHL needed was speed. It&#39;s been a problem for that decktype since Dagobah, before there even was an objective. The problem we had, design-wise, was to give it enough help and speed, without pushing it over the top, as it can be a very strong deck once flipped.<br />
<b>JT: It seems that most players are persona-replacing Son Of Skywalker after flipping their objective so they dont have to lose a force to use test 5. Was your intent that a player should have to play an extra Luke to get around SoSs gametext?</b><br />
DT: The reason we went with that text was because of the absolute power that Son Of Skywalker showed when the Force loss text wasn&#39;t on there. In other words, the deck was just too powerful when the text wasn&#39;t on there. If people are persona replacing him, it&#39;s really serving the same purpose as the &quot;lose a Force&quot; text, which is that they are having to devote card slots to the problem, which gives the Dark side all that much more of a chance to compete. When this deck clicks on all cylinders, it can be a beast, and often wins by a large margin. Anything that slows it down or uses a few more cards to get the job done, whether that is by persona replacement or the LS player losing a few cards, balances the deck out and keeps it honest.<br />
<b>JT: Why not just make SoS the all-purpose Luke, that doesnt have to lose a force?</b><br />
DT: As stated, we felt that the deck was too powerful when the text wasn&#39;t on there. We also like the fact that players have options, and get to make their own choices as to who their apprentice will be. I&#39;ve seen lots of discussion online that tells that some people love the new SOS, and others prefer to train DOS. That&#39;s a beautiful thing, in our view. If everyone&#39;s doing things one way, and decks are cookie cutter versions of each other, then we&#39;re not doing our jobs well as designers.<br />
<b>JT: The new bounty hunters and their ships are seeing a lot of play, especially the new Mist Hunter. What types of decks do you see these cards being most-frequently used in?</b><br />
DT: I think that the bounty hunters and their ships have certainly been helped, but I think that decks that revolve around them (like CCT and Court) still need a push to be up there with the best DS decks. I think the help they&#39;ll get in the virtual stuff that focuses on Cloud City and Jabba&#39;s Palace will be just what they need to get them there. :)<br />
<b>JT: Despite the power of the new dark side cards, many still feel like light side got a bigger boost out of the set. Are their plans in the works to shift darks power back?</b><br />
DT: I would tend to agree that Light side has been gotten the bigger boost lately, but I think the sides are still fairly equal. It wasn&#39;t long ago that I thought it was way easier to build DS decks than Light, and now that situation seems to be reversed. I think that as we do the next few sets (Cloud City, Shadows, Jabba&#39;s Palace) we&#39;re entering a part of the story where things really got bleak for the Rebellion, and conversely the bad guys really got to shine (aliens, bounty hunters, Imperials). Hopefully the next few sets will give you lots of fun things to do to boost the power of Dark decks.<br />
<b>JT: The WHAP helper has transformed the objective from one that only Scott Lingrell plays, to one that people are winning major tournaments with. Are there plans in the works to boost the other seldom-used episode one objectives?</b><br />
DT: Perhaps a few of them. Scott himself deserves the credit on that one, as he won a playtest contest and got the priveledge of designing a card to help a deck that certainly needed help. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see big help for Senate, Lightsaber Combat, or Podracing (for either side) any time soon, but I think you just might see stuff that helps some of the others. Jabba&#39;s Palace is quite a ways off, but I think anything that helps alien decks is likely to help a Gungan deck, for example.<br />
<b>JT: I want to ask you a personal question about a previous virtual set: why was the anti-podracing shield created? I know I am not alone when I say I hate podracing and am glad to see it take such a big hit, but Decipher had already made a racing shield - did you just not feel the Decipher shield was strong enough?</b><br />
DT: That&#39;s pretty much it. Podracing had certainly had it&#39;s &quot;day in the sun&quot;, and I&#39;d say the majority of players didn&#39;t care for it. Having to stock that one card in your deck (Anakin&#39;s or Sebulba&#39;s Pod, usually), was kind of annoying, when you didn&#39;t plan on racing yourself, and too often the Shields they made didn&#39;t even do anything, so you felt like you were wasting a slot to try to stop it. Racing is still seen occasionally now (like with Chu&#39;s LSC/Podracing deck), and I think it&#39;s about where we want it, as a viable side strategy for certain decks, but not something you see at every table.<br />
<b>JT: It seems like every virtual set includes some kind of card to hinder dark side senate, yet it is still being used with frequency to win big events. Do you still feel like theres work to be done to take down this decktype?</b><br />
DT: Possibly. I&#39;ve personally never been a fan of many of the mechanics that Senate uses, and in fact I personally consider one of my biggest successes as a playtester for Decipher was getting the amount of cards that the flip-side picks from your hand from three down to two. I think we&#39;ve put some pretty effective counters out there, and yet the deck is still quite viable (which is what we want). It&#39;s not as much of an NPE as it used to be, but it can still be pretty frustrating to play against, as it does so many things well. I&#39;m not positive that you&#39;ll see more Senate love in the future, but I don&#39;t think you should be shocked if LS is given more weapons for their arsenal to deal with some of the tactics it uses, either.<br />
<b>JT: How long before work begins on virtual set six?</b><br />
DT: We should be working on it very soon.<br />
<br />
<b>JT: Can you give us an preliminary information on what the PC hopes to accomplish in V6?</b><br />
DT: It&#39;s far too early in the process to say (at least for me). I think you hit upon a few of the items in your questions. Some help for Dark side overall, especially for bounty hunters. Carbon-freezing will certainly get some help. For Light side, I think it would be fun to have a Lobot that actually sees play. For both sides, I know many players would like to see a Weather Vane that serves a useful purpose. All that, and I think we&#39;re going to surprise everyone with some cool new ideas and mechanics. Of course, things need to be rigorously playtested, to make sure that they&#39;re fun without being too much, but I think we&#39;ve got a great group that does a fantastic job on that end. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=4898&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
