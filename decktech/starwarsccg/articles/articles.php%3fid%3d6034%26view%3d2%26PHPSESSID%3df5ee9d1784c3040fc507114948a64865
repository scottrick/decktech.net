It is clear that in the whole skim of things, there really are not that many of us on here. From seeing the reviews to my article and my deck,(Return of the Super Beatdown), the same people take the time to rate them every time. There is nothing wrong with these passionate people, but we have to step back and ask ourselves, Why arent more people on here?  <br />
<br />
I can say that I have gotten more and more involved in this game because of Decktech. When the game was HUGE back in like 2000, it was nice to be in college and get caught up on all the new decks that I might see, plus get some strategy and advice on my current decks. Decktech was the reason I was able to continue to be a contender while I was still in college around so many other entertainment opportunities. <br />
<br />
Now that the game is more or less running on auto pilot, we are trying to bring back the game to a respectable meta around the country. That means that there are probably going to be A LOT of new players or ones that need help to get up to speed on how the game is played in 2005. Decktech provides the place for this to happen. Players like me are here to give advice to anyone, as well as education those who just arent quit there yet. There is one thing to play a game, but then another to share your experiences playing the game with others who also play. That is why we are on here and why you are currently reading this article. Why else would you take the time to read this or any other article? Why would you look over a deck and read the strategy for completely no reason? From talking to some of you on here, I have found that the true meaning of this site is being lost and replaced with those who would belittle others for having differences in opinions or because they simply want to be jerks.<br />
<br />
In this article, I hope to provide my opinion on what we should be doing on this website, how we can better use this site to grow as a group and not form factions against one another. I am sure that some of you will disagree with what I have to say, but like my other article, I want to do all that I can to return the game to the highest point it can be. That means using every resource we can to help those who need it. Decktech provides one of the resources we use to stay involved in this game. Our side of it is nothing like all of the other sides, because this is OUR game, not one that is made by a huge company looking to make money by having $10,000 tournaments, (not that I mind having one for that much money), but we have to look at where we are with this game. A game that is that competitive with 100s of 1,000s of players will always have the players that people are jealous of or just simply hate because they are too overly goldenrody. This game has that too, but for what reason, we play a game that is crawling on its hands and knees each year as it stays a float. At one point there was even talk of no longer having a Worlds Tournament, after the low turn out at 2004. In order to get a great turn out in 2005, we have to rise about all of the crap. There is no reason we can be different from all of the other games. Why our player base, worldwide cant be called the coolest guys who ever played a card game. Can you imagine people at Origins or GenCon saying, Man, maybe I should play Star Wars again, because those guys are so cool to hang out with. I am telling you it is possible, but A LOT of things must change. <br />
<br />
To start, there needs to be a revamp of how we treat each other as players on this site. I just cannot understand how someone enjoys making others feel like crap about a chose they made in a deck or what they chose to write about in an article (of course articles need to be articles and not a few sentence paragraphs or simply a question). There is no such thing as a perfect deck, (if there was, it would get an errata), that means that every single deck that you could post would have a weakness that can be pointed out by someone. So, the first thing that I believe could use some change, is how we rate other peoples Decks, Tournament Reports, and Articles <br />
<br />
Currently, there are four types of players that rate things on here; Friends, Constructive, Rude Constructive, and completely Un-constructive. <br />
<br />
Friends of course are those who you play with around your area or you met on here or at big tournaments like Origins, you know, people who are going to give you a 5 for every single thing you post just to support the fact that you are even posting at all. There is completely nothing wrong with the Friend type. It is a perk of the system. <br />
<br />
The Constructive players, like me, truly look over a deck for example and really think about what they can do for the deck to help it. When I look at a deck, the rating will just pop in my head based on how well I think it can truly perform at a tournament verses other decks that it might face. I never EVER rate a deck lower than 3 half, unless the person put a very weak or small strategy section, because that tells me that you really dont care about the deck and are just posting it to either get rating points or you dont understand why there needs to be a strategy. The other reason I would rate it lower is for revenge from ratings of the last two types. There are many got players that care about giving a good rating and helping, but there is just no reason all of us cant be this way. <br />
<br />
Rude Constructive players are the ones that will look over a deck, give it an ok rating or maybe a low one and give real advice that may be good and help the deck become better, but they decide to tell the person as though they are the master of the game, and the person summiting the deck is a moron for even thinking their deck would work. A lot of the reason that these types have become this way is because they had the same experience from someone else in the past and decide to be just like them to everyone else. These types are not that far from being ok, they just need to remember that most of the people that summit things are hoping for real help or they want to get an honest opinion from other good players. As a good player, you dont make yourself look like one by hitting it up with some off the cuff rating. I am sure, there is nothing I could ever really do about these players, because to be honest it is probably just their personality or they really dont even know they are doing it.   <br />
<br />
The COMPLETELY UN-CONSTRUCTIVE players are those that really piss me off. Most of the time they give some half a$$ reason for their rating, and the person receiving the advice either feels like quitting the game or acting out in revenge. They will not really look over the deck or just because of what it is or who is posting it, they decide to lash out in anger with an insult or a very low rating just to make the poster feel like crap. These people are destroying Decktech for Star Wars CCG. Having spoken to some of you who share my feeling of these people, I know that it would be nice if there was a change. <br />
<br />
Now, this article is not meant to call anyone out, because truly I am not writing this in a form of revenge or anything like that. I just feel that our game is in a special situation because it has been out of print for over 3 years. In order to keep what players we have left we need to join as one and help one another. Arguing, insulting, and calling out are how factions are formed on this site, and that is the way it used to be on here. It was something that you just couldnt avoid because there were players that were SO serious about the game, that any difference in opinion would cause a long draw out argument, i.e. Clint Hayes. Because we are now so few, when someone gets bashed on here, they turn around with all of their friends and start what I like to call as a War of Rating, simply rating what the insulting person posted low just to get back at the former insult. This combined with a gang of friends will get the first player to come back with his friends, like a feud. Confusing, well just read over it a few more time and you will understand. <br />
<br />
So, after saying all that, the next time you are about the rate a deck or give someone some advice, remember that they are players too, and they are choosing to post their deck for both acknowledgement and help. So please take hid in insulting, it will only cost people tech points for having to remove the bashing that they tried to earn by posting.<br />
