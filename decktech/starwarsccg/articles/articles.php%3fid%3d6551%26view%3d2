<br />
<br />
Hello!?! HELLO!?!?!?!?! Is anyone still on this website??? Granted I know the game is slowly losing players, but you would think some of the players from the PC forums could be seen on here from time to time. And perhaps they still log into this site every week, but no one seems to be posting anything anymore. No more articles. No more deck posts. Are there really only a few decks posted right now??? This problem needs to change. Players need to feel open to share their ideas about this very special game. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I originally wrote these Top 10 articles when there was a Writing Team. Since there is no more Writing team, I decided it was time to write one under my own Decktech ID.  <br />
<br />
I thought it was time to post a fresh article for the game. It has been almost a year since I posted anything to this site, so I hope everyone enjoys this new article about my Top 10 Cards that EVERY Deck Should Play. Everyone talks about the 61st card, but how many cards should every deck have at least one copy of no matter what the type or strategy?? In my opinion, this list of cards has more reason to be in every deck type than any other. Each player has their favorite cards that always make it in all decks, but there are only a few cards that really should be in all decks. I picked five cards that both sides have which do pretty much the same thing. Then the list has two specific DS cards and three specific LS cards. Read on to see why I picked each of these. And feel free to let me know of any other cards I might have missed when you review this article. (For those that haven&#39;t read my articles before, you will find that it can be hard to describe SWCCG in detail without using run-on sentences. For those grammer soldiers out there, please do your best to ignore the run-ons and enjoy the content about the game)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TOP 10 CARDS (In no specific order):<br />
<br />
<br />
1  Luke Skywalker (ANY version)  While most skilled players already know about why you should ALWAYS play at least one copy of Luke, it might not make sense to everyone. Most LS decks already have reason to play with a Luke. Rather you play space and need Luke Skywalker (v) or a Speeder deck that requires Commander Luke (v), or any Jedi based deck that uses Jedi Knight or Rebel Scout Luke. The majority of LS strategies dont make you think about putting a Luke in the deck. But there are a few decks that can get by without one. Agents in the Court, Datooine Base Operations, Hidden Base, and Echo Base Operations all can be played and win without Luke. The reason you want that one copy is for specific DS match-ups. The biggest being Bring Him Before Me. Your Destiny can literally win games for BHBM. Having to lose 3 Force the entire game just because you dont play with Luke can really hurt. Agent of the Black Sun also causes direct damage while Luke is not at a battleground site. For those decks that you just dont need a Luke, go ahead and put 1x Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. He is a 6 destiny for the deck, and subtracts 3 from being crossed over, making him a great defense for both BHBM and Huntdown. If you want to get more use out of a Luke. Playing with at least 1x Luke Skywalker (v) makes great sense in all space decks since he retrieves and pulls All Wings Combo. Then you also have EPP Luke for a quick lightsaber strike in battle. No matter which Luke you go with, the point is simply dont EVER forget to pack that 1x Luke or you might find yourself losing to a match-up that would have been an auto win. <br />

2  Imperial Decree (v)  Truly a great card for DS. ID (v) is the best way to get around direct damage for DS. This Immune to Alter Effect provides an answer to LS decks that choke Force and cause direct damage without interaction. If the LS plays Revolution on all your locations, and provides no battlegrounds..no problem, ID (v) lets you lose 1 Force to activate the LS icons. Then for each battleground you occupy (NOT control), you reduce LS direct damage AND Force drains at non-battlegrounds to a minimum of 1. So no matter what DS deck you play with, there is never a reason to leave this card out of your deck. WHAP, Test 6, Profit, Speeders, Legendary Starfighter, Advantage, etc all cause direct damage. While you can also play with Imperial Propaganda (v), it can be canceled with Control, this card has NO counter as long as you occupy those battlegrounds. The LS has MANY ways to cause direct damage. Dont lose because of it. ALWAYS play this card. <br />

3  It Could Be Worse  Long has this card been a staple for the LS. Going back to the original Premiere set. ICBW is a Used Interrupt that says simply, WHENEVER you must lose X Force, you may pay X Force to cancel it. Even though the action is NOT considered canceling the damage, so it gets around protection texts in Bane (v) or Walkers which says drains and bonuses may not be modified or canceled. No other card has more power and versatility than ICBW. No matter how the loss is caused. Force drain, Odds, Blowing the Shields, losing a Duel, Occupation damage, even your own card. It can all be canceled by simply USING FORCE!!! There is never a situation where it would be a bad idea to cancel Force loss against you. No other Interrupt makes more sense for LS than this one. Because of how powerful this card is, the DS will choose to grab it more than any other. So the LS can build a strategy around another powerful Interrupt leaving it free to play all game (unless they play multiple grabbers) OR you get to abuse this card all game should they grab another Interrupt. Paired with Threepio WPS or Mirax, this card can get around ANY damage the DS might be causing then pulled back into hand for repeat effect. Just make sure to look out for Its Worse, which is the DS #1 answer to ICBW. Its Worse is probably the ONLY reason ICBW has not be given an errata after all these years. The problem is the DS is not as common to be playing Its Worse since it has no other bonus to a DS deck besides the Combo version also allowing you to shuffle any deck. The idea when playing this card is to wait and see what kind of deck the DS is playing and then unleash this card on them. More often than not, you will hear, NO, I grabbed the wrong thing! Since this card does not require you to have anything set up on the table or play any additional cards for it to work, there is just no reason that at least 1x should go in ALL LS decks. <br />

4  We Must Accelerate Our Plans (DS) or We Wish to Board at Once (LS)  These cards are listed together because they do almost the exact same thing only downloading different cards since they are made for different sides of the Force. WMAOPs & WWTBAO are Used Interrupts that can upload ANY Effect from your Reserve to your hand by paying 3 Force. They were made to be the Coruscant version of Twilek Adviser (DS) & The Signal (LS) from Jabbas Palace. The ability to set up your deck and find those key Effects can be done with either. For the new or returning player, the common Twilek & Signal provide a cheap option for finding your Effects. While WMAOPs & WWTBAO are both rare, they are way more useful and deck friendly. The reason you should ALWAYS play WMAOPs or WWTBAO in their place is because these cards also download specific cards for Free, so once you are finished finding your Effects, you can play them Used to put a destiny 5 back in your deck and put a card down from your hand for FREE without having to play the 3 Force. All of this text is well known from current players, but this article has to explain the reason for each card on this list. At least 1x should be in your DS/LS deck if you play ANY Effect which you dont start with or is pulled by another card that is already on the table. Now-a-days, we dont see many decks that can win without playing a few key Effects, thus this card MUST be in every deck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5  Out of Commission & Transmission Terminated  The reason this LS combo Interrupt made the list is simply because Huntdown has always been a top tier 1 deck for DS. Many players may argue they have enough spies in their deck to always cancel the Visage without worrying about having to play this card. The problem is you never know what kind of Huntdown you might play against. I remember playing a version that would start Power of the Hutt and first turn put Ephont Mon at the Holotheatre so no spy could ever deploy or move to that site. It was not full proof, but neither are spies when it comes to always getting that Visage off the table. Now if it wasnt enough to be able to cancel Visage, this Interrupt can also cancel The Phantom Menace and Image of a Dark Lord (not played that much, but still). Then you have the OOC part of the card which lets you place a random card from the opponents lost pile out of play, always a game changing event. How often have Maul or Vader been killed of the table early or lost to a random top drain, and you had that random 50/50 chance to place him out of play for the entire rest of the game. All because of this Used 5 destiny Interrupt. Some LS decks must play with 2x or even 3x of these to have a chance of winning, but there is just no reason to ever play any LS deck without 1x of this card. Rather you want to cancel Visage late game or early to keep from taking all that early damage. While Huntdown stays powerful as a solid DS tournament option, and placing cards out of play continues to be a powerful aspect, one of these MUST be in your deck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6  Ghhhk (DS) & Houjix (LS)  For almost as long as the game has existed, these cards have been seen in all different types of decks as an insurance policy to a random beatdown. Ghhhk & Houjix are the exact same card for both sides of the Force. This Lost Interrupt says you lose no more battle damage after completely forfeiting your cards from a location after losing a battle. Rather the beatdown was a surprise or the character was only battling to kill one or more specific characters, this Interrupt provides the safety net. Many decks these days dont play these cards, but no matter what your strategy is, there is never a game where a beatdown is not possible (unless your deck NEVER battles). For that reason alone, at least one copy of this card should always find its way into your deck. Either in the deck itself or under your Starting Effect to be played with Ive Lost Artoo (v) (DS) or Meditation (v) (LS), there will always be a game when you will need this card to keep from losing the game. Because these cards are Dejariks, Masteful Move (DS) & Escape Pod (v) (LS) can pull them into your hand. No matter your strategy, at least one of these cards has more reason than any other to be in your deck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7  You Are Beaten (DS) & Clash of Sabers (LS)  The main reason these cards made the list is because the majority of decks these days play with sabers. These Interrupts allow your character with a saber present to pay 2 Force to exclude from battle ANY character present at the site until the end of your NEXT turn. No drawing destiny, no restriction as to what character can be targeted (unless the character itself is immune like Lord Maul or Master Qui-Gon). The card doesnt even restrict when it can be played. So you can choose to play it after the opponent battles you or even right after you hit a character to make them immediately lost. The ability to exclude is the most powerful reason to play this card, but there is another reason. Each card also cancels a powerful Effect. YRB (DS) cancels Uncontrollable Fury and COS (LS) cancels Presence of the Force. So while it might seem like you would only play these cards in decks with ground and sabers, they do have reason to be played in decks that dont play sabers. COS (LS) probably has more reason in decks that need to get around POTF like MWYHL or Menace Fades. YAB (DS) wouldnt make as much sense in alien or SYCFA decks that dont play sabers or any Vader. The power of these cards in decks that do play sabers makes it worth putting on this list. If you cant find room in your deck, you can always add one under your Starting Effect to be played with Ive Lost Artoo (v) (DS) or Meditation (v) (LS). So while the other cards on this list are black & white cards that should be in ALL decks, at least one of these cards should be in all decks that play any type of saber, even if you only play 2x EPP Mara (v) in your alien deck. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
8  Cold Feet (v) (DS) & I Dont Need Their Scum, Either (v) (LS)  These cards are probably the newest to the game of all that were placed on this list. They were released in V11 due to the overwhelming need of the ability to play more than just 3 to 4 Defensive Shields per game from under your Starting Effect. At this point in the game, shield busting decks were becoming very popular as a deck that would play too many strategies for the opponent to cancel with a limited # of shields. Even now the most popular shields played in a game are Grabber, SAC, Battle Plan/Order, & Secret Plans/Aim High. That means once those popular shields were in play, the rest of the game could play Odds, Podracing, Combat, Retrieval, etc. Cold Feet (v) (DS) & I Dont Need Their Scum, Either (v) (LS) are Used 5 destiny Interrupts that allow the player to either play any Defensive Shield OR take any Grabber into hand from under your Starting Effect. They also have the ability to cancel specific cards for each side. CF (v) (DS) cancels Yerga Mig, Surprise Assault, & It Can Wait and Suspends Bacta Tank, Goo Nee Tay, Bo Shuda, or No Questioned Asked for remainder of turn. IDNTCE (v) (LS) cancels Counter Assault, Hidden Weapons, Overload, Id Just as Soon Kiss a Wookiee, Hutt Smooch, or a react involving an Independent starship. Of all the cards listed on this top 10, at least one of these cards should ALWAYS be included in ALL swccg decks. There will never be a game where the ability to play an extra shield OR cancel a key card will not be needed. Dont you EVER forget a copy of this card in your deck. (As an added note to these cards, the DS has a huge advantage since Cold Feet (v) is NOT unique while IDNTSE (v) is unique)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
9  Monnok (DS) & Grimtaash (LS)  Sooner or later these cards had to be placed on this list. Also going back to A New Hope, Monnok (DS) & Grimtaah (LS) have been a staple to SWCCG. These Interrupts have both a Used & Lost function. The Used says if your opponent has 13 or more cards in hand, you may place all but 8 randomly in Used pile. The Lost says you may pay 4 Force to reveal opponents hand. Any cards opponent has two or more of are LOST. When the game was new, a player had no choice but to draw up cards in order to set up a strategy. Many times it wouldnt take any time before a player had 15 to 20 cards in their hand. These cards have been there to either reduce the hand or punished them for drawing up so much by causing their doubles that happen to get drawn to all be Lost. Year after year, the game has always changed, but there is almost no deck that exists today that plays 100% no doubles. And even though the game has many ways to download or pull the majority of your strategy without having to draw, there will always be times when the opponent draws up 13+ cards in order to find that key card to counter a specific strategy. These cards will continue to be a game changing card, and the #1 reason a player will ask how many cards in your hand? Just like Ghhhk or Houjix, these cards are also Dejariks, so they can also be pulled by Masterful Move (DS) & Escape Pod (v) (LS). Of all the cards listed on this list, these are probably the most likely to not been seen in as many decks, but there is always a good reason to put one in every deck, never a bad idea. (The combo versions of both cards can be pulled from Reserve with Crush the Rebellion (DS) & Scrambled Transmission (non-V) (LS), both these Effects are Immune to Alter so they can be started at the beginning of the game)  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
10  Masteful Move / Masterful Move & Endor Occupation  Ending this top 10 list is the DS Used Interrupt that has no reason not to be in every single dark deck built today. There are many reasons to play this card, but the main reason will always be to cancel the way overpowered LS Effect Mantellian Savrip. Savrip allows the LS to forfeit characters/starships/vehicles from hand in place of attrition and/or battle damage in losing battles. This means no matter how much power or destinies the DS produces, if the LS has Savrip in play and enough stuff to forfeit in hand, the DS player can never remove the LS characters/starships/vehicles from table short of using a weapon or random ability like Choke Vader. Savrip allows TRMs to stay alive with just Home One against a DS space deck that has 20+ Star Destroyers. When you combine Savrip with any type of retrieval, the LS player will never leave the table. Masterful Move is also a 6 or 5 destiny and can be played to take into hand any Hologram or Dejarik from your Reserve deck. The Combo version also cancels Tatooine, Cloud City, and Coruscant Celebration, which can be very hard to cancel otherwise if you arent playing a DS space deck. Many DS decks will be playing 2x of this card if they fear Savrip or the Celebration cards. Rather your DS deck is unique or some new weird strategy. At least 1x Masterful Move OR Masteful Move Combo should be in your deck. No matter what anyone says, there is never a reason to get beat by a LS Savrip deck. (Also, if your deck really fears Savrip, make sure to also play 2x Controls so you dont end up having your Masteful Move Grabbed and Sensed by the LS leaving the Savrip in play all game)<br />

Well, there you have it. Nothing really educational for the old players, but hopefully you enjoying reading and agreeing / disagreeing with my opinion of the Top 10 cards that all decks should play. Please stay tuned for more articles. I will always enjoy writing about SWCCG. May it never truly die!!!<br />
