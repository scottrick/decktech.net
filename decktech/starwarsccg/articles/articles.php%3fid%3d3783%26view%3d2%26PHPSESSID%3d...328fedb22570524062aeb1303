In some ways, a high level player should feel obligated to share their knowledge and help advise advancing players as they try to rise to the top. I recently re-read such a contribution, originally by Clint Hays, re-cast by Casey Barson, in which he talks about how to elevate one&#146;s game. I found myself agreeing with several points, and disagreeing strongly with others. This is what I think is necessary to go all the way in a tough environment.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#1: Play to win.<br />
<br />
Otherwise known as giving a damn, it is imperative that every game, you play to win. 100%. This is important above all else. If you don&#146;t play to win every game, every situation possible, you won&#146;t become a top-level player.<br />
<br />
I will draw analogies from my own experience to help illustrate my points throughout this article.<br />
<br />
I am a violinist. One thing I have found in recent years is that how I practice sets the stage for what I need to do later on. If I learn a piece in a careless way, am negligent of bad intonation, am faulty with my rhythm IN EVEN THE SMALLEST FRACTION -- this comes back to bite me later on. <br />
<br />
SWCCG is no different. When playing a game -- this especially applies to non-tournament games -- it is important to stretch the mind and try your best to win every scenario. If you try something and it doesn&#146;t work, go back and fix it. Try something new. Don&#146;t let it slide and do it better next time. Subconsciously, you are practicing the wrong thing -- you are imprinting in your mind a losing situation. Do it good then -- take moves back, rethink another way to do it -- get it right. So when something similar happens in a setting where it matters, you have seen the pattern before and know how to handle it. But first, you have to care enough to do it right.<br />
<br />
*Note -- implied in this is that you do everything in your power to win WITHIN THE RULES. Never is stacking the odds in your favor by any means legitimate.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#2: Know the cards.<br />
<br />
Clint was right on when he said this. I will combine this into one category: know everything. Some people find this easier than others. Some can rattle off the lore on some obscure A New Hope card, while others struggle to remember the destiny on a well-used interrupt. Whatever it takes, know all the cards. This will help in several ways:<br />
<br />
@You will know better what to expect. If you know all the cards, you will automatically know which ones people use and which will never see the light of day. Then you can plan ahead and in any given situation, expect the worst. By doing so, if it doesn&#146;t come, you will be ahead every single play, because you already took it into consideration.<br />
<br />
@Being saved by obscure gametext. Correction: supporting game text on every card can drastically alter a situation if you don&#146;t treat it as such. There is no such thing as obscure game text.<br />
<br />
For example, Dodge subtracts three from every weapon destiny draw on that targetting. ANH Grimtaash cancels Molator. The people that know this in the heat of the moment like it&#146;s common knowledge won&#146;t break under the pressure. It also helps immensely when you have two more card slots and five potential options. Pick the cards that can do the most.<br />
<br />
@Memorization of numbers and cards themselves. Often overlooked, always underestimated. If you can&#146;t write your decklist from memory, be able to do it. Ideally you should be able to write it out by card type, in alphabetical order, by destiny number -- all of the above. You will know your deck inside out and not hesitate at all when you draw your Twi&#146;lek -- you&#146;ll know which of your 11 effects will help you most in the current situation. <br />

Along these lines, know exactly how your destiny is split up. Programs like Deckmaker help immensely. If you know you have nine 1-destiny cards and 4 are deployed, 3 are lost and one is in your hand, then if you only need to draw a 3 on two swings, your odds are good. If you don&#146;t know, then you have to resort to searching for something, which messes up stacked destinies, leaves you open to Changing the Odds, etc. Nothing in your favor. John Hawkins and Chris DeNoma have taken this category to another level. This is a huge part of what makes them such elegant players; they not only have their destinies memorized, by mid-game, they&#146;ll have yours, too. <br />

#3: Think ahead. <br />
<br />
Think things through before you commit to an action. If you have P-59 in battle with two opponents&#146; characters, think to yourself: which guy would I rather have lost? Which guy is it imperative that I hit? Don&#146;t just go for the guy with the lower defense value because you have a higher chance of hitting him. Better yet, if you know your destinies, sometimes it may be better not to fire if you need that high destiny so you won&#146;t take overflow, or to force him to lose the bigger-forfeit guy. Plan ahead; know what your opponent&#146;s response will be to all situations. It&#146;s possible to break down every given situation into smaller games. In a battle, you have the situation where you draw a 7. You have the situation when you draw a 0. You can miss, or hit. Know what his response will be to each avenue and then choose accordingly. But don&#146;t neglect one or two or you just cut off your options.<br />
<br />
This can and must be extended to situations before the game. It is most important that it be done in a broad, vague way; specifics can come later. Know how your deck responds to pressure, as in a game vs a Hunt Down deck. Think about how you will handle that. Think about what you&#146;ll need to do in the long run when both sides are down to ten force. This lends tremendously to last-minute deck changes and meta calls. If you know your deck has a weakness in the long haul (like Watto), you may need to support it with a bigger force of guys.<br />
<br />
This rule is incredibly underestimated. If you can&#146;t playtest, this is a fantastic substitute. Cover all possibilities in your mind and when you see it in front of you, you&#146;ll know how to respond. It becomes automatic. If you go into a tournament thinking you have enough power to handle anything on the ground, you will be wrong. It&#146;s guaranteed! Some guy will have thought past what you can throw at him and have the extra jabronie spy to drain at your 2/0 when all your guys are down. That guy will be 2000+.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#4: Be courteous.<br />
<br />
If you are a @#$%, please skip to #5.<br />
<br />
This is more a mental thing than anything else. There are two ways to play: aggressively, or non-aggressively. I have always been a passive advocate of being courteous to one&#146;s opponent. I think it&#146;s important that you give your opponent room to breathe, time to think, a chance to take back the last action. You never know when you may need that extra room or take-back, and nothing will give it to you faster than quid pro quo.<br />
<br />
Patience is a virtue. Nothing can ice someone more than staring across the table at a guy who is in total control even though the game has just begun. Look at Martin Akesson play. The guy gives me the chills. Then look at someone who has the reputation of being loud and/or obnoxious. Respect is obviously the issue, and one party has much more than the other. Not only is it perhaps nicer to play with decency, but it can be a strategic advantage as well.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, if someone is being a rules lawyer with you, I think it is necessary to return the favor if he ever asks for a favor from you. Quid pro quo all the way.<br />
<br />
Also very important: being courteous will increase your good reputation. The world of SWCCG is very small and ever shrinking. Having a good reputation can be your ticket to many different places, and you may find yourselves at events you would not be able to attend otherwise if people like you. People won&#146;t like you if you play like a @#$%. So treat them well and the favor will be returned.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#5: Track.<br />
<br />
Enough has been written on this topic that has been of excellent quality. I have nothing new to add. I should reiterate the importance of it though: there&#146;s never too much tracking! I have played games where I tracked one six the entire way through, and others where I only tracked &quot;when I needed to.&quot; There is never a time when you don&#146;t need to, however, so this is a slippery statement. At any rate, the better you are at this, the better you will do in games. There is definitely a direct correlation in the level of tracking and the level of winningness (if there is such a thing).<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#6: Be versatile.<br />
<br />
This is the direct opposite from Clint&#146;s rule #7, which is &quot;Play your Game.&quot; I used to see it like that, but then came several games in which I was incapable of adopting a different strategy, and I lost because of it. I think playing your own game is important, but you must be able to switch to a different game on a moment&#146;s notice.<br />
<br />
I doubt many people will agree so I will try to illustrate a little better. Different decks are played one particular way so often that most people think that is the only way the deck can be played. This should totally work toward your advantage. For example, Lightsaber combat is almost always used to apply early pressure. Get Lord Maul down quick, put his saber on him, and you&#146;re cooking. But it can be played just as effectively if you wait for your opponent to make the first move, and react to his play. Similarly, Ralltir Ops was so good because of the flexibility it allowed: you could play to flip it quick, or you could play to flip securely, or anywhere in between. How you played the deck was much more important than the actual cards.<br />
<br />
In history, those with power who were not capable of adapting with the times either were brushed aside or were forced to ultimately adapt to changing standards. The old Catholic Church was unable to adapt to the demands of the time (Martin Luther&#146;s 95 Theses) and ultimately the Council of Trent was necessary to reform the church. If you want another example, pick a king whose head was chopped off during a period of civil unrest. Similarly, a Star Wars game can find itself heading to the guillotine if a player is unable to adapt. The ability to be versatile is incredibly important.<br />
<br />
=======<br />
#7: Keep cool.<br />
<br />
Don&#146;t panic. This one&#146;s simple. Even if your opponent comes down with a slew of guys (where&#146;s that N&#146;gok?), plays a bunch of interrupts that reduces your character pile at that location to a lone Saurin, and then makes him forfeit 0 to boot, don&#146;t sweat. You&#146;ll find your way much easier if you&#146;re not helping your opponent by beating yourself. No regrets, and don&#146;t look back. There is only the rest of the game ahead of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
=======<br />
These strategies should put you well on your way to becoming more consistent, better at tackling new problems, and in better control of the situation, whatever it may be. Comments and suggestons welcome! Just remember that you&#146;ve never reached the height of your game. You won&#146;t ever, either. The moment you think you&#146;re playing your best, you&#146;re already on the way down. And there is no legacy -- you may have accomplishments under your belt and feel like you&#146;re the @#$%. But people never remember anything. All there is is what is still left to be done. Keep improving your game.<br />
