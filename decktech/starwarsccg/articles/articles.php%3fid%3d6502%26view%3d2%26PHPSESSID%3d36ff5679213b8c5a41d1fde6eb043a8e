This should give us a detailed look for people outside of Utah to see what the options for it being held here.  <br />
<br />
1st off, I want to know who would be willing to do the Utah event.  Please either post here or email me, I need to get some numbers to make sure it works.<br />
<br />
2nd off, I wanted to say the Main event would be on Saturday.  We could have a sealed deck or DS2 Starter deck event when the Finals are going on for everyone else.  Friday night and/or Saturday we can hold different events:  JP OTSD sealed deck, DS2 Sealed Deck, Draft with just about any set or sets, V-6 4-6 round event, another Regular 4-6 round event.  <br />
<br />
Im thinking something like a V-6 event on Friday night, Main event Saturday morning and then some form of sealed event that night as the Finals go on and then Sunday morning holding another regular tournament before people had to fly or drive back Sunday night.<br />
<br />
<br />
Salt Lake City:<br />
Our best bet for holding an event here is at the University of Utah campus.  I dont have any contacts here but I know a guy that runs events at their ballroom all the time who could get me in contact the person we need, we could probably get a big schoolroom for the event or small area.  Im guessing this would be a cheap place to play too, Id have to find out more, but Im guessing it would either be free or cheap.  The Uofrimbazelampus is amazing, its really beautiful and big, the student center is amazing with bowling/food/games all in one area.  Im not sure on hotels but there are some great food and hang out places near by including coffee shops, not sure on bars and such though, but since its close to the campus, Im sure there is.  We should be able to do this Fri-Sun<br />
<br />
The U is close to the airport, maybe 20 miles or less away, its also very close to downtown, giving you full access to the SLC nightlife.  While most people will joke about this, the nightlife in SLC is actually very much alive.  My wife and I were just downtown recently for a show and it was packed, with lots of clubs/bars/restaurants packing people in, including a great pizza place we went to, all near downtown.  Its very much alive at night, so no worries of it being dead.  Probably not as exciting as somewhere like New York downtown, but for SLC, its very active.  <br />
<br />
Total cost, should be under 200 or even free to run.<br />
<br />
<br />
South of Downtown SLC<br />
South of Salt Lake in Murray Utah at www.TheBlackRose.com Game center.  <br />
Im friends with the owner, they used to run all the WOTC events in the state and currently runs the big UD and just about every other games events.  I ran LOTR TOC here and they were free for the 9 of us.  Im sure with a bigger event, it would cost something but Im sure we could work it out, they also have plenty to buy from CCGs/Card Sleeves/Board Games/Comics and if I can guarantee them business, Im sure they would like that.  So Im guessing I could get this for about 100 bucks.  We need to give them time to make sure they dont plan anything else or at least have the space for us.  They actually own two shops next to each other, one is filled with only tables and the other is half tables half store, so we could probably just use the full store side and have it all to ourselves.  They have drinks and candy at the store and are close to fast food places, parking is bad though.  We would have this place Fri-Sun, they have no one in on Sundays so we could hold some fun events.<br />
<br />
This is about 15 minutes or so outside of downtown SLC by freeway and about 20 by city streets, so about 30 from the airport.  There are cheaper hotels nearby that would range in the 50 range up to 100, most are around 80 for a nice place.  This area is more on the boarder of the not-as-nice area of SLC.  There are bars somewhat close by, a strip club about two blocks from the club.  Its still close enough to downtown SLC so that you can enjoy all of that still.  <br />
<br />
Im guessing under 100 to run for the weekend, maybe even free.<br />
<br />
<br />
Provo<br />
Ive already talked to a hotel in Provo about doing a comic show there and its 100 bucks a day for their conference area which is really big, includes chairs and tables, we would be fine holding it here.  Im sure they could give us good rates too depending on how many we get and the conference room.  This is a really nice area of town, next to a lot of restaurants and a mall across the street.  The hotel is right off the freeway.  We could hold a Friday event at BYU or the local Library which are just nearby and those should be free, holding a Sunday event would be tougher in Provo as just about everything is closed.  So Saturday would be at the Hotel and the other days would have to be other places around town.  The hotel will be nice since its so close to things as well as being able to just go downstairs in the hotel for the event.  <br />
<br />
This is about an hour away from the airport and downtown SLC.  Its located right by BYU and downtown Provo.  The downtown strip of Provo has two bars and a lot of little music stores where there are always concerts going on weekend nights, so you can catch some great local music and we get bands from all over coming in too.  <br />
<br />
Im guessing we will get the most Utah players to the event if it is held in Provo vs. anywhere else.  <br />
<br />
Shouldnt be more than 100 dollars to run the event.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Other Pros:<br />
Should get around 10-18 Utah Players, hopefully even Todd  2006 State Champ  Darkness, and the St. George Southern Utah Group with Jaron Janson  Jerba, Id expect at least 10 guys for the main event if not more.  We will get more local Utah players if its in Provo than in SLC.  <br />
<br />
Park City is about an hour away from all three locations, Park City is awesome and a blast to hang out downtown.  I hear the nightlife is amazing there, Ive only gone during the film festival and thats a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Mountains/hiking/biking, if youre into this sort of thing, it would be a great time to come and do this.  <br />
<br />
Airport is a Delta hotspot and flights are usually cheap especially this far in advance.  Airport is close to the UofU.  <br />
<br />
There are Malls and shopping here that is relatively cheap compared to other cities, you wont pay as much to eat here, usually a high cost restaurant is in the mid twenties for an amazing meal.  <br />
<br />
Cheaper for a hotel and running an event than Vegas.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
You will probably not get the Utah players to the Sunday event, so this could be an event with just players from other places.  This could add a twist to the weekend and could be fun.  Im guessing about 75% of the Utah players that show up for other events, will not show up for this.<br />
<br />
Not as close to the other player bases as Vegas is if you are driving.<br />
<br />
Not as many hotspots as Vegas, the nightlife isnt the same.<br />
<br />
No gambling.<br />
<br />
I hear the alcohol takes you longer to get drunk here.  I dont know if this is true or not.  There are still plenty of places where you can get alcohol.  Smoking is banned at every restaurant and from what I understand, you cant smoke in bars, dont know if this is true or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prices to consider for the event.<br />
Cost for event will probably be between $0-200.<br />
Ultimate Prize Package with V card and Glass is $198<br />
2007 National Championship is $200<br />
<br />
So the total cost to hold the event look to range from $398-$598.  Of course the cheaper it is, the more prizes and what not could be given away.<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me why the West National Championship is listed at $200 when the East is listed as $50 and the European one is listed as $40?<br />
<br />
Ultimate Package includes:<br />
<br />
Winner of event gets a V-card design and Glass trophy <br />
6 uncut sheets <br />
1 random booster box (Endor, Reflections I, Special Edition, or Tatooine) <br />
4 random OTSD (or JPOTSD) individual boxes <br />
1 random Epp/EJP/ECC tuck packs <br />
6 tournament foils <br />
Posters/pins/etc <br />
3 Virtual Card Cutsheet Sets <br />
5 rare Coruscant cards with 5 total common/ucommon also<br />
<br />
National Western Championship<br />
This is for the 2007 US National Championships West. Two automatic bids to World Championship Day 2 issued and first place will receive the 2007 US National Champion Trophy for each event. <br />
<br />
<br />
Entry fee Options:  <br />
<br />
We need to cover the cost here $398-$598, anything over will give us either more prizes, cash for 1st and 2nd, and whatnot.<br />
<br />
$20 dollars, we would need 20-30 players just to cover the cost, <br />
<br />
$25 dollars, we would need 16  24 players needed to cover cost<br />
<br />
$30 dollars, we would need 13  20 players needed to cover the cost<br />
<br />
$35 dollars, we would need 12  17 player needed to cover the cost<br />
<br />
I think if we did something where its $20 for Utah players and $25 for everyone else that we would have a good turnout from the local guys and that shouldnt be too much for everyone else.  So we would need at least 20-30 players.<br />
<br />
Boxes that could easily be added to the prize pool, these boxes will be put in at the price I paid for them, so they are going in the cheapest I have gotten them.  Coruscant, Tatooine, Cloud City Enhanced, A New Hope.  I have everything else but these would be the top boxes that I would like to see given out, all other boxes could be added at the plus 5% price over what I paid, so its still cheap, so we could get a lot of extra product if we get a lot of people, I have everything including a Ref 3 box we could put in.  Haha.  I will also put out my box of non-NM rares and let people pick out a certain amount from there; there are plenty of great cards in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as Cash Prizes:  We could easily give first place $150 and second $50, of course this will be easier to do if we dont have to pay for our place to play.  If we do have to pay, we could still fit this in.  If the PC wants to help and donate some money, that would be great too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone like LTG could make it so he could help judge some events.  Ryan who has already got a bye into Day 2 could help out with events.  I can judge events but Id like to be able to get a chance at the Day 2 and whatnot.  I have no problem helping do everything else though.  <br />
<br />
As well as this there would be plenty of product.  I give all the Utah guys 5% over my normal box price and that price will be good for this and all singles will be at the Utah discount of 20% off my C1G price.  So if you need something last minute, I can help.<br />
<br />
The side events like sealed deck would be $5.00 - $10, with everything over cost either going to prizes or help to add to the pot on Saturday or the cost of where we are playing.  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or suggestions, please post them or let me know, I would like to get something in place for this event if we choose to do it in Utah.  I can provide boxes and such if we do it in Vegas but there will be a lot more free stuff if we do it in Utah.<br />
