Heres her game text:<br />
<br />
Princess Leia Organa (v)<br />
Destiny: 1<br />
Unique, Rebel, Pilot, Warrior<br />
Power: 3, Ability: 4, Deploy: *, Forfeit: 7<br />
*Deploys free only as an escorted captive of Jabba or a bounty hunter. Strangle can target an escort (even if not alone) and your destiny draw with it is +1. If released, escort is lost and you may retrieve any 3 cards (except Strangle).<br />
<br />
The bit that hadnt registered with me was the escort is lost part. Now surely (I thought to myself) this must be huge, so I went off and read the rules about captives and their escorts and admittedly theres a couple of things there that work in her favour, like the fact that characters cant normally be transferred between escorts, and when shes released she can go off to the used pile to be deployed again next turn via Seeking An Audience (v). Of course, for this to work, you have to be playing a Profit deck, but thats really where she belongs anyway. <br />
<br />
OK, that was the good news. Now for the bad! I searched all the decks on decktech for ones that listed Princess Leia Organa (v) or PLO (v) and found a grand total of one. Out of nearly 16,000 decks only one person has ever listed her!! Indeed, even the non-v version has seen very little gameplay action, being included in less than 5 decks since the end of 2002. So whats the problem? First, lets read the most obvious card that works with her, Strangle: <br />
<br />
Strangle<br />
Destiny: 7<br />
Unique, Lost Interrupt<br />
Target an escort alone and its captive. Draw destiny. Escort lost if destiny + captive&#39;s power > escort&#39;s ability + power. OR During a battle at a site where Leia is an escorted captive, add one battle destiny.<br />
<br />
Not overly inspiring, huh. At least we can now use it even if the escorts not alone. Still, lets look at using it against Jabba: Leia has power 3, versus Jabbas ability 4 + power 3 = 7. OK, so a destiny draw of 4 would now be enough to kill him, since PLO (v) adds one to the draw. Oh, but if you fail, tough luck  the interrupt is lost! Not great if you ask me. And by the time youve managed to draw strangle (I couldnt find anything that would pull it) and set up a tracked 4 (what are the chances of drawing a blind one in the average deck?), the game could easily be over.<br />
<br />
However, Strangle kills the escort anyway so I thought Id look for the cards that fitted well with the escort is lost text I mentioned earlier. With this in mind I went on a hunt for all the cards that release captives, and heres the major problem. The light side actually has very few ways to release captives other than killing the escort. So if were not using Strangle to release her and were going to have to kill the escort by some other method then the only bit of her game text thats any use is the very last bit  you can get ANY 3 cards back. But that IS worthwhile.<br />
<br />
But wait a minute, I just implied a second ago that there ARE a few ways to release a captive from its escort that dont involve simply killing the escort. One is the used function of the cloud city interrupt Captive Pursuit: If a battle was just initiated at a site, target a captive present. Captive released if you win battle. An ewok can also release a captive with Ewok Rescue, but they only deploy on Endor. The only other card that Ive found that can do it is the Arc Welder device from Jabbas Palace. Heres its game text:<br />
<br />
Arc Welder<br />
Destiny: 6<br />
Device <br />
Deploy on any R-unit droid. During your control phase, may use 2 Force to release an escorted captive present. Also, when present at start of a battle, may cause one opponent&#39;s character of ability = 1 present to be excluded from that battle.<br />
<br />
So, a breakthrough  a consistently usable way of releasing PLO (v) using Artoo! Just one minor flaw  your droid has to be present with during your control phase. So you deploy PLO (v) on Jabba during your turn and he can then simply move from the Audience Chamber into the Dungeon next door and dump her there. See how you like them apples.<br />
<br />
OK, I thought  how do we get round this? Well, the creature Worrt prevents opponents characters from using their landspeed so that might be a possibility  I couldnt find another way to stop characters moving once they were already on table. But surely thats not going to stop the dark side  Worrt will be mincemeat as soon as hes attacked! True but what if there was a way to prevent him from being attacked? Well, it just so happens that there is  in the form of Rennek:<br />
<br />
Rennek<br />
Destiny: 2<br />
Unique, Alien, Warrior<br />
Power: 1, Ability: 1, Deploy: 2, Forfeit: 3<br />
Creatures at same site (except Sarlacc) do not attack and cannot be attacked. Up to three times per turn, may use 1 Force to cumulatively add 1 to his power for remainder of turn.<br />
<br />
Hmm so now we have a way to keep Jabba at the Audience Chamber, so long as we can keep Rennek alive. Theres a few ways to do this: the simplest is to deploy Bo Shuda, which prevents battles from taking place in the Audience Chamber while you have an alien present. Thats going to make freeing Han tricky, though. You could give Artoo a Fire Extinguisher, which can be lost to cancel a just-initiated battle, then use either Yoxgit or a Baragwin to get it back for you during your next control phase. Finally, you could deploy Caldera Righim, an alien whos game text states that: Unless Great Warrior on table, opponent must have total ability < 8 to initiate a battle at same site.<br />
<br />
Right, so now we have a way to keep Jabba where he is. Well, almost. Its only his landspeed he cant use, so he can still relocate with the Underground Passages game text, or use Elis Helrot to move away. Theres a few ways to deal with the latter  Insurrection (& Aim High), Its A Hit or Quite A Mercenary will all do it, and so would a Sic-Six deployed to the Audience Chamber. Its your choice. If you can deploy a version of Lando to the Underground Passages, that cancels the dark side game text too and Jabba will truly be stuck with is captive. However, if you were to deploy Lando then he would either need some bodyguards, or have to be an undercover spy. But theres a huge problem with this strategy because its almost a given that the dark side will deny you of Lando by deploying theirs either at the Audience Chamber during the starting setup, or during their first turn. So this isnt a reliable enough strategy and unless you have a backup plan you could give Jabba a way out (if he relocates to Underground Passages one turn, then the Dungeon next turn and Leia will be banged up good and proper again). You can get round this though, so long as you have a copy of You Will Take Me To Jabba Now in hand, which Artoo can use to follow Jabba:<br />
<br />
You Will Take Me To Jabba Now<br />
Destiny: 5<br />
Unique, Used Interrupt<br />
If Jabba is at a Jabba&#39;s Palace site, relocate one of your characters to that location from a related site. OR During your deploy phase, deploy one alien (at normal use of the Force) from Reserve Deck to the Audience Chamber, reshuffle.<br />
<br />
Of course theres going to be a few of these in the deck anyway to help pull the all the supporting aliens Ive already mentioned that we need.<br />
<br />
Right, so now we can abuse PLO (v) and deploy her, safe in the knowledge that her escort will die next turn? Well, almost. Theres one thing I havent covered yet, which is how you actually get the Arc Welder in to the Audience Chamber in the first place. The simple bit is pulling Artoo first turn with Seeking An Audience (v), using his game text next control phase to pull Hero Of A Thousand Devices and using that to grab the Arc Welder. The problem is Artoo is a spy and Ephant Mon can really hamper your efforts to get him an audience with Jabba. So, along comes Chewbacca, Protector (non-v)  again pullable with Seeking An Audience (v)  and cancels Ephant Mons game text. So long as you have one of your battle avoidance strategies in place, you (and Chewie!) will be fine.<br />
<br />
OK, so thats the strategy. Sorry its so long and involved. Hopefully Ive made it clear enough. Before I sign off, though, Im just going to list the cards (and a summary of their relevant game text) Ive already mentioned that you might need to run this strategy. However, this is not a deck post so Im not going to list every card Id put in the deck. Finally, theres some suggestions as to how the game might go for the first few turns. As its the simplest, Im going to use Bo Shuda as the battle canceling strategy   as I mentioned earlier, I dont necessarily think its the best option, but it is pullable quickly and therefore useful as an example.<br />

<br />
Starting (9):<br />
An Unusual Amount Of Fear + 8 Shields + 2 x Worrt (just in case one dies!)<br />
You Can Either Profit By This / Or Be Destroyed<br />
Tatooine: Jabbas Palace<br />
Jabbas Palace: Audience Chamber<br />
Han (v)<br />
Heading For The Medical Frigate<br />
Seeking An Audience (v) [pulls Artoo, Princess Leia Organa and Chewbacca, Protector]<br />
Tauntaun Bones (v) [pulls Worrt from under starting effect]<br />
Bargaining Table (v) [pulls Leslomy Tacema (v)]<br />
<br />
Characters (5):<br />
Artoo [pulls Hero Of A Thousand Devices]<br />
Chewbacca, Protector [cancels Ephant Mons game text]<br />
Leslomy Tacema (v) [pulls Bo Shuda]<br />
Princess Leia Organa (v) [the Jabba & bounty hunter killer!]<br />
Rennek [prevents creature attacks and attacks against creatures]<br />
<br />
Devices (1):<br />
Arc Welder [frees escorted captives during control phase]<br />
<br />
Effects (2):<br />
Bo Shuda [prevents battles in Audience Chamber if you have an alien there]<br />
Hero Of A Thousand Devices [pulls droid devices]<br />
<br />
Interrupts (about 7):<br />
You Will Take Me To Jabba Now (about 5 copies) [pulls aliens to Audience Chamber, relocates a character to Jabbas site]<br />
Its A Hit (x2) [cancels Elis Helrot]<br />
<br />
Suppose that the dark side starts with Jabba and Lando in the Audience Chamber, and has the effect that can pull Ephant Mon, Boelo, Bib, etc. so by the time its the light sides first turn they have Jabba, Ephant Mon and Lando at the Audience Chamber (at the very least!). They may also have converted both your sites, but its nothing to get worked up about  you dont need that much force anyway!<br />
<br />
So first turn, we pull Artoo and deploy him to Tatooine: Jabbas Palace. Thats about it. Cost = 2 force.<br />
<br />
Dark side turn 2  by now they may well have the Dungeon and the Underground Passages on table. So pull Hero Of A Thousand Devices (which also pulls the Arc Welder), Leslomy Tacema (v) (who also pulls Bo Shuda) and Chewbacca, Protector. Deploy the characters and Bo Shuda at the Audience Chamber, and Hero Of A Thousand Devices and the Arc Welder on Artoo. Use Chewies game text to cancel Ephant Mons and move Artoo into the Audience Chamber. Cost = 6 force.<br />
<br />
If the dark side stays put, then next turn you can deploy Worrt to the Audience Chamber from under your starting effect, and Princess Leia Organa (v) as Jabbas captive, providing you have in your hand either Rennek or You Will Take Me To Jabba Now, which you can use to pull Rennek. Cost = 2 force. Importantly, though, you will need a copy of You Will Take Me To Jabba Now in your hand at the END of this turn so that if Jabba and Ephant Mon both go off to the Underground Passages then R2 and his Arc Welder can follow them (since Chewie will continue to cancel Ephant Mons game text, but only up to the end of the dark sides turn). And ideally, youd like to be holding some protection against Elis too.<br />
<br />
So there it is then. Thats maybe one way you could think about using Princess Leia Organa (v) to take apart a decent chunk of the dark sides alien forces (well, Jabba and any bounty hunters). Hopefully theres some ideas in this that you have found interesting and maybe you could make work. Ive only taken up 24 slots in the deck so far, at least 8 of which will be in just about any profit deck you care to look at, so you can customize the rest of it to fit with your personal preferences. The rest, as they say, is up to you<br />
