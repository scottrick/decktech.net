I asked Doug a series of questions that will enable you to get to know him better:<br />
<br />
	Tell me a bit about yourself;  Who is Doug Taylor?<br />
<br />
Well, its tough to condense everything into a short soundbite, so Ill try to summarize as best I can.  Im a Christian, a husband of an amazing wife, and a father of five incredible children.  Im a Custody Officer at our local County Jail, which means that basically I baby-sit adults for a living; Im also now a Guild representative (the equivalent of a shop steward) there.  Im big into gaming, not only CCGs but RPGs as well (face-to-face stuff, as opposed to computer or video games), and Im a huge fan of X-files, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Lost, and Heroes.<br />
<br />
	When did you first get involved with SWCCG?<br />
<br />
I got involved soon after the game came out.  I was a player of Star Trek CCG (also made by Decipher), so I used to frequent the old AOL message boards, which is where I first heard of the game.  I bought cards within a few days of them coming out (in December of 1995), but I didnt volunteer right away, actually.  When I finally stepped up to be a Tournament Director, I was inducted into Red Squadron.  And even though Id waited a good deal of time, I was one of the earliest members (which is how I got to choose Red 4, all that was taken at the time was Red 2,3, and 5).  I got more and more involved, eventually helping to turn my area (Seattle) into one of the biggest hotbeds for the game in the world.<br />
<br />
	What do you love about the game?<br />
<br />
I love that it does a great job of simulating the Star Wars universe.  To me its more than just a bunch of characters or ships or what-have-you.  Thats why, even though I love the mechanics, Wars didnt interest me.  I turned down the opportunity to playtest it and never even bought a single pack of cards, even though I think the actual *game mechanics* are the best of any CCG.  So its a combination of a great license with a fantastic game engine.  I love that you can build a deck around a certain theme, and I love that each game can be sort of a What If? in the Star Wars universe.  I love that it is a game that is dependent greatly on skill, but there is an element of chance in it as well.  I think the basic premise that each card is equal to one unit of life is brilliant, and I love how, when you really boil it down to its simplest, its a contest of territory, with each player trying to outdo the other by carefully utilizing ones resources.<br />
<br />
	Who are some of the people who have impacted you along the way?   <br />
<br />
There are so many.  My number one play partner for all of these years would be my oldest son Andrew (whos now 15); hes been playing (and beating adults) since he was 5 years old!  In the earliest days, some of my main antagonists and collecting buddies were Jim Lian and William Green.  Kyle Heuer was a big help and good friend at Decipher, and eventually I came to work side-by-side with many others there as well, such as Chuck Kallenbach, Juz Pakes, Tom Lischke, Joe Alread, Geoff Snider, and many more.  Squadron Members like Jim Colson, Winfried Sommerfeld, Gregg Keefer, and Tim Courtney were inspirational, and getting a chance to meet and playtest with early designer Jerry Darcy had a big impact on me.  There are so many good friends I made in the Seattle area that it would be tough to name them all.  Especially noteworthy ones would be Kirk Redrup, Gabe Alonso, Martin Norris, Eric Locken, Taylor Gardner, David Beaubier, James Canova, John Wartinger, Charlie Hankins, Chris Wirfs, Todd Soper, Joe Olson, and Michael Erisman.  Other friends from around the world include Steve Flores, Jason Kilby, John Hawkins, Greg Anderson, Jason Robinette, Scott Lingrell, Jerry Jensen, Peter Sundholm, Neal Razi, Mike Carr, Kevin Brownell, and Mike Girard.<br />
<br />
	What are some of the funniest moments in your SWCCG career?<br />
<br />
One of the funniest I can remember was a casual game with my friend Gabe Alonso.  He thought he had me completely destroyed.  He was LS and had just devoted everything towards a massive beatdown with a bunch of Mains and destiny adders.  Hed crushed what looked like a significant DS force (there was something like 3 Walkers and a number of Imperials).  I think he played the battle damage tripler, and the final tally was something like 150 to 50.  He goes to gather up his cards, just assuming that he won, and I said Ghhhk.  I just remember the flabbergasted look on his face; he couldnt believe that anybody would play a single copy of Ghhhk in a DS Imperial power deck loaded with Mains and Toys.  Another funny time was when my buddy William  my main sparring partner in the early days  finally beat me at a S/A/C war (though there was no Control back then).  I hadnt realized it, but I guess hed never beat me (whatever number of Senses and Alters people were playing with back then, Id just play with a few more).  He literally danced around his apartment in celebration!  Other notable funny times included Secret Squirrel and SW Trivia with the other Squadron Members at the first DecipherCon, and hanging out with the Decipher crew late into the night playing Pack Wars, doing karaoke, and watching Marcus Certa clown on everybody as he got more and more alcohol into his system.<br />
<br />
	What is your role in the PC today?<br />
<br />
Im one of the two Design Advocates (along with Scott Lingrell), so thats my main function.  So I design cards, oversee (along with Scott) the entire state of the game and other projects like player-created cards, and manage a Design Team.  I used to head up a number of other subcommittees, too, but weve redistributed and reorganized a lot of things and have a lot more people involved in leadership positions, so it makes may life easier.  Scotts been doing a lot of the stuff I used to do (like heading up the playtesting), so thats helped as well.  Theres still lots of continual decisions that need to get made by the Advocates that affect the entire game, and my work in Design keeps me very busy (Im the main one heading up Virtual Set #13, though Eric Olson is back and doing a lot of work and taking a leadership role as well).<br />

	What are the biggest opportunities for SWCCG right now?<br />
<br />
I still think we have the best CCG in the world.  So we always have the opportunity to draw new players and fans.  It sounds like a number of players are returning to the game right now, and I think we have a chance to continue to draw more of them back to the game as it appears that our efforts with the Redux have given us a very balanced and healthy meta.<br />
<br />
	What are the biggest challenges?<br />
<br />
As always with this game, the learning curve is one of the biggest challenges.  Another significant hurdle is the lack of some of the cards, especially those from later sets, being available for all players that want them.  The PC is continuing to work on both of these issues.  Charles Sonnenburg (Sonn) and his Rules Team have been hard at work further streamlining and refining the rules, and the PC is attempting to do what we can to put many of the hard to get Episode I cards into the hands of the players.  In addition, Design will continue to keep in mind what cards are more difficult to get, as we virtualize different rarities of cards.  We also always try to keep in mind how many copies of a particular card each player might want to acquire.  Thus, if we make a very valuable card that most players would likely want to have a couple of, then we try to make sure its a common from one of the more plentiful sets.<br />
<br />
	How would you respond to those who have criticized your card designs or approach?<br />
<br />
Im okay with those criticisms.  I am fully aware that I cant please all of the people all of the time, and I think weve got a large vocal contingent that tends to be fairly reactionary and pessimistic.  I almost chuckle when ANY card is revealed that is decently powered or somewhat strong.  Its not like a 99% chance that the playing community will squawk and say that its broken!, its 100%.  They did it with the EPPs and many other cards Decipher made, and they continue to do so with just about every set we make (some of the biggest complaints came with Leia, Han, and Tarkin.  Those sure turned out to be way overpowered, didnt they?   &#61514;)  Now, to be fair, there ARE some criticisms that have been fair and deserved.  I dont think weve done a very good job with our Objectives so far, at least not on the first (or often even the second) try.  All I can say is that well continue to do the best we can, and I think overall when you compare the stuff weve done with the stuff done by the designers of Decipher I think it can hold its own.  Were entering into our sixth year of doing this, and  though weve had to do some fine-tuning (with the Redux) and errata  I think the overall quality of our product speaks for itself.  Its a really fine line trying to make cards that are solid and playable and yet not so strong that they see play in EVERY deck.<br />
<br />
	What does success look like for V13?  How will we know if a v-set is successful?<br />
<br />
Success for V13 will be a bit different than for previous virtual sets, I think.  Initially with this set we tried to really stretch the boundaries a bit.  We tried out some new things and made some stuff a bit TOO strong, initially, and the playtesters were vehement in sending it back to us with some serious concerns.  We worked hard to scale a bunch of it back and the response is much better.  In addition to the different goals for this set, were still in the fixed meta that is the Post-Redux environment, and wed rather see the deckbuilding options OPEN UP as opposed to become smaller.  In a perfect world a good player would have at least a half dozen different deck options for each side.  By that I mean they should have at least 6 different decks that they feel like they could take to a local tournament or even a Regional and feel that they have a good shot of winning with.  Often that just isnt the case, but its something we strive hard for.  A virtual set is successful if it changes the playing environment (even just a little) and if it inspires people to build new decks, but NOT at the expense of disrupting things such that there are only a few decks (or even one) for each side.  Believe it or not, I have NEVER had the goal of having decks full of virtual cards.  I remember right after the introduction of virtual cards.  There was some public backlash and negativity in the playing community about the whole idea, and I would go to DeckTech and pull up the latest decks, just hoping to see a virtual card or two in them.  Some decks had none, but many had a few here and there.  As time has gone by, more and more theyve become accepted and integrated into decks.  But its always been our goal to continue to help older cards and decktypes, so if a deck only has a few virtual cards, then thats okay too.  For many CCG companies, the goal is to continually introduce cards that they want you to play with.  After all, their goal is to sell you more cards.  So if your latest deck is made up of 75% new stuff (from the last set or two), then they feel like theyve been successful.  But in our case, if we introduce a single virtual card that encourages you to experiment and play around with a completely new deck, then we look at that as a successful venture.<br />
<br />
	What are the best selling points of this game to get new players involved?<br />
<br />
Weve got a number of them, I think.  Not only do we have an incredibly intense and complex game that requires skill to master, but weve got a game that has ten times the strategy of many other games out there.  You can play (and be successful) even as a new player, and if you have the ability to track and think a few turns ahead, you can get even better.  A couple of other huge selling points are that we have a dedicated and passionate player base (who will help you acquire cards, answer your rules questions, and help you with deckbuilding and understanding the game better), we have the opportunity to be a designer yourself (via the player-created virtual cards), and we have a game that is reasonably cheap to get into.  Sure theres an initial cost to acquire old cards, but the reality is that  with new sets no longer being sold  the cards are very affordable.  Combine this with many people willing to help people get up to speed and its fairly economical, especially for a returning player who still has some cards.<br />
