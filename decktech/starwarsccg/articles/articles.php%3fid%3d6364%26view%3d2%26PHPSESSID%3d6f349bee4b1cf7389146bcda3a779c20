It is time for a history lesson. Through my years of playing SWCCG, I have noticed many things that have changed since Premiere hit the shelves back in December of 1995. In my growing efforts to educate those about the game through my articles, I have decided to create yet another article that can be used as a tool for those interested in the history of the game. This article will go through the entire history of the game. My goal here is to collect and store all important information about the game, and where it has come from. I wanted to create an article that a player could go to when he or she wanted to recall what the game was like in the earlier years. <br />
<br />
Many of you have been playing since the very beginning, and remember how very simple the game was back then. In this article, I have organized all the dates that the product was released. So finally we have one place that someone can go to do find out when a specifc set came out. Also, I decided to post the World Champion decks for both sides that were used to win the World title for that year. The first Worlds was in 1996, and took place at a time when only Premiere and A New Hope were out to play with. Since then, year after year, a new set has changed the way the game was played. I hope this article can give everyone a clear understanding of how very big and complex the game has become in its 10 years of existence. <br />
<br />
Because I had to go through 10 years, I broke it up into two parts so that I could go ahead and release the part that I had finished. I also wanted it to be easy for someone to use. So a two part history just seemed like a better idea. Part 1 goes from Creation in 1995 to the end of 2000 with Part 2 picking up in 2001 to current V sets. Also please forgive any grammer or mispelled words. Its hard to find all them mistake in an article this long.  If it seems like the layout for each decklist is different, it&#39;s because some were copy and pasted from Decipher&#39;s old website.<br />
<br />
To save space, I have replaced the following:<br />
<br />
Light Side = LS<br />
Dark Side = DS<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
10 Year History of SWCCG, Part I<br />
<br />
<br />
Chapter 1:        In the Beginning<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In December of 1995, right before Christmas, the Premiere set of 324 cards was released. The set was composed of cards taken from the original A New Hope movie providing players with their first version of Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia Organa, Han Solo, and C-3P0. The idea behind this set was to introduce the game as well as it could without being too complicated. By itself, Premiere was extremely basic and did require more cards to be truly effective. That is why in February of 1996, Decipher released a Two-player Introduction set as a tool to teach players how to play the game before a player spent a lot of money on the main set. The two player set included six unique cards that included a very weak version of Vader and Luke, which were created to be previews to the game, and were not truly playable in any deck. <br />
<br />
At this very early time, the game was so basic with only a few choices for sites and starships. The majority of games took place on the ground, and consisted of players activating, then saving force or immediately drawing up to find more sites to deploy. Once the DS got Darth Vader out, and the LS got Obi-Wan Kenobi out, the rest of the game was compiled of huge Sense/Alter wars until one side was left with no more Jedi powers. Jedi powers were so important to your deck, that literally 1/3 of it was just Senses and Alters. Usually, the war took place when the DS tried to play A Circle is Now Complete to immediately place the strongest LS character out of play. Of course, back then, the out of play rule had not been clarified, so many just believed that just that copy of Obi was out of play and another one could be played later in the game. Once the side had lost the S/A war, the rest of the game was draining or setting up a beatdown with Ellis Helrod / Nabrun Leids to move characters all around the table. To follow this first set in April of 1996, was the Jedi Pack with 11 unique cards, most of which had no game text. In that same month, Decipher released the two Rebel leader ships; Red Leader in Red 1 and Gold Leader in Gold 1. Both the Jedi Packs and Leader ships were not sold in stores. They were given out at demos and tournaments to players as they learned to play the game.  <br />
<br />
As the months went by, the game got a huge boost in July of 1996 with the introduction of the A New Hope set of 162 cards. The set included all the rest of the cards from the first movie that were not in the Premiere set. The first versions of Chewbacca and R2-D2 were introduced, as well as, the first Death Star, which immediately became the most popular starting location for DS. Although it allowed the LS to go first, the three Force it provided gave the DS an early advantage in setting up their game. The only thing the LS had going for them at the time was Tantive IV, which allowed for direct deployment to the Death Star. Combined with the Millennium Falcon, and the Rebel Leaders, the LS had the advantage in space over the DS ships that had no immunity to attrition. Only Vaders Custom TIE could provide a force in space with immunity <4, and rarely got out with Darth Vader usually already deployed on the ground. A New Hope introduced many very popular uncommons and commons; Monnok / Grimtaash, Ghhhk / Houjix, and Undercover, which are still used today. <br />
<br />
After a few months of the two sets, Decipher decided to create their major tournament scene, and hosted its very first Worlds Tournament in November 1996. Below is the two decks that the very first SWCCG World Champion Raphael Asselin used to win. You will notice how very basic they are in comparison to the decks played today. There were no objectives, starting interrupts, or ANY card that can download anything. These decks both relied on getting what you needed through simply drawing the cards in your force pile. If you notice, both decks have a lot of Senses & Alters. His strategy for LS was to use How Did We Get Out of This Mess? to find all the cards he needed quickly, while the DS deck was built as a space deck, with Vader going where he was needed.  You might also notice that both his decks dont play with Traffic Control or Reactor Terminal. Two cards that were standard to almost every deck built in the early years of the game. <br />

Chapter 2:        The Game Continues<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Novemeber of 1996, the next 162 card set in line, Hoth, was released. It was not legal for the Worlds Tournament that same month. Hoth introduced a whole new planet for the game to play on. This set began the division of the movies as each set from here on out would introduce cards from that part of the movie. Hoth, of course, provided the game with all the scenes from the beginning scene of the Empire Strikes Back. This set finally gave some more options for ground with the introduction of Walkers and General Veers for DS, as well as, Anakins Lightsaber, and the all powerful Hoth Shields with Echo Base Occupation for LS. Many decks would be built around this protective strategy as the DS could not deploy to any site protected by the Shields. They were forced to deploy on the outermost marker and then move in. This allowed the LS to defend against the characters that may have been deployed to invade the planet. <br />
<br />
The set introduced Commander Luke, who was an evolved version of the original. Although more powerful, was the first of many characters Decipher decided would have deployment restrictions, which required that the character be deployed to only a specific planet in order to be played. This type of deployment would last through all of the sets introduced from the Empire Strikes Back. <br />
<br />
A few months later in March of 1997, Decipher introduced an updated Two-Player Introduction Set based around Hoth. Like the first Two-Player box, this set had seven unique cards that you could only obtain from this box set. Two of which were Walker Garrison and the Imperial Walker. Walker Garrison was the first big drain strategy introduced to the game. It literally gave the DS a way to drain for 10 or more cards in a single turn. The demand on these unique cards drove the value of this second box set way up to where it was almost impossible to find in stores. <br />
<br />
Although Hoth provided many strong cards to the game, it didnt change the game all that much. Then, shortly after the Hoth Two-player set came out, the next set in line, Dagobah, was released in April of 1997. Dagobah provided the middle of the Empire Strikes Back by including all the Dagobah locations, Asteroids, and Bounty Hunters seen in the movie, as well as introducing a new Jedi power, Control. This set is known to be the sole introduction of some of the cheesiest strategies the game has ever and will ever see. In this one set, players had the ability to win games with almost no interaction with the opponent. The LS got the majority of help with Jedi Training through Yoda and Son of Skwalker. The first Jedi Test, Great Warrior, took away all force drain bonuses from the DS. Anger, Fear, and Aggression could be inserted into the DS deck to cause four cards in damage for them not initiating a Battle. Dagobah was the first location that could pull sites directly from the reserve deck. Once on table, all Dagobah locations were completely protected from any DS foe as Dagobah deployment rules restricted ANY deployment unless the card itself allowed it to be deployed there. The DS had to literally load up a ship and land on the planet in order to stop the LS party. If all of that wasnt enough, the LS player could play Revolution on Yodas Hut and add Lightsaber Proficiency to Son of Skywalker whose text allowed you to find his lightsaber. All of this would give you a solid drain of 4, while playing On the Edge to retrieve any cards that the Darkside might have caused. Keep in mind that there was no such thing as a Battleground or cards that cancelled drains (except Control), so the Dagobah drain stayed there all game. <br />
<br />
Although the Dagobah based deck was almost unbeatable. It could be beat with the other really cheesy strategy known to all as Odds. The Odds strategy involved simply deploying any three characters to the table, and then Inserting an Effect; (3720 to 1 / Never Tell Me the Odds) into your opponents deck. When this Effect reached the top through activating and drawing destiny, each player would count up the destiny number of the 3 lowest characters on table. The lowest total lost that much Force in difference. So, if I had Vader, Tarkin, and Ozzel on table, then I had a total of 2, while the LS who inserted the Odds card would have 5 from R2, 5 from Wioslea and 4 from a random droid. So the DS would have to lose 12 cards!! The bad thing about this lame strategy is it stayed in existence for three years before it was finally stopped by cards made in Death Star 2, which wasnt released until 2000.    <br />
<br />
Of course, if both of those strategies werent enough for one set. Decipher also thought it would be cool to include the Asteroids, which for the most part were not a bad strategy. If only the original Asteroid Sanctuary wasnt made to cause direct damage during OPPONENTS control phase. So you would be draining during your turn, and then making them lose force during their turn, after you dropped 1 to 3 of them on the previous turn. It was a totally broken strategy and was immediately errataed to be during the LSs control phase. <br />
<br />
Shortly after Dagobah was released in April, Decipher decided to release another supplement product, the First Anthology, in May of 1997. The First Anthology was the first product to preview cards from sets that were awhile from being released. This one included five cards from Special Edition; Boba Fett, Commander Wedge Antilles, Jabbas Influence, X-Wing Assualt Squadron, and the Death Star Assault Squadron. They were all produced in white bordered to show they were the preview version of the card. By purchasing the Anthology, a player would also receive 2x Unlimited Premiere starter decks, 2x A New Hope packs, and 2x Hoth packs, as well as, a nice box to store your decks.    <br />
<br />
With the creation of Dagobah, the game took a big turn in a different direction. You would have thought that Decipher would have noticed the problems that Dagobah created for the game and immediately fix them, but they didnt. The following set, Cloud City, was released in Novemeber of 1997 to complete the sets from the Empire Strikes Back. It finally gave the players their first version of Lando Calrissian and Boba Fett, as well as, introducing new versions of main characters with Princess Leia and Captain Han Solo. This new version of Han is still considered to be the best choice for a Han to pilot the Falcon. Although the set did add to the game with new locations and powerful Interrupts and Effects in You Are Beaten / Clash of Sabers, Imperial Decree, Path of Least Resistance, Smoke Screen, Its a Trap, Dark Deal, and Epic Duel. At the time, Epic Duel was not very easy to play because you had no way of finding anything and could still lose the game even with both Obi and Luke out of play. Imperial Decree allowing for Force Drain bonuses and Revolution to be cancelled was really the only card that the DS could use to counter the Dagobah deck. The set also didnt include a direct way to cancel Odds. <br />
<br />
You would think that the set couldnt have made the Dagobah deck any better. Instead, it created an even powerful strategy by introducing Clouds, which could be deployed to the Dagaboh system to allow for an additional drain of 6 once a Tibana Gas Miner was deployed to the planet with Great Warrior. So even if the Hut was Revolved back and no bonus drains were allowed, the LS player could still drain for three in the Clouds with almost nothing the DS player could do. By far, the most powerful card in that set was Dark Deal. This card provided the DS with their own bonus drain effect to match the LS having EBO to play since Hoth. Much like EBO, Dark Deal require the DS player to place a number of characters and even a TIE out in or to deploy the card. The LS had to occupy a number of locations just like EBO in order to cancel the Effect that was immune to alter.    <br />
<br />
This time the new set was released in time for the 1997 Worlds, and many players found themselves playing against fresh decks with cards that had only been out a few weeks. You will notice that in just one year, the two World Champion decks have a totally different feel to them. Phillip Jacobs played two decks that took a defensive side to playing as he reacted to what his opponent was doing. If you notice that his Dark deck sports THE most popular ships that were included in every DS deck because they were the only ships that had immunity. You will still notice that both decks had completely no way to find any Effect, Interrupt, or most importantly a site. The game still began much slower with both players using their first few turns to simply set up their sites and find some characters. <br />

Chapter 3:        A Change is Coming<br />
<br />
<br />
With the second Worlds Tournament in the books, Decipher continued their path to release new sets. In April of 1998, Jabbas Palace began the division of sets that would be released for the Return of the Jedi. Like Cloud City, the set was also 180 cards and is still the largest set of characters with 93. Literally every character that could be seen in or around Jabbas Palace was included in the set. Jabba the Hutt lead the charge for the DS characters while the LS got a new versions of Artoo, Lando, and Leia. Although Princess Leia Organa was not very popular and saw almost no playing time in decks. The creation of Jabbas Palace would introduce a new card type, the Starting Interrupt (Twilek Advisor DS/ The Signal LS), which for the first time allowed a player to start the game with any Effect that deployed for free. The Jabbas Palace site provided the DS with a location that could deploy related sites from the Reserve Deck. Combined with Expand the Empire being started on the site, the DS could literally deploy every single related Jabbas Palace site on the first turn if the game. This set up gave the DS 9 Force after their first turn, a strategy totally unheard of until this set. It also could remove the majority of floating 0s that a normal deck would have had in the past. <br />
<br />
Because the set had no version of Luke, Decipher created I Must Be Allowed to Speak, which allowed the Son of Skywalker version of Luke to deploy to Tatooine overriding his game text restricting deployment to only Dagobah and Cloud City. In this set, Decipher decided to finally create a card (Torture DS / Dont Forget the Droids LS) that could cancel the Odds mess from Dagobah. The only problem was that it was still an Interrupt, so you had to be lucky enough to have one in your hand by the time the Odds Effect popped. The other problem was that a player playing Odds would usually just play it in many copies so that after the average player used both of their Odds Interrupts to cancel it. The Odds player would grab it, and then resume the very cheesy strategy of non interaction card lose. <br />
<br />
With the success of Jabbas Palace in place, Decipher decided to expand on the very weak Sealed Deck Tournament Format. Until this time, the entire format of Sealed Deck was trapped in a world of total luck. The ability of the player to win consistently playing in this format until now was totally unheard of. To fix this problem, Decipher released the Official Tournament Sealed Deck in May of 1998. They consisted of six different collectable boxes with different characters (Vader, Luke, Leia, Boba Fett, C-3P0, and Jabba) that players continue to use at tournaments to hold their decks. In the boxes, every player would get the same 18 OTSD Premium cards (9 dark & 9 light) that were designed specifically for Sealed deck games to help level eliminate the luck factor. The 9 cards that a player could obtain would add the missing strategy that a normal game of Sealed Deck was lacking. <br />
<br />
Finally, SWCCG had become a solid CCG with 6 complete sets. It was time for Decipher to release their Second Anthology in July of 1998 that would preview 6 more cards the same way the First Anthology did just one year prior. This time the Second Anthology came with a gold box, which included two packs of Dagobah and Cloud City, as well as, 8 packs of Unlimited Premiere. Up until now, both Anthologys preview cards had still not been released in their main set. Fans began to prepare for another large set to equal the size of the first Premiere set.  <br />
<br />
As with Hoth and Cloud City, the 7th SWCCG set, Special Edition, was released in Novemeber of 1998. It came just in time for Worlds that year, so players had the same experience from the previous year playing against decks that were completely new. The new set would introduce 324 new cards, as well as, a totally new rule book included in all new pre-packed Sealed Decks for each side. The Sealed Deck each came with 20 fixed cards each made for that specific side. This set would introduce Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and Ben Kenobi, which provided players with an option to which type of powerful character they wanted to have in their deck. The release of DLOTS would greatly help the game by giving more players an opportunity to obtain a version of Vader with the original Darth Vader at that time reaching costs of $70+. <br />
<br />
Special Edition brought about the largest change to the game up to this point by introducing a totally new type of deck type called Objectives. Each side got 5 different Objectives that would allow the player to play a deck that had a specific purpose other than simply finding ways to either drain or cause damage. They sped the game up by giving the players a totally new feel to playing the game. No longer was a game of SWCCG restricted to drains, deploying, and battling. By completing the requirements of the 0 side of the Objective, the card would flip to the 7 side, which would give the player an advantage over the opponent. So much so that many times the opponent would be required to flip the Objective back to the 0 side in order to have a chance of winning the game. Of course not every Objective that was flipped provided total victory for the player, some of them simply made it more difficult for the opponent to obtain to win with their original strategy. <br />
<br />
Decipher thought this set would continue the pace of the game as it was currently the second most popular CCG behind Magic. The problem this set created was it introduced a very very bad strategy through one of the Objectives. Imperial Occupation DS / Local Uprising LS aka Operatives took over the game like a bad virus. The Objective was so overly powerful that literally no other strategy could easily beat it. No matter what your hand or strategy was, it would have no chance against this Objective. The set was released right before Worlds, so only the players that played this strategy had any chance of winning. The 1998 Worlds Tournament was a total mess. No longer was it a test of who the best players were, but only who was smart enough to play this type of Operative. Day 3 of Worlds literally had only one deck that wasnt Operatives. Looking at the two decks, you will not see anything that even looks like a SWCCG strategy, past or present. They are included as a reminder of the mistakes that were made in this game.    <br />

Chapter 4:	Where are the Sets?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the 3rd Worlds Tournament in the books, Decipher released a new concept card to the game at the end of 1998 known as the Enhanced Premiere Pack or EPP. Each had a special card that was sold in a special pack that showed the card on the outside and included 4 packs of unlimited Premiere. The special cards consisted of 6 versions of main characters that all had a Permanent Weapon built into their game text. Vader, Luke, and Obi all had their lightsabers, while Fett, Han, and Leia all had a blaster. To make up for a blaster being a weaker weapon, the three of them all got an added text for adding a battle destiny if with a specific character(s). These destiny adding characters were the first of their kind and proved to be very popular throughout the game for years to come. <br />
<br />
As 1999 went by, Decipher continued to push back the release of the next set, Endor. In the past, the new set had always come out in April. This time it was released in June. Players were excited to find yet another new planet of possibilities as well as two new Objectives to play with. Both were based around the Endor: Bunker and involved either keeping it safe or blowing it up. Although the idea was different, neither Objective proved to be all that powerful and was usually only used as a platform for a mains and toys deck. <br />
As for the rest of the set, the LS gained the all popular Ewoks as well as a General version of Han and a Skywalker version of Leia. The DS received no main characters but did gain many unique AT-STs, as well as, a new AT-AT to play with in Tempest 1. Endor as a whole was not very popular as far as total cards to play with. It did however include some very popular LS characters (General Crix Madine) and red cards ( Strike Planning, I Know, Lost in the Wilderness / Always Thinking with Your Stomach, and Insurrection / Imperial Arrest Order). <br />
<br />
Endor was the first to introduce the SWCCG world to Foils. The Endor Foils were a small set of mainly the rarest cards in the set; General Solo, Daughter of Skywalker, Tempest 1 etc. They were the first set that gave a new collecting feel that the game had been lacking. The 18 Foils from this set are the only ones that have an extra thick layer of foil that makes the entire card shine more than any other foil set that would be created for the game. This type of foiling cost more for Decipher to make, so they changed the process to be less shinny. <br />
<br />
As Worlds approached, the game continued to not have any new cards. Endor would prove to be the only full set that would be released in 1999. This would be the only year that Decipher seemed to be behind in the creation of the game as the fought for the right to design cards for the new movies as well as the popular novels. During this time, the game seems to float by as all the decks created in June got no change before the Worlds tournament at the end of the year.   <br />
<br />
Once again, Decipher held its Worlds Tournament for SWCCG in November. This time they had their own personal convention known as Deciphercon. It was held in Virginia Beach, which provided players with a great view of the waves as they played their tournament games. Deciphercon was a huge success for Decipher as they provided Shannon Baskin (Mara Jade) and Jeremy Bullock (Boba Fett) to autograph players stuff. The great thing was that all you had to pay was the entry fee into the Con. The autographs were completely free, and there was no limit to how many things you could get signed. Decipher used the Con to advertise their plans for the game. They prepared by having blow ups of the future cards for the game i.e. Mara Jade, The Emperors Hand, which would not be released until January of the next year. <br />
<br />
Listed below are the two decks that Gary Carman used to defeat Steven Lewis for the 1999 World Champion Title. As you can see, they are still very different from any year before them. This time, Objectives got the majority of play. DS sported ISB with Outer Rim Scouts, while LS was Hidden Base with Epps and Odds. You can see that the player still must hope to draw all of his locations and characters into hand before he could affectively set up his strategy. The game still has no real way to search for anything short of an ORS with the Abyssin Ornaments and searching for systems with Hidden Base. <br />

Chapter 5:	Crazy for Reflections<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the completion of Endor, Decipher had a new problem to think about. The next set would be Death Star II, which would complete the Trilogy as far as the card game was concerned. At that time, they had not obtained the rights to make the Episode I cards, so Decipher decided to push the release of DSII back. With the extra time gained by pushing back DSII, Decipher released a new line of Enhanced cards to follow the success of the EPPs. Enhanced Cloud City and Enhanced Jabbas Palace introduced the game to even more versions of popular characters, as well as provide even more permanent weapon characters and permanent pilots in their matching ships. <br />
<br />
Much like the Epps, they were pre-packaged with the same cards in each one with one card showing out. This time though, they would include more than just one card, each ECC and EJP would include 4 unique cards that were the same based on who could be seen on the outside. The ECCs came with 4 packs of Cloud City, while the EJPs had 4 packs of Jabbas Palace. ECC included such awesome cards as IG-88 with Riot Gun, 4-Lom with Concussion Rifle, Lando with Blaster Pistol, Chewie with Gun, Boba Fett in Slave 1, Lando in Falcon, and two new objectives based around Cloud City. EJP followed the same pattern of ECC by introducing new characters and objectives all based around Jabbas Palace. The difference in the two was that EJP had fewer permanent weapon characters and more cards that were simply different versions of the main characters. The DS got Mara Jade, The Emperor Hand, Mara Jades Lightsaber, Dengar with Blaster Carbine, Jodo Kast, and Zuckess in Mist Hunter, while the LS got Master Luke and Boushh. ECC could be purchased for the first time at Deciphercon 1999, but would not hit stores until mid December. EJP was then released at the beginning of the new year in January 2000. <br />
<br />
To keep the game going as they worked out making future sets past DSII, Decipher created their very popular set Reflections I that was released the same time as EJP. Reflections I gave players a way to purchase a pack of SWCCG and literally obtain cards from all the sets from Premiere to Special Edition. Each pack was crammed with 18 cards, 17 coming at random from anyone one of the for mentioned sets, while the last card was a one of 114 Foils of some of the most popular cards in the game. The Foils were divided up into rarity; Very Rare, Super Rare, and Ultra Rare. Only two cards in the set were Ultra rare, and that meant just that. In a whole case of 10 boxes, there might be one Ultra Rare of either Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker. This made putting a set together an almost impossible task without paying a lot for it. The overwhelming success of the Reflections I set convinced Decipher to produce WAY too much, which is why there are so many to be found to this day on Ebay.<br />
<br />
The new cards gave Decipher a chance to perfect their final set that would conclude the original trilogy. In June, the Third Anthology was released as a last minute product before DSII. The third and final anthology followed the same recipe as the previous two. The player got another long box, this time it was black and covered with stars. The third did however do something different. Since Decipher had no more cards to preview, they simply created 6 unique cards that could only be obtained through the Anthology. The LS got R2 in Red 5, Prisoner 2187, Echo Base Garrison, A New Secret Base, and the MBO objective, while the DS got the SYCFA objective. The released of these cards created a whole new way to set of EBO for LS, as well as give the DS a way to play the Death Star and still go first. <br />
<br />
Finally, as it seemed the set would never come, Death Star II was released in July of 2000. The set completed the original Trilogy with all the locations and characters that were missing from the game. Players could now play with Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Emperor Palaptine, which were the Ultra rare cards in the set and were the first powerful characters to have a 6 destiny number. DSII also introduced a new card type, the Admirals Order, which provided additional help too many strategies mainly in space. Players got a big surprise with the set with the introduction of a new starting interrupt; Prepare Defenses DS / Heading For the Medical Frigate LS. This time a player could start the game with 3 Effects as long as they all deployed for free to your side of the table and were always immune to alter. The strength of this starting card is still used currently with anyone playing an Objective.<br />
<br />
Death Star II introduced the game to brand new starter decks that were pre-packed to be instantly playable in a seal deck tournament. The starters included a balance of locations, characters, and starships, which finally made the sealed deck format reliable to a wider range of players. They could be played with a supplement of packs from other sets, this way no one got too much of an advantage from what they pulled. The downside to this product was that it serviced no other purpose other than in sealed deck, so a player would never need to purchase more than one of each with only 1 card being unattainable from other DSII packs; Admiral Piett for DS and Ackbar for LS.       <br />
<br />
DSII was a huge success. The game had finally reached a true high and continued to be the second most popular SSG right under Magic. To prepare the players for Worlds, Decipher released one last product to spice up the decks that had become popular. Jabbas Palace Sealed Deck hit stores in October 2000. Like the first edition of the Enhanced Sealed Deck format, the JPSDs were composed of 6 collectable boxes all with different pics from characters set in Jabbas Palace. Each box included 6 packs of Jabbas Palace and a pre-packed set of 20 cards (10 for each side) that were unique to the JPSD. The most powerful card being No Escape for Darkside because it finally provided a way around Honor of the Jedi, which really hurt DS direct damage during the few months HOTJ existed with no counter.  <br />
<br />
By now you already know what this paragraph is going to be about since we are now up to November 2000. Of course, Worlds at Deciphercon, which was held in Orlando, FL, this year. The turn out was great. This year there was a Wild card where the Top % no matter what would move on to Day 2. With the number of players that showed up to play in the Wild card, the top 45 players out of 167 moved on. Then in Day 2, the top 12 moved on to Day 3. This year was the first year Decipher decided to have complete computer pairings, which meant that a computer could do all the pairings based on the outcome of each game. Wow, that must mean that everything went SO much faster, right?? Well, since all the games had to be keyed into the computer, the pairings took over an hour after each game. So an 8 game tournament that was suppose to be over like at 7, lasted until 2 in the morning. So players that played in Day 1 and 2 had to play 16 games with like 4 hours of sleep, and that is if you went to bed right after the Day 1 tournament was over. No time for playtesting or deck building at this Worlds. If you didnt have your deck built, you were looking at no sleep for the night. <br />
<br />
As far as product goes, the only thing that was released at the 2000 Worlds was a rare Japanese version of the Hoth 2-Player set that was already rare with so many players needing those Rebel Snowspeeders and Walker Garrisons. They sold out in a few hours and are still one of the rarest product to be had in the SWCCG universe. A new product would not be seen until early in the New Year as Decipher would product more sets in one year than any other year to date. <br />
<br />
Listed below are the two decks that Matt Sokol used to become the 2000 World Champion. You will notice that they are both the exact Objectives that were used to win the 1999 Worlds. So if you didnt already know, ISB and Hidden Base are the only Back to Back World Champion decks. Of course, they are nothing like the years before or the years after. The point by now is to continue to see the evolution of these Objectives. <br />
