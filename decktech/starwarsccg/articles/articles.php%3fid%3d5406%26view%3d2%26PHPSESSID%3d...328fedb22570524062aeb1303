She can still use it, but only on your turn( another good reason to use YAB). As of this posting, no one even picked up on that, I just wanted to correct myself because I don&#39;t want to mis- inform any of you. Also as Terron pointed out she is more powerful when her cover is broken(which I ALSO said in the article when I mentioned using her text the previous turn). The point was you could use her to clear a site, WITHOUT BREAKING COVER(thus avoid being battled, using a Gkkkk, or deploying other characters to back her up). I would have posted this in an update, but articles have no edit feature. Thank you.<br />
<br />
In part 2, The Newbie&#39;s Guide,  I have MANY more combos to go over. Some of these, however, I could never claim were mine. Some have been used for YEARS, while others are very new. In fact, most of these are more basic than the ones in part 1, but still worth taking a look at, if for no other reason than we have a lot of newer players on this site now who may not have seem this stuff already. The reason I am posting some of the more vintage combos here at all is because very few people other than myself seem to use them any more, and they still work fine(or in some cases even better now). Again I make no claim that these are &quot;my original ideas&quot; because even though I thought of some of them on my own, I posses no telepathic abilities and can not prove that I thought of them first. If you are one of those people that will give me a bad review for posting an old and un-original, but still very useful combo, well than you can below me. Just remember that these combos are not for every players style, so don&#39;t review me on whether or not they are universal, but instead on their effectiveness.<br />
<br />
With that said I have taken the liberty of including the intro from part 1 in case you have not read it yet(or if you skipped it the first time as I think some of you did) because what was said is still relevant. If you did read it last time, skip to combos.<br />
<br />
 <br />
In this article I will be sharing with you some of my combos and opinions. The reason I called this article &quot;How I Play The Game&quot; is because, well, this is how I play. When I was taught how to play(as touched upon in my other article, Sealed Box Tournament???) I was forced to come up with new and sometimes strange combos of my own just to stay alive. Some never worked well but most did and those are the ones that I will share with you. A lot of these can be found in some of the decks that I have posted, though I probably did not go into as much detail explaining them. I didn&#39;t want to call this &quot;New Combos&quot; or &quot;Combos You Should Use&quot; because some of these combos aren&#39;t new(at least not to me) and they may not be for every one. Not to say that you may not like them or find them useful, just that every body has there own style and mine may not work with yours. Anyway, the main reason I am posting this, even though some of this may be old news, is because every time I post something I always get some knucklehead posting a mindless review. It&#39;s not their fault if I don&#39;t explain myself well enough in the strategy, it&#39;s mine, so here is my chance to fix that. <br />
<br />
COMBOS <br />
<br />
You retrieved how much?!  Well lose half then, round up!!<br />
Ever try to stop the Light side from retrieving, only to have them do it anyway. Well you can&#39;t win them all but at least their victory will be short lived.<br />
<br />
Anti-retrieval Shields/effects (CHYBC, SP) and Imbalance:<br />
In my opinion, the dark side IS stronger BECAUSE it is quicker, easier and more seductive. On the other hand, a well made light deck can be very hard to take out and can eventually out last the dark side, usually because of retrieval(but not always). Lets face it, the light side is much better off when it comes to retrieval, while the dark side has the advantage of direct damage. When you look at it that way, there is a definite balance between the two.  So the best way to overcome your opponent, is to upset that balance(or cause an &quot;Imbalance&quot;). <br />
<br />
Playing Come Here You Big Coward, Secret Plans, or both(if you are a jerk like me:) can really help slow the LS down to the point where it&#39;s questionable whether they can retrieve anything, but a good player always finds a way to do it anyway.  With both CHYBC and SP on table, your opponent MUST occupy two battle grounds and pay X force to retrieve X force. When they manage to stock pile enough force to do all this, flip their objective, end the race, or whatever and retrieve, it kind of sucks. This is where Imbalance comes in. Once they retrieve, play Imbalance, and make them lose HALF of whatever they got back(round up). Believe me, this one little destiny 4 used interrupt, can be very useful, even when used by itself. Lets break it down: <br />
<br />
Profit  Retrieve 10, lose 5<br />
MWYHL(without Yoda(v) )  ret. 10, lose 5<br />
MWYHL(with Yoda(v) ) ret 3 after every test, lose 2 as often as you can play Imbalance<br />
Draw Their Fire  ret 1 when they initiate, lose 1 as often as you can play Imbalance<br />
Noble Sacrifice played on Obi-wan  ret 9, lose 5<br />
Retrieve a weapon with a Baragwin or Yoxgit  ret 1, lose 1<br />
ect.<br />
<br />
As you can see, Imbalance is not only useful whenever they retrieve a butt load, but since you round up, it can actually CANCEL(or in other words, make pointless) the retrieval in decks that retrieve on a continual basis. If you pack one in your deck, and track it, you could play it 3 out of the 5 Jedi tests( I have done this), almost every time they play On/Off The Edge, or to penalize them with their own DTF. The best reason of all, since it is used AFTER they retrieve, it is not effected by the text on Yoda(v), or anything else that &quot;protects&quot; retrieval. If you can find room, I recommend this card, and when used as a combo with CHYBC and/or SP, it can win games.<br />

<br />
I duel, you die. You draw nothing, have a nice day.<br />
One of the oldest techs out there, one card=one kill, and still works. <br />
<br />
Vader and Circle: <br />
On the 7th day, God may have rested, but when he got up the next morning, he made this combo! One of the simplest combos out there, yet I only see a few people still using it, so I decided to include it in here. Lets take a look at the Circle Is Now Complete:<br />
<br />
 Destiny 6, <br />
Lost interrupt. <br />
TEXT= &quot;If Vader and Obi-wan are present at a site, use 1 force to initiate a duel between them. Ether Jedi is power +2 if they have a lightsaber. Loser of duel is out of play.&quot; <br />
<br />
Unlike other duel cards, this WILL work on non-jedi Obi-wan(minus the +2 lightsaber text. Ha ha.) and because there is no destiny draw, EPP Vader is ALMOST guarantied to tag Obi-wan with this. Most people have gone back to using EPP Obi, so you only really need EPP Vader to do it. EPP Vader is power 6(so you get 8), EPP Obi-wan is power 5(so they get 7), = you win. If you want a lock against any thing that might happen, however,  you could always use Lord Vader, his saber, Weapon Levitation/Disarmed, and a Sense for their dueling protection interrupts. Many of these cards you should be using already, adding Circle should be considered. I mean, after all, how many light deck do you know of that play Obi-wan?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now with that said......<br />
Don&#39;t want the above statement to happen to you, than protect yourself!!!<br />
<br />
Obi-wan/Qui-gon and Courage of a Skywalker:<br />
With Hunt Down, Dueling Maul, Deep Hatred, and Circle:) , you would think you would see more people playing Courage, but you don&#39;t. A miss-conception made by a lot of people is that COAS is only good with a Skywalker, not true. The last part of the text on the card, which lets you add one destiny to your total when in a duel, can target anyone, not just a Skywalker. Since the COAS adds a destiny to your total, it can be used even if no destiny draw was made(like with Circle) making it a very good card to have when protecting your jedi from a dueling deck. If not, you could always use it, and a Jedi Presence, to make a SUPER TANK LUKE. Not bad for a destiny 2 that was &quot;bad&quot; enough to make a updated Virtual version.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that I need their help, but....<br />
If you play Jedi and Rebels in the same deck, raise your hand.<br />
<br />
LS Mains and Jedi Presence:<br />
Dark Jedi Presence + DS Mains is.......well, ok(I mean how threatening is Tarkin and Motti power wise, come on). Jedi Presence + LS Mains however, are fudging awesome!!! This should also be common knowledge, but as far as I can tell, not many people use it, again that&#39;s why it&#39;s in here. Use Qui-gon as your Jedi, and all the Rebels with him battle at double power! That means Jedi Luke, Obi-wan, Leia, Han, Chewie, hell even Screaming Lando( after you use his text to add to his power first, of course) ALL WOULD BE DOUBLE POWER as long as they were with the jedi you use to play it. Also, since it targets a jedi that is PRESENT during a battle, it will still work even if your jedi was excluded from that battle by a Barrier, You Are Beaten, Dioxis, or whatever. Not too shabby.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your future is cloudy at best<br />
Like QMC? Don&#39;t like playing against Hunt Down, BHBM, or any other dark deck that centers around a Sith Bad Azz? This may interest you....<br />
<br />
Old-school Weather Vane and Fall of the Empire:<br />
It feels like it was a very long time ago (circa: 2001 or so) when I stumbled on to this one. A little over a year after I started playing Star Wars, I found myself playing my piss poor QMC against  Greg Hodur&#39;s (Ghetto Leader to all who don&#39;t know) very well made Hunt Down. I can&#39;t remember exactly what we both started, all I can tell you is I started the Weather Vane. After his first turn, he dropped Vader at Guest Quarters, and flipped his objective. On my turn, I looked at my hand and saw- EPP Obi, Fall of the Empire, Bespin-CC, and some alien-so I pulled a site, lost a card to Visage, and ended my turn. On my next turn, I dropped Obi ( he flips back to the &quot;0&quot; side)and my alien to battled Vader. I won the battle (with out swinging my saber, very important!)by 1 after destiny was drawn, lost the alien to attrition, and played FOTE, placing Vader on the Weather Vane. With Vader on the WV, Greg had to stay on the &quot;0&quot; side of his Objective because Vader was on table for &quot;Unique purposes only&quot; and could not occupy a battle ground as is required to flip back to the &quot;7&quot; side. Since he had no interrupts to relocate Vader, and I wasn&#39;t going to send anyone else to the Vane, the only way he could get vader off of there was to control Bespin-CC. So to make sure that didn&#39;t happen, I lost Bespin-CC to Visage at the end of my turn. Of coarse this was WAY before KTEOF, so I was stuck on the &quot;0&quot; side too, since I needed that location to stay flipped myself.  As I said before, his deck was much better than mine and he did win in the end, but he never got Vader back and I never forgot that combo.<br />
<br />
After KTEOF was released with the Tatooine expansion, I brought back my combo. Every time I play QMC, that combo is in there, and it is an awesome way to take out one of their mains. It can single handedly mess up most HD or BHBM decks (most Hunt Downs drop Vader at CC, because you give them a battle ground) and can even screw up ITTWC if you also pack an Amidala and tempt Maul to come to Bespin. This combo is very easy to pull off, very unexpected, and since you no longer need the CC sector, there is no reason this should not be a more commonly found combo in today&#39;s QMC decks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Old mains platform makes comeback, thanks to opponent?<br />
An idea I am toying with: Light side deck that takes advantage of going second for a change.<br />
<br />
Obi-wan&#39;s Hut and Location x3(v)....?:<br />
Remember the old Obi&#39;s hut-Tosche Station shuffle? The great thing about that deck was you could get good activation/drains with only 2 sites, revolution, B Monk and a few mains. The not so great thing was because you used Careful Planning as your starting interrupt, you got no starting effects. Well, depending on the match up, that should all change. LLL(v) lets BOTH PLAYERS use 2 force to deploy a battle ground from reserve. Now since the Dark Side goes first, and since they MUST play their starting interrupt BEFORE YOU, you may as well take a second and see what effects they are playing, right? If they give you LLL(v) at the start, then there is no reason you can&#39;t change your mind, put CP back and play HFTMF instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s 6 down, 6 more to go! Look for part 3 as soon as I can get it done. Untill then, enjoy and thanks for reading! <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=5406&view=1&PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=...328fedb22570524062aeb1303'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
