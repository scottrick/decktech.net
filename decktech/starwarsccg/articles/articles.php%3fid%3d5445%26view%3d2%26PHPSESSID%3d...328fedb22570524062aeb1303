I will also take this opportunity to share some in-depth strategies for these combos(and how best to abuse them) as well as my opinions about some deck types here and there.<br />
<br />
It has been one of my goals with these articles to try and get some of the SWCCG players on this site to start thinking &quot;outside of the box&quot;. I think that many people will agree with me when I say that deck submissions to Decktech have been somewhat stale as of late. So I say, out with the new, in with the old. This game has THOUSANDS of strategies at your disposal, don&#39;t settle for the 5 or 6 new and most obvious ones. Just because a card or particular strategy is &quot;new&quot; does not mean it is better. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, sometimes the new stuff is better and more effective, but not always. Don&#39;t be afraid to abuse the hell out of an old idea. That old idea will work well for you more likely than not because there is a VERY good chance that your opponent will not have the cards to stop it or even any clue how to stop it with the cards they do have. The more diverse the decks and strategies we use are, the more competitive and FUN this game will be. When we have no more than 100 people or so frequent this site, and have no less than 10 CCT decks posted every month, it&#39;s time to shake things up a bit. Remember, think outside of the box. There is no spoon.<br />
<br />
Based on the reviews and D-mails that I have received from my last 2 articles, I am convinced that there is a demand for &quot;old-school tech&quot; and I will do my best to satisfy it. Majority rules so if you are one of those people who will give me a bad review for posting an old or unoriginal, but still very useful combo or strategy, than you can toss my salad.<br />

This is a very old trick that some may not have picked up on, granted it may not be the best tech out there, but tech all depends on how well it is applied. Back in the day, when Hidden Mains ruled the Light Side, it was important to get a lot of activation in a beat down deck. Hell, it STILL IS important! The more you can activate, the easier to track and the more cards you could deploy for your beat down. If you have some type of HB/EBO beatdown, especially mains or other ground force like speeders, Dagobah is a good way to achieve that activation. <br />
<br />
HB, first turn, you activate 3 plus what ever the DS gives you. Use the text on the objective to pull Dagobah, use that to pull a Dagobah site like Yoda&#39;s hut, then use Rebel Planners(v) to pull another system, like Endor if you are also playing Strike Planning. Now on you second turn you will be activating 9 plus what the DS gives you , while only giving them 2. This gives you a good start whether you play HB on the ground or in the air. Space decks can now potentially pull 2 systems and a Dagobah site every turn, letting you set up fast and activate an insane amount of force, it all depends on how far you are willing to go with it.  <br />
<br />
What makes this good for a Mains platform is that you can get away with a some what limited space package, freeing up room for more ground stuff. You never have to occupy Dagobah, you can&#39;t be drained there, and even if they go to the trouble of getting someone to Yoda&#39;s Hut for the drain(which would take them a few turns), Honor cancels it even if No Escape is out. On the ground you could combine this with Insurrection and Staging Areas if you want, or you can keep pulling Dagobah sites for even more activation, depending on whether you want to defend your own docking bays or invade their sites. The point is, you can do anything you want with your deck ,flip or non-flip, and activation wouldn&#39;t be a problem. I have even seen people Jedi Test with HB using this combo so basically, the sky is the limit. <br />
<br />
This also works well with EBO, or A New Secret Base to be more specific, though with all of the Hoth sites you would only really need the Dagobah system and a site to give it that little extra boost. Too bad &quot;Lock&quot; Nevander(v) can only pull battle ground systems(which Dagobah is NOT), otherwise you could use Dagobah for activation in any deck.<br />
<br />
Another bit of tech, as far as this Dagobah combo is concerned, is when you use it with  Colo Claw Fish. If you have relatively low destiny in your HB, or you are just not that good at tracking, here is what you do: Pull Dagobah, use it to pull Training Aria, use THAT to pull Jedi test 6, and then stack the test on Colo!  Now its still your deploy phase on your first turn and BANG, you already have a 6 on Colo that you won&#39;t even miss. BRING.....IT.....ON!!!<br />
<br />
If you don&#39;t think a non-flip HB with Dagobah for added activation is the way to go, I understand, but before you write off this combo completely, just hear me out for a minute. With the dawn of Virtual Cards, and the ease with which you can now flip your given objectives, many people don&#39;t even think about playing anything else. That, in my opinion, is the best reason why you SHOULD play something else! When you play competitively the element of surprise is one of the best advantages you can have. When a certain deck type is very popular(like CCT, HB and EBO for example) people ALWAYS pack some sort of tech for playing against those decks, so don&#39;t be afraid to play a pile, non-flip objective or even something totally off the wall. You may end up being better off because by the time your opponent figures out what you are REALLY up to, it may be too late for them to do anything about it. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ever notice how the sand just seems to get EVERYWHERE<br />
Not a good thing if you are a Sith lord or one of Jabba&#39;s cronies.<br />
<br />
Hutt Trade Route and Sandwhirl:<br />
In order to properly explain how good this combo can be, I am first going to have to describe the deck I most commonly use it in. With the last paragraph still fresh in your mind let me pitch this to you: Agents In The Court / No Love For The Empire as a mains platform. I have been playing AITC mains( my decks titled BOOTY CALL!, which were directly inspired by Hayes &quot;Hayes&quot; Hunter&#39;s AITC Mains) off and on for a few years and it works very well against Scum decks, the post V6 flipable CCT, and not to mention most other deck types too.  There are many advantages to playing AITC mains:<br />
<br />
1. good non-flip fake out(use Jar Jar as your rep, a Gongan swarm not unlikely)<br />
2. better than average activation first turn for a mains platform,(TRM gets 2, HB gets 3, you get 5)<br />
3.  easy to pull off A Gift? tech( JP Artoo, Threepio or any other droid, start the AC and you&#39;re set, this is made that much easier with non-virtual Seeking an Audience)<br />
4. can convert a DS Jabba&#39;s Palace site with one of your starting locations(You deploy your starting stuff second, and drop HTR and ANY JP site, may as well cover their AC site with yours, preventing them from using it to pull an Alien :) <br />
etc.<br />
<br />
 One of your biggest advantages, and more often than not the one most overlooked, is the fact that one of your starting locations is Hutt Trade Route. This is the part where I FINALLY discuss the Sandwhirl combo( don&#39;t complain though, because I just gave you a butt load of other tech above). Now, to make sure that we are all on the same page, I am going to go into depth with this one, step by step:<br />
<br />
Tatooine: Hutt Trade Route(desert)<br />
( 2 icons for light side, 1 for dark)<br />
TEXT<br />
Light Side=&quot;Your characters aboard vehicles are each power +1&quot;<br />
Dark Side=&quot;Unless you control Hutt Trade Route, your game text on Tatooine: Jabba&#39;s Palace is canceled&quot;<br />
<br />
I will tell you right now that I almost never use the text on my side of the site. Why? I will explain in a minute. My opponents text, however, I make extensive use of. One of the main things that has made dark decks that focus around JP so popular is the fact that they can pull their sites with Tatooine: JP. By starting HTR, I prevent them from doing this before their first turn even starts. Even if they don&#39;t start the JP with the intention of pulling it with LLL(v), or something like that, they still must control my site before they can use it to pull their other locations. HTR is also a desert, allowing me to deploy Sandwhirl there. Lets say they have Mara in their opening hand and deploy her to HTR their first turn, thinking that she can handle herself until they can back her up. This would let them use the text, so I use Sandwhirl on her asap. If they are brave enough to deploy someone weak, I may wait a turn or two until they back them up with a better character before using Sandwhirl. It&#39;s more fun that way. Since I use it in a mains deck with the intention of invading their sites instead of occupying my own, Sandwhirl also protects me from being drained there.  With 2 Sandwhirls and 3 Signals, I can pull this off as early as my first turn just about every time. <br />
<br />
As for my text at the site, it&#39;s almost completely worthless to me. &quot;Your characters aboard vehicles are each power +1&quot; basically only works if my guys are on a skiff, Luke&#39;s land speeder, or any other &quot;open&quot; vehicle because your characters power is irrelevant when they are on an enclosed vehicle. With my guys (AND my opponent&#39;s) on an open vehicle, they are ALSO vulnerable to Sandwhirl because it is not enclosed. Now do you see the dilemma? There are ways around this so I can still have use of my text, but it really isn&#39;t worth it to even mention.<br />
<br />
This combo can be used in any deck, really. With Mindful of the Future, Visored Vision(v), and even if the opponent plays LLL(v), you can pull it with relative ease and since it is Unique to the Light Side, you never have to worry about the DS deploying it first or converting it after it hits table. I find that starting it with AITC is still the best way to go, and it is in reference to this that I will be describing it&#39;s use. The basic formula for this combo/deck is to have a default start of ; Objective, HTR, and Tat:JP, that way if your opponent has no interior Tatooine sites your Sandwhirl will go back and forth in an endless loop. Like most of my other decks, AITC mains works best when used to counter what your opponent is trying to do. It is very &quot;reactive&quot; in this way, so the best way to describe how this combo works is to apply it to specific situations you are likely to come up against. In other words......Deck Match Ups:<br />
<br />
VS Scum pile, COTVG, MKOS:<br />
When playing this AITC combo against match ups like these, don&#39;t think of Sandwhirl as a way to slow them down, think of it instead as a kick in the teeth or the final blow in a near endless string of torture! With a pile they have no objective so they must deploy their starting location (Tat:JP) first. You can ether start the AC for more activation and for A Gift tech, or convert their site with yours. With COTVG, they start the AC so you can convert that with yours or start Tat:JP for more activation and so they can&#39;t pull their version with LLL(v) or a Neimoidian Advisor because it is already on table. If they use MKOS, you can use ether method depending on what JP site they start and how you feel it will best screw them up. A good Scum player almost always has a Cloud City Engineer just in case one of their sites gets converted so they can &quot;lift&quot; it back to the top, but this can take time, so be patient and do your thing. When they finally get their site back to the top, and if you LET THEM control HTR, they will think they can finally get their game going........that is when you Sandwhirl them.<br />
<br />
VS Hunt Down:<br />
Like the Weather Vane tech I mentioned in Part 2, the Dark Side usually drops Vader at one of your sites  first turn. They tend to do this because you give them a battle ground, allowing him to flip. With you default start of Tat:JP and HTR, your Sandwhirl will back and forth in an endless loop until one of you cancels it with Control, or deploys an interior site. If they send down a search party, be over joyed! Characters they select for their search party can&#39;t search until control phase, move or participate in battles they initiate until their NEXT TURN! So you can ether beat down on them, or use Sandwhirl again! <br />
<br />
VS ITTWC: <br />
You have Sandwhirl. They have the Desert Landing Site, which is a DESERT! Nuff Said. Even if they use the Expand the Empire/Cantina combo I use in Disarming Darth Booty Bash, don&#39;t reveal your Sandwhirl tech until they do something stupid.<br />
<br />
VS CCT (flip)<br />
We all know how to flip CCT by now, get popsicle Han to the Audience Chamber ASAP. What you may not know is, due to location deployment rules for Tatooine sites, Docking Bay 94 is on one side of Tatooine and Jabba&#39;s Palace is on the other. Meaning, they have no choice but to move Han ACROSS any and all exterior Tatooine sites to get to the AC, including the HTR. Always use your default start for CCT. Since most players are already starting to get used to the idea of not having Han to work with anyway, why not make both him AND his captor go missing with Sandwhirl? I would! (NOTE: To all of you who have posted a flipable CCT that I have reviewed, THIS is why I told you to include a Tempest Scout 1 in your deck. Now do you understand? At the very least you could pull the Walker with the AO Battle Deployment and use it with Trample to help hold one of your DBs. The only other option I can think of right now would be to include Mos Espa DB or the <> DB that can be deployed next to JP, but then you need IAO. Your call....) <br />
<br />
As well as this deck/combo has preformed for me in the past, I feel that it may be due for an overhaul. I was thinking it may be time to turn it from a mains platform into a type of Big Blue.........but I will talk about that deck if/when I post it. Until then, give it a shot with what I just told you, it&#39;s a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maul likes to drink heavily<br />
It&#39;s true! I see him in the bar all the time! Wait a tick......I guess that means I drink just as much as he does. Well if knowing is half the battle, the other half is buying the next round or beer.<br />
<br />
Desert Landing Site and Expand the Empire:<br />
All of you who have seen my most recent deck, Disarming Darth Booty Bash v3.5, should know this one. Unlike in my deck strategy, however, here I will show you 1 or 2 other applications for this combo as well as it&#39;s weaknesses.<br />
<br />
The best thing about Expand the Empire is the fact that it only &quot;Expands&quot; your game text, not opponents. This is huge with the Desert Landing Site because it is the text on the opponents side of that site which gives you the most problems. Let&#39;s face it, the DLS is a DRAIN SITE, plain and simple so when your opponent can cancel that drain just by deploying Amidala(who they can pull from their deck with YOUR card, I Will Find Them Quickly, Master) you have to stop draining and go get her. You could avoid this by not using I Will Find Them Quickly Master, but this card not only pulls If The Trace Was Correct(so you get your drain bonus), but ITTWC also DEPLOYS ON IT, making it the backbone of your drain. EtE fixes this without breaking a sweat. Remember that it is YOUR TEXT on that site that lets you deploy Maul for free and drain +2 there if ITTWC is on table. With EtE deployed on the DLS, you can now use that text at both adjacent sites as well! That&#39;s a maximum of THREE sites that Maul now deploys free and drains +2, two of which whether Amidala is deployed or not!!!! <br />
<br />
The first method I will describe is the same one found in my deck, DDBB v3.5, were I use LLL(v) to deploy Maul&#39;s favorite bar, the Cantina, first turn and use ITTWC and Maul&#39;s Double Saber to get a drain of 6 there. Depending on your starting stuff and whether EtE is in your starting hand, you can start draining for 6 as early as your second turn, without fear of Honor Of The Jedi or Sandwhirl. Deploy Rodian(v) and back up like Dr. Evazan for example and you are set.<br />
<br />
The next method is with Imperial Arrest Order to deploy DB 94 and the Mos Espa DB on ether side of the DLS. This works well if you want to back Maul up with Walkers and Trample, and use Mobilization Points for added activation. I find that this works best with a SAC package, to help with Fallen Portal. This type also seams to free up more room for your space stuff too, oddly enough.<br />
<br />
As for the Weaknesses of this combo that I mentioned earlier, well it is actually also one of the advantages for the AITC deck listed above: Tatooine Location Deployment Rules. The DLS is an exterior site, so it must be placed between DB 94 and JP. If they deploy DB 94, you can no longer get the drain bonus at Cantina. It will still work at the DB however, but only for a drain of 5, bummer. The same can be said about any exterior Tat sites they deploy during the game. Also, EtE is not immune to Alter, so be sure to have protection in the form of D-shields, Effects or a SAC package of your own. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is something I like to call BLUE BALLS<br />
You know, when the sac is shut down<br />
<br />
Anti-SAC combo effect and NO Escape:<br />
This is a very simple combo that we seldom see anymore. Anti-SAC cards protect you from opponents Sence and Alter. Anti-Sac cards can be found in the form of Effects and D-shields. Honor of The Jedi protects opponent from the force lose caused be anti-SAC cards. No Escape can help against HOTJ, but only if you use the anti-SAC EFFECTS!! I know that D-shields help save card slots in you deck, but if play cards that are not immune to Sence and Alter that are still very important to your overall strategy( like Imperial Command for example) then sacrifice 2 card slots for TINT/OE combo and NE, it may save you the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BONG!...Bring out your dead!......BONG!.....Here&#39;s one...........I&#39;m not dead...........What?.........Nothing. Here&#39;s your nine pence.<br />
Like a card that is &quot;dead&quot;? There may be a way to bring it back........and it doesn&#39;t involve a mad scientist, vampirism, or a religious belief structure of any kind. <br />
<br />
Shield Busters and Dead Cards:<br />
Never think for a minute that D-shields can stop everything, they can&#39;t. This is going to be short and sweet. Now that we have the ability to deploy stuff from under our starting effects, but are still limited to ten cards under it and (for the most part) three D-shields on table, do you really think most people still have the obscure shields under there? With this in mind, won&#39;t it be fun to breath new life into a Numbers or Operative deck, or maybe you miss playing Weapon Levitation and Scanning Crew as much as I do? All I&#39;m asking is that you give it some thought, because one of the things that makes this game so good is the fact that there really is no such thing as a &quot;dead&quot; card.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I know I promised 6 more combos for you, but the AITC thing ended up being a lot longer than expected, and included the 6th combo anyway(non-virtual SAA and A Gift), so I hope you can forgive me. <br />
<br />
Enjoy and thanks for reading!!!!<br />
