There are just a lot easier ways for light side to bring the fight to its opponent.  There have also been some really incredible virtual cards made to help light side out in this endeavor.  Listed below are the five virtual cards that we consider to be the best benefactors to light side battling decks.  As usual, we&#39;ll give our takes after each other&#39;s top 5.<br />
<br />
<b>Armaedes&#39; top 5 LS Battle Aids</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Civil Disorder (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  You may not play Rebel Barrier.  Whenever you initiate a battle, you may activate 1 Force and/or take the topmost character (without a permanent weapon or a maintenance cost) from your Lost Pile into hand.  Senators are deploy +2.  May lose 1 Force to cause a combat card to be lost.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
Like it&#39;s counterpart, Ability, Ability, Ability (V), this is the ultimate battling helper for its allegiance.  You gain bonuses for initiating battles (in the form of retrieving characters that you can then use to battle), and it slows down two problematic matchups for beatdown decks, senate and lightsaber combat.  For my money, there is no better battling card in the game than Civil Disorder (V) because light side has so many other cards to help it out like Quick Draw (V), Sai&#39;tor Kal Fas (V), Mantellian Savrip and A Jedi&#39;s Resilience.  No light battling deck should ever be without this card.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Yep, I chose to include this with AAA on my DS listing it also tops my list at #1.  I would play these cards even without the anti Senate and LSC text, which feels clumpy and tacked on.  <br />
<br />
<b>2. Evacuation Control (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  When deployed, shuffle your Reserve Deck, peek at top 3 cards, and place them face-down here.  Once per battle, you may place one card here in your hand to prevent either player from drawing more than one battle destiny (battle destiny draws may not be modified or cancelled).  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
The reason this card is on the list is because it makes light side immunity mains good again.  Now instead of dropping your EPP and taking out a couple of characters, you can drop down your immunity main and take out a couple of characters and still have the immunity main around next turn to drain on the location.  This also stops your opponent from messing with your destiny draw via the senate objective, which is important if you want to really cause some battle damage.  Although this card appears more defensive in nature it can actually be a very powerful offensive card.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
This ranks just outside my top 5 on both sides.  CD/AAA have already conditioned you to getting more mileage out your immunity mains, this just reinforces that principle.  I don&#39;t like this in the early game in case a key card gets trapped under the Effect, but mid-game onwards it is a welcome play.  I think this will also give those decks that rely solely upon immunity mains (THGG, WHAP, Invasion) a little bump into playability.  Remember, total battle destiny can still be affected!! <br />
<br />
<b>3.Down With The Emperor (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  All immunity to attrition is reduced by 3.  You may not fire permanent weapons.  Whenever a Dark Jedi is lost, or opponent loses a battle, opponent loses 1 Force.  During your draw phase, use 3 Force or place this card in your Used Pile.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
This is much better than the dark side version, A Day Long Remembered (V), because it doesn&#39;t hurt you if you decide you want to keep it on the table.  When facing Imperial Justice (V), the immunity reduction is good because otherwise it could be problematic cracking Lord Vader&#39;s immunity < 6.  Also, since you are battling you can count on making your opponent lose lots of Dark Jedi as well as lots of battles, so the additional Force loss is important.  Furthermore, the card is destiny-6 and easily cycles back into your Reserve Deck for easy tracking.  If you generate enough Force - and every mains deck should have solid generation - it will be an easy thing to pay the 3 Force &quot;upkeep&quot; cost if you should need to.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
ADLR is #2 on my DS listing, and I have to take exception with DWTE being better than it.  These cards aren&#39;t meant to stay on the table this card is wonderful to cycle through your deck for destiny of whatnot.  The upkeep is manageable, but I can&#39;t think of any time I&#39;ve used this card and kept it on the table by paying for it.  <br />
<br />
<b>4. Quick Draw (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  Once per game, may / Sai&#39;Torr Kal Fas.  Your lightsabers are destiny +2 and may target vehicles for 2 Force (-1 to each destiny draw).  Once per turn, if you just lost a character weapon, you may place that weapon in Used Pile.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
This card promotes battling for two reasons.  First of all, it makes those immunity mains with weapons much stronger as they will always have access to their weapon, since Sai&#39;torr (V) can get it out and Quick Draw (V) sends it to the Used Pile if it&#39;s lost.  The other reason this helps battling decks is that it allows light mains decks to target vehicles, which have been a safe haven from light side weapons for a long time.  Now dark vehicles aren&#39;t safe from lightsaber-toting mains.  As an added benefit, your lightsabers get a destiny bonus as well.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
An added benefit?? I always looked at that destiny bonus as a big fat target for Overload, which can rear its ugly head on occasion.  The only Dark Side vehicle I regularly see is Bliz 4 (unless you are playing Walkers), and it has enough counters for me (Heroic Sac is my favorite).  If you have a card slot it&#39;s nice, but if you are putting all this effort into immunity mains I think you should plan on them never leaving the table so I personally would just run Sai&#39;torr.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Impressive, Most Impressive (V)</b><br />
<i>Cancel Imperial Barrier (when targeting your Jedi), Stunning Leader (in a battle your Jedi is in), You Are Beaten (except when cancelling Uncontrollable Fury) or All Too Easy.  Immune to Sense.  OR Once per game, if opponent just initiated a battle, you may take the first action in the weapons phase.</i><br />
<br />
Last on the list because of how specific it is, but still a solid battling helper due to its ability to cancel just about every battle evasion method dark side can come up with.  The trick is that it has to be targeting a Jedi, but frankly most light battling decks are going to be heavy on the Jedi anyway (Mace Windu (V), Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and possible a Jedi persona of Luke Skywalker).  Cancelling battle evasion is obviously a very good thing for a battling deck, but the card doesn&#39;t stop there.  If your main should survive the battle and are still at the site, and the dark player retaliates, you can use this card to take the first action of the weapons phase, which means you can strike out at one of your opponent&#39;s characters before they have a chance to do any tricks with Dr. Evazan or Dark Strike.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
#5?? Aw, man it&#39;s my #1.  I don&#39;t want to steal my own thunder so read on.  I think this was a very good card to come out of the player designed card experiment.<br />
<br />
<b>Shewski&#39;s top 5 LS Battle Aids</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Impressive, Most Impressive (V)</b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
When you deploy to battle in modern SWCCG, the biggest thing you fear is the re-beat, where your opponent minimizes your offensive power, reinforces on their turn, and then beats you down.  Evasion and character removal are two prime ways to slow down a feisty LS player.  IMI takes care of it all.  I don&#39;t think its specificity is a hindrance at all.  Barrier will often be saved for your big guns (Jedi).  Most battles involve Jedi (Stunning), and YAB will target those aforementioned big guns.  Being able to battle on your own terms is very nice.  The secondary text is quite nice as well, as Armaedes pointed out.  Though protective in nature, it can turn a defensive battle into an offensive one quickly.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I agree that this is a great card, but #1?  This is a very deck-specific card, as it won&#39;t work in a battling deck that isn&#39;t mains, and even in a mains deck it won&#39;t help you with EPP Luke.  A very nice card no doubt, as it made my own list, but not an auto-play by any means.<br />
<br />
<b>2. I Wonder Who They Found (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on Han or Back Door; draw two cards from Reserve Deck.  Your Rebels are defense value +2 and are immune to attrition < 4.  Imperials deploy +1 here.  May place Effect in Used Pile to cancel the targeting of a character weapon.</i><br />
<br />
Wow, oh wowie.  I really enjoyed V8 for all the new possibilities that it brought to LS battling, and this is one of them.  It is a new twist on the &quot;Fab Four&quot; Effects that can fit into a variety of decks.  The deployment choices are nice, but it is stronger going on the Back Door.  Immediately you get some extra card advantage.  Universally your EPPs and other scrub Rebels get stronger, and your opponents have some trouble deploying to your stronghold (especially nice if deployed on Han).  The best thing about this text is the ungrabbable Blaster Deflection.  Lots of bad things can happen to your hit characters, so don&#39;t let it happen.  General Solo can pull this every turn for optimal abuse.  You can even cancel your own targeting if you want to cycle this for more cards on the following turn.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Aargh!  I can&#39;t believe I forgot this one!  Although I think of this less as a battling card and more of a defensive card.  In a battling deck these days, you rarely want your characters to stay on the table for long because they&#39;ll run the risk of a return beating.  Really this card is about keeping your guys alive, not beating down your opponent&#39;s guys.  Still a solid card, but not what I would consider a &quot;typical&quot; battle aid.<br />
<br />
<b>3. K&#39;lor Slug (V) (and Molator (V))</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table. Your characters present about to be lost during a battle (before the damage segment) remain in play and must be forfeited for 0 at end of battle. Non-Jedi characters without weapons are immune to Bad Feeling Have I. (Immune to Alter.)</i><br />
<br />
One of my pet peeves, briefly touched upon under #1, is character removal.  The Dark Side is rife with popular ways to get rid of your heroes such as Dr. Evazan, Dark Strike, and Choke Vader.  K&#39;lor Slug (and Molator for the DS) helps you avoid painful beatdowns due to sudden losses of power and destiny draws.  While this is more like IMI in that it helps your battles hold their effectiveness, the second part of the text goes very well with immunity mains.  Your mains can get out at their normal cost, which greatly speeds up the time it takes to get them into play by a turn or more.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Again, I find this less of an offensive aid than a defensive aid, and more of a battle-hindering card than anything else.  The dark side&#39;s character removal is a big way dark wins battles, so in my opinion taking this away makes effective battling more challenging.  I really like this card - I think it is a necessary component of the game - but I&#39;m not sure I would classify it as a battling aid.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Leia (V)</b><br />
<i>P:3 A:4 D:2 F:5<br />
Leia&#39;s game text may not be canceled. While at opponent&#39;s Galactic Senate, may lose 1 Force to place Leia and any character present out of play. Once per battle at her location, may cancel game text of opponent&#39;s leader of ability < 5 present for remainder of turn.</i><br />
<br />
Leia is a revolutionary card.  She is a very cheap destiny draw that allows for an early disruption of the Dark Side&#39;s setup.  Though envisioned as an anti-Senate card, she has many other strong uses.  Most used is probably her leader canceling game text, which can set up some beats of her own.  She can take the teeth out of Jabba, Xizor, P-59, Fel, Igar, Ephant Mon, Veers, Thrawn, and Tarkin.  This text always works as well.   Typically, such a powerful card wouldn&#39;t be so cheap, but she has been an early thorn in my opponent&#39;s side for some time now.  Usually my choice for a utility Leia, but Princess Leia (V) deserves consideration as well.<br />
<br />
 ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
YES!  Leia (V) is a fantastic battling card.  Not only does she have strong gametext for battling herself, but she also takes a bite out of senate, which is a deck that makes effective battling by the light side more challenging.  I would even put this Leia above EPP Leia for battling effectiveness.  Great pick by Shewski!<br />
<br />
<b>5. That&#39;s One (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on Chewie or Back Door; activate 2 Force.  Your battle destiny draws are +1.  Once per game, may lose 2 Force to cancel a battle just initiated.  May place Effect in Lost Pile to relocate your character to an unoccupied site related to that character.</i><br />
<br />
I guess you can figure out that I&#39;m a big fan of the new Endor Effects.  This one is nice but in my mind not as strong as IWWTF.  First off, its a little more limited on its deployment since Chewie is generally not as useful as Han.  Secondly, it doesn&#39;t have the loop potential that IWWTF has.  But it is still hard to deny the effectiveness of the Effect.  Extra activation is always nice, but it is a mandatory activation be sure to factor that into any tracking plans of yours.  The universal battle destiny bonus is very helpful as is the battle canceling text.  Use that if you get into a pinch and then cut into the odds with a well timed Sorry About the Mess.  The most exciting bit of text on this card is the relocation part at the end.  You can use it defensively to get out of the way of a beat.  You can use it offensively to jump into a battle.  You can also use it to get to an empty site, which ostensibly helps RST but also can get you an extra Force drain.  The possibilities are endless!<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I find it hard to consider a card that has &quot;cancel a battle&quot; in its gametext to be a good battle-aiding card, but the rest of the text is undeniably battle-oriented.  Adding 1 to battle destiny draws is huge, and at worst will offset Lando Calrissian (V) trying to reduce your battle destiny.  The &quot;Path Of Least Resistance&quot; text is also great for warping one of your big guns into a battle, especially in an Endor deck where you&#39;re playing a number of related locations.  The deployment restrictions of this card keep it from making my own list, but in the right deck this can really cause your opponent some unexpected pain.<br />
<br />
There you have it!.  Keep an eye out for the DS version so you can see what the bad guys have to offer in terms of making your battles more and more worthwhile.   <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6249&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
