<br />
The game of Star Wars has changed dramatically since I first began playing it.  Decks used to be very reactive, and they ran many more multiples than they do today since the basis of decks was card drawing.  Since the inception of virtual cards, the nature of decks has changed dramatically.  Strategies that seemed card intensive are now quite simple with the implementation of defensive shields, additional starting cards, uploading and downloading and the like.  <br />
<br />
So what does this mean for deck building?  This means that the majority of the decks that one will encounter at a tournament will have a strategy that is very reliable, and will establish itself in similar ways almost every game.  A side effect of this is that the &quot;old school&quot; decks are phasing out, at a very rapid rate.  One such example is Throne Room Mains, a deck that 40-50% of the light side players played following Special Edition.  Now a realistic estimate would be about 5-10% of all light side players would use this deck today.  <br />
<br />
Why is this?  As an Economics major, I am constantly dealing with the issue of efficiency, and this is no different with Star Wars CCG.  Decks are simply more efficient now than they were when throne room was the best light side option.  Granted, throne room decks have become more efficient themselves, but there are many more efficient light side options today.  Some of these examples are LS Senate, WYS, Speeders, Hidden Base.  All of these decks follow a similar game plan from game to game. <br />
<br />
This means that for deck building, decks today should be efficient and take advantage of the increased speed that the new cards allow for.  A deck that sets itself up very consistently will allow the player to spend less time worrying about how to setup their strategy, and more time to worry about dealing with their opponent&#39;s game plan.  This is critical because this is the nature of the game today, one player&#39;s game plan against another player&#39;s game plan.<br />
<br />
However, this does not mean that decks that do not have a setup do not still have their particular advantages.  The focus of the majority of decks today is on their setup and not on reacting to the opponent.  This means that if you get a bad match up, it largely comes down to luck as to whether or not you will be able to win the game.  A reactive deck like a Throne Room Mains would have a chance to compete in every game.  The best of both worlds is the deck that Brandon Schele and I used at worlds this year, Justin Desai&#39;s and Mike Gemme&#39;s KTOD (Kashyyyk Train Of Dominance) Dark Side Senate.  The deck has a very efficient setup and can directly attack the opponent&#39;s strategy, and react to the game.<br />
<br />
Another key about the game today is the incredibly high destiny.  Unless you have very honed tracking abilities, you should consider the increased average destiny.  To provide an example, if you calculated the average destiny of a deck with high destiny a few years ago (by adding all the destiny numbers of the non-starting cards and dividing it by that number of cards) a deck with strong destinies would have an average destiny of 3.5.  Now, almost every deck has an average destiny of that, and good decks have an average destiny of 4 or even higher after starting cards are revealed.<br />
<br />
Another important thing to remember about this is that because of this, some characters are simply not as strong as they used to be.  One good example of this would be Emperor Palpatine.  Sure, he has immunity to attrition but because of these increased average destinies, he quite frequently will not survive battles due to weapons hitting him.  This makes (V) The Emperor seem like a much better deck choice (regardless of the destiny tradeoff) because of his built in weapon ability, along with his other text.  If the Emperor&#39;s immunity to attrition is not going to save him in the battle, then why bother wasting a card slot on him, when (V) The Emperor simply has better gametext?<br />
<br />
Another important factor about efficiency is not just deck efficiency (the overall speed/consistency of a deck) but in card efficiency as well (using the least amount of cards to do the job).  Simply put, this means not using three cards when one will do the job.  Good ways to judge this are through playtesting.  Do you really need that Red Leader in Red 1 to hold Bespin in that QMC deck where you have the Falcon, Red 5, Red Squadron 1, (V) Tantive IV, (V) Bright Hope and Outrider?<br />
<br />
However, for your Hidden Base Deck, that Red Leader in Red 1 might not be a bad addition to that space fleet.  This brings up another point, about the context of the deck you are building.  You have to make sure you take advantage of you deck&#39;s strengths while trying to limit/eliminate its weaknesses.  Figuring these out all comes from playtesting, which is an invaluable tool for deck building.  Experience is critical, and only you can gain that for yourself.<br />
<br />
Another good thing for deck building is to try to think about cards to hurt your opponent&#39;s strategy.  Hayes Hunter described this best to me saying, &quot;When I think about how to hurt my opponent, I think about the cards that I do not want to see my opponent play against me if I was playing the opposite side of this match up.  I think about which cards would screw me, and then I play them&quot;.  This is the correct strategy, because anytime you can make your opponent&#39;s job more difficult for them, that is just as good as making your job easier for you.  <br />
<br />
Now that I have described very general patterns and recommendations for deckbuilding, I will talk about some of my own patterns that worked for me.  Many players have told me that I build very strong decks, and I have always felt I could always look at a deck and improve it for me.  Granted, what works for me will not necessarily work for you, but this happens with any two players.  Example being, what works for Jonathan Chu will not always work for Brian Hunter and vice versa.  You should identify your play style and build your decks accordingly, or play the decks that fit your play style.  These are two different issues, you can always adapt a deck so that it is better for your play style, and at the same time, there are always deck types that will already fit your style.  I will discuss play styles later in this article.<br />
<br />
One of the things I always try to do with my decks is to make sure that I have a very strong space package.  This is because generally in games there will be less battleground systems on the table than battleground sites.  If you cannot maintain a presence in space then Battle Plan/Order will become a big problem and you will not be able to spend as much force, as you originally wanted for reinforcing yourself, battling, moving or card drawing.  I have always felt Battle Order and Battle Plan were critical for the way the game is today, and I tend to agree with Justin Desai&#39;s comment to &quot;always pay to drain regardless of how much force you have.&quot;  Nevertheless, at the same time, not having to pay to drain is optimal.  <br />
<br />
Another thing I tried to do with my decks is make sure that I could cause overflow during battles and this was generally due to particular interrupts which I will mention here quickly.  Sorry About The Mess & Blaster Proficiency, Sniper & Dark Strike, Fallen Portal, Clash of Sabers, You Are Beaten, and Maul Strikes (I am specifically referring to the dueling portion).  These interrupts are what Magic players refer to as &quot;creature removal&quot; and the concept is similar in SWCCG.  Immediately removing characters from battle is extremely powerful, and I know this is why Brian Hunter loves the card (V) Molator so much, because this deals with this issue.  Even though some players use this card, many others simply do not and this makes these first few cards very potent weapons.<br />
<br />
A series of very aggressive cards I tend to play are ones that cause direct damage to the opponent.  These include Search + Destroy, Ability Ability Ability, Limited Resources, Legendary Starfighter, Civil Disorder, Visage of the Emperor, some senators and First Strike/Draw Their Fire.  The concept of &quot;free damage&quot; is amazing in this game, and any additional damage makes the game quicker and easier, and increases differential.  I try to play at least a few of these cards in every deck to try to increase the deck&#39;s damage potential.<br />
<br />
A series of very defensive cards I tend to play are ones that cancel cards that are potentially game breaking.  These include Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down, It&#39;s Worse, Masterful Move, Transmission Terminated, and of course the good old favorites Sense and Alter.  The card Dodge used to be my favorite in the game before the Player&#39;s Committee seriously hurt battle evasion, but besides Dodge, Sense and Alter were always my favorite cards in the game.  The reason is quite simple, it is because they are the most abusive interrupts ever made, Sense especially.  One thing that many top SWCCG players hate is surprises, and I quote Scott Lingrell about this, &quot;If a good player plays a card against you that you don&#39;t know what it does, be very very scared.&quot;  Sense and Alter help eliminate a lot of these scary moments.  A good example would be, say you are playing Hidden Base with non unique XWings against a high destiny Dark Combat deck, and lets say to flip them you have an Epp Qui Gon sitting at the Theed Palace: Generator Core.  During your control phase, you initiate a force drain at a system where you have 4 X-Wings, total power of 8.  Many players will see where I am going with this already.  Anticipating this force drain, your opponent plays Counter Assault, canceling the drain.  Their total destiny is is 20 (two 6&#39;s and two 4&#39;s).  You lose 12 force, and quite possibly the game.  This is when Sense is the most abusive interrupt in the game.  You never know what exactly is going to happen in a game.  Consider Sense/Alter your security blanket.  Moreover, I never consider it a bad play to grab Sense because of its potency. <br />
<br />
Another very important concept about deck building that very few people talk about, but most understand is synergy.  This is how well the cards in a deck work and combo with each other.  For example, most dark deal and speeder decks have a lot of synergy.  The cards work very well together, and most of them help pull each other and make each other stronger.  A specific Hidden Base deck that Paul Maholick showed me in March 2004 exhibited this.  It used Luke/Red 5, Wedge/Red Squad 1, Dash/Outrider and then it used Red 7, 8 and 10 from special edition.  He said, &quot;The problem with most hidden base decks is that the ships are meant to be able to draw destiny at systems by themselves, but when you put them together nothing else really happens.  All you get is two ships together that both could have drawn battle destiny by themselves.&quot;  With this particular example, the ships got STRONGER as the game progressed and as they combined with each other to create a more powerful effect.  This is the concept of deck synergy.<br />
<br />
Then there is the question of how much specific tech a deck should run for its problem match ups.  As a general rule of thumb, I try not to use more than 5 cards in a deck to tech out against problem match ups, and by this, I mean cards that only have a use against a particular deck.  Examples of this are (V) Scrambled Transmission or (V) Heroic Sacrifice.  However, other cards work very well against specific decks but are multifunctional, these I would separate from this category.  Some of these would include (V) For Luck, (V) Sabotage and (V) Logistical Delay.  These cards will be useful in many more than just one specific match up, but at the same time, they can be the push your deck needs to win those difficult match ups.  <br />
<br />
As always, there is the quite simple question about activation for decks and this goes back to the idea of efficiency.  As a rule of thumb, I always would go for guaranteed activation over activation you had to draw for.  For example, an activation scheme I have seen many decks run is the Jedi Council Chamber, Boss Nass Chambers and 3-4 interrupts to pull these.  The player is dedicating six cards to an activation scheme that is not reliable, and quite frequently both of these sites would not hit the table in a timely fashion.  In addition, besides pulling locations these interrupts have very little use after the first few turns.  Meanwhile docking bays guarantee activation by turn 3 at the latest, consistently every game, while also having those extra 3-4 card slots for other things (or other activation).  Pullable sites to me have always been the optimal solution even though they do not provide as much force as others.  They are a great solution for any deck that is not Throne Room mains.<br />
<br />
Finally, the most important part of deck building is the balance between all of these individual parts, and that comes from experience, play style, and Meta.  An important thing to realize is that before you worry about a deck&#39;s weaknesses and a deck&#39;s balance, you should first make sure that the deck achieves its goal effectively, and it does not depend on the opponent to do anything.  Even when you do not build the deck yourself and you are just making changes to someone else&#39;s list, try to keep these things in mind.  A good judge of your deck will be when you have to lose force, and you have to really consider which cards from your hand you want to lose, or if you want to lose off the top of reserve.  If you can see the reasons why every card in your hand can be useful in the situations you are seeing (or anticipating) you know that your deck is capable of handling most of what it will encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Playtesting<br />
<br />
I feel that playtesting is imperative in becoming a good player, and even more so, in staying on top of things once you have honed your playing skills.  There are many things to consider during playtesting, and I will cover each one of them in depth.<br />
<br />
a) Practice with a deck<br />
<br />
Primarily, playtesting allows you to practice a deck that you may or may not be familiar with, as a way to figure out the ins and outs of the deck.  If you have not played in a while, it can help you simply get back in the swing of things.  Regardless, it is better than going into a tournament blind, and making stupid mistakes that you know you should not have.  If you ever find yourself saying, &quot;If I had just play tested, I would not have made that mistake&quot; then you know the problem.  This is clearly the first step before you can make any further progress in the process.<br />
<br />
b) Changes to a deck<br />
<br />
After deck construction, playtesting is an invaluable tool in refining what looked like a great deck on paper.  Weaknesses become quickly apparent, and unnecessary cards (overkill) are equally apparent.  Thorough playtesting is the ultimate tool in making decks more efficient and more capable.<br />
<br />
c) Deck selection<br />
<br />
Many players will play test to decide what deck they want to use for a tournament, because many will consider a few different deck options before a tournament.  Playtesting can make this decision very simple because you can compare decks to each other based on how they performed.  Without playtesting, players make this decision on theoretical assumptions and comparisons on paper, instead of making real decisions based on deck strength.<br />
<br />
d) Game Plan/Strategies<br />
<br />
Depending on your experience and abilities as a player, forming a game plan for how to play against a specific deck could be very easy.  For me, I always wanted to play test to find out what method of attack works best in particular situations, so that by the time a tournament came around it was simple repetition of what I had practiced earlier.  Through this kind of hard work, you can achieve foresight about how games will happen which allows you to be able to predict and thus be less surprised during a game.  By knowing exactly what will happen, and how to go about it, you will be in control during the game, and the game of SWCCG is a game of control.  Control over yourself, your deck, your opponent and your luck.  The more control you have the better chance you will have to win.  Through the hard work of playtesting, you can achieve this.  Granted, some players already have this, and this is what Brian Hunter refers to as &quot;the feel&quot; in his article about how to become a better tournament player.  The way to achieve &quot;the feel&quot; if you do not naturally have it, is to practice and to think about how to act in certain situations, and why that is the optimal way to act.   <br />
<br />
e) Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses<br />
<br />
Nothing will let you analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your deck (and others) than by playtesting the match up directly.  This is the most important part of playtesting in my opinion.  By analyzing my decks weaknesses, I am able to strengthen and reinforce those weak points, while letting the decks strong points take control of the game.  In addition, by analyzing deck weaknesses, I instinctively know my direct plan of attack against these match ups.  This is powerful, and makes the game very difficult for your opponent, which ultimately makes it easier for you.<br />
<br />
f) Offensive Playtesting<br />
<br />
Offensive Playtesting is simply looking for the strongest, most aggressive deck that you can find.  You analyze what methods of attack are optimal for certain match ups, and how to react to certain game situations.  By doing this, you are able to understand what works and what does not, so that by the tournament you are just acting based on instinct, rather than trying to figure the situation out at that particular point in the game.  This is what Brian Hunter describes as &quot;the feel&quot;.  It reminds me directly of another quote from Hayes Hunter when he told me, &quot;My brother and I have played so many match ups against each other by this point that when I get to a tournament I am seeing situations that I have already played before, and I know exactly what to do now.  At tournaments, I am no longer surprised.&quot;<br />
<br />
g) Defensive Playtesting<br />
<br />
Defensive Playtesting happens when you have selected which deck you are most likely to use at the event, and all you do is offensively play test other decks against your deck of choice.  You aggressively attack its weak points.  This allows you to find the strengths of your deck, as well as methods of improving it.  What it also allows for is the experience of what your opponent will feel when playing against your deck and their mindset for the match up, and this is invaluable.  If you already know what your opponent is thinking, you can exploit that to your advantage.<br />
<br />
h) Knowing your Enemy<br />
<br />
Knowing your opposition is an important part of this game now that tournaments are smaller than they used to be.  Going into a tournament, you know who your strongest opposition will be, and probably what you anticipate them to play.  Playtesting this particular match up is the best way to prepare for the tournament.  By knowing what your opponent is going to try to do to beat you, you will be prepared and have tricks up your own sleeve.<br />
<br />
3) Play Styles<br />
<br />
Briefly, I am going to try to analyze Play Styles, and I will do this through talking about how a few different players play the game.  You probably will play in a similar fashion to one of these players, but exhibit traits of others.  I have listed the following in alphabetical order, by last name.  I have chosen these players because they have very different play styles.  I could have included other players, but these were the easiest ones to illustrate my point with.  I apologize to any other players who I have excluded.<br />
<br />
Jonathan Chu  What Chu has done for the past few years, is he has played the most aggressive decks in the tournament field, and his entire gameplan has been about applying quick and direct pressure to the opponent.  In what others may consider a reckless play style, Chu directly makes YOU (the opponent) have to make a play to stay in the game, and then Chu will counteract you.  He understands what the pressure of his deck does to the opponent, and the usual ways they are going to react.  Because he knows this inside and out, he is ready for the ways opponents are going to react to him.  The strategy relies on his deck being the one that puts the most pressure on.  In the case where he plays against a deck that somehow applies even more pressure than his does, he has to adapt his gameplan and since he is such a good player, this is no problem for him, but this play style might not necessarily work for all people.  One good example of this, is in his Speed Deal deck.  I have seen a few different players try to use this strategy, and I myself have tried it as well, and we simply cannot get it to work that well, but Chu makes it work, and work very well.<br />
<br />
Justin Desai and Mike Gemme  They find a strong deck that deals a considerable amount of damage, and learn it inside and out.  They also realize quickly which cards are the strongest for the deck and play A LOT of them.  They play more multiple of strong cards than almost anyone does, because they want to have them for important situations.  I have tended to do this the past few years as well.  I was playing four dodges in my combat deck for a long time, this year&#39;s Throne Room deck ran four senses, and at one point had as many as three Goo Nee Tays.  Their decks also have incredible destiny, and some very creative tricks that opponents are not anticipating, (Blue Milk, (V) Heroic Sacrifice).  Desai and Gemme usually plan to win a few certain ways, and work their deck to be able to accomplish these, such as their WYS deck that relied heavily on Legendary Starfighter battles with the Falcon.  Their decks are incredibly strong, but they do not always work for all players, because some players want to have more cards that are different in their decks, and do not want to dedicate deck space to five fallen portals, four dodges and the like.  Some players also do not want to rely on so few characters, but as you can tell, it absolutely worked for Justin Desai, and Mike Gemme.<br />
<br />
Brian Hunter  One word describes his play style and thus his decks.  Solid.  Brian Hunter builds decks that are balanced, and solid overall.  They do not focus intensively on one particular strategy, they allow Brian to play and react to whatever situation faces him in the game.  He does not rely on pressure, or a particular aspect of his decks to try to win the game, he uses the decks balance and completeness to be able to address whatever issue may be a problem this particular game.  While this does not give his deck an aggressive edge, it absolutely gives him a chance to win every game, and to outplay his opponent.<br />
<br />
So what does knowing this do?  It allows a player to consider different play styles, and more importantly try to address their own, so that they can both build better decks and play them better.  You always want to play the decks that work with your play style and not try to learn someone else&#39;s because it will not always work for you.  You will have greater success focusing on your own abilities and strengths.  I hope that the players I have mentioned can serve as a rough guideline of different play styles for you.<br />
<br />
4) Tracking <br />
<br />
For this topic, I would like to recommend the numerous articles on decktech about the subject, which explain the topic in much further detail than I can.  In addition to these articles, I have a few suggestions about tracking.  If you have not learned how to track yet, the easiest way to do this is with a deck that you are very familiar with, that pulls relatively few cards from the reserve deck.  I find the easiest way is the bottom up method, which is if I have 5 cards in my used pile, and I play an omni box, I want to activate until I have 6 cards left in my reserve deck next turn.  I then add and subtract cards accordingly for each card I add or subtract to my used pile in following turns.  I find this method is easiest because once you know the number of cards beneath that destiny, you do not have to worry about it for the rest of that turn.  You either activate up to it the following turn, or you can add cards to the total and activate up to THAT amount the following turn.  I feel like I do not track in this game as much anymore, but I realized that I really do, it just feels like second nature now so I do not have to think about it as much.<br />
<br />
5) Tournaments/Pressure<br />
<br />
This is when your own confidence is the most important in Star Wars CCG.  I find the easiest way to deal with pressure in tournament games is to immerse myself in the game in front of me, and to block everything else out.  Forget about what is riding on the game, and just focus play by play.  This is akin to what any professional football coach or player would say about how they prepare for the season, taking it one game at a time.  By focusing on each individual action within a game, you rarely forget to take an action.  I still see very strong players forget to pull a card during their turn, or even forget to force drain in tournament games.  This baffles me because I simply do not make mistakes like this.  These may seem like minor mistakes to you, but in my mind, these are major mental mistakes.  When you focus a game play by play, you make sure you do not miss anything, and you are able to diagnose entirely the game situations that are in front of you, in addition to planning for the rest of the game.  <br />
<br />
The easiest way to feel confident in a game of Star Wars is to know your deck very well, have playtesting under your belt, and by playing more and more tournaments.  A good Star Wars player will know his decks very well, and be focusing on what their opponent&#39;s next play is likely to be, and how they will be able to respond to it.  There is very little I can say about this subject, except that you should always remember your decks strengths and weaknesses, and you own playing abilities, so that you are confident to tackle any situation you may see in a game.<br />
<br />
6) Knowledge Accumulation<br />
You may have just read this heading and been wondering what this could possibly mean.  This is how you can acquire knowledge about decks, the Meta, and your possible opponents.  I do not feel this is a hard thing to do nowadays with decktech.  Remember that you learn nothing by talking and everything by listening.  Tournament reports are the easiest way to notice what players are doing, and what trends are going on.  For example, if you see that both Greg Shaw and I qualified for Day 2 of worlds last weekend using a DS Tatooine drain deck, what can you learn from this.  Think it through, think of how other players are going to react or what they are going to do prepare for this deck in the future.  Furthermore, think of what you are going to do because of this.  Always try to find out the current trends in the game, and try to interpret their implications for the future.  Doing this helps you to establish a sense of the Meta.<br />
<br />
7) Establishing A Gameplan<br />
<br />
The best way to establish a gameplan against a certain strategy is to think about yourself sitting on the other side of the table.  Ask yourself, what the key strengths and weaknesses of the deck are.  If you can destroy or ignore their decks strengths, you win.  If not, you focus on the weaknesses, and try to make these weaknesses hurt substantially, while minimizing damage from the opponents decks strengths.<br />
<br />
For example, if I am playing against Watch Your Step, I say to myself, &quot;this deck is incredibly strong in space, but really does not have much power on the ground.&quot;  I think about my dark deck, and if I know that it cannot stand up to the light side in space, then I focus my efforts on destroying the deck on the ground, while holding my space for opportune moments, typically late game.  Always remember that you want to maximize your damage potential, rather than fighting long battles that will seemingly get you nowhere in the short run.  I could dedicate many resources to dealing with watch your step in space, but there really is no point, as I am eventually going to lose, and I am using many more resources than my opponent is.  It is simple economics really, the marginal benefit of fighting up in space against watch your step, does not outweigh the marginal costs most of the time, so it is really pointless to deal with.<br />
<br />
This really wraps up my article, before I go I would like to issue the following advice as well that does not really fit in any of the sections above.  Players should realize that the card backs on Star Wars cards, particularly light side cards have different color dyes on the back of them, which is noticeable if your opponent is using clear card sleeves.  Some players use this for their own advantage, and unfortunately, right now this is legal in the rules, and has been since the game&#39;s inception.  However, it is good to know that players do this, because if a player is doing this against you, if you pay attention you can anticipate what they are going to do against you with these destinies, and plan accordingly if there is anything you can do about it.  Be aware of your opponents, so that you can always play your best, and not have other factors get in your way of accomplishing what you want to accomplish in this game.<br />
<br />
I hope this was useful for your game, I felt I should share some of my knowledge with the community.  Good luck in your games.<br />
