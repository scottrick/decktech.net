<br />
Welcome again to another article about SWCCG. It has been awhile since I wrote anything for this game. So I apologize for my absence. I can say I havent felt as good about the game in 2006 with all the changes that were made. But is looks like the future is going to be bright, so I decided to write about something that has been on my mind for sometime. Please keep in mind that this was written more like a conversation, so I am sorry that there is a lot of first and second person. For something like this, I find that it makes for a much easier and more entertaining read. Please Enjoy.  <br />
<br />
 <br />
Ok, so I have returned from my 5th Worlds Tournament without making it to Day 3. It stinks yes, but how much of it was in my control?? For years, players have argued that only the best players win Worlds. But is this really true? Each year we spend the time playing in locals, talking on the boards, posting, reading, and reviewing decks. We do all this for fun as well as practice for the big Worlds tournament. Because I have been playing this game so long, I know that I really have no control over my outcome at Worlds. Each year of the game has been totally different from the previous year. Sometimes, there is a broken deck idea that has no bad match-ups and pretty much auto wins no matter what; examples Original WYS (v), Original V8 Scum, Original V8 Agents, Tuskan Drain with Timer Mines, Operatives, etc. Decks like this usually do not last long, and most of the time gets an errata to fix the negative experience playing against them. <br />
<br />
In the history of Worlds, it has really been about half and half to which Worlds had these decks and which had a wide range of normal decks that could lose if played against a hard match-up or higher skilled player. Now, the point of this article is to look at the game, and how much control a player really has when it comes to making it to Day 3. And then, winning Worlds.  <br />
<br />
In the past years of playing the game, I have been thinking about this a lot. I could be the best deck builder in the World, own as many cards as anyone, and be the best player in tournaments, yet STILL not make it to Day 3 nor win Worlds. Why is this?? Why are CCGs so up in the air?? From my experience, SWCCG does not have this problem as much as other CCGs since we are required to completely deck out our opponent as well as build two completely different decks for two completely different sides of the game. The random luck aspect is much less, BUT still exists. <br />
<br />
In a local tournament the best players almost ALWAYS win. It almost never matters what decks show up. Unless they are auto loss decks, the same three players seem to win week in and week out. A local will always come down to Ability. Whoever has the most 95% of the time will win, period. When two players that both know the game very well face off, then it breaks down into the luck aspect of the game. If you think back to all the close games you have played, I bet every single player who plays on a regular bases can relate to many of these examples of Luck. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
Listed below are examples of Luck I have found to exist within SWCCG. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
1 ) Opening Hand <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The beginning of the any SWCCG game will always begin with Luck. Nothing you can do about it. With an 8 card opening hand (in most cases) and usually 54 to 50 different options from your Reserve deck once your starting stuff is out, just about any combination of cards could be your first to play with. Depending on how you built your deck, and how much you are able to set up from the starting cards, the game outcome will play out from how good your opening hand is. That is where deck building comes into play with SWCCG.  <br />
<br />
The key these days is to build a deck that can set up and win no matter what your opening hand is, and for the most part, that is what happens in the majority of games played. If the deck requires you to get a specific card in your opening hand, then multiples of that card are used to increase the consistency. Many times for this to work, one would need anywhere from 5 to 10 copies to insure success. Even still, Luck will show its face when you still do not draw a copy when 1/6th  of the deck is that card, and another 1/6 is already on the table as your starting. <br />
<br />
For example, the pre-redux Sim (v) and Green Squadron 1 (v) were used to set up a lock on the opponent first turn. The original text said that each time your opponent / or /, they had to pay two force. So getting this going before the opponent could even set up usually set them back two or three turns. But, the only way for this worked was by getting one of them in your opening hand. In the history of the game, the best decks have never require that ANY specific card be in your opening hand. So this aspect is not the most common in SWCCG. <br />
<br />
Many decks are built with counter cards which are unique cards that are only in the deck to hurt a specific match-up. Sometimes one card can be used to hurt many different decks to save slots over using many counter cards. Some of the best examples are The Emperor (v)  hurts LS Senate, Profit, AITC, Undercover Spies; Imperial Decree (v)  protects against all different types of direct damage and all LS Force choke decks; Honor of the Jedi  protects against direct damage from most DS cards (unless No Escape in play) and Force drains at non-battleground; It Could Be Worse  just plain cancels ANY Force loss as long as you can play the Force to cancel it. Because these counter cards are needed to beat a specific match-up, if you are not able to get the card in your hand in time, it will be useless in the game because you will already be behind in card loss.  <br />
<br />
For example, this happened to me at Worlds this year. I was playing a CCT deck verse a Profit deck. Now for me to have a shot of holding the AC, I had to get The Emperor (v) in my opening hand after starting DrE Combo and EPP Mara Jade with the Profit objective. As Luck would have it, I got my one Emperor (v), which gave me complete control for the vast majority of the game. No Emperor means the AC would have been cleared by turn three, which means his whole strategy was slowed down and almost stopped while I held the AC. Did I do anything to change the outcome of this game by my skill?? Nope, it was a different game because of my Luck in my opening hand. Does this apply to every game you play? Of course not, but its still there. <br />
<br />
 <br />

 <br />
2) Specific Deck Match-Ups  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Match-up of a specific deck verse another will forever have a great affect on how a game plays out. This is what makes the game fun because in a tournament you normally have no idea what you are about to face. So all you can do is practice against similar versions and hope you have thought of every possible version that specific deck could produce. This aspect has a HUGE affect on what decks are chosen to be played in big tournaments.  <br />
<br />
For example if Huntdown becomes the most popular DS deck, then because I know that Hidden Base gives it the most trouble, I have a greater advantage of winning the match-up verse Huntdown than I would if I played a WYS deck. . At Worlds, I played a HB deck that was undefeated against Huntdown, Senate, SYCFA, and BHBM. All of which were played at Worlds, but I did get paired up against any of those decks. Nope, I had to play two CCT decks and one Ral Ops (its worst match-up). The current meta of the game is created from what becomes popular <br />
<br />
Luck comes into play with what match-up you will face each round. Unless you are playing a broken deck that beats everything no matter what, every deck will have at least one match-up that gives it a harder game. Some decks have auto losses. At different times in the game, one of the two sides will be weaker. Currently during this article, the LS is weaker. The Redux + Re-Edit have made the DS the stronger side with more options for decks that can win consistently verse all current LS options. Before these changes, the LS was the stronger side for over a year. <br />
<br />
Since you are forced to play both sides in a tournament, the weaker side will only win against a favorable match-up. Each year, this is what greatly determines who will make it to Day 3. Each game I am paired up with my weaker side, the Luck of what type of deck my opponent is playing will determine how hard the game will be to play and even win. From my years of playing, I am usually paired up at least once with my worst match-up. The tournaments I have won were because I was able to adapt and win the game despite having a disadvantage going into the game. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
3) Destiny Draws<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
The Destiny is what separates SWCCG from any other CCG (accept WARS of course) because unlike rolling dice. You have the ability to track and set up what you want a destiny to be, in turn controlling the outcome of your actions during the game. If you know you have a 1 for destiny on top, then you probably wont be battling Lord Vader. However, the vast majority of the game is played with completely no idea of what your destiny draw would be for ANY reason. This provides the largest amount of luck SWCCG currently has. Listed below are the different examples of how a different destiny draw can change the whole outcome of the game.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
-          Drawing a 6 for Ellis when you only have 5 saved OR drawing a 0 or 1 when you have 5 saved giving you extra force for another character in the battle. <br />
<br />
-          Missing the Sense or Alter draw after a huge SAC war or the moment you need to cancel an important card like Ellis, FWKTIL (v), Jedi Presence, etc. <br />
<br />
-          Missing an Epic Event or Jedi Test draw over and over and over, so much so that end up just sitting there taking drains until the game is over. Many decks that require an Epic Event to win do nothing until the Event is complete. Happens most often with Dueling Huntdown, Walkers, MBO, and MWYHL decks. <br />
<br />
-          Missing a weapon draw that would have either allowed you to play DrE or Sniper/SATM Combo to make the biggest character lost or you missed an important character that needs to be lost to win the game i.e. Xizor, Jabba, or Watto. The opposite also happens when your opponent is able to hit character with very high defense value with the only high destiny in their deck after you searched, and the deck was reshuffled right before the targeting. <br />
<br />
 <br />
(This happened in the same Profit game I mentioned earlier from this past Worlds. Remember I had total control over the AC with DrE Combo, EPP Mara Jade, The Emperor (v), PLUS Maul, YA with double stick and The Phantom Menace out. He had one 6, and a bunch of 4s, 3s, and one 1. So since I had TPM + Lando (v) out, only a 6 + 4 would be able to hit Maul. If Maul stayed, him + DrE meant auto beatdown. SO as luck would have it, he drew the 6 + 4, hit Maul and played SATM to make him lost. From there, the whole game changed.) Did I do anything wrong in this match-up? Nope. With only one way to hit lined up, would he miss more than hit? Yep, but that didnt happen in my game. So I lost. <br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
4) Specific Player Match-ups<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
The type of player you play against also has a great affect on the outcome of the game. When you sit down to play against someone you dont know, as you play the game you become aware of what kind of player they are. Some play fast to try and throw you off. Some play very slow so they dont forget or make a mistake. But no matter who you play, you can assume that if they are playing in Worlds that they know what they are doing. The luck of who you are pair against in your first game at Worlds will set the pace for your whole day. I find that if I win my first game, I do better. A few times I have lost the first game, then crawled back to the top for the last game, but more times than not. Whenever I won the tournament it was after a game one victory. <br />
<br />
So what makes one player better than another. The biggest difference between the elite is number of mistakes. We are all human, and this game does require you to remember about 50 things at once. At any given point in the game, there might be 10 to 20 different Effects in play total for both sides. The best players can remember what all of them do always so they know when to do which action. Of course every player has made a mistake at any given time because this game is hard. But you will find that the best are the ones that always seem to play mistake free Star Wars. <br />
<br />
Among the elite who know everything about the game, there are some who still get nervous in tournament play. These players will then resort to cheat through ignorance. They will attempt to get away with things that are not allowed simply because the opponent doesnt catch them. The most common version of this is only losing direct damage when the player reminds you. Many cards like Legendary Starfighter, Search and Destroy, Visage of the Emperor, Padme (v), Advantage, and Emperors Power (v) all require direct card loss during a specific phase of the game. This is supposed to happen automatically, but because there is no rule that says direct damage must be lost even during a later phase in the game. The only way it is lost is for the player to constantly remind the other player. With so many other things in the game to remember, even the best players will forget from time to time or when the pressure of having to win begins beat down in a Worlds tournament.  <br />
<br />
The players that win the most consistently catch everything. They are sharp and are always aware of what is going on. They also do a good job of always knowing how much force you are supposed to activate before its even your turn, so the moment you activate even one over, they know. Being paired up against one of these players first game means you have to start the day out at a high level.  <br />
<br />
Although it stinks having to play against a really good player, the worst match-up of all time has to be the Teammate match-up. There could be 50 players at the tournament, yet the random luck of life pairs you and the guy you playtest, build decks, and even sleep with up against each other. And the worse part is this will usually happen game 1 or 2. So you immediately send one of the two of you to the lower table. This match-up is the hardest because you are playing someone who not only knows every card in your deck, but has already played the exact game already, so they know how to play out the game in order to win. The luck of the game has more to do with this match-up than any other because the quickness at which you can find the cards you need usually determines the winner since you dont have the surprise factor. Plus, this player knows how the specific cards in your deck matches up with their own. For example, me and Brian Rippetoe had to play against each other game 2 after I lost that Profit game, and he lost to a previous Teammate match-up game 1 against Steven Lewis. We had already played out the exact game same side, same decks. We both knew every card in each others deck. Because he lost to me the first time we played, his strategy was totally different this time, plus we both got totally different cards in our hands. With so many players, it was very random that Brian would have to play against not one, but both of the players he road up with. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
 <br />
5) Bad Draws<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
The final luck aspect to the game is found with the random shuffle of your deck. As you play the game, / and /, deploy cards with your Force, and cycle the cards in your deck, you are constantly changing what cards you will get in your hand during your draw phase. Most games will play out as normal with no one card taken too long to find its way to your hand, especially if you are looking for it. <br />
<br />
Players find bad luck when 9 times out of 10, everything will work the way the deck is supposed to. But every so often, your perfectly built deck will just for no reason beat itself. I know you guys know about this. It happens every year, to almost every player. The number one deck of all time that does a great job of beating itself is Throne Rooms Mains. TRMs has been the strongest most versatile LS deck for years. Those who have played it have had at least one in their career where no matter what happened, all of your twix sites were stuck in your deck. With no sites, the deck never had Force to play with, and in turn was simply drains out. <br />
<br />
Another example that will never forget was at the 2005 Worlds when bottom seed Drew Scott defeated top seed Reid Smith because Reids Endor Mains deck never gave him a Jedi. Drew was playing a pretty basic Huntdown beats deck with matching weapons over EPPs. At the time, Endor Mains used not only the broken Back Door Effects but the FREE deploy Luke, Rebel Scout (v). The posted decklist showed 12 Jedi in the deck. During this Day 3 Worlds game, Drew set up Lord Vader with stick to the Endor: Rebel Landing Site turn one, and drained for 3 all game. Normally, a Jedi would have responded by LS turn 2, but in this specific game, Reid could not find a Jedi. Turn after turn, no Jedi. Only after half his deck was gone did he finally get one out only to have it killed shortly after. At this point in the game, Huntdown would have AUTO lost to this match-up, but because luck wanted Drew to win, Reids deck beat itself. <br />
<br />
There is similar story every year. This makes up the part of the game that just sucks because it has nothing to do with either the type of deck being played, the match-up, or the skill of the player. You just lose because it was your destiny to do so. <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Those five examples are why in the history of the game, the highest ranked players have NEVER won Worlds. Sure, all the players are good, but very rarely has the winner truly been a player someone would consider to be one of those Elite that no one wants to play against. And the person who won Day 2 almost never wins Worlds either. This is because both days are like completely different tournaments. You start a whole new day with all five Luck aspects starting all over again. <br />
<br />
 <br />
So, with all that has been explained, do you REALLY have control over winning Worlds?? Or each year are you just rolling the dice hoping not to crap out? We play hours each month, then take time off from work, school, and friends, spend money we dont have all to have the possibility of being a World Champion. Why?? <br />
<br />
 <br />
Money?? Well, we can now say that winning money is a reason to play the odds. In the past, Decipher didnt even offer that, so what then was the reason for trying to win? Title?? Perhaps it might be for the title of World Champion, something that no one could ever take away from you. For the rest of your life you would be that years SWCCG World Champion. And truly, it is a difficult feet. If you look back at the players that had the 2000+ ratings during the majority of the active game, you will notice that only 2 or 3 have actually won Worlds. Game after game, victory after victory, and despite the fact that some players reached 2000 and never dropped below, they never took the title of World Champion. Many times it was a no name or player that had been playing but either was not in the 2000 rating club or simply didnt play in a whole lot of local tournaments. Maybe they were not as active on Decktech, but when it came to winning the big one, they stepped up, got the draws and can now say they won this very major tournament. <br />
<br />
In the history of the game, there has been a total of 11 SWCCG World Champions. And out of those 11, there have been no repeats. No one has ever won Worlds twice, neither back to back nor completely different years. Even some of the best players of their time became lower end players as the years of the game changed the game play. What it takes to win now is not what it used to take. The game has become MUCH more difficult and requires a vast knowledge of 1000s of different cards and possible combos between the cards. Each time a new set was released, 100 new deck ideas were created. Now with the Virtual cards, we get about 50 different deck types with each set since the cards created usually open many older strategies that were died or hurt by a previous set. Cards that are introduced to the game now are usually a direct help to the meta. No longer do we have sets of hundreds of cards that have no play value. With no packs to feel with bad cards, only powerful specific cards become Virtual. <br />
<br />
 <br />
The point of this article was to show that we really play this game for fun. Sure, we all want to win Worlds, but honestly, the majority of us would have played 10 maybe 30 years, and never won the whole thing. The players in Day 3 may continue to be the same players each year, but the winner will always be someone different. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Luck will 9 times out of 10 decide who is Champion. Once you have the top 12 players all together for that years Day 3 tournament, only Luck will decide which LS deck has to play which DS deck game 1. Will Huntdown play Combat?? Will Hidden Base play Bring Him Before Me? From the match-up, you have the game play itself. Will you have the best match-up possible but top deck your key character, location, effect, weapon, ship, or purple card you needed to make your whole deck work or the one card you needed to beat the deck your opponent was playing? <br />
