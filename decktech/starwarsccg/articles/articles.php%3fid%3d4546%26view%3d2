Not just physically or geographically; everyone comes from somewhere in this game.  Some of us started playing competitively immediately upon learning the game.  Others, like me, enjoyed it as a side hobby for years before realizing there was an extensive tournament community out there.  Where we come from is simply a way of saying what our education in the game has been; and for me, the best way to describe that education is by describing the decks I&#39;ve built or played over the years and how they trace my development as a player.  So I&#39;m going to tell you about the first five decks I built, and along the way I&#39;ll impart some of the wisdom I&#39;ve gained from using these decks.<br />
<br />
By the way, this article is for beginning and intermediate players, not so much for advanced players.  But feel free to read it if you&#39;re interested (or even if you&#39;re not).<br />
<br />
Deck Number 1: Hidden Base<br />
Hidden Base was one of the first objectives I pulled from Special Edition back in the days of the game&#39;s first major metamorphosis.  Hidden Base, Ralltiir Operations, and the Operative Objectives were the only objectives I owned for a long time, but they were all I needed.  And I could tell from the start that Hidden Base was powerful...the ability to pull all your systems, then cancel force drains...that&#39;s the stuff of dreams to a young player.  Especially since the Operatives looked so non-movie to this huge movie fan (I still have never played WYS).  But I&#39;m going to move ahead, to after Reflections II came out, since that&#39;s when I first started playing SWCCG in tournaments (what I call &quot;playing seriously&quot;).<br />
<br />
My first serious Hidden Base deck, built about the time I started playing in tournaments in Wenatchee Washington, was centered around causing maximum damage to the opponent using off-the-wall cards like Leebo and Kin Kian.  I called it the Age of Aquaris since I used that system for massive activation in the early game.  I would also pull Roche, then the Big One, and then the Asteroid Cave for a guaranteed battleground site to satisfy Battle Plan and Menace Fades.  I thought the whole Kirdo III sandwhirl thing was cheesey; I wanted to hold a site with my own guys on my own strengths.  Looking back, this was pretty naive...I rejected the obvious strengths of a certain strategy just because I thought it was too powerful.  Meanwhile I was spreading incredibly thin in space, trying to set up Red 10 at Ord Mantell, other ships controlling Coruscant and Kessel, and Kin Kian at any other system, with Leebo on the table and a Kessel Run completed for some outrageous amount of damage.  However, one Zuckuss in Mist Hunter would have taken out my entire fleet.  <br />
<br />
At this point in my development, I was thinking only of setting up my own strategy, draining for a huge amount, taking no thought of what my opponent would do to try to stop me.  And unfortunately, I played this deck so often that it became internalized to the point that whenever a tournament was coming, I would instinctively revert back to this Hidden Base deck without trying to build a new deck.  As a result, I played incarnations of it at the 2002 Endor Regional and RebelCon later that summer, with not good results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deck Number 2: Court of the Vile Gangster<br />
I first discovered SWCCG just after Cloud City came out, so the Carbon Freezing mechanic was one of the first expansion rules I learned, and I loved it.  When Jabba&#39;s Palace hit the streets, All Wrapped Up was my most-wanted card out of that set, and the only reason I ever really bought it (well, that and the hot pic of Leia on the packs).  So you could say that bounty hunting and capturing has *always* been one of my favorite strategies, from the very beginning.  And when Court of the Vile Gangster came to my attention, I was in love.  I even played it recently last year, with devastating results (this is part of why my rating has been under 1700 recently).<br />
<br />
I played Court non-scum at the second tournament I ever attended, with decent results (I think I took 5th of 8), and loved every minute of it (especially trying to feed Qui-Gon to the Sarlacc).  My deck revolved around setting up a couple good drains on Tatooine, dropping the Sarlacc on the Pit of Carkoon to inhibit my opponent from moving around on Tatooine, and then doing my dest to capture people with dengar&#39;s MRG, jodo kast&#39;s (er, feltipern trevagg&#39;s) stun rifle, and all wrapped up, and then drop them into the sarlacc&#39;s gaping jaws.  I think this is one of the earliest decks I posted on DeckTech, calling it &quot;Flipping Court (I&#39;m Not Crazy)&quot;.  I considered the deck great fun, and it was actually one of my best creations up to this point.  It demonstrated significant improvals over my early Hidden Base designs, because it actually took my opponent into account; I was trying to lure my opponent to come after me so I could capture characters to feed to my sarlacc.  To do that, I took great pains to set up good drains and Tatooine Occupation, trying to give them a reason to follow me, and often it worked.  However, I still wasn&#39;t considering all the angles; a Hidden Base much like my own would have ripped me a new one by outdraining me in space.  I was also including strange and crazy concepts, like Tatooine&#39;s Hunt the Queen side strategy, without trying to find one unified strategic concept...I was branching out too far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deck Number 3: Prepare for a Surface Assault<br />
When Doug Taylor and the Players Committee started dropping hints about virtualizing objectives, Imperial Occupation/Imperial Control was one of the first names on the list.  Doug said &quot;look at the pictures on that card, and tell me what kind of virtual card you think we&#39;ll make it into.&quot;  Unfortunately, he was saying this a good year before it was actually virtualized...but I started building Walker Garrison decks immediately, eager to test out the power of the Battle of Hoth.  Since I never had the chance to collect much Hoth, most of my cards for the deck came from the 2player game that I bought off eBay for around $15.<br />
<br />
The deck was direct damage, pure and simple.  I used You May Start Your Landing, Rebel Base Occupation, and We&#39;re In Attack Position Now to set up a ping of 3 at each of 2-3 sites, depending on how the deck was functioning.  I used the incredibly cheap Imperial Walkers because they had permanent pilots, then dropped on Merrejk and Igar as commanders, while putting the brand-new Virtual-Class Star Destroyers at the system, sometimes for as little as 1 Force each (8, -3 from text, -2 from Motti, -2 from Prepare for Surface Assault).  I also used one of my more ingenious engines up to that point: 4 Admiral&#39;s Orders.  Many people would scoff, but I still maintain that for the pre-objective Walker deck, 2xBattle Deployment and 2xWe&#39;re In Attack Position Now are just incredibly awesome.  With Battle Deployment, you get your walkers out from Reserve Deck, so that fewer walkers are needed in the deck.  Then drop We&#39;re In Attack Position Now, sending Battle Deployment to the used pile (where I could track it for Trample if I was concentrating), and use the new AO for immunity on my Star Destroyers and direct damage the next turn.  There were games where I would drop 3 Admiral&#39;s Orders in the same turn, or use Thrawn to keep Attack Position in my hand while I used Battle Deployment to pull a walker and then switch again...it was beautiful.<br />

This deck, I felt, didn&#39;t need to focus so much on what my opponent was doing, because it could cause such enormous damage all by itself, damage that couldn&#39;t be solved by canceling force drain bonuses.  The only problem I was running into was Honor of the Jedi, which was solved by adding 2xPresence of the Force and a No Escape just for good measure.  But by this point I realized that simply building my own strategy wasn&#39;t good enough; I was including EPP Vaders and Mauls to disrupt my opponent by knocking out a few key characters.  The deck was so good that I brought it to the 2002 Endor Regional, where it showed up my Hidden Base by finishing 2-1.  At Endor I realized what the weakness of the deck was.  Nguyen owned me in the first game of the tournament by revolutioning my 5th marker and then dropping a bunch of characters on my sites.  I began to see that Walkers don&#39;t have the power to take back Hoth sites, even though they may have the power to hold them.  Even though I went on to play this deck at RebelCon and the Seattle DPC, I was very careful to make sure I got to my sites before my opponent did, or else use my EPP Vaders and Mauls to clean my opponent off Hoth before my walkers came down for the damage.<br />

Deck Number 4: Hunt Down and Destroy the Scrubs<br />
After seeing the power that a good choke/beatdown deck like Nguyen&#39;s had, I resolved to make my own over the summer while I was in Port Angeles, far away from the Wenatchee tournament scene.  But I decided to use Hunt Down, which I had read so much about on DeckTech without ever playing (and I&#39;d only played against it once).  I used my giant oversized objective, since I never pulled a normal sized one from SE, and got to work on trading online for Visage of the Emperors and a few more EPP Vaders.  I tried several incarnations of the deck.  Probably the first used Conduct Your Search to pull the Back Door as my battleground site, then pulling Blast Door Controls to make sure I could punish my opponents with Maul and bounty hunter beatdowns, and using Blaster Rack to pull weapons, specifically for Choke Vader and Arica.  Although that deck was fun, I noticed that the extra twix sites I was using made my activation weak to Watch Your Step, a perennial favorite in the Port Angeles meta.  So I switched to the more conventional and non-Blaster Rack docking bay deck that most of the top players were advertising on their DeckTech memberpages, still building my own versions of the deck and not copying decklists, but copying many of their card choices.  Hayes Hunter&#39;s Hunt Down SOLID was extremely influential, as was Brian Hunter&#39;s Hunt Down done RIGHT.<br />
<br />
However, even though I was ripping up the less experienced Port Angeles players (many of whom had nowhere near the card collection I had built), I was not confident in my ability to play this deck, so when RebelCon rolled around in July, it was back to my tried and true Walker Garrison deck for those events.  In both of the major RebelCon tournaments, I had a chance to play against Nick Jones&#39; Hunt Down deck, and see the beast in action.  Both times he owned me (since I was playing that awful Hidden Base), but I learned a lot from watching him play.  His ability to choke me was really amazing, as was his ability to hold a site with only Vader, nothing but interrupts to back him up when I tried to come down on him.  Even when I revamped my Hidden Base to turn it into more of a Hidden Mains deck, I couldn&#39;t touch his Vader enough to cause overflow.  And I began to see the true way to play Star Wars CCG...instead of using characters and other cards on the table to protect my sites, I needed to use interrupts and other tricks to create what I&#39;ve come to call the &quot;reverse beatdown&quot;--when you&#39;re opponent tries to beatdown your characters but instead finds himself losing overflow because of character removal or some other nasty trick.  I started rebuilding my Hunt Down again, but still couldn&#39;t muster the confidence to play it at the Seattle DPC, where again I was back to Walker Garrison.<br />
<br />
Although I haven&#39;t really returned to Hunt Down since last summer, I&#39;ve incorporated many of the things I learned while playing it into the latest versions of my DS Combat deck, called &quot;Nightspawn&quot; on my memberpage.  And to see a Hunt Down I never played nor even built (except on paper), check out my hilariously highly ranked &quot;Third Watch&quot;, the deck whose only redeeming factor is its strategy section.<br />
<br />

Deck Number 5: Wokling Senate (Hunter Style)<br />
At RebelCon last summer I was also introduced to the power of Senate, thanks to Keith Watabayashi and Steven Harpster.  I had toyed with Senate before, but usually only in Episode 1 only format (where I created the &quot;Driven: Senate Podracing Space&quot; deck which I thought was pretty tech, if not pretty good).  After RebelCon, I set about trying to build versions of them in open.  I never had much success with Dark Senate, but after hitting upon Brian Hunter&#39;s Ghhhks Away deck, I knew I had found a masterpiece.  Hopefully the tribute to Mr. Hunter here will make up for my mental lapse when I posted the deck last month without giving him credit for introducing me to it in the first place.  <br />
<br />
This deck is perfect for the fifth and final deck in my evolution as a player, because it truly inaugurated me into the level of skill I currently play at.  Senate is no easy deck to play: in the hands of a beginner, it does fairly well; but in the hands of an experienced player, it can do anything and everything that is required.  I messed around with Light Senate for about two weeks before bringing it to the Seattle DPC, where I came stupidly close to winning two games that I still think I could have won if i&#39;d just tried harder (and hadn&#39;t had the sun full on in my eyes for one of them).  But when Virtual Set 3 came out, and people were talking about the end of Senate, Virtual Wokling looked to me like the best helper Senate could have asked for.  Now the deck starts with 4 icons + wokling on the table and gives up only 1.  That means it generates 6 Force guaranteed the first turn, enough to deploy Senator Palpatine and search for the Senate Hovercam, netting you another 3, plus 1 from a docking bay you deployed.  As you can see, the activation sets up amazingly fast in the first two turns, providing an awesome platfrom for beatdowns, the natural strength of the deck.<br />
<br />
The art of playing Light Senate was perhaps the best education in SWCCG that I could have asked for.  My first month of playing it, all I could think of was how many times I forgot to use the second text of a political effect, or forgot to save a force for Palpatine&#39;s game text during my opponent&#39;s turn, or when i should have put my senators back into my deck and tracked them for battle destiny.  But after that first month I started hitting on all cylinders and I knew exactly what my deck could do and when.  I could beatdown my opponent anywhere on the table, using SAC to stop their evasion and my political effects, plus judicious repeat applications of Queen Amidalas to make sure I swung everything in my favor.  Or with Palpatine and my political effects, plus Blaster Deflections, I could repel any attack on my EPP&#39;s as they controlled Coruscant docking bays against space decks, while the Falcon combo worked its magic time and again.  This deck, more than any other, taught me to play at a higher level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are the decks that I built and played to bring myself up to the current level I&#39;m at, and I hope it&#39;s been educational or at least interesting for you.  I won&#39;t go into the decks I&#39;m currently working on or playing, except that you should expect them to be at least on the level of the Senate and Hunt Down I finished this article with.  If this article goes over well, I might think about writing a few meta-judging articles in the future, covering what I think needs to be prepared for, at least in my own area.  Until then...May the Force be with you.<br />
