Everywhere you look, you see his name.  Anytime there is a <br />
discussion about the greatest Star Wars card players of all time you&#39;re sure to see his name, and as a veteran player who has been around since the days of Premiere, he has had plenty of time to create a name for himself in the Star Wars CCG community.  A winner of countless major tournaments and holder of the second-highest rating in Star Wars, Jonathan&#39;s most recent accomplishment was finishing in the top eight at Deciphercon 2002.  So here&#39;s a chance to see the name Chu again, and also to read his opinions about the game.  If you ever wanted to know what it takes to become a legend in SWCCG, look no further.<br />
<br />
JT: I was reading a thread on the decktech message boards yesterday about who the greatest deckbuilder of all time was.  Your name seemed to come up more than any other.  How do you respond to that?<br />
JC: I&#39;m definitely not the greatest deckbuilder of all time. Up until a few years ago I found decks online - from monnok.com, Mufty&#39;s website, Decktech, all over - and made changes to them to make them better (in my opinion). I may have made meta calls better, on average, than some players, but I did not make the original deck concepts.  Recently I&#39;ve made some good ones - the speed Watto I used at Worlds was good. But if I had to name the best deckbuilder, it would be Steven <br />
Lewis.<br />
<br />
JT: What&#39;s the most important thing to keep in mind when building a deck?<br />
JC: The meta. Right now it&#39;s so difficult because it may be hard to find a game, at least much harder than it used to be. <br />
I don&#39;t bother building decks that are going to lose in the meta. Maybe that&#39;s a bad habit, or maybe not, but if I feel <br />
like people are going to pack a lot of Watch Your Step hate, why bother making a good Watch Your Step?  Unless it&#39;s teched out against people teching out against it . . . but then it&#39;ll lose to a normal deck. Anyways, if you can make the right meta call, you will certainly have an edge against any level player.<br />
<br />
JT: At Deciphercon 2002, you played some unusual stuff in your decks; Watto with Combat Response, and light side combat with podracing.  What made you decide to pick these two to play?<br />
JC: I playtested with my buddy Chris Praskac the three days before the tournament. We came in with our standard decks but with the intention of trying to find something completely broken. The day before I was watching DPC Don Kitzman, who was playing Brian Twigg; Don was playing Watto. But his Watto was the slow version - I think it started No Escape. I got to thinking: is there any way to satisfy Honor (get the third battleground) and Battle Plan at the same time? And there happened to be a starting effect slot to help out . . . and what we came up with was the Combat Response Watto. And it does awesome against so many decktypes . . . Watch Your Step, Quiet Mining Colony, to name a few. The only matchup that gave it a really tough time we could think of was Throne Room mains, and we didn&#39;t plan to see much of that.  For light, the combat we had was the combat we had back in May. We made a few (bad) changes but kept it roughly the same, despite the racing shields. This turned out to be a bad call because Watto was so prevalent, but I don&#39;t think anyone thought there would be so much Watto.<br />
<br />
JT: You went on hiatus from the game for what seemed like over a year, and now you&#39;re back without having lost anything from your break. Why were you less involved with the game then, and why are you back now?<br />
JC: Yeah, I was disappointed Decipher lost the license and didn&#39;t like how they seemed to churn out the sets that year before announcing it was officially lost. I thought some quality was lost along the way. I was also miffed about <br />
how Warren Holland was plugging his new game Lord of the Rings in the same announcement, and about how it was a much better game (popular opinion seems to be it&#39;s much worse of a game). That&#39;s bad politics. I stopped playing, and more importantly, thinking about it altogether.  But then when the con season opened up again I played again, and originally I was really rusty. On my way back from school in Tennessee I stopped by Chris Praskac&#39;s for a couple of days and played a lot. He had just won a mini-Open and was doing well and completely trashed me that whole day. But it got the gears turning again and it didn&#39;t take a lot to get back into it -- primarily because there were really no new cards I wasn&#39;t familiar with. And the meta was still more or less the same.  I&#39;m back because interest seems to be picking up as people realize how random <br />
LOTR is, and because the Player&#39;s Committee is so dedicated and doing such a good job with the virtual cards. Like probably most people, I originally thought the virtual cards were another bad idea by Decipher, but frankly they&#39;re great. The Player&#39;s Committee is what Decipher should have been for all these years.  They are professional and put out good stuff that has been thoroughly tested.  The biggest reason I&#39;m back is because the game is so good. There&#39;s nothing out there like it. Nothing comes close.<br />
<br />
JT: You are currently ranked second in the world, trailing Brian Hunter by only 64 points.  Have you ever felt any pressure to move up into the number one spot?<br />
JC: Nah. Hunter plays a lot more than I. He&#39;s a great player. As much as I would love to be #1, I don&#39;t play nearly enough anot dedicated in the same way he is. If it happens, it happens. I don&#39;t think it matters all that much.  <br />
<br />
JT: There has been a long history of rivalry between the top two players in the world, whoever it may have been.  Do you have any of that type of relationship with Brian?<br />
JC: Sure, but it&#39;s all within the game. We&#39;re 1-1 in tournament play -- he beat me en route to winning the first DPC Vegas, and I beat him this year to prevent him from placing in the top 8 at Worlds. I respect his opinion and I feel like it&#39;s mutual. We&#39;re starting up a editorial-type thing on Decktech soon -- it should be interesting what we have to say about each other&#39;s thoughts about the game.<br />
<br />
JT: In your Star Wars career, you have had the chance to play (and win) against some of the biggest names in the game.  Who&#39;s the best player you&#39;ve ever had a game with?<br />
JC: I can name a few great players. Steven Lewis at Origins and St. Louis Grand Slam. Steven Turner at Tennessee states. The Terwilligers at about every local for years. TJ Holman at RamapoCon. The list goes on and on. While the games <br />
are still very vivid to me, none really rises above the others. The players at the time were all spectacular, and the resulting games were also.<br />
<br />
JT: What do you think of the new cards being produced by the Player&#39;s Committee?<br />
JC: They&#39;re fantastic. I hope they keep making them for years to come. I consider the game very lucky to have them, and for them to treat it so seriously; it would be easy for them to churn out less-than-quality material, because there&#39;s really no incentive for them to give it their all besides keeping the game going. For them to be creating, in my opinion, the highest quality cards the game has seen for years even when Decipher was making it is a testament to their faith and dedication to the game and everyone playing it. Simply put, the game still exists because of the work they do. All players would have turned away long ago if not for them. The Player&#39;s Committee is a very big reason why I&#39;m playing the game again.<br />
<br />
JT: Explain the thought behind your own virtual card, Security Precautions.<br />
JC: I wanted a card to help Ralltiir Operations, but not be limited to that decktype. That was the primary consideration behind the card.  Ralltiir Operations has suffered as a decktype because of the slowness of its activation. It takes forever to get going. It always has. This was important because it was probably the best example of a deck that was near impossible to stop once it got going. When it got beat it was usually because it went too slowly and the Light Side did too much damage for it to overcome.  I didn&#39;t want to mess with this balance by creating an effect that started on table and immediately upped the activation (like They&#39;re On Dantooine (v) or even like Wokling (v)). Security Precautions is great because you can grab it with You Cannot Hide Forever, or even the Ralltiir text if you can somehow flip quick and hold it for a turn. It is essentially a 3/0 with a 5 destiny that also stops another Ralltiir killer, Revolution. At the same time, the Light Side immediately has a target when it comes out; this helps balance it out.  At the same time, it&#39;s possible to play this card in any deck. For example, I think it helps dark combat out a lot, because Goo Nee Tay historically destroys that deck. It may help out Scum too for the same reason. But it&#39;s balanced - the deploy penalty to Ralltiir is nullfied, as is the deploy bonus for your aliens in a Scum deck, the penalty to No Bargain is gone, etc. I think it&#39;s a very balanced card. For this reason it may not see as much play as it would if, for example, it started on table and made all <> sites force generation +1. Oh well.<br />
<br />
JT: How much of your game relies on tracking, and how important do you think it is?<br />
JC: I love to track. There are people who track more than I, but when I need to I feel like I can track sufficiently well to give me the edge in crucial battles. I hate virtual Prophetess.  It&#39;s incredibly important to track.  Games are won and lost on tracking. I had an excellent game with Alex Tennet at Deciphercon 2001 (before disqualification) - it was classic Ralltiir Ops vs Hidden Mains. He had Jedi Luke with saber and Ben Kenobi with saber and I absolutely had to get rid of <br />
them. I tracked a Masterful Move for 3 turns before activating to it, and that decided the game.<br />
<br />
JT: What&#39;s the secret to being a Star Wars champion?<br />
JC: I don&#39;t know - I&#39;ve never been one. To be a great player it takes a lot of thought more than anything else. Challenge yourself to figure out innovative ways to beat the meta. There are thousands of cards in this game. I am convinced there were dozens more strategies in the existing cards to deal with commmon problems than people have found. The people who find them are successful.<br />
