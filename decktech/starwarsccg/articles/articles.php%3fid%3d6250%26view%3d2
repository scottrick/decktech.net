There are few ways better for disrupting a cheesy strategy that your opponent is trying to implement than to just kill off the characters that are implementing it with.  Opponent playing Never Tell Me The Odds?  Go kill their characters.  Opponent draining for 3 at a site?  Go kill the characters.  Nothing could be simpler.<br />
<br />
Luckily the Player&#39;s Committee has released some really great cards to promote battling and to encourage players to build decks based around battling.  Below are our top 5 picks for the greatest battling helpers ever released by the PC for the Dark Side.  As usual, we&#39;ll give our takes after each other&#39;s top 5.<br />
<br />
<b>Armaedes&#39; top 5 DS Battle Aids</b><br />
<br />
<b>1.  Ability, Ability, Ability (V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>Deploy on table.  You may not play Imperial Barrier.  Every time you initiate a battle, you may activate 1 Force and/or take the topmost character (that does not have a permanent weaopn or maintenance cost) from your Lost Pile into hand.  Senators are deploy +2.  May lose 1 Force to cause a combat card to be lost.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
In my opinion, this is the greatest battling promoter in the history of the game.  This card will work in just about any battling deck.  While Scum And Villainy requires aliens on the table and Imperial Domination (V) requires that you play with only Imperials, Ability, Ability, Ability (V) can work in any deck that has non-permanent weapon, non-maintenance characters.  In fact, it will work even if you are playing some EPPs or maintenance characters!<br />
<br />
The retrieval aspect of this card is merely the most obvious reason why this is a solid battling promoter.  The second line of the gametext prohibits the playing of Imperial Barrier, the oldest and most widely used dark side battle hinderer.  This promotes battling if for no other reason than that it prevents the dark side player from using the easiest form of battle evasion.  In other words, even though this is a dark side card it can also help light side battling decks!<br />
<br />
This card further promotes battling by hindering two of the most potentially non-interactive decktypes around, senate and lightsaber combat.  This card slows down light senate, which has long revolved around a combination of big drains and frustrating hit-and-run tactics with EPPs.  It also hurts lightsaber combat, which is the objective that is perhaps most designed to avoid battling.<br />
<br />
All in all, this card manages to accomplish the greatest stride towards creating a battle-oriented environment, making it number one on my list.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Amen, man.  I rank this as my #1 DS aid as well.  As I mentioned in the LS article, I think that the anti-Senate/LSC was a bit much to fit into this card and hurt those decks a bit too much.  A very strong card, a bit stronger than Civil Disorder, I think.  See my review below for why!<br />
<br />
<b>2.  J&#39;Quille (V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Hoth Shield Rules&quot; are ignored when he deploys and at his location.  Other Whiphids are deploy -2 and forfeit +2.  Once per game when deployed to a site, opponent loses 1 Force for each Light Side character there.  Draws one battle destiny if unable to otherwise.</i><br />
<br />
J&#39;Quille (V) is a great battle-aiding card because you can get characters to any non-Dagobah location in the game with him.  Unless your opponent is playing Dagobah locations (where they can&#39;t do any damage anyway), they can&#39;t put a character anywhere and be safe.  If all J&#39;Quille (V) did was get you to any location you wanted to go to, it would still be an incredible card.  But he also gives you some more pro-battling gametext with the Force loss clause of his gametext.  This helps battling decks because it makes your opponent more wary of stacking a whole lot of characters at one location and preventing you from battling without getting wiped out.  Essentially, J&#39;Quille (V) makes your opponent spread their Force more thinly to avoid massive Force loss, and spreading thin plays right into the hands of a solid battling deck.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
I&#39;m torn on him.  Sure, it&#39;s nice to have him as a staging area into fortified area, but I think he (and Tanus for the LS) did some bad things as well.  A pullable beatdown spy for Scum isn&#39;t so hot.  I also wish that the Force loss was contingent on initiating a battle at his location instead of just deployment.  Some hit and run tactics can evolve from that.  Finally, while at the time Speeders raised its ugly head, he was a big fat blunt object that really kicked that deck to the curb.  He could probably have done enough damage on his own or if gave DS a way to drop the Hoth Shield kinda like what a saboteur might do.  I see him used more for the damage text than anything else, so he didn&#39;t make my list.<br />
<br />
<b>3.  Stop Motion (V)</b><br />
<i>Cancel one attempt by opponent to &#39;react&#39; away from a battle.  OR Cancel Dodge.  OR / Ice Storm, He Hasn&#39;t Come Back Yet, or Cold Feet.  OR Cancel opponent&#39;s attempt to randomly remove one or more cards from your hand (except with Grimtaash).</i><br />
<br />
It should be obvious why Stop Motion (V) is a good card for a battling deck - it stops your opponent from moving away from battles.  In addition to cancelling Dodge, it can also cancel the &#39;react&#39; of the annoying Arcona.  The card is also a used high destiny interrupt that has some nice recycling gametext so that if you don&#39;t need it at the time or if you have multiples in your hand, it can be easily put back into your reserve deck.  Finally, the last line of text also helps with your battling as it prevents your opponent from removing key cards from your hand right before you administer the beatings, ensuring that once you get your battling combo in your hand it will stay there, provided you stay below 13 cards in hand.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Good call.  Much like IMI, this card helps make sure that your battles go through.  This was very big when LSC had teeth and evasion like Dodge was in vogue.  It&#39;s a neat idea, but in modern SWCCG I can&#39;t think of prominent reacting away from battles for the LS other than Hyper Escape, which Firepower deals with.  <br />
<br />
<b>4.  Jabba The Hutt (V)</b><br />
<i>To move requires +2 Force.  Once per game, you may / Scum And Villainy.  During battle, you may lose 2 Force to cause all other aliens (without a maintenance cost) here to battle at double their power.  May not be targeted by weapons while your other unique alien leader here.  Immune to attrition < 4.</i><br />
<br />
If the power of Scum could be placed at the feet of one character, it would be this one, which is ironic since Jabba doesn&#39;t even really have feet.  Jabba The Hutt (V) is very deck-specific, which is why he&#39;s not higher on my list, but in an alien deck he can end games on the 2nd or 3rd turn.  I have personally had Jabba The Hutt (V) cause more than 50 overflow in games, and I know other players who have got that number even higher.  With the number of ways dark side has to pull aliens from the deck, and with Jabba (V) doubling the power of almost all of them, you can create devastating beatdowns in record time.  The best part is that the Audience Chamber deploys him from Reserve Deck and then Elis Helrot takes him wherever the fighting is.  Truly a brutal battling card.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Well, I might take exception on the power of Scum being focused on him, but you are right that he is a potent card.  I mean, winning a battle by 20 and winning it by 40 both hurt your opponent, but both are likely game winners.  I didn&#39;t rank him on my list since I don&#39;t really like what he brings to the world of SWCCG.  I think there were plenty of other cool Jabbas that Scum decks could run, plus I have trouble envisioning Jabba being a flying beatdown machine.  <br />

<b>5.  Imperial Domination (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  If you have any non-Imperial characters (or starships) on table, place in Lost Pile.  Neither player may draw more than two battle destiny in a battle.  Whenever you initiate (or win) a battle, you may retrieve any one Imperial, and once per turn, whenever you draw an Imperial for destiny, you may take that card into hand to cause a redraw.  Suspended while opponent occupies more locations than you.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
Like Ability, Ability, Ability (V), but harder to use due to the fact that you can only play with Imperials if you use this card.  In addition to offering some solid character retrieval, this card also does a decent job of causing your opponent to spread out quickly so that they can suspend the gametext of this card.  The battle destiny limiting may seem like a bad idea for a battling deck, but in reality there aren&#39;t a lot of ways for all-Imperial decks to get multiple battle destiny anyway, and this way you can use characters like Lord Vader and have the immunity to attrition be worth more than if you had to worry about your opponent drawing 5 battle destiny and basically making your immunity worthless.  Another reason this is a solid battling card is because if you draw battle or weapon destiny and accidentally flip a character, you can take it into hand and try again, allowing you to play with more characters than you would normally be able to get away with while still maintaining the integrity of the deck&#39;s destiny.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Wow, great minds think alike.  This is my #5 as well.  I really like the versatility that this card brings to an Imperial deck and think that as stronger Imperials are created this card will see more and more play.<br />
<br />
<b>Shewski&#39;s top 5 DS Battle Aids</b><br />
<br />
<b>1.  Ability, Ability, Ability (V) (and Civil Disorder V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
A must play in many decks, AAA revolutionized the SWCCG world when it was released and still continues to be a popular play.  Part of its strength was that it could play as well with its &quot;taboo&quot; characters (EPPs and maintenance guys) as without them.  As long as you had a few key guys to keep looping onto the table, you could take full advantage of its text.  While I don&#39;t like the anti-Senate and Combat text, it made it easier to rationalize including this in your decks.  I believe that AAA is stronger than CD since its senator text will hit more often for the DS (targeting Leia and Mon Mothma) that the LS.  In fact, when characters are designed to work around this Effect, you know it&#39;s a prominent one.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
The only advantage I can see Civil Disorder (V) having over this card is that Civil Disorder (V) makes a mean combination with Quick Draw (V).  This is #1 on my list as well and is maybe one of the best cards ever made by the Player&#39;s Committee.  Although I find the anti-senator text to be fine, I do agree with you that the anti-combat text might have been a bit of an overkill move as it almost completely invalidates the decktype.  However, when you&#39;re looking at battling aids it&#39;s hard to beat a card that lets you get back your characters so that you can keep on battling.<br />
<br />
<b>2.  A Day Long Remembered (V) (and Down With The Emperor! V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>Deploy on table. All immunity to attrition is reduced by 3. You may not fire permanent weapons. Whenever a Jedi is lost, or opponent loses a battle, opponent loses 1 Force. During your draw phase, lose 1 Force or place this card in your Used Pile.  (Immune to Alter.)</i><br />
<br />
Much like my #1 pick, I like the DS card a little more than the LS version.  There are more Jedi that see play than Dark Jedi, and many have little immunity or none at all, which can mean guaranteed Force loss.  This card is not meant to stay on the table, but cycle through your deck to show up as a big destiny draw or to deploy again for more Force loss.  This works well w/ #1 as well, since you can&#39;t fire with your EPPs.  The attrition reduction is a two-edged sword; so make sure you have some fodder.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times it has turned a weak destiny draw into a site clearer.  A great card that is fun to use along with other battle winning cards like Insignificant Rebellion.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I agree completely with your assessment of the strengths of this card.  The light side version made my list, but for dark side I just think there&#39;s far better battling helpers available.  The strength of most of the powerful light side decks is EPP hit-and-run.  I really only see the dark side version of this card being useful if you keep it on the table for a turn, so your opponent loses a Force from their EPP strike, or if you are going against an immunity-mains deck like Profit, which is unpopular at best, or the Careful Planning (V) Endor deck, which this card would work quite well against.<br />
<br />
<b>3.  Boba Fett (V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>P:3, 4: Slave I.  If a battle was just initiated at same site, may target one opposing character present.  Draw destiny.  If destiny +2 > ability, target captured.  May &#39;fly&#39; (landspeed = 3).  Immune to attrition < 3 (< 5 if with Han or Jabba).</i><br />
<br />
When battling in SWCCG, it often is a huge advantage to start the fight, since you get the first action in the weapons segment.  This can often mean the difference between victory and loss.  Boba Fett changes all of that.  He is the first character to key off of the &quot;just&quot; action of a battle being initiated.  Some Interrupts in the past have done that, but never characters.  This Boba is cool since he is an EPP w/o having a permanent weapon icon.  Like Empy (V), this makes him eligible for a lot of cards we have mentioned before.  The ability to easily remove a character from battle before your opponent has the ability to do anything is very potent.  He essentially trumps all types of other weapons and text.  Capturing is quite strong since it is not an &quot;immediately lost&quot; action that can be countered by cards like K&#39;lor Slug and the like.  From now on, the choice of Bobas will be between this version and BFBH.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I despise this Boba Fett persona.  Not because he&#39;s bad, but because he&#39;s so friggin&#39; good.  I have played games against this guy where I had a big stack of mains on Fett with Binders.  One of my favorite combinations is to add his Fett&#39;s Blaster Rifle (V) to him and then play Hidden Weapons and Defensive Fire (V).  With the right destiny draws, you can very easily clear out 4 characters per battle (destiny +2 with his text, destiny +4 with Defensive Fire (V), destiny +2 with his rifle, then Hidden Weapons).  Especially if you&#39;ve got You Cannot Hide Forever out and Lando Calrissian (V) hiding somewhere, this Fett can definitely hold a site by himself.  Mandalorian Mishap (V) makes him look stupid, but otherwise a very solid card.<br />
<br />
<b>4.  Firepower (V) (and Weapons Display)</b><br />
<br />
<i>Plays on table. During your turn, opponent loses 2 Force each time they move away from a location you occupy. At end of opponent&#39;s turn, if you control two battlegrounds (a site and a system), and your opponent deployed a card with ability this turn and did not battle, randomly select a card from your Lost Pile and then place it here or take it into hand. During your move phase, you may relocate X characters, ships, and vehicles for free to locations the opponent occupies, where X = the number of cards stacked here.</i><br />
<br />
Much ballyhooed when first released, these &quot;offensive&quot; Defensive Shields became a popular staple among most Shield lists.  It&#39;s very easy to play since its initiation conditions are similar to another standby, Battle Order/Plan.  These shields work to discourage cowardly play, like running away from battles on your turn (Watch out for Honor reducing this!) or not fighting you when they deploy to the table.  Many decks have been built so that they can take full advantage of this gametext.  For the DS, the relocation game text is great for their low hyperspeed space or to send their heavy hitters around the board without using docking bays. Drawing key cards to hand is always a big bonus, and even some other cards key off the stacking mechanism with this card.  This card helps battles happen and happen often!!<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Excellent choice, this was actually #6 on my list.  It barely missed the cut because the second portion of the text requires that you control a site and a system to make it work, and hardcore battling decks rarely do this.  The part of the card that makes the opponent lose Force can be good, but frankly if your opponent has a choice between taking a beating and losing a measley two cards (which, as you point out, is reduced by Honor Of The Jedi), they&#39;re going to lose the 2 no questions asked.  In other words, those this is a card that should be played in every battling deck, it doesn&#39;t actually help your big battles happen because the opponent is still able to use their &quot;escape&quot; cards, they just have to lose a couple of Force to do so - which oftentimes is a fair trade.<br />
<br />
<b>5.  Imperial Domination (V)</b><br />
<br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
Armaedes made a bunch of good points about this card above, but there were a few things I also wanted to add.  First, two copies of this can be played for maximum use, which means twice as many benefits heading your way.   It may be overkill in many instances, but if it is worth it, you&#39;ll never go without characters ever again.  Secondly, there are some creative ways for you to use it as a cycling machine.  DDM had an interesting Hunt Down that used a lone Womp Rat to constantly draw against Vader so that he could draw needed Imperials into hand.  I also don&#39;t think that limited destiny draws as a bad thing with you constantly weeding out low destiny characters your 2 destinies should be stronger than your opponent&#39;s.  This is also yet another great battle winning effect that works with many of the other cards on this list.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
No argument here, and the two-copies thing is an important point I forgot to mention.  I have seen this card used effectively in Hunt Down, BHBM, ISB, Ralltiir, and even some Combat Readiness (V) decks.  Like Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it&#39;s good because it rewards you for battling by giving you more characters to battle with.  Unlike Ability, Ability, Ability (V), it&#39;s far more deck-specific, but getting back characters is always a good thing.<br />
<br />
There you have it!.  Keep an eye out for the LS version so you can see what the good guys have to offer in terms of making your battles more and more worthwhile.   <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php?id=6250&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/starwarsccg/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/starwarsccg/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></td></tr></table>
