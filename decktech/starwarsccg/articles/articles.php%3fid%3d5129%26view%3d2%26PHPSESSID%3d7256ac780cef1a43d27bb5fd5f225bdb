My name is Tim Simon I started playing SWCCG in 1995 when it all began.  But alas, when Pokemon came out, I was drawn in and I was out of Star Wars from about Special Edition to Death Star II.  But now I am back and will never again leave the greatest card game ever made.<br />
<br />
That said.<br />
<br />
I hear countless times That deck is dead, or That objective is stupid, itll never work<br />
Well, I have done some investigation and will now report my findings.  This could be useful to new players, but more experienced players will probably get more out of it.  I tried not to use too many crazy acronyms, if you want any explanations for any strategies listed below, feel free to email me.  This is my first article, so rate accordingly.  Be forewarned, this article may be longer than most posted on Decktech.<br />
<br />
Ive decided to divide up the article into two parts.  Here is the first:<br />
<br />
Decktypes that ARE dead and that should STAY dead<br />
<br />
Dead Deck #1  Operatives<br />
<br />
The first one that came to my mine was operatives.  Lets face it, whenever you open a pack of special edition (or REF I for that matter) you are bombarded by operatives.  What was Decipher thinking?  Did you know there are actually twenty different operatives for light and dark?  Did they think people would really think Alderaan operatives would be superior to Kessel operatives or something?  Seriously though, they may have been OK, even annoying for a while, but after the operative rules came out, it was just not worth it.  Operatives suddenly kill each other when they meet and they cant drain unless someone else is with them.  On top of that, they made a defensive shield to stop them.  Fortunately I was not around for the prime days of the operatives (lol) but I can imagine that they were not interactive and very annoying.  Nifty tricks like Abyssin Ornament etc would get old very fast.  I hope the PC does not even consider trying to bring this decktype back.  Ugh, I cant type anymore about this one, sorry.<br />
<br />
Dead Deck #2  Hyperdrive Generator<br />
<br />
The next one on my list is THGG.  Now, I admit the objective may look cool when it is first viewed, but anyone who has tried to play it will tell you its problems.  First off, the deployment restrictions really hurt here.  The absence of Ben Kenobi or Luke, red squadron, etc really limits what you can do on Tatooine.  In addition, the deck just does not have enough punch.  Wow, I can activate two force on my opponents turn with the Queens ship out!  Until it gets blown out of the sky by Executor, Zuckuss, Dengar, Baron, or someone else.  The direct damage isnt even helpful since senators are not incredibly difficult to kill when exposed.  Without a doubt, the coolest part is the retrieval of one force into hand whenever you draw a battle destiny, but lets face it, youre going to be so outdrained or damaged on other planets that it will at best delay the inevitable.  In addition, it will probably take you at least 5 turns or so to flip assuming that your opponent doesnt care too much about your one drain at the junkyard.  There arent enough good drain sites on Tatooine to make it worth it, and I can see Deal, Combat, Walkers, etc never coming to Tatooine and still annihilating the LS.  Like WHAP, virtual cards are needed here to make this deck worth the effort it takes to sleeve sixty cards.<br />
<br />
Dead Deck #3  Endor Operations<br />
<br />
The next dead decktype I found was Endor Ops.  This deck also seems good at first glance, but really is in bad need of help.  It is odd that Tatooine gave birth to so many helper cards for objectives (including RST) but not for Endor Ops.  OK, first off, you need to control 3 Endor sites with biker scouts and/or ATSTs to set up Establish Secret Base.  One problem that comes up is that you cannot pull that third site except with either Location, Location, Location (v) or some obscene amount of useless interrupts like Neimoidian Advisors.  Another problem is that you cannot pull the scouts or the ATSTs.  The ATSTs could be pulled with Battle Deployment, but to pull that, you would need Piett, who must be pulled by Imperial Commands, etc. <br />
Another glaring problem is that the effects boost space drains.  How do you have a strong enough space force to spread out and drain while at the same time keeping the ground strong?  This deck would have to be very card intensive and with little retrieval (one whole biker scout per turn), would be doomed to low differential wins if, in fact it could win.  The potential for drains is big, dont get me wrong, but the problem is in the lack of an ability to pull the needed cards, combined with the need to spread them thin to be effective.  I can see v cards making this deck good too, but well have to wait to see what the PC does.  Oh, and as for a non-flip deck, why bother?  Establish Secret Base would be pointless to have by itself, and Ominous Rumors would be difficult to pull off at best.  First off, you need to pull systems obviously for it to be effective, so where does Merrejk come from?  Command for Piett?  Pull Merrejk, put him at the Executor Docking Bay maybe?  Even this would take at LEAST 4-5 turns to get rolling and a good LS deck will be hitting you hard for damage in that time.  And everything goes to waste if Merrejk gets rushed at the DBay or if the LS comes down on one site before you put it out.  Combine that with the Ultimatum shield and you get a thoroughly dead not-so-ominous-anymore Ominous Rumors.<br />
<br />
Dead Decks 4 and 5  Ralltiir/Dantooine Ops<br />
<br />
These decks just never really had enough punch to begin with, in my humble opinion.  Dont get me wrong, Ive seen some great Ralltiir Ops designs in the past, but that was over 18 months ago.  V cards have shown us decks that are faster and that have more punch.  Dantooine Ops is ridiculous, even with the helper v card, because it doesnt really hurt your opponent.  Ooooh, drain bonuses where I have a squadron.  That means I have to get systems out, put squadrons there, and keep them alive.  Dont forget the low immunity and the fact that every good dark deck in existence will be hitting me for tons of damage by the time my squadronexhaust the table.  Space decks that revolve around raw power just dont work.  You need stuff like weapons, or battle destiny, or high immunity to stay around.  Otherwise a well-placed Ghhhk or Houjix will do you in.  Even with the Imperial +2 deployment thing, think about it, how many dark decks beatdown with only imperials?  And the all opponents drains are -1 thing is useless because the DS just needs to control TWO dantooine locations to flip you back.  Thats the system and one of your many sites.  Ralltiir Ops has the same problem, although cool tricks with biker scouts and the such made it a bit more formidable.  <br />
The key to winning an SWCCG game is to make your opponent care about you.  By that I mean that they have to actually, genuinely care about what your deck is doing enough to come down and try to stop it.  Then either a) they fall into a trap youve laid for them or b) they make a mistake that you capitalize on.  Either way they are taking time away from their strategy most likely.  The flaw with these two deck types is that your opponent generally will just not care about them.  Dantooine is just bad because its all about squadrons that are just raw power.  Ralltiir is a lot better, (especially since you can pull any card you want into your hand) but still, a good LS opponent will force you to come to them.  It should be the other way around.  And, like I said, its not that hard to flip you back to the 0 side.  <br />
<br />
Now, the second part:  Decks that are CONSIDERED dead but SHOULDNT BE<br />
<br />
Overlooked Deck #1<br />
<br />
The first deck that I thought of was Court.  Thats right COTVG.  Now I admit, at first the deck seems weak.  But lets look at the objective for a second.  OK, once per turn you can pull any independent starship you want.  Your opponent loses one force every turn if they do not come to Tatooine.  When you flip, and eat someone, you retrieve force equal to your opponents forfeit, and your opponent loses that amount.  Convinced yet?  I didnt think so.  Well, the problem obviously comes in when you try to flip.  You need to capture two characters or one character of ability >2.  Obviously youd put in All Wrapped Up.  Then the issue is getting bounty hunters to fight.  Double Back is a possibility, since there will be so many bounty hunters to pull or retrieve.  Elis Helrot could be used to get them wherever they need to go.  Whats that you say?  What if they play Insurrection?  Well, then you use Elis anyway.  As long as your opponent gives you one exterior site you can use Elis.  If they dont then you could put in a <> docking bay or something (which your objective pulls) to get your Fetts, Iggys, etc. where they need to go.  Dont underestimate Hidden Weapons!  That is a MONEY card, its just as easy to capture quiggy as it is a Rebel Trooper.  And dont forget about Krayt Dragon Bones v.  Your rancor can now come out whenever you want it to, and is even stronger.  It is very possible to eat a huge main like Luke Jedi Knight or Qui-Gon.  Now, heres the catch.  The key to any deck is its ability to hurt your opponent.  This means your opponent will probably need to come to Tatooine.  Well, throw in some Gailids and spread out.  Your drains will all be +1 and combined with your obj, that damage will add up.  There is NO dark side deck with better retrieval.  You retrieve from eating, you can retrieve from Scum and Villainy, you can retrieve from bounties, etc.  This will help you last longer, plus cards like None Shall Pass and No Bargain make it safer to spread out in Jabbas Palace.  If youre feeling spunky, you can throw in Tatooine Occupation, although you need to get the system out somehow.  All of this damage will force your opponent to come to you, and if they still dont Elis will take you to them.  One thing thats hilarious to do, is to wait until after you flip.  Then leave some scrub at the audience chamber.  When the huge beatdown comes, Trap Door!  It will always go through and voila!  The rancor will be fed tonight.  Anyway, I think Ive said enough about Court, needless to say I think its the most fun out of any dark deck out there.<br />
<br />
Overlooked Deck #2  Watto<br />
<br />
Watto was HUGE for a while.  Then when Tauntaun Bones (v) came everyone got panicked and envisioned Watto becoming a snack to a hungry Worrt.  Well, I think that fear is groundless.  Watto is awesome because if the incredibly fast damage you can cause plus the ability to have your opponent deploy your vehicles and characters for you.  Its not uncommon to set up first turn.  But alas, Worrt.  Well, if youre worried about Worrt, put out Bubo!  Start with Krayt (v) and put out Bubo before Watto comes out.  Bubo will eat Worrt 99.9% of the time and he cannot eat your own characters.  As soon as the two of those creatures are together, they immediately attack and Bubo wins.  Watto is safe.  Now you have to worry about keeping Watto alive.  Well, obviously play with a few copies of him, and SAC would be a good idea too.  I imagine Lost in the Wilderness is a big danger as well, so be ready with a Sense.  Remember that useless guy from Tatooine, Gamall Wironicc?  Hell keep Watto safe, although you may get a strange look from your opponent when he comes out.  There are countless ways to ensure Watto survives, Barrier, Force Lightning, Elis (if youre desperate), etc.  Again Tatooine Occupation could work here, but is not necessary.  Presence of the Force + Feltipern Trevagg, Projective Telepathy, etc will make your opponent use more force, thus ensure your damage of two will go through.  Dont forget Bad Feeling Have I or No Escape.  Anyway, so Watto is not dead, and Bubo would love to visit a Worrt and the junkyard.  <br />
<br />
Overlooked Deck #3  RTP<br />
<br />
Yes, Rescue the Princess.  I think this deck has the most abusive potential of any LS deck.  Your opponents characters and starships lose ALL immunity to attrition, and every time they lose something, it goes OUT OF PLAY.  Why arent people jumping to play RTP at all the big tourneys?  Well, there are a few reasons.  One is that it used to take forever to flip.  Before the v cards, the only way to really flip successfully was to do something weird like start Echo Base Garrison and pull 8D8 to free Leia.  This took forever.  Now, though, its much better.  Cell 2187(v) gives you a virtually free R2-D2 to get Leia out.  With a few clever tricks like Path of Least Resistance, using Rieekan to pull a speeder, etc., you can move Leia from her cell to Yavin 4 in ONE TURN.  But, what if she dies?  Well, put out bacta tank.  If Leia dies, your opponent is helping you because then you just deploy Leia at the Y4 Dbay and move her over to flip.  This deck is so sick because you can do runs with stuff like HCF and EPPs to poop everything your opponent can put out.  The biggest danger is that of Artoo dying.  Palpy loves to Force Lightning him.  The best solution Ive come up with is to start Wokling (v).  Use that to pull Hopping Mad and use that to pull Droid Shutdown.  If you have enough of those, Artoo will be safe.  The trick is just to flip.  When you flip, all heck breaks loose and your opponent will not be able to stop you.  See Scott Lingrells RTP deck for a great model to build off of.  Id like to see more RTP at tourneys, it is SO abusive when it works.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Overlooked Deck #4- MBO<br />
<br />
Now, I know what youre thinking, MBO?  Who wants to play MBO?  Well, I admit, this deck is dangerous.  It either works beautifully and crushes the DS, or it fails pretty bad.  If you want to see it done well, look at Chris Angers MBO deck, youll see what Im talking about.  OK, here we go.  It is now possible (thanks to v cards) to flip MBO first turn.  Unlikely, but possible.  Say you wait two turns.  Advance Preparation (v) pulls everything you need to blow up the Death Star, and a good deck can do it on the second turn!  Thats around 14 damage dealt to the DS on turn 2!  Plus after that, all of your drains are +2 in space where you have a ship with a pilot, and you can retrieve 3 force EVERY TURN when you deploy a ship (for free) from reserve.  Did someone say Liberty?  Oh, my bad.  This deck is so fast that it will probably throw most decks off guard by the quick damage and retrieval.  Its problems lie on the ground.  General Rieekan and Romas Navander dont do too much against the likes of Vader or Maul.  But thats OK, because if theres one thing the LS can do well (and there is more than one) its evasion!  Its A Trap! is my favorite, but stuff like Dodge, Barrier, Houjix, etc all ensure that a massive beatdown will not come your way.  Let them have the ground if they want to, after you blow away the star of Death, they will be losing so much force a turn that they will not last very long.  Your ships will annihilate anything they can throw at you in space (if youre smart).  Battle Plan will kill them eventually, your retrieval will let you outlast them.  One possible problem is Set Your Course with the Death Star Assault Squadron, but if that happens, take your time and maybe try and battle them out first.  Remember, it has no immunity so draw a battle destiny of 1 and it will die.  Just make sure to put out lots of forfeit fodder.<br />
<br />
Well, there may be more deck types out there, but I think I got the major ones.  Congratulations and thanks for getting this far!  Plus, I think this article is long enough for my first.  Please rate and give feedback.  You can email me at timsim1@umbc.edu if you have any questions.  (please ask before rating!)  In no way do I consider myself an expert or veteran of this great game.  I just joined Decktech and thought it would be fun to write an article.  I hope you enjoyed it.<br />
