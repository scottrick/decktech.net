These cards were a product of an environment where non-interactive play like big drains and direct damage were far too rampant.  Encouraging battling (our last set of articles) is not the only way to promote interaction- you can also blunt your opponent&#39;s attempts to drain your Life Force.  In this set of articles, we are going to look at &quot;damage control&quot; V cards- those cards that reduce your damage or retrieve cards for you.  Finally up are the top 5 DS damage control V cards.   <br />
<br />
<b>Armaedes&#39; Top 5 DS Damage Controllers</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Imperial Decree (V) </b><br />
<i>Deploy on table. While you occupy X battlegrounds, whenever you are about to lose Force (except from Force drains at a battleground, battle damage, or your card) you may reduce that loss by X to a minimum of 1 (may not be further reduced). At the beginning of your turn, you may lose 1 Force to activate based on opponent&#39;s Force icons rather than your own.(Immune to Alter.)</i><br />
<br />
When this card was first released, I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed.  After all, it hurt one of my favorite strategies (Force denial).  However, after some serious play with this card, I have changed my mind completely and now consider this to be one of the better cards released by the Player&#39;s Committee.  There are lots of forms of direct damage for Light Side, and this card can reduce most of them.  Imperial Decree (V) also has a solid balancing factor: Dark Side must control battlegrounds to make the damage-reduction work.  This discourages Dark Side &quot;turtle decks&quot; while also giving Light Side the option to still have their direct damage - as long as they&#39;re willing to fight for it.  Solid damage controller that also promotes interaction - an excellent quality in a card, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
A consensus pick!  Who would have thunk it??  I like how this seems to cycle in and out of decks, which means that denial is still a valid option in small doses.  Don&#39;t despair, Armaedes!<br />
<br />
<b>2. Image Of The Dark Lord (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on any planet site.  Opponent&#39;s Force drains here are -1 (-2 if Vader controls an adjacent site).</i><br />
<br />
It&#39;s a destiny-6 card that can be pulled from your deck using Masterful Move, and can reduce Force drain damage with the only stipulation being that it must be a planet site (so no Cloud City locations).  There&#39;s really no easier way to reduce damage, as it requires no commitment from the Dark Side player other than that they commit a card slot to a destiny-6 Effect.  If Vader&#39;s hanging around an adjacent site, this card will obviously become even more powerful.  Simple Effect that can make a huge difference in a game.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
Wow, talk about an obvious miss on my part great idea for a damage controller.  The LS version (Projection of a Skywalker) was played quite a bit for similar reasons.  The one thing that I don&#39;t like about this card is its fixed location.  If you temper a drain at a planet where there are multiple sites, your opponent can always move around it.  It works best at key drain locations where the enhancers (unlike lightsabers) are fixed as well.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Imperial Propaganda (V)</b><br />
<i>If you are about to lose Force during opponent&#39;s control phase, play on table to reduce that loss by 2. Whenever you are about to lose Force during opponent&#39;s control phase (except from a Force drain at a battleground) cumulatively reduce that Force loss by 1 (once per copy of this card, to a minimum of 1).</i><br />
<br />
Another high-destiny damage controller that&#39;s easy to pull off.  Since this is an Immediate Effect it can even be pulled with the Fanfare shield to be used in a pinch.  Like Imperial Decree (V), this is a good one for reducing direct damage, but it&#39;s less useful than Decree (V) because it only works in the control phase (so it won&#39;t affect Uncontrollable Fury, Legendary Starfighter, Anger, Fear, Aggression, etc.).  Still a solid, high-destiny card that can be used in any deck thanks to the first line of text.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
I agree that this is great card that can be helpful in many decks.  I know that I have used it when I wanted to raise my average destiny while still having some protection to direct damage.  You hit the nail on the head that the first line of text makes it extremely usable.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Imperial Reinforcements (V)</b><br />
<i>Once per game, if opponent has more cards with ability on table than you, draw destiny and retrieve up to that number of Imperial characters and/or Imperial starships (may take one retrieved card into hand).  OR Cancel K&#39;lor&#39;slug.</i><br />
<br />
Somewhat limited in scope due to the fact that it only works on Imperials, Reinforcements (V) is still a solid card that can give a Dark deck some life back in the late game.  It&#39;s really obnoxious when you keep losing your ability off the top of your deck and are unable to keep up with your opponent due to a weak-battling hand.  Imperial Reinforcements (V) can correct this problem and breathe some life back into your deck by giving you some more ability to fight with.  Other than the cards needing to be Imperial, there are no other stipulations, which means you can retrieve EPP Vader into hand if the opportunity arises.  The ability to pull a powerful Imperial like EPP Vader out of the Lost Pile at any time is an incredible ability to have.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
Eh, yeah, it&#39;s pretty good but much like my comments on Merc Sunlet, I HATE having to rely on losing the game (at least being behind in terms of board control) to use a card.  You don&#39;t mention canceling the Slug, which is very nice since there is so much Dark character removal.  Getting up to 7 cards back is pretty strong, I just wish I could use it anytime.  <br />
<br />
<b>5. Lieutenant Grond (V)</b><br />
<i>[Adds 2 to power of anything he pilots.]  Adds one battle destiny if with Dyer or if driving a swoop.  May place Grond in Used Pile to cancel a Force drain at a related location.</i><br />
<br />
Okay, probably nobody saw this guy coming on the list, but Grond (V) is actually quite good at blocking drains, especially if you put him on a vehicle that can move as a &#39;react.&#39;  He can react to a Force drain to block it, then be placed in Used Pile to block a second drain at a related location.  The only downside to this is that some opponents will stop draining after Grond (V)&#39;s react so that they can beat him down instead of allowing you to put him in the Used Pile.  Just make sure you always have a &quot;bail me out&quot; card in hand just in case, so that if your opponent catches onto your tactic you can save yourself a beating, then stop reacting and just put Grond (V) in the Used Pile to cancel a single drain.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
<br />
Nice idea!  I&#39;ve only seen him used in space to cancel a drain on the ground.  It actually was a cool loop - my opponent used Praji to pull him every turn to shut down my big drain on Endor, leading me to spread out instead of consolidating. <br />
<br />
<b>Shewski&#39;s Top 5 DS Damage Controllers</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Imperial Decree (V) </b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
For years, Dark Side players wanted to know if they would ever get a card comparable to Honor of the Jedi.  Fortunately, the answer was yes.  This card is a nice staple in many DS decks.  First, I enjoy the fact that its&#39; a cousin of Honor, not an outright twin.  Its text promotes interaction via battleground deployment and it lets some damage through no matter what.  I haven&#39;t used the activation text very much, but the very threat of it generally neutered Revolution heavy choke decks like some versions of TRM.  I rank this card so high since it so easy to slip in virtually any deck, but its usefulness has slipped with the lack of direct damage heavy LS decks in the meta.  Most LS damage seems to come from battle damage anymore, but in the days of Speeders and WHAP this card was a difference maker. <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Couldn&#39;t agree more; this is a very powerful card for the Dark Side and belongs in just about every Dark deck under the sun.  I had forgotten to mention that this card still hurts Revolution like the original Decree did.<br />
<br />
<b>2. Imperial Propaganda (V) (and Imperial Atrocity (V)) </b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
Armaedes&#39; had the LS version of this card ranked in the last article, and I agree with its inclusion.  It probably belongs more on the LS list than over here, but my DS needed some fleshing out so I cheated a little.  Simply put, a lot of direct damage happens in the control phase, and this card tempers it.  I feel the LS version is stronger since there is simply more direct damage that you are likely to face.  LS direct damage, as mentioned above, is on a low ebb.  Regardless of side, the card is very playable and reliable with its status as an Immediate Effect.   Even if you aren&#39;t playing a damaging deck, you can still reduce a drain by 2 (even at a battleground), which at times is extremely handy, especially since the card keeps giving back to you.  As always, high destinies are always welcome in any deck, and this card easily fits the bill.  Watch out for Control- this card isn&#39;t immune to it.  One fun way to use this card is in conjunction with the non-V version.  You can use a variety of means to deploy a handful of copies of the easy to deploy V version, and then wait for your chance to play the old school version and cause a bunch of Force loss.  It&#39;s hard to pull off, but can be as deadly as a beatdown.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Shewski&#39;s always coming through with the tech, combining this with the non-V version.  This is a really great card, and high-destiny to boot.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Imperial Occupation (V) </b><br />
<i>[While] this side up, Rebel Base Occupation is canceled.  Your Force drain bonuses may not be canceled unless opponent controls a Hoth location.  Once during each of your deploy phases, you may / any marker site.  Once per turn when you deploy an AT-AT, you may take one card (except an AT-AT) from Lost Pile into hand.  For each Imperial in a battle at the Hoth system, your total battle destiny is +1.  Your AT-ATs are destiny +1 when drawn for weapon or battle destiny.</i><br />
<br />
Another #3, and another strange pick.  I limited the text to the 7 side of this objective since it contains the &quot;retrieval&quot; text that made me choose this card.  Dark Side retrieval of any sort is very limited, so to me reliable &quot;retrieval&quot; that&#39;s immune to Aim High gets my attention.  Much like No Escape, this Objective lets you get cards back to hand, which can mean that painful cards like EPP Maul can constantly be cycling out of your Lost Pile and back into play.  While limited in deck use, I believe this text helped make Walkers such a powerful deck when it became legal to play.  I would estimate that many Walkers decks would be able to get about 3 uses of this text, since many played some cheap walkers that were worth trading for stronger cards.  Much like Secure Route (V), the power of this text is limited only by your creativity.  Some of my favorite uses are to pull strong Interrupts, Arica, the aforementioned EPP Maul, or some pesky Ice Storms.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Now this is an original choice!  The problem with this is that it&#39;s (obviously) about as deck-specific as you can get.  This works in only ONE dark side deck, and although the immune-to-Aim-High retrieval is nice I would have had a hard time justifying the inclusion of this card on my own list just because it of course will not work in any other deck besides walkers.<br />
<br />
<b>4. A Bright Center to the Universe (V) (and The Planet That It&#39;s Farthest From (V))</b><br />
<i> Deploy on table.  While you control more battlegrounds than opponent, if you just lost Force to a Force drain, once per turn you may retrieve (for free, and may not be canceled) X Force, where X is the total bonus associated with that Force drain.</i><br />
<br />
These cards (especially the LS version) were overshadowed in V9 by Entrenchment, but they are useful in their own right.  These cards are powerful solutions to single site, mega drain decks that have plagued SWCCG throughout its lifetime.  The biggest drawback is not getting cards lost from hand to the drain back into hand, so you lose hand advantage.  If you lose from Reserve, you will get it right back into circulation, albeit at the bottom of your Reserve Deck.  An enterprising player can use this expected retrieval to do some tracking.  Some LS decks that are still popular, including AITC, offer many enhanced drains and being able to effectively ignore one of them is a great tool for the DS player.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
This card almost made my list, actually.  This is really good for those new Endor decks that can drain with three or four lightsabers at one location, turning a drain of 4-6 into a far more manageable drain of one or two.  Also good for a Jedi Council Chambers drain deck that wants to hurt you for a big drain at a non-battleground using Jedi Lightsaber (V)s.  A Bright Center To The Universe (V) makes those deck look silly.  The only reason this didn&#39;t make my list is because of the qualifications of the card - you have to control more battlegrounds than the opponent.  In certain situations, like the &quot;drain at one location for a million&quot; type of decks, this is easy to pull off, but against a deck that spreads and drains (i.e. QMC with Pucumir) this card loses a lot - if not all - of its potency.<br />
<br />
<b>5. I Had No Choice (V)</b><br />
<i> During any deploy phase, deploy on opponent&#39;s Lando with a maintenance cost. Landos game text is canceled. Once during each of your control phases, you may randomly retrieve one card from your Lost Pile.</i><br />
<br />
OK, I admit, I was stretching to find some final damage controllers for the DS, leading to this card making the list at #5.  Let&#39;s face it; the DS is more about power than about being resilient.    This card arose as a need to get Ref 3 Lando off of the table.  If for some reason you needed him on the table, it would cost you his destiny adding game text as well as to get back some cards from your lost pile.  I would estimate that much of the time this seems play it ends up with Lando leaving the table to get rid of the card&#39;s debilitating effects.  But however, if you are able to keep him on the table somehow, he is a walking candidate for beatdowns as well as steady retrieval.  I wish this card was a little more playable, like by being able to play on any Lando or onto table and perhaps some helpful text if it is lost by any reason.  For now, this is a niche card that doesn&#39;t have much use but is an example of what a solid DS retriever looks like.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Yeah, I ran into the same problem; dark side isn&#39;t so good at the damage controlling.  This card is pretty bad, though; canceling Lando&#39;s gametext can be useful in certain situations, but since the retrieval comes during the control phase the light side player can easily prevent the retrieval by just letting Lando die in a battle (after all, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s doing much good without any gametext).  I would much rather use Breached Defenses (V) in this situation - it can still be played when Lando is deployed, but it can be pulled using the Fanfare shield, causes Force loss, gives guaranteed retrieval (provided you have Force for Aim High), and also reduces the effectiveness of the card it&#39;s played on (though certainly not as much).<br />
