Interviewer:			Benjamin D. Kline<br />
Interviewee:			Brandon Schele<br />
<br />
<br />
1) How&#39;d you get into SW:CCG?<br />
I have a confession: I was never really a big fan of the Star Wars license. I had never really sat down and watched the movies, I had no idea what the &quot;Executor&quot; was, I didn&#39;t even know that the ship was bigger than say an X-wing. I knew next to nothing. My brother&#39;s friend had some cards, and <br />
<br />
my brother started buying them too. I got interested in how complex the game was, completely regardless of the license. Eventually I started buying my own and playing against my brother and his friends. This was all back right after the release of Dagobah. Around the release of Special Edition, I <br />
<br />
played in my first tournament (Bespin and Beyond). I didn&#39;t have many cards for this format, so I obviously didn&#39;t fare too well. Around the release of Death Star 2, I played in my second tournament. It was at this point I started playing competitively on a regular basis, and within a couple of months <br />
<br />
I was one of the top players in the areas I played (Rockford and Madison).<br />
<br />
<br />
2.) Your early thoughts on SW:CCG, when you first started playing.<br />
I found the game to be competitive, complex, and fun. It wasn&#39;t monotonous like a lot of other card games, where you have a couple of different phases and a fairly limited amount of decisions to make in each game. I loved the fact that even if your deck wasn&#39;t as good as your opponent&#39;s or you had <br />
<br />
a bad matchup, you still had the opportunity to outplay them for the win. The fact that just about every game was winnable with very little reliance on luck just kept me coming back.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.) Thoughts on Decipher losing the license?<br />
I was in denial at first. I was worried that my game was going away for good, only I didn&#39;t want to sell my cards when I had the chance because I still enjoyed the game. Sure, Decipher made mistakes when creating cards. But they also created a great game with seemingly endless possibilities for <br />
<br />
decks. I wasn&#39;t exactly thrilled with some of the cards that came out in some of the last few sets (I&#39;m still not a huge fan of defensive shields honestly), but I still enjoyed the environment they created during the 3 years I played competitively while they had the license. It was a shame to see them <br />
<br />
lose the license, but at least now I don&#39;t have to pay for new cards.<br />
 <br />
<br />
4.) Thoughts on the start of the Players Committee and virtual cards?<br />
I was glad the game wasn&#39;t dying, and that it was being put into the hands of what I thought were capable members (although I was naive at the time and still thought Decipher ran a great business, so take it for what it&#39;s worth). Virtual cards was an interesting concept to me, and I was glad when the <br />
<br />
first few sets just added some support cards, but didn&#39;t drastically change the state of the game. They toned down overpowered strategies, but for the most part, left the meta as a whole alone. I was content with this, because I loved the environment the previous couple of years (yes, I even liked <br />
<br />
podracing). Also, I was thrilled that there were still large tournaments being held, like regionals and at Gencon, with a large number of participants. They were keeping the game going, so I couldn&#39;t complain.<br />
<br />
<br />
5.) Prior to GenCon 2004, you were unkwon, tell us about that timeframe (the time leading up to Worlds 2004).<br />
At the beginning of 2004, I wasn&#39;t really interested in playing SWCCG at the moment. I wasn&#39;t attending tournaments, I wasn&#39;t keeping up on the cards, and I really wasn&#39;t talking to anyone about the game in general. Towards the end of the semester, I decided to start going to the PC forums (May <br />
<br />
18 to be exact, the day I joined the PC forums, so I supposed that was the end of the semester). I hadn&#39;t played a game of SWCCG since probably July or August, and I had 2 virtual sets to catch up with I believe. I started talking to people more about what was still good, what impact the new cards <br />
<br />
were having, if any new strategies had come from the sets. The main person I talked to during the whole summer was Mike Pistone. We traded strategies and decks, and would build decks together. We both have a similar playing style, as in we both prefer a more reactive type of deck like TRM, so <br />
<br />
that helped. I attended Wisconsin States in either June or July playing TRM and Hunt Down, and was 5-0 going into the 6th game with a timed win against the guy I had to play in the 6th game. I was the only undefeated I believe at the time, and I figured I would be a lock for the finals. During the <br />
<br />
game, the guy in 2nd place (who had played the same side as me the game before) came over and told his friend who was playing me how much he needed to timed win by in order to be in the finals. Needless to say, I was timed out by that exact amount, but had I been given one more turn, I <br />
<br />
would&#39;ve won the game and been in the finals. I had never really won a qualifying tournament before at this point, the closest I had come was taking 3rd at Corellia Regionals back in 2002 where 50+ people showed up, so I was pretty upset by how it ended up. Illinois States was a month or so <br />
<br />
away, so I decided to prepare for that. Obviously there was nothing wrong with my decks, so I decided to play those again. Luckily, only 10 people showed up at Illinois States, so my chances of winning were really good. The Illinois meta is still pretty lame, considering at the time two players were <br />
<br />
still playing MBO, but I only had to face one of them during the tournament. I went 6-0, beating the 2nd place finisher (Kevin Brownell) once during the tournament, so we bypassed the final and I got my bye to Worlds. At this time, I had little intention of actually going to Worlds, but it was something <br />
<br />
I was discussing with Pistone and my friend Jim at the time, so the possibility was definitely there. I was probably a bit too confident at the time, even though I had literally playtested next to no games during the summer, and only played in two tournaments. Pistone and I had been talking though, <br />
<br />
and decided that Senate was still not only good, but a great surprise deck that we could bring for Day 2 and make Day 3 with. I was pretty convinced on this, so that helped convince me to go because I liked my chances. Eventually I decided to go, so Jim and I drove down there, and obviously the <br />
<br />
rest is pretty well known.<br />
<br />
<br />
6.) What did you do in preperation for Worlds 2004?<br />
Not a whole lot, to be honest. I talked to Pistone a lot about decks, as I said, and built only 4 decks: WYS, TRM, HD, and Senate. I playtested maybe a handful of games with Jim before we went down there, and playtested another couple with Pistone during Day 1. Other than that, I really didn&#39;t <br />
<br />
playtest or anything of the sort, which I suppose is sort of unusual when preparing for such a large tournament. <br />
<br />
<br />
7.) Why did you choose the decks that you did for Day 2?<br />
Well TRM gave me the best chance to win every game. It had no bad matchups, and I&#39;m really comfortable playing with the deck. I had played TRM for years, actually, and it was something I could always fall back to if need be. When it came to Senate, it was chosen for multiple reasons. It was a <br />
<br />
surprise deck, since most people at the time had considered the deck &quot;dead&quot; due to all of the bullets out to hurt it. Due to not being played often, people didn&#39;t know how to play against it well, which worked to my advantage. It had favorable matchups against the two most popular decks at the time <br />
<br />
as well, which were TRM and Speeders. Plus I just loved how many different things all of the aspects of Senate could do, whether it came from the Political Effects, the senators, or even the Objective itself. It was also a deck I had played pretty regularly, especially when it was first released, so I <br />
<br />
was very comfortable with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
8.) Why did you choose the decks you did for Day 3?<br />
To put it simply: everyone was telling me &quot;Just play what you know&quot;. And those were the decks I was most comfortable with, even though I was worried about them(although they were stupid worries, heh). Pistone went off to test with Lee Edwards and Greg Shaw, which worried me considering I <br />
<br />
had to play Lee first. I made a couple of minor changes to each deck, but that was it really. <br />
<br />
<br />
9.) Thoughts on a whole of Worlds 2004?<br />
I thought it went well, but of course I&#39;m quite biased due to the results. There was good competition there, and a decent turnout as well. And I definitely couldn&#39;t complain about the prizes, heh. <br />
<br />
<br />
10.) How did it feel to be Worlds Champion?<br />
At first I couldn&#39;t believe it. I was nervous as it was going into Day 3, and then even more nervous when I had to play Brian Hunter for the first time. It&#39;s really difficult to describe what it felt like when Reid scooped the final game after figuring out there was no way he could pull it out. I was elated, <br />
<br />
excited, in disbelief... I honestly spent the whole day expecting to lose in each round, and then to pull through and win each was pretty unbelieveable. It&#39;s something I definitely won&#39;t be forgetting anytime soon, and something no one can take away from me.<br />
<br />
<br />
11.) Toughest opponent of Worlds 2004?<br />
The toughest two games I played were definitely against Reid Smith. I had what I felt like good matchups each game, but he kept the TRM vs AOBS match closer than I expected, and got a really good jump on me in the Senate vs TRM matchup. He&#39;s a great player that doesn&#39;t make mistakes, and <br />
<br />
has a fairly similar playing style to my own.<br />
<br />
<br />
12.) Best game at Worlds 2004?<br />
Well I would love to say the TRM vs Brian Hunter&#39;s CCT where I destroyed him, but that wasn&#39;t really the &quot;best played&quot; game really, or the most exciting. The best game was definitely Senate vs Reid Smith&#39;s TRM. I won&#39;t go into many details, because they&#39;re in my tournament report posted here <br />
<br />
on Decktech, but it was definitely a one sided game for the most part. I was struggling to hold the Senate, and he had already taken huge control of the Naboo system (the only battleground on the table). I was struggling to cause any damage at all to him, until I finally drew into my Coruscant Guard <br />
<br />
and caused a decent amount of overflow against his guys in the Senate (considering they were all power and forfiet 0). I was still losing by more than I won the previous game at this point, so I needed a way to cause damage. He had his lone Yoda sitting at my non-bg Coruscant DB, and I had just <br />
<br />
enough force to deploy EPP Vader, battle, swing, and draw destiny. I had been holding First Strike in my hand until this point, and luckily Reid had saved no force, but had just pulled Houjix into his hand. I beat Yoda up for probably 8-10 overflow with the aid of Political Effects, and that knocked him <br />
<br />
below the amount he needed to win by.<br />
<br />
<br />
13.) Following Worlds 2004, you&#39;ve become well known, what are your thoughts on that?<br />
It feels good to be recognized, although it has become a double-edged sword. Some people look up to me, and actually believe I have an idea what I&#39;m talking about. But of course, there are others who see &quot;World Champion&quot; as a target, and see even discussions as a competition to try and tell me <br />
<br />
how wrong I am on whatever comments I&#39;ve made. The best part about winning worlds is that it gives me some credibility and visibility in the community, as opposed to being just another face in the crowd.<br />
<br />
<br />
14.) Because of you winning Worlds 2004, you won the ability to design a V-card, you made Mon Mothma[v], take us through the entire process.<br />
Well at the time I created the card, the DS was significantly stronger than the LS. The only real decks to play at the time in my opinion were TRM and Speeders, and Speeders was consistently getting more bullets to kill it, leaving the LS with no real other options. Walkers was pretty strong, and I <br />
<br />
didn&#39;t exactly favor that deck due to it&#39;s seemingly monotonous play (basically, it could pull everything it needed to win the game every game). I wanted to create a card that not only opened up options for the LS, but also hurt a deck that I felt was a pretty big problem, because in order to beat it you <br />
<br />
generally had to pack quite a few counters.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve pretty much described the process I went through designing this card in my article on decktech, so if you&#39;re looking for a more detailed explanation, go check that out. Basically she was already a senator, so I wanted to make her actually useful in the Senate. The LS had very few ways to pull <br />
<br />
locations, especially battlegrounds, so I wanted her to do this as well. And obviously the Epic Event portion of her text was to disrupt Walkers, or at least make them try a little harder to blow up the generator. All in all, I believe the card is fairly successful. The worst part now is trying to top that with <br />
<br />
my next two designs.<br />
<br />
 <br />
15.) You also made Top 8 at Worlds 2005, give us all the details about Worlds 2005.<br />
Oh man, where to start with this one? I wasn&#39;t really too thrilled about going to worlds this year for multiple reasons:<br />
<br />
A) I had a huge target on my back. Being the defending World Champion, anything short of winning again would be a disappointment to me. It didn&#39;t help that everyone was gunning for me as well.<br />
<br />
B) I wasn&#39;t particularly fond of the meta. AITC + Scum = lame. I was honestly not looking forward to playing with or against either deck, and I had hoped Scum would&#39;ve been fixed by the time Worlds rolled along, which is why I played it all spring and summer.<br />
<br />
C) The rise of decks that required what I consider far less skill to play. I&#39;m not trying to offend anyone here, but if you compare the decks played in 2005 to those played in 2004, you will see a drastic difference. In 2004, the only decks around that pulled all that much were CCT, Speeders, and <br />
<br />
Walkers. Only those decks weren&#39;t completely set up by turn 2 due to slower activation in most games. In 2005, you had Endor Mains, Bespin CR(V), Scum, and AITC(among others), that were generally completely set by the end of their second turn after pulling everything they needed and setting <br />
<br />
up a significant amount of damage. There was no &#39;early game&#39; with these decks, they went almost straight to the mid to late game transition where they drained/damaged you. Obviously, I&#39;m not a fan of these types of decks, because pretty much anyone can play them fairly well.<br />
<br />
I attended Worlds anyway, and still had a decent time primarily due to the people that were there. It was nice to see everyone again, and Nick Kolnik (yes, the &quot;nazi&quot; bluethrawn), despite all of our disagreements, actually personally told me he was glad to see I was there. That alone made the trip <br />
<br />
worth while, knowing that I wasn&#39;t actually loathed to the point that people were hoping I wouldn&#39;t show, especially the essential head of the group of players that I&#39;ve had the most disagreements with (MNSWCCG).<br />
<br />
Day 2 was kind of lame, I played against 3 TRM decks(Chris Twigg, Hollingworth, Lee Edwards), a CR(V) Hoth(Mike Richards), and 2 Scum(Eier, Hollingworth). Talk about a lame day, considering I was playing TRM/Scum as well. The worst part about it is that the TRM/Scum matchup is a coin flip, <br />
<br />
completely relying on the DS&#39;s ability to find everything they need the first two turns or if the LS gets the cards THEY need to win the game in the first two turns. If LS can&#39;t find anything, DS wins pretty much by default. If LS can get a jump, it can be a close game with the LS having a chance. Both <br />
<br />
of my decks went 2-1 for the day, losing to Eier primarily because I took out Insurrection combo the night before like an idiot, and losing to Twigg due to him getting that good TRM hand.<br />
<br />
Going into Day 3, I had two choices for LS: I could either play a completely anti-Scum deck or I could play TRM and try and tech it for Scum best I could. The anti-Scum deck would auto-lose to Hunt Down, so it really wasn&#39;t a good option in case anyone went back to the old reliable. So I was stuck <br />
<br />
with TRM. I put as much anti-Scum in it as I could, including 2 Leia RP, 3 Inconsequential Barriers, 4 Sense, 2 Alter, plus more My dark I pretty much left alone, because there&#39;s not much you can really do with scum to change it. I sat down to play Eier, he elected to use Scum first, and my starting <br />
<br />
hand was 2 Leia RP and a bunch of mediocre red cards. I draw up for the first 2 or 3 turns, get no locations, and only one more character EPP Quigon. So by the time I finally get someone to go with Leia, he has his deck set up and I&#39;m pretty much done. I try and cause as much damage as I can <br />
<br />
with the guys I can find(which isn&#39;t much) and the little activation I can gather(again, still not much), and obviously lose the game that was decided at the end of turn 3. He was playing Endor Mains for LS, and there was no way I was going to be able to beat that by the same amount he beat TRM <br />
<br />
with, because Endor Mains has a pretty consistent set up that can cause some damage the whole game. So once he got me below what he needed me below, he drew so I wouldn&#39;t have a chance to use scum to retrieve enough back to win. I would&#39;ve won the 2nd game anyway, it was just pointless <br />
<br />
to play the game beyond that point.<br />
<br />
All in all, worlds was alright, I just wish I would&#39;ve had a better time actually playing the game. I suppose I can only hope future years will be better in terms of what decks are available at the time.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
16.) Favorite / least favorite decks throughout the years?<br />
Oh man, favorite deck ever was probably an EPP/DTF/Numbers/AFA/HDWGITM/Podracing pile from between Tatooine and Reflections 3 releases. That deck just didn&#39;t lose. I also enjoyed playing TRM, Hunt Down, Senate, and Combat for both sides. The first decks I ever got fairly good with were <br />
<br />
TIGIH and MKOS around the release of Reflections 2, and I enjoyed playing those, even though it was Docking Bay wars time. I pretty much enjoy any deck that you can play a control/reactive style with.<br />
<br />
Least favorite decks? I&#39;ve never enjoyed playing against or with any sort of Big Blue deck for DS. They&#39;re just slow and boring, and generally not all that interactive. Walkers and Speeders were always fairly lame, and started the whole &quot;lets pull everything we need&quot; garbage. I personally don&#39;t like a <br />
<br />
lot of the decks around now due to how fast they set up and how they remove a lot of the decision making from the game.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
17.) Favorite / least favorite cards throughout the years?<br />
Not entirely sure on this one. I never really had a &quot;favorite card&quot;, or multiple for that matter. I almost always include Goo Nee Tay in multiples in my LS deck though. Otherwise, nothing really sticks out here.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
18.) You have begun to be known as a pessimist and very controversial figure online, what are your thoughts or retort to that?<br />
Really? I always thought I was quite well loved and adored. Haha<br />
<br />
I suppose anyone that truly speaks their mind is going to be controversial, as evidenced by the many real world examples of this. The pessimist part stems from a constant negative view on things done or released, but if you don&#39;t agree with them, isn&#39;t it pretty much my responsibility as a player to <br />
<br />
voice that opinion? This is a Player&#39;s Committee, where we have a fairly small player base and an even smaller group of people governing how the game is played. Pretty much everyone on the forums makes their opinion known one way or another, and I suppose the reason I&#39;m the target of most of <br />
<br />
the controversy is because I&#39;ve been on the dissenting end of most things since I got on the forums less than 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
Obviously it wasn&#39;t as bad when I first arrived on the forums, because at the time I wasn&#39;t well known (or known at all), and ignored for the most part. But once I won Worlds, got the special icon to go with it, I&#39;ve become a target of scrutiny. Something about the icon makes people feel the need to <br />
<br />
attempt to one up me in even the smallest discussions, I suppose as part of a self confidence or self pride booster. I&#39;m very well aware that this isn&#39;t the only reason people feel the need to lash out at me, but this is a contributing factor whether people are willing to admit it or not.<br />
<br />
When it comes to controversial or dissenting views, I&#39;m really just trying to voice my opinion on the matter. Unfortunately, this opinion usually is a negative one the past year and a half due to disagreements over how things have been handled regarding the game lately. This includes virtual cards, the <br />
<br />
design and playtesting process in general, and what needs erratum or changes. I&#39;m sure most of the readers will remember the gigantic feud over a certain player&#39;s card, which was attempting to change the entire face of the game. Obviously I opposed the mere concept of the card based on the severe <br />
<br />
changes it would make to the game, and I didn&#39;t think a player should have the right to change the game so drastically just because he won an event. I didn&#39;t agree with the changes attempting to be made either, but even if I did agree with the changes, I most likely still would&#39;ve opposed giving a <br />
<br />
player the ability to drastically change the game as much as that card would&#39;ve, especially in its original form. It would set a terrible precedent for future virtual cards (not that we haven&#39;t already with certain overpowered characters), and pretty soon everyone would try to make drastic cards that could <br />
<br />
eliminate every part of the game they didn&#39;t like. In short, it would lead to a pretty chaotic meta and game in general, and would lead to far more fights.<br />
<br />
Something that I&#39;m sure most people already know is this: The dissenting side of things is almost always the most vocal. People who agree with a certain change aren&#39;t going to be posting all over &quot;Yeah, this is a great idea&quot; with long posts and arguments for it out of nowhere. They&#39;ll just either silently <br />
<br />
agree, or post something short about how they believe it&#39;s a good idea. The dissenting side has to be more vocal in order to not only grab attention, but to attempt to persuade people to see their side of things. Inexperienced players generally don&#39;t have the understanding of the game that more <br />
<br />
experienced players do, and won&#39;t understand the impact of certain things on the competitive playing environment. In fact, if they aren&#39;t a part of the competitive playing environment, they usually could care less about it. The more competitive players are going to be the most vocal, which is the case <br />
<br />
on the forums as we speak. I&#39;m hardly the only one, but I get singled out due to the avatar. Obviously the way I present arguments sometimes gets me criticized as well, but I&#39;m unfortunately intolerant of people that really have no idea what they&#39;re talking about, and get frustrated when trying to <br />
<br />
discuss the topic at hand with them. Most anyone is going to get frustrated with &quot;I think this just because&quot; with no justification.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not a bad guy, really I&#39;m not. Sarcastic and a jerk at times, I&#39;ll admit to that (actually it&#39;s pretty difficult for me not to admit to that, heh). I&#39;m just trying to get my opinion across in the best way possible so players and Advocates both understand where I&#39;m coming from, and possibly gather <br />
<br />
support. I&#39;m (usually) not trying to look for a flame war, although I do find myself stuck in them quite often (or at least have subtle shots taken at me).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
19.) You are very outspoken on the problems of SW:CCG, the Players Committee, and certain virtual cards, and other issues. Here is your place to rant and list all of these problems (in your opinion).    <br />
Being outspoken is one of the more frustrating things on the forums. People like to put words in my mouth, or completely ignore the main point I&#39;m trying to make in order to pick apart a small part of my posts. I hope I can clear up my opinions on lots of things here, I just hope this list doesn&#39;t get too <br />
<br />
long:<br />
<br />
A)  <br />
SWCCG: The game in general is really not all that fun to play anymore. The games are too fast, they&#39;re requiring less decision making in order to win, and deck building is becoming way too easy. There is a notable lack of creativity involved in making decks, and this makes games far less entertaining. <br />
<br />
A lot of decks right now are &quot;pull my cards, deploy my cards, cause damage&quot;, and this cycle is completed by the end of that player&#39;s 2nd or 3rd turn. A couple of years ago, you were lucky to deploy DLOTS in Hunt Down on your second turn. Now Endor Mains can deploy General Solo(V), Mon <br />
<br />
Mothma(V), Luke Rebel Scout(V), and Obi JK(V) all on their first turn, along with some weapons, support cards (back door effects), and still have force left over to draw or save. Where is the fun in that? Where is the skill involved in that? The decision making pretty much boils down to &quot;Do I want to <br />
<br />
deploy Mace or Obi this turn, and save the other for next turn in case they deploy someone somewhere other than Endor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done to reduce pulling of cards, prevent decks from activating 7+ on their first turn due to their icons alone, and stop all of this free and cheap deploy garbage. The idea of a free Jedi Luke that also has awesome gametext is just plain stupid. I&#39;m well aware that at the time he was <br />
<br />
created that the DS was still stronger than the LS, but there are better methods to deal with this. Really, did someone actually think all of the support cards to AITC was a good idea? What about the insane amount of Scum help? A plan needs to be developed as to how to deal with this and get the <br />
<br />
game back to a more stable state, where decision making is an integral part of deciding who wins and loses a game again. When this plan is developed, it needs to be implemented over the course of 2 virtual sets, to slow everyone into the changes. I truly hope something is done, or else at the current <br />
<br />
rate, most of the competitive players will get discouraged and likely stop playing. I know this is the case for me at the moment, I have pretty much no desire to play since the game just really isn&#39;t all that fun right now.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
B)<br />
The Player&#39;s Committee: As a whole, one obviously can&#39;t criticize them too much due to the fact that they&#39;ve kept the game going this long. Although I don&#39;t agree with the way certain advocates deal with things (primarily the ones who actually have control over the cards and errata), I&#39;m not going to <br />
<br />
call them out here. My main complaints are stated in the other sections, so you can just refer to those. But I do have to say a big THANK YOU to them for the way they&#39;ve run and supported competitive tournaments. I truly appreciate it, as does everyone else I&#39;m sure. Worlds was a good time <br />
<br />
(despite the meta), and this is primarily due to the advocates that were there that helped set everything up.<br />
<br />
C)<br />
Virtual Cards: I honestly don&#39;t even know where to start here. There are so many ridiculous cards now that either do too much or just are too strong that really should&#39;ve never made it out of playtesting. The worst part is the whole &quot;Make a powerful card and then make 4 bullets to it in subsequent <br />
<br />
sets&quot; process that they seem to have going on, since all they&#39;re doing it seems is cycling in new powerful cards in the process. I&#39;ll list the cards I have the biggest problems with, along with a little explanation for each. I&#39;m not going to get too detailed here, since this really isn&#39;t the place to rant on this. <br />
<br />
Obviously if more detail is desired by someone reading this, I&#39;m not all that difficult to get a hold of. So, in no particular order, here we go:<br />
<br />
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight (v): <br />
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi Knight  This card has been discussed inside and out. I just don&#39;t understand how &quot;cancel any one destiny when with a dark jedi&quot; made it out of playtesting, since it can be abused in so many ways. It&#39;s just a stupid card with overpowered text. I&#39;m well aware that there are ways <br />
<br />
to kill Obi, but that is a poor excuse for designing such a strong card.<br />
<br />
Mace Windu (v):<br />
Mace Windu  This sets a terrible precedent for player created cards. This is basically a guy whose gametext stops most ways to kill him, and he can pull his own weapon AND Blaster Deflection. So he&#39;s immune to attrition and immune to at least two weapon targets, and now with Colo gone, he&#39;s <br />
<br />
even more difficult to hit in the early game. This was basically a &quot;Let&#39;s make this guy as strong as they&#39;ll allow me because it would be cool&quot; sort of deal, which I hope others don&#39;t attempt to emulate.<br />
<br />
Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (v):<br />
Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout  Adds 1 to his destiny draws? Okay, I can live with that. Opponent must use 2 force to fire a weapon at same site? Eh I guess that&#39;s alright, although a bit strong. Deploy for free?! People would easily play this guy and deploy him for 6 given the rest of his gametext, <br />
<br />
yet they felt the need to let people deploy him for free. Absolutely ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Establish Control (v):<br />
Establish Control  There&#39;s a reason why Mob Points got a fairly balanced counter, and why it was made a shield, and it definitely wasn&#39;t because it could pull the Executor. The anti-alien line puts this over the top.<br />
<br />
Sim Aloo (v):<br />
Sim Aloo  I don&#39;t mind the &quot;pay 2 to pull a card&quot; line, but to put that on an ability 4 character with immunity with another awesome line of text is a bit over the top. He&#39;s just begging to be abused. I suppose I&#39;ll leave it at that for now.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Really, I could go on forever with this, but I think this is a good stopping point. This interview is already really long right now, I don&#39;t want to stretch it into &quot;unreadable in one sitting&quot; with this topic alone.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
20.) You still have a few future V-Card designs, anything you can tell us about them?<br />
To be honest, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with them. I want to do something other than &quot;just another strong character&quot;. I want it to be something creative and fun to play with, but figuring out exactly what that is is pretty difficult. I&#39;m leaning towards Dark Side cards, since it&#39;s at an obvious <br />
<br />
disadvantage for the time being.<br />
<br />
<br />
21.) What do you think is the future of SW:CCG and the Players Committee?<br />
I think it is in good hands, and that the players will definitely stick around for a few more years. The only thing I&#39;m concerned about is the competitive circuit, where I think attendance will start to decrease if the problems with the current game aren&#39;t amended. The current meta just isn&#39;t fun to play in, <br />
<br />
and many other competitive players have expressed that same feeling to me. I just don&#39;t see a point in spending hours building decks and cutting out virtual cards and driving a few hours to play a game that just really isn&#39;t that fun at the moment.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
22.) You were a playtester for a while, anything you can tell us about your time as playtester? (That won&#39;t violate playtester rules).<br />
I was not impressed by the playtesting process at all. It was actually quite disappointing, and in my opinion, really needs to be rearranged before future virtual sets are released. The whole process is inherently flawed due to the hierarchy system in place. I&#39;m not entirely sure I can go into any more <br />
<br />
detail than that without getting in trouble in some way or I would, sorry.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
23.) What is the future for you?<br />
In life, I just graduated college with a Bachelor&#39;s in Mechanical Engineering, and got my first full time job. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m going nowhere but up from there, haha.<br />
<br />
As far as SWCCG, I&#39;ll play as long as the game keeps me interested. I&#39;d really like to attend Worlds this year and probably next, and the odds of my attending will definitely increase if it is moved to Chicago (which I hope it is).<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
24.) Any road stories or favorite SW:CCG moments you&#39;d like to share?<br />
A couple of short things, nothing really elaborate since I&#39;m terrible at telling stories:<br />
<br />
At Worlds 2004, after Day 2 my friends and I were heading to Champ&#39;s to eat. A couple of people tagged along, including Jim Li, who I knew, and oddly enough Reid Smith, who I had never spoken to in my life. We really didn&#39;t talk at dinner, and we really didn&#39;t discuss SWCCG at all considering 3 of <br />
<br />
us were in Day 3. Turns out, Reid and I both made the finals, and when we sat down to play, he said &quot;Dude, I don&#39;t even know who you are&quot;. I told him my name, and apparently my younger brother (Justin) was more well known than I was due to his retarded posts on decktech that summer, <br />
<br />
because a couple of people knew his name but not mine.<br />
<br />
So when both Reid and I made Day 3 again this past year, we were definitely going back to Champs to eat. I ended up going with the same group of people, with a couple more friends tagging along, and Reid got held up waiting for Team Ohio and sitting with them. Unfortunately it didn&#39;t work out so <br />
<br />
well for us this time, but I&#39;m going to have to blame Reid here for not sitting with us instead of Team Ohio. Thanks Reid for screwing both of us on Day 3!<br />
<br />
Also on Worlds 2004 Day 3, when I was playing against Brian Hunter, a lot of people would come over and ask &quot;Who is that kid?&quot; I heard a lot of &quot;I have no idea&quot; and some people even tried to guess as to who I was (none were right). When I was beating Hunter during the second game of the <br />
<br />
match, quite a few people decided to crowd around the table out of disbelief.<br />
<br />
This past year, on Day 2 I wore a t-shirt that simply says &quot;WORLD CHAMPION&quot; on it more out of comedic effect than anything else. The advocates all shook their head in disbelief when I walked in, which was pretty much what I expected out of them. It was amusing though, because at that point <br />
<br />
everyone that I hadn&#39;t met before from SWCCG knew who I was. A few people hated the shirt. Keith Watabayashi(sp?) saw me in the hallway and said &quot;Who would wear that shirt?&quot; and shook his head. Matt Sokol actually liked it (it probably doesn&#39;t hurt that he&#39;s a former world champ as well).<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, nothing really all that entertaining has happened as of yet. I wish I had better stories, but hopefully I&#39;ll get some in the coming years.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
25.) Any final comments, opinions, or anything else you&#39;d like to share with us?<br />
Nothing really to add, your questions pretty much covered everything. The only question you left out was &quot;What makes you so awesome?&quot;, but I&#39;m sure everyone can live without the answer to that one.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Thanks for the interview, and thanks to all who have read this far. I hope I didn&#39;t bore any of you too much. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Thank you Brandon for your time, and we hope all of you tune in later for more of the interviews.<br />
