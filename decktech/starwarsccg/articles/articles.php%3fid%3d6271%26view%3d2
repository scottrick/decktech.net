This was, by and large, a product of an environment where non-interactive play like big drains and direct damage were far too rampant.  Encouraging battling is not the only way to promote interaction- you can also blunt your opponent&#39;s attempts to drain your Life Force.  In this set of articles, we are going to look at &quot;damage control&quot; V cards- those cards that reduce your damage or retrieve cards for you.  First up are the top 5 LS damage control V cards.   <br />
<br />
<b>Armaedes&#39; Top 5 LS Damage Controllers</b><br />
<br />
<b>1.  Entrenchment (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  Imperial Atrocity is cancelled.  Whenever opponent Force drains, if you control two battlegrounds (a site and a system), or Jedi Test 1 completed, you may lose Force equal to the number of Light Side icons at that location instead of losing Force to the Force drain.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
Best.  Card.  Ever.  Well, maybe that&#39;s an exaggeration, but this is a card that has been much needed ever since the words &quot;Force drain bonuses&quot; appeared on a card alongside the phrase &quot;may not be cancelled.&quot;  Hopefully, there will never be a card made to get around Entrenchment (V) because this is a card that&#39;s good for the game.  It promotes interaction, it slows down those cheesy &quot;drain for 9 at one location&quot; decks, and it encourages decks to be balanced enough to hold both a battleground site and a battleground system.  No card has done so much to change the game since Menace Fades.  Some may argue that this card promotes turtling, and it&#39;s hard to dispute that when Entrenchment (V) is seen in a deck like Watch Your Step (V), but I would much rather face a turtle deck than The Maul Deck that ended the game with 4 or 5 Force drains.  For my money, no card in the game reduces damage so effectively while still promoting balance and interaction.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Maul deck was no real threat to the LS meta, IMO.  I really dislike that this card needed to be made, but it was ridiculous to put a potent text like Bane Malar&#39;s onto a card that can be pulled so easily and turtle so well.  I don&#39;t think this card is good for the game in principle, but needed in purpose.  DS drain decks like Dark Deal are on unsure footing for the foreseeable future, which is a sad side effect of trying to take out Scum decks.  But, as you say, any card that encourages deployment to battlegrounds is a good one for the game.  I would just hope that battlegrounds don&#39;t become like Jabba&#39;s Palace in Scum decks- battlegrounds in name only.  There are so many tricks that can be brought against you in those places that it&#39;s often better to leave them be.  <br />
<br />
<b>2.  Flash Of Insight (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  While this card on table, play with the top card of your Reserve Deck revealed.  During your draw phase, place this Effect and top card of your Lost Pile in your Used Pile.</i><br />
<br />
Possibly the most effective retrieval card around, Flash Of Insight (V) is a free retrieval of one card per turn that is unaffected by Come Here You Big Coward, Do They Have A Code Clearance?, Secret Plans, or Allegations Of Corruption.  As if that wasn&#39;t enough, it also lets you check out your top destiny, which is always a good thing (even if your opponent gets to see it too).  At destiny-4, there&#39;s no reason why every light deck shouldn&#39;t have at least one Flash (V) in it, and more likely you should have 3-4.  With Threepio With His Parts Showing or Mirax Terrik on the table you can play one every single turn with a bare minimum of tracking, and getting a risk-free card from your lost pile back into your deck while also cycling a decently-high-destiny Effect back into your deck is always a good thing.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
I make this my top damage controller; mainly since it can fit in any deck out there the sheer versatility of this card is amazing.  There truly are lots of little tricks you can do with this card that I hope to share in my review of it.<br />
<br />
<b>3.  Merc Sunlet (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on table.  While you have more cards in your Lost Pile than your opponent, and you are about to lose Force, you may use X Force and place X cards of your choice from your Lost Pile out of play to reduce Force loss by X.  You may not play Out Of Commission.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
As long as you aren&#39;t doing a character-heavy deck, in which you play multiples of numerous characters, this is a good damage-reduction card because it basically says that if you have a bigger lost pile than your opponent, you don&#39;t have to lose any more Force until your lost pile is smaller.  This works for ANY damage in the game, including damage from your own cards, and all you have to have is some active Force in order to use it.  Obviously, this card is also good with the Immediate Effect I Can&#39;t Believe He&#39;s Gone, which adds 5 to your power in battles and so could technically be considered a damage reducer as well.  The best part is that you can place out of play the cards of your choice from your lost pile, so if you have a lost pile filled with valuable cards that you would rather retrieve than place out of play, you can choose different cards to use with this Effect.  Basically, this card says that as long as you&#39;re losing the game, each of your cards lost can satisfy two points of damage instead of one.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Good point about the damage from your own cards- I forgot about that.  I do feel that it is a little worse than you represent (I have it at 4) since to get the use out of this you have to take damage, which is generally never in my game plan.<br />
<br />
<b>4. Imperial Atrocity (V)</b><br />
<i>If you are about to lose Force during opponent&#39;s control phase, deploy on table to reduce that loss by 2.  Whenever you are about to lose Force during opponent&#39;s control phase (except from a Force drain at a battleground) cumulatively reduce that Force loss by 1 (once per copy of this card, to a minimum of 1).</i><br />
<br />
The first time you play this card, it reduces any control phase damage, including a Force drain at a battleground.  After that, the damage it works on minimizes but it&#39;s still an effective counter to direct damage sources like Occupations or You May Start Your Landing.  Especially due to the popularity of the Combat Readiness (V) Scum deck, the ability to reduce Occupation damage is huge.  Think about it - Occupation and YMSYL rarely does more than 3-4 points of damage tops.  If you get two copies of Imperial Atrocity (V) out at the same time, you can reduce this damage down to 1 point a turn and almost completely neuter the effectiveness of the damaging card.  To top it all off, this card is destiny-6 so it won&#39;t hurt you to play multiples of it, and it can be pulled with Don&#39;t Do That Again, so you can always have it when you need it.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
These cards are definitely strong.  If using that card, you can use Occupation cancellers to help keep your damage down.  One card you can use it with is Honor of the Jedi.  Personally, I prefer Honor for its universal reduction but if you are worried about a lot of No Escape being played this isn&#39;t too bad, either.  <br />
<br />
<b>5. Tusken Breath Mask (V) </b><br />
<i>Deploy on a battleground location.  X = the face-up destiny number of your Objective.  While all your ability on table is provided only by aliens, creature vehicles, and Independent starships pilots, you are considered to have +X in total ability at locations you occupy, and once per turn you may ignore up to X in battle damage.  Cancelled if opponent controls this location or if it becomes a non-battleground.  Immune to Alter.</i><br />
<br />
It&#39;s on the bottom of my list because it&#39;s so deck-specific, but I couldn&#39;t make a damage-reduction list without including the most powerful damage reducer around.  First of all, playing this card with a flipped objective gives you a guaranteed battle destiny in every battle.  This alone can be considered a damage reducer as it makes it that much harder for your opponent to do a beat down.  Then, once they do get their less-than-effective beatdown pulled off, you can ignore 7 battle damage from it.  So you get your character&#39;s power, a battle destiny, possibly your characters forfeit, and then add 7 to that total, and that&#39;s how much damage a lone character can handle before a beatdown is going to hurt you.  Obviously, the down side of this card is that you can&#39;t play it in every deck since it will only work with alien decks like Agents In The Court and Quiet Mining Colony (and certain builds of Watch Your Step).  However, when it comes to finding cards that reduce damage it&#39;s hard to pass over a card that says &quot;ignore battle damage&quot; in it.<br />
<br />
SHEWSKI&#39;S TAKE:<br />
Bah!  I consider this (and WYS (V)) bad examples of how to create damage controllers.  A lot of NPEs came from both of those, but I can&#39;t deny its strength - as most recently evidenced at Worlds when AITC ran amok.  This is a very, very strong damage reducer that thankfully got errata&#39;ed to remove the Bo Shuda loophole, but I could justify having this not rank in my top 5 since I found other candidates that are more universal or better for the game.<br />
<br />
<b>Shewski&#39;s Top 5 LS Damage Controllers</b><br />
<br />
<b>1. Flash of Insight (V) </b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
Flash is one of those cards that you can fit into ANY deck and it&#39;s so strong that you may often be tempted to slip in multiples.  Generally, with proper tracking you can get a lot of use of just one copy.  This card is a great way to learn how to track- you can track the Effect itself, the card &quot;retrieved&quot;, or use it to check another destiny you were already tracking.  Note the parentheses on retrieved this is not retrieval, so it is not affected by cards that hamper general retrieval.  I think my favorite use of this card is to check destinies early in the game, when you are shuffling so much that tracking is a few turns away at best.  I play Flash, and then generally use every shuffling technique available to me until I get the destiny I want to see.  In the heyday of Walkers, it was quite easy to get a high destiny so I could launch a Corran beatdown.  My second favorite use of the card was in conjunction with cards like Naked Threepio by using various shuffling techniques I could also get the choice of a few different cards I could draw into hand.  The destiny isn&#39;t too bad, either!  Beware, Flash is nice Alter bait- while there are plenty of worse cards your opponent can let through your nice &quot;retrieval&quot; cycle might end prematurely.  <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I couldn&#39;t agree more; Flash (V) can literally go in any light side deck, and it requires no effort whatsoever to pull it off - you don&#39;t even have to have Force available, since it&#39;s not &quot;retrieval&quot; and therefore immune to Secret Plans.  This is by far the most universal retrieval method available for light side.<br />
<br />
<b>2. Entrenchment (V)</b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
I really dislike the need for this card, but I applaud its power and potency.  This card is the ultimate trump in the cancel/may not be canceled war and looks to be the top dog for a while.  This card really throws a thorn into the Dark Side&#39;s game plan that I think didn&#39;t need to be done.  Most DS decks had drain bonuses of one or two, but then the Maul deck came along and brought back fear of the mega drain.  That fear was unfounded in my opinion, but the existence of Bane Malar (V) in Scum decks may have threatened the meta enough to justify such a heavy handed card.  I like how this helps balanced decks as well as MWYHL and has the slight drawback of not allowing LS to use Atrocity.  I think this card might bring a card like Presence of the Force into more play to get around it.  It&#39;s a very strong card that puts to shame older cards like Menace Fades or Great Warrior.  May it be a lesson to us in how things can escalate in any aspect of the game. <br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I agree that the necessity of this card is unfortunate, but it&#39;s definitely an extremely strong card.  Moreover, it promotes balance for light side, since the light player must have enough space and ground to control the requisite site and system.  Also a much-needed card for Jedi Testing decks.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Luke Skywalker (V) </b><br />
<i>P:3 A:4 D:3 F:7<br />
Adds 3 to power of anything he pilots (and to Attack Run total if piloting lead starfighter). If piloting at a battleground during your control phase, may retrieve 1 Force or take Darklighter Spin into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle.</i><br />
<br />
I think this might be a somewhat controversial choice at number 3, but this card has been an extremely strong component to LS space packages from the start of the virtual card era.  Luke is a solid pilot, but his strengths are in his ability to easily reinforce himself through All Wings Report In & Darklighter and, more importantly for this list, his retrieval text.  Luke is generally a pretty tough force in space, and with a decent amount of backup you can generally lock down a system and retrieve all game long.  The retrieval is very nice since it is so reliable- you can easily play strong lost cards like On the Edge before your control phase and then use Luke to get Edge back.  This can easily lead to getting much needed cards back, and since you are only retrieving one Force at a time, you always know what you are getting back, and generally can afford to pay for it if Secret Plans is out.  Luke&#39;s biggest drawback is that he is Luke.  There are many powerful personas of Luke out there and you need to pick the one that best fits your deck.  Often time a more versatile Luke (like EPP Luke) will make the cut over the farm boy, but when he fits into a deck, he will make his presence felt.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
Luke Skywalker (V) was actually #6 on my own list, and the only reason he didn&#39;t make the top five is for the exact reason Shewski says - sometimes you need a more versatile Luke, such as EPP Luke.  Also, Luke Skywalker, Rebel Scout (V) is an extremely powerful card that often precludes the use of farmboy Luke (V).<br />
<br />
<b>4. Merc Sunlet (V)</b><br />
<i>see above for text</i><br />
<br />
This card is most notably seen in a popular TIGIH build that uses it to pull off I Can&#39;t Believe He&#39;s Gone, but you could fit it into some other decks.  When it came out, Dark Side direct damage was on the upswing and in effect this card lets you play with a 75 card deck at least when it comes to losing cards.  The hardest part of this card is the restrictive use of it- you need to be hurting more than your opponent to start using it, but one of the neat parts of it is that you can choose which cards to PooP.  This lets you PooP garbage cards that you don&#39;t really want to use ever again (maybe HFTMF or a once per game Interrupt) and leave the real gems in your Lost Pile to retrieve.  The loss of Out of Commission is no fun either- it&#39;s always great to blindly knock out Vader or Maul.  This card is low on my list since there really is only one deck that can use this to its advantage regularly (TIGIH) and because it is purely a defensive card.  It often may be nice to have this in a first draft of a deck list, but in the end it likely will get cut since no one goes into a game planning on getting behind in the damage race.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
I love this card.  As you said, it&#39;s one downside is that you have to basically be losing the game in order to utilize it.  However, I have seen this card put to excellent use in some decks such that it turned the tide from near-certain defeat into victory.  I consider this to be a very balanced damage-reducer, as it&#39;s use is limited and it hurts a deck that wants to retrieve in other methods (i.e. if you retrieve cards from your Lost Pile, this card becomes far less useful).<br />
<br />
<b>5. Secure Route (V)</b><br />
<i>Deploy on a site.  Cancels all other Secure Routes.  Your Republic characters may deploy here regardless of Objective deployment restrictions.  Once per turn, if you just deployed a Republic character to an interior Naboo site, take any one non-character card from Lost Pile into hand.</i><br />
<br />
This card single handedly revitalized WHAP and made it a potent and competitive deck.  The reason it makes my list is that it is another case of retrieval without retrieving, just like Flash (V).  Secure Route opened up Theed Palace to the Light Side player by removing onerous deployment restrictions brought upon themselves by the objective.  This alone would help WHAP, but it also let you get a nice kickback when you deploy to Theed Palace.  Unlike Flash (V), SR (V) lets you take the &quot;retrieved&quot; card into hand, which is incredibly powerful and lets the Light player be extremely reactive.  This power has been around for a while (see No Escape), but being able to do this every turn (and with such a variety of card choices) was a new wrinkle for the LS, especially since other methods of getting back those characters exist already.  Again, this truly only fits into few decks other than WHAP, which knocks it down the list, but its power in those decks is incredible.<br />
<br />
ARMAEDES&#39; TAKE:<br />
This is a card I didn&#39;t even consider for my own list due to it&#39;s limited usability.  It&#39;s a very strong damage controller, no doubt, but it&#39;s really only useful in WHAP decks or a non-WHAP deck that uses Republic characters and interior Naboo sites; I can&#39;t fathom such a deck being good, but I suppose it&#39;s possible.<br />
