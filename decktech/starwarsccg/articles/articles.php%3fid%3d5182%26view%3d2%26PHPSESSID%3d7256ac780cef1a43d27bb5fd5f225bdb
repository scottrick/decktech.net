The strategies included are not particularly advanced per se, however, and will most likely not be new for those with tons of experience.  After being in the game for a few years, I have noticed a few mistakes that many people tend to make.  These tips will by no means shoot you from 1700 to 2100 overnight, but it may help you to gradually improve your records at local tourneys, and eventually even win some.  Also, there are definitely more mistakes that people make then could possibly be mentioned in one article, I am just trying to hit on the big ones.<br />
<br />
WARNING:  If you are an accomplished experienced player looking for super advanced strategies, please stop now before giving low reviews.  Anyway, here we go:<br />
<br />
Tip #1 KNOW YOUR CARDS<br />
<br />
	Other articles on Decktech have said this over and over again, and still it can never be said enough.  Everyone knows why they have a card in their deck, but not everyone knows every single use for every single card in their deck.  For example, Imperial Arrest Order gives certain Imperials a forfeit bonus, Ive had situations where I have had say Admiral Chiraneau alone on the Chimaera, and my opponent draws a battle destiny of five.  If I didnt know about Arrest Order, I would have had to lose both the ship and Chiraneau.  How about the card Skywalkers?  Say you are about to deliver a huge beatdown with Luke, Leia, and Obi against some imperials, but Luke Jedi Knight is barriered.  Now you were planning to use Skywalkers to add two battle destiny, but you have a choice.  You can use Skywalkers to cancel the Barrier, and still battle (thus still catching your opponent unprepared), or if you didnt know about that, your opponent has a chance to prepare and turn the tide of battle into his favor.  Read ALL of the game text of your cards, and the lore.  It can be crucial to know if your character is a leader, or if your opponents character is a smuggler.  If youre not sure what a card does that your opponent is using, ask to check it out.  Your opponent will always have an edge over you if they know what their cards do and you do not.  You lose even more of the edge if you dont know what your own cards are capable of doing.  Most players should be nice enough to let you quickly read their cards.  SWCCG prides itself on having some of the nicest people in all of card games.  Ask the TD if you have a rules question.  There, Ive think Ive said enough about that.<br />
<br />
Tip #2  Pay to Drain<br />
<br />
Now, this may seem obvious, but when you think about it, it can make a big difference.  Oh, he put a Projection on my 2/2 site, so now its not worth it to pay to drain of one.  Well, those who have played quite a few games will be able to tell you stories where they have lost by ONE force.  Anybody will tell you games where they needed ONE more card in their life force to pull off a great move.  This is huge, and potentially game winning.  I recommend almost always paying to drain, except in special circumstances.  If you need all your force to deliver a big beatdown, then thats something different.  The point Im trying to make is that you should never not pay to drain, thinking that it just doesnt matter.  Because it can and will somewhere along the line.  I know for a fact that during the third day at Worlds this year a game was decided with a one point win.  What does that tell you?  OK, the bottom line is, unless you really need the force for another big move, than you should ALWAYS ALWAYS pay to drain.<br />
<br />
Tip #3  Tracking 4 dummies<br />
<br />
Now there are 3 great articles on Deck Tech right now by Steve Marshall that talk about tracking.  Those articles are spectacular, and changed the way a lot of people played the great game of SWCCG.  I will never attempt to do the same, but in this paragraph I will show the simplest way to track.  Its how I started, and I still use this method from time to time.<br />
OK, say you have a used interrupt in your hand with destiny six.  You know the card that the interrupt pulls is not going to be in there, so what do you do with it?  Toss it for drain fodder?  NO!!  This works particularly well late in the game, but can be done anytime.  Here is all you have to do.  Wait until the very end of your turn.  I mean the split second before you recycle your Used Pile.  Play the Interrupt.  While you are searching your deck (it doesnt actually matter if the card is in there or not) count the cards in your reserve deck.  Thats it, just count them, and remember the number.  During your next turn, activate that number of force (this is why this works best late in the game, when you have less cards in your life force.  It can be done at any time, but it takes longer if you arent activating very much.)  Voila!!  That six is now on top!  Could it be any easier you ask?  Well, actually it can.  If you play with Threepio with parts showing (or Janus Greejatus for DS) you can do it even more effectively.  Again, at the end of your turn place the highest destiny card in your hand on top of your used pile to draw the top card of your deck.  If you know how many cards in your reserve, then you just activate that number next turn, and you can easily have a 7 ready to choke Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, or to shoot Emperor Palpatine with a blaster!  That can obviously change a game very quickly.  If you have any questions about this, feel free to dmail me, I love to talk SWCCG.<br />
<br />
Tip #4  Anticipation<br />
<br />
This is without a doubt the most advanced strategy I will discuss.  Its also the vaguest.  What I mean is, try to anticipate the actions of your opponent, try to be one step ahead of them if possible.  This will obviously be difficult for newer players, but with experience comes knowledge.  One thing that really helps is verifying your opponents deck.  Then you get to see what your opponent can possibly use to hurt you.  Ex-your opponent saves a force at the end of his turn.  Could he have a Barrier?  Or is he waiting to use the gametext of some character or effect on table?  If you know whats in his deck, then you know what to expect.  This will definitely take some getting used to, and will definitely not work all of the time, but it can be a huge help.  Did your opponent leave some scrubby character alone at a site?  Chances are he has a Ghhhk/Houjix or some sort of evasion.  If you plan for that however, with Stop Motion (v) or Sense or something, youll be one step ahead of him.  (Note:  I know Ghhhk and Houjix are immune to Sense, they were just there for examples only.)  &#61514;  Basically, the best way to improve this part of your game is to verify your opponents deck at every opportunity, and try to think what you would do in his place.  I know it sounds corny, but if you master this skill, then you will hopefully rarely be surprised by your opponent, which is always good.<br />

Tip #5-Pull stuff doing your activate phase, or before you activate if possible.<br />
<br />
How many times have you searched your deck for a card, only to find that you activated it?  It happens to all of us.  But, if the card that allows you to search says once per turn you can do that whenever you want.  If you need a Flash of Insight (v) to set up your infinite On the Edge retrieval (I love Flash (v), its the most fun virtual card so far, unless if Im DS) activate three force, use your Signal, then activate the rest.  Many many players have no doubt caught onto this (no need to tell me in the reviews), but this article is for those who havent thought about all the little tricks of SWCCG.<br />
<br />
Tip #6  Have a plan, and dont give up<br />
<br />
This one may sound corny too, but its very serious.  How many times have you wanted to give up after a crucial battle went sour?  It happens much more frequently than we would like.  But, the game is not over until its over (yeah Yogi Berra).  I have a friend who was playing Hunt Down, and very early in the game he lost Vader and he went Out of Play.  He still fought back and won the game.  The moral of the story is that if you dont want to win, you usually wont win.  Dont get discouraged; dont get intimidated.  Every deck has a strategy, a way its supposed to play to win.  Never lose sight of that strategy, even if youre tempted to.  It is very easy to give up in the presence of a player who has a rating far above yours, but then why play at all?  Hes going to have to work to beat you unless you let him.  At the very least, every time you lose a game you should learn something.  Every time you learn something you become a better player.  There, I guess I can get down off of my soapbox now.<br />
<br />
Tip #7  Have fun.<br />
<br />
There, you knew it was coming.  We all play this game for fun right?  If you arent having fun, they youll probably stop playing.  If we stop playing, then the greatest card game of all time will die.  None of us want that to happen, so enjoy yourself.  Play to win, but dont play like your life depends on it.  You are just asking for a N.P.E. if you do.  If your opponent beats you, be a good sport, and maybe even ask him for suggestions.  One thing that really can annoy players is the timing issue.  If your opponent is going to drain you out next turn, and time is up, draw up.  Theres nothing you can do about it anyway, and it doesnt even hurt your score anymore than timing would.  Nobody wants to play with a sore loser, or perhaps even worse, a sore winner.  If you do win, thats great, but theres no need to do a song and dance or heckle anyone about it.  A true loser at SWCCG is someone who creates a N.P.E. for other players.<br />
<br />
Well, thats about it for now folks.  I hope you enjoyed the article and I hope it helps you out in some way.  Thanks a bunch for reading, suggestions are welcome.  May the greatest card game ever made continue to live and thrive in all of us.<br />
