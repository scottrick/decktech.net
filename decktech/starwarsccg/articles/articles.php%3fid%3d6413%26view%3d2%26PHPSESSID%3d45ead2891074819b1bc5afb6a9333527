I had said that there would be no more than 5, and here are the 5 who were most recommended to me.  <br />
<br />
Ray Bordier - In the state of Pennsylvania, before there was Reid Smith, there was TJ Holman.  But perhaps even before TJ Holman, there was Ray Bordier.  A top notch trash talker at the table, Ray sometimes used his non-stop chatter to try and throw an opponent off their game.  While it is tough to know how much of an impact this might have had, there&#39;s no denying that Ray maintained a strong rating in some of the game&#39;s earlier years, and was a powerful force in the Coruscant Region.  Ray won the PA State Championship in 2000, but has basically been &quot;off the radar&quot; for the past 5 years.  <br />
<br />
Matt Sokol - A member of Team Albany, Matt&#39;s rating was usually not much to shout about, when compared to most of the team&#39;s other members.  Not only did both of the Twiggs, and Jonathon Chu, all keep ahead of him in the standings most the time, but so did Dan Sokol.  But in the year 2000, Matt made his name known to the entire world of SWCCG.  He won two grand slam titles that year, and defeated Yannick LaPointe to win the 2000 World Championship Event.  <br />
<br />
Reid Smith - Although Reid didn&#39;t enjoy a lot of success in the earlier stages of his career, he really came into his own as part of the &quot;New Guard&quot; mentioned earlier in the series.  By 2003, Reid was beginning to be recognized by big-name players as a potential threat.  By 2004, most people listed him among the top 5 players still in the game, and by 2005, he had become many people&#39;s favorite to win the World Championship.  Reid&#39;s accolades include a 2nd place finish at the Origins DPC in 2004, and a 2nd place finish at Worlds in 2004.  He also took 1st place at Origins in 2005, and was &quot;co-champion&quot; of the 2006 Corellia Regional Championship.  <br />
<br />
Chris Shaner - Chris is kinda like a miniature version of &quot;Mr. 2nd Place&quot;, Steven Lewis.  In the Tatooine Region, Shaner took 2nd place in a myriad of major events, of at least FOUR different types.  He placed 2nd in the 2003 Arizona State Championship, behind Brad Reinhold.  He placed 2nd in the 2002 Tatooine Regional Championship, behind Brian Hunter.  He placed 2nd in the I-10 cup behind Hayes Hunter, and placed 2nd in the 1st DPC Vegas behind Brian Hunter (where Chris battled through a field of over 70 players, including a semi-final win against Kyle Craft)<br />
<br />
&quot;Team Ohio&quot; - Okay, this is sorta cheating, because this technically puts the Honorable Mention list over 5 people, but nobody recommended any particular member of Team Ohio (they just said &quot;I would nominate Team Ohio, because they have done so much for the game in the last couple of years&quot;), so I&#39;m going to make this exception here.  Team Ohio&#39;s brightest moment was probably when they took 3 of the top 4 places at the 2005 World Championship Event.<br />
<br />
Alright then, on to the top 10!  Every player on this Top 10 list is a bona fide master of the game.  Let&#39;s get to it.<br />
<br />
#10 - Yannick LaPointe<br />
Like Dominic Gaudreault and Raphael Asselin, Yannick was another player based out of Quebec in Canada.  And he was surely the most successful player to come from the Great White North.  Yannick&#39;s best year would have to be 2000.  At the North American Continental Championship, Yannick was one of five players to finish the Day 2 swiss style at 5-1.  But his massive differential launched him into the final against Steven Lewis, where Yannick swept Steven 2 games to 0.  Yannick would go on to the World Championship event that year and finish in 2nd place, defeated by Matt Sokol.  On the strength of these two performances, Yannick began to be mentioned with the best players in the world.  2001 did not start off quite as well for him.  He attended the very first DPC, in Normal, but missed the top 4 with his 5-3 record.  He then went to Gen Con, where he had won Continentals the previous year, but dropped out of the tourney after a 3-2 start.  Yannick finally got himself back on track at the DPC Montreal, where he defeated Jonathon Chu in the final confrontation.  But when Decipher cancelled Decipher Con for 2001, Yannick considered giving up the game, and didn&#39;t prepare much for Freedom Con.  He eventually did decide to attend, but had a very disappointing finish, unable to even muster a winning record.  He would compete at Worlds again in 2002, but would again miss the top 8.  In November of 2002, Yannick was one of 3 elite SWCCG players (along with Brian Hunter and Bastian Winkelhaus) that Warren Holland signed into the Decipher Hall of Fame for their excellence in the game.  <br />

#9 - Steven Lewis <br />
So maybe you heard that Greg Shaw took 2nd place at Worlds on two occasions.  Maybe you heard that James Booker took 2nd place at a few events.  Maybe you heard that Chris Shaner took 2nd place at a few events.  But there is only one true &quot;Mr. 2nd Place&quot;, and that is Steven Lewis.  The number of significant events that Steven has taken 2nd place in is almost beyond belief.  A very strong player from Tennessee, in the Yavin 4 region, Steven was a long-time deckbuilding/playtesting partner of Clint Hays.  For whatever reason, Steven received the lion&#39;s share of the credit for the deck designs that the duo came up with.  Lewis is generally regarded as one of the best deck innovators in the game&#39;s history.  Some of the decks that he is best-known for include:  Speederholics Anonymous (a TIGIH deck that used swarms of T-47 Speeders to win battles), Monkey TIEs (a SYCFA TIE swarm deck that used TIE Vanguards), How to Cook a Chevin (a Hunt Down deck that featured the insert card 3720 to 1), and Invincible Court (although there was nothing particularly interesting or unusual about his Court deck, it remains a deck that people think of when they discuss Steven Lewis and deck designs).  Some of the many tournaments in which Steven Lewis has taken 2nd place include:  The Nashville Grand Slam, the Birmingham Grand Slam, the 2001 TN State Championship, the 2000 North American Continental Championship, the 1998 Yavin 4 Regional Championship, the 2000 Yavin 4 Regional Championship, and the 1999 World Championship.  Steven Lewis seemed to disappear from the game for the most part, from 2002-2005, but has recently resurfaced, and is expected to lead &quot;Team Tennessee&quot; into the World Championships in 2006.  <br />

#8 - Justin Desai<br />
Like Reid Smith, Justin Desai did not enjoy a ton of success in his early days.  But like Reid Smith, Justin was a big part of the &quot;New Guard&quot; when some of the elite players had retired and/or gotten lazy.  Justin attended the 2000 World Championship, but missed Day 2.  He attended two DPCs in 2001, but although he performed reasonably well in them, did not make the top 4 in either.  He then attended Worlds in 2001, but again was unable to get to Day 2.  In 2002, Justin placed 2nd at the Kashyyyk Regional Championship.  Things were starting to look up.  And then at Origins that same year...it happened.  The &quot;Kashyyyk Train of Dominance&quot; (KToD) was born, as Justin Desai and his partner Mike Gemme edged past 3rd place Hayes Hunter to play each other in the final confrontation.  After they split games 1 apiece, Mike Gemme has the better differential and wins the Origins event.  Justin would follow up this performance with another impressive 2nd place finish later that year.  At Freedom Con 2 in 2002 he went 5-1 during the swiss style, and took revenge on Gemme in the semis, advancing to the final against Brian Hunter.  The two would split games, but Hunter would take the win.  Justin would attend the 2002 World Championship, but he and Gemme would both miss the top 8.  The KToD was temporarily derailed.  But wait, there&#39;s more.  In early 2003, Justin attended the DPC in Chicago, and after charging through the swiss style undefeated, conquered Brian Fred in the Final Confrontation.  It was done.  Justin Desai had won a major event among a very strong field of competition, that included Jonathon Chu, Clint Hays and Brian Hunter.  And still he was not finished.  At Origins in 2003, Justin again finished the swiss style with a perfect record, and after knocking off Joe Gianetti in the semifinal, Justin advanced to the Final Confrontation of Origins for a 2nd straight year.  Justin again faced Brian Hunter.  They would again split games, but by exactly ONE differential point, Justin avenged his defeat at Freedom Con 2 and got his 2nd $500 payday of the year.  Desai carried this momentum into 2003 World Championship, and made it into the Top 8 playoffs.  But he was eliminated in the first round by Clint Hays.  Soon after, Justin Desai retired from SWCCG to pursue Upper Deck&#39;s VS card game.  <br />

#7 - Martin Akesson <br />
One of the best SWCCG players ever produced by the European continent, Martin Akesson possessed every ability you could want as a Star Wars player, and was one of the greatest &quot;multi-turn trackers&quot; in the entire world.  Despite living in an area of the world that was not exactly a hotbed of SWCCG activity, Martin was consistent enough to crack the World&#39;s top 10 rankings anyway, with a rating over 2150.  He also accomplished basically everything that could be accomplished in his part of the World.  Akesson won his Regional Championship in 1998, then repeated as Regional Champion again in 1999.  He would then take 2nd place in his Regional Championship in the year 2000.  He also won the Swedish National Championship in 2000, and won it again in 2001.  Not convinced yet?  Martin also won the European Continental Championship in 2000, and took 2nd place at the World Championships in 2001, knocking off Hayes Hunter in the semifinal before being bested by Bastian Winkelhaus in the Final Confrontation.  <br />
<br />
#6 - Kyle Craft<br />
Kyle Craft was a player in the Tatooine Region, Colorado specifically.  An understudy of Thaddeus Chenoweth, Kyle would eventually master SWCCG to a degree that few could match.  Though his playing style was much more aggressive than his mentor&#39;s, Kyle found ways to make it work.  And then make it work again.  And again.  Of course it took a while before Kyle&#39;s career really got going.  Not only was he held under Thad&#39;s heel for quite some time, but Kyle would also have some struggles against fellow Coloradan John Arendt, and was also consistently defeated by another Colorado player, Brian Hunter.   But one day everything changed.  At a tournament in Colorado Springs, Kyle used his Operative decks to cruise to a 6-0 record, defeating rival John Arendt twice in the process.  And also defeating his long-time tormentor Brian Hunter twice.  (It had taken more than a half-dozen attempts before Kyle was able to beat Hunter for the first time)  With two wins against John and two wins against Hunter in the same day, Kyle&#39;s rating began to skyrocket.  Soon he had not only passed John in the ratings, but had passed nearly everyone in the ratings.  Kyle became not just #2 in the state, and not just #2 in the Tatooine Region, but the #2 ranked player in the entire World.  Deadset on stripping his nemesis of the #1 ranking, Kyle continued to attend the same tournaments as Brian Hunter on a regular basis.  And Kyle would continue to have more success against Hunter than anyone else at these events.  After Hunter won the first several matches between them, the remainder of the games were split fairly evenly.  Kyle Craft has won more games of SWCCG against Brian Hunter than any other player in the world.  But suffering occasional defeats against other players in these tournaments (like John Arendt, or Tony Depa) while Hunter stubbornly refused to ever lose to anyone BUT Kyle, would be enough to keep Kyle from attaining the #1 spot.  Kyle had some of the longest reigns at the #2 spot that the game has ever seen, and he held the #2 spot on 3 seperate occasions.  And while holding down the #2 rank in the World so often (despite the presence of the #1 player in his own back yard) was Kyle&#39;s most impressive accomplishment, he also placed well at numerous major events.  Some of these strong finishes include:  2nd place at the Denver Grand Slam (behind Clint Hays), 3rd place in the Vegas Grand Slam, 4th place at the first DPC Vegas, and 3rd place at the 2000 World Championships.  Kyle also won the Colorado State Championship in 2000.  <br />

And holy crap this is long.  And I have a million things to do before I leave for Chicago.  I guess this article is going to be 4 parts.  I&#39;ll try to post the rest while I&#39;m in Chicago if I get enough time at a computer.  Thanks for reading, and I&#39;ll see you for the final 5.   <br />
