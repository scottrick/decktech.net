After some reflection I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that Business Admin and SWCCG are very similar. Furthermore, Ive taken my experiences in Business Admin and applied them indirectly to SWCCG to find a new direction for the game. Specifcally, in the ongoing effort to attract new players.<br />
<br />
There was a time when the prime business of business was to make a profit and product. There is<br />
now a prior, prime business, which is to become an effective learning organisation. Not that profit<br />
and product are no longer important, but without continual learning profits and products will no<br />
longer be possible. Hence: the business of business is learning  and all else will follow. Or as Reg<br />
Revans has noted: Learning inside an organisation must be equal to or greater than change outside<br />
the organisation.<br />
<br />
And what are some of the critical issues facing todays corporations?<br />
<br />
? Reorganisation, restructuring, and reengineering.<br />
? Increased skills shortages, with schools unable to adequately prepare for work in the twentyfirst<br />
century.<br />
? Doubling of knowledge every two to three years.<br />
? Global competition from the worlds most powerful companies.<br />
? Overwhelming breakthroughs of new and advanced technologies.<br />
? Spiralling need for organisations to adapt to change.<br />
<br />
Or as Shoshana Zuboff has written: The behaviours that define learning and the behaviours that<br />
define being productive are one and the same. Learning is the heart of productive activity. To put it<br />
simply, learning is the new form of labour.<br />
<br />
Learning in organisational settings in todays environment will represent a new form of learning in<br />
the following ways:<br />
<br />
1. Learning is performance-based (tied to business objectives).<br />
2. Importance is placed on learning processes (learning how to learn).<br />
3. The ability to define learning needs is as important as the answers.<br />
4. Organisationwide opportunities exist to develop knowledge, skills, and attitudes.<br />
5. Learning is part of work, a part of everybodys job description.<br />
The full richness of the learning organisation incorporates five distinct subsystems  learning,<br />
organisation, people, knowledge and technology.<br />
T<br />
1. Emergence of Learning Organisations<br />
The new species of organisations is called a learning organisation, and it possesses the capability to:<br />
? Anticipate and adapt more readily to environmental impacts.<br />
? Accelerate the development of new products, processes, and services.<br />
? Become more proficient at learning from competitors and collaborators<br />
? Expedite the transfer of knowledge from one part of the organisation to another.<br />
? Learn more effectively from its mistakes<br />
? Make greater organisational use of employees at all levels of the organisation.<br />
? Shorten the time required to implement strategic changes.<br />
? Stimulate continuous improvement in all areas of the organisation.<br />
Organisations that learn faster will be able to adapt quicker and thereby achieve significant strategic<br />
advantages.<br />
There are four major areas, which have changed profoundly over the last years:<br />
1. Economic, social and scientific environment<br />
? globalisation<br />

Fortunately, some of the same forces that created the changes in the environment and atmosphere<br />
can be used to build the learning organisation.<br />
2. The Systems-Lined Organisation Model<br />
A systematically define learning organisation is an organisation which learns powerfully and<br />
collectively and is continually transforming itself to better collect, manage, and use knowledge for<br />
corporate success. It empowers people within and outside the company to learn as they work.<br />
Organisational learning refers to how organisational learning occurs, the skills and processes of<br />
building and utilising knowledge.<br />
There are a number of dimensions of a learning organisation:1<br />
? Learning is accomplished by the organisational system as a whole.<br />
? Organisational members recognise the importance of ongoing organisationwide learning.<br />
? Learning is a continuous, strategically used process  integrated with and running parallel to<br />
work.<br />
? There is a focus on creativity and generative learning.<br />
? Systems thinking is fundamental<br />
? People have continuous access to information and data resources.<br />
? A corporate climate exists that encourages, rewards, and accelerates individual and group<br />
learning<br />
? Workers network inside and outside the organisation.<br />
? Change is embraced, and surprises and even failures are viewed as opportunities to learn.<br />
? It is agile and flexible.<br />
? Everyone is driven by a desire for quality and continuous improvement.<br />
? Activities are characterised by aspiration, reflection, and conceptualisation.<br />
? There are well-developed core competencies that serve as a taking-off point for new products<br />
and services.<br />
? It possesses the ability to continuously adapt, renew, and revitalise itself in response to the<br />
changing environment.<br />
The systems-linked learning organisation model is made up of five closely interrelated subsystems:<br />
learning, organisation, people, knowledge, and technology. If any subsystem is weak or absent, the<br />
1 This is a good example of the overgrown lists Marquardt sometimes falls prey to.<br />
effectiveness of the other subsystems is significantly weakened. Marquardt discusses each of the<br />
subsystems in their own chapters so I wont go into the details here.<br />
3. Building Dynamic Learning through the Organisation<br />
The learning subsystem is composed of three complementary dimensions:<br />
1. Levels of learning (individual, group and organisational)<br />
2. Types of learning (adaptive learning, anticipatory learning, deutero learning and active learning)<br />
3. Critical organisational learning skills (systems thinking, mental models, personal mastery, team<br />
learning, shared vision, and dialogue)<br />
Learning, ultimately, is a social phenomenon  our ability to learn and the quality and openness of<br />
our relationships determine what we can know. Our mental models of the world and of ourselves<br />
grow out of our relationships with others.<br />
Levels<br />
Learning in organisations can occur at three levels. Individual learning is needed since individuals<br />
form the units of groups and organisations, or as Senge asserts organisations learn only through<br />
individuals who learn. The factors that can contribute to individual learning in the organisation<br />
include:<br />
? Individual and collective accountability for learning<br />
? Locus and focus of individual learning (learning should have immediate application to the job.)<br />
? Accelerated learning techniques.<br />
? Personal development plan (people recognise that employers cannot guarantee them lifelong<br />
employment but that they can assist them in achieving lifelong employability. There should be a<br />
partnership between the organisation and the employee to assist in the long-term career<br />
development.2)<br />
? Abundant opportunities available for professional development<br />
? Individual learning linked to organisational learning in an explicit and structured way.<br />
Group/team learning means that work teams must be able to think and create and learn as an<br />
entity. They must learn how to better create and capture learning (learning to learn). A successful<br />
team learning system ensures that teams share their experiences with other groups in the<br />
organisation. Team learning will occur more fully if teams are rewarded for the learning they<br />
contribute to the organisation. Marquardt uses Watkins and Marsicks team learning model that<br />
shows the learning organisation as the union of individuals and organisation. The key is the overlap,<br />
which is where teams function.<br />
Organisation learning (1) occur through the shared insights, knowledge, and mental models of<br />
members of the organisation (2) builds on past knowledge and experience which depends on<br />
institutional mechanisms (policies, strategies, explicit models...) used to retain knowledge. Though<br />
organisations learn through individuals and groups, the process of learning is influenced by a much<br />
broader set of variables (for example symphonys performance is more than the sum of individuals<br />
knowledge and skills but the result of the know-how embedded in the whole group working in<br />
unison.<br />
2 This was one interesting thought.<br />
<br />
Types<br />
<br />
There are four types in which organisations learn:3<br />
<br />
1. Adaptive learning occurs when an individual or organisation learns from experience and<br />
reflection: action ? outcome ? results date ? reflection. Adaptive learning may be either<br />
single-loop (focused on gaining information to stabilise and maintain existing systems) or<br />
double loop (questioning the system itself and why the errors or successes occurred in the first<br />
place).<br />
2. Anticipatory learning arises when an organisation learns from expecting the future: vision ?<br />
reflection ? action approach.<br />
3. Deutero learning occurs when the organisation learns from critically reflecting upon its takenfor-<br />
granted assumptions.<br />
4. Active learning involves (a group/team) working on real problems, focusing on the learning<br />
acquired, and actually implementing solutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skills Marquardt has added Dialogue to the five critical organisational learning skills identified by Peter<br />
Senge:<br />
<br />
1. Systems thinking: A framework for seeing interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect<br />
chains, for seeing underlying structures rather than events, for seeing patterns of change rather<br />
than snapshots. Changes in one part of the organisation can affect other parts with surprising<br />
consequences.<br />
2. Mental models: An image or perspective of an event, situation, activity or concept<br />
3. Personal mastery: A special level of proficiency that is committed to continually improve and<br />
perfect skills, a discipline of continually clarifying and deepening ones personal vision,<br />
energies, and patience.<br />
4. Team learning: The process of aligning and developing the capacity of a team to create the<br />
learning and results that its members seek. The team involved must learn to tap the potential of<br />
many minds to become more intelligent than one mind.<br />
5. Shared vision: Provides a focus, direction and energy for the members of an organisation. And<br />
learning is a way of striving to accomplish that vision.<br />
6. Dialogue: promotes collecting thinking and communication.<br />
Top ten strategies to build learning subsystems:<br />
1. Develop action learning programs throughout the organisation (time and effort!)<br />
2. Increase individuals ability to learn how to learn<br />
3. Develop the discipline of dialogue in the organisation<br />
4. Develop career development plans for employability<br />
5. Establish self-development cash programs<br />
6. Build team-learning skills<br />
7. Encourage and practice systems thinking<br />
8. Use scanning and scenario planning for anticipatory learning<br />
9. Encourage/Expand diversity, multicultural and global mindsets and leanings<br />
10. Change the mental model relative to learning (most people retain a negative picture of learning,<br />
one acquired in their school days).<br />
<br />
3 It should be noted that there are several versions of this list in the book. For example the first list of this kind grouped<br />
the types of learning in a totally different manner that included additional types. In addition the names of the types<br />
change. The reasons behind these discrepancies are not discussed. This may be very frustrating to a student trying to<br />
memorise these for an exam.<br />
<br />
4. Organisation Transformation for Learning Excellence<br />
The organisation subsystem refers to the setting and body in which the learning occurs. The four<br />
key dimensions are vision, culture, strategy, and structure.<br />
Vision, a solid foundation of shared vision about learning, accompanied by recognition that unless<br />
the company becomes a learning organisation, it cannot achieve its vision. A shared vision provides<br />
the focus and energy for learning. It can lead multiple strategies and procedures into a common<br />
goal.<br />
<br />
Culture. The culture of most organisations is one of nonlearning, if not antilearning. Taking risks,<br />
trying new approaches, sharing information is discouraged. A successful corporate learning culture<br />
has a system of values that is supportive to learning.<br />
Structure . Although form should follow function, the opposite is often the case. The form or<br />
structure of many organisations prevents them from beginning corporatewide learning: rigid<br />
boundaries, bulky size, disjointedness of projects and tasks, and bureaucratic restriction. The<br />
structural characteristics of learning organisation are based on the need to learn; the driving<br />
organising principle is to put the necessary freedom, support, and resources in the hands of the<br />
people who need them:<br />
? Streamlined, flat hierarchy<br />
? Seamless, boundaryless, and holistic (boundaries inhibit the flow of knowledge, they keep<br />
individuals and groups isolated and tend to reinforce preconceptions, distrust, and bias.)<br />
? Project form of organising and implementing (the smaller size, quickness, and accountability of<br />
project teams encourage more efficient and more applicable learning.)<br />
? Networking (networks differ from teams or task forces in that they are not temporary, do not<br />
only solve problems that have been defined for them, but take their own initiatives, can make<br />
substantive operating decisions of their own.)=<br />
? Small units with entrepreneurial thinking (even big organisations are structured like and operate<br />
with a dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit similar to that of new, small companies.)<br />
? Bureaucracies are rooted out<br />
<br />
Top ten strategies for organisation transformation to learning:<br />
<br />
1. Hold a future search conference to develop vision of learning organisation<br />
2. Gain top level management support for becoming a learning organisation and for championing<br />
learning projects (financial and human resources need to be allocated to make the vision a<br />
reality)<br />
3. Create a corporate climate for continuous learning.<br />
4. Reengineer policies and structures around learning (policies and boundaries are minimised so<br />
that knowledge and ideas can quickly move within and outside the organisation).<br />
5. Recognise and reward individual and team learning. (That which gets rewarded gets done.<br />
Rewards should cover learning actions, such as risk taking, commitment to learning and<br />
personal mastery, teamwork, encouraging new experiences and ideas, being a teacher/trainer,<br />
and passing lessons learned on to team-mates and the broader network.)<br />
6. Make learning a part of all policies and procedures<br />
7. Establish centres of excellence and demonstration projects<br />
8. Use measurement of financial areas as a learning activity. (That which gets measured gets<br />
done.)<br />
9. Create time, space, and physical environment for learning. (People need time to plan and reflect;<br />
they need physical, social and mental space to listen and be creative. They need to take the time<br />
to listen.)<br />
10. Make learning intentional at all times and in all locations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Empowering and Enabling People<br />
<br />
People are the pivotal part of learning organisations because only people, in fact, learn. The people<br />
subsystem includes employees, managers/leaders, customers, business partners, and the community<br />
itself. Each of these groups is valuable to the learning organisation, and all need to empowered and<br />
enabled to learn.<br />
<br />
There are several principles to consider in the empowerment and enblement of employees:<br />
? Treat employees as mature, capable workers and learners<br />
? Encourage employee freedom, energy, and enthusiasm<br />
? Maximise the delegation of authority and responsibility (too many organisations have made<br />
employees accountable but have not empowered them.)<br />
? Involve employees in developing strategies and planning (empowered workers are able to make<br />
decisions as good as, if not better than, the decisions made by managers because the workers, in<br />
fact, possess the best information).<br />
? Strike a balance between individual and organisation needs (Better organisational results are<br />
built upon happy, productive individuals. Learning organisations are also conscious of the<br />
pressures on workers to meet both family and work obligations.)<br />
<br />
Managers/leaders need to move from controlling to empowering, from being a commander to<br />
being a steward, from acting as a transitional manager to acting as a transformational leader. <br />
<br />
The new leadership roles and skills required include:<br />
? Instructor, coach, and mentor<br />
? Knowledge manager<br />
? Colearner and model for learning<br />
? Architect and designer (of the learning organisation)<br />
? Co-ordinator<br />
? Advocate and champion for learning processes and projects.<br />
? Building a shared vision<br />
? Co-ordinating multiple, task-focused teams<br />
? Surfacing and testing mental models<br />
? Engaging in systems thinking (they must help people see the big picture, with the underlying<br />
trends, forces and potential surprises)<br />
? Encouraging creativity, innovation, and willingness to risk.<br />
? Conceptualising and inspiring learning and action.<br />
<br />
Conversations and information gathering from customers provide new knowledge for customers,<br />
after all, have expertise in what they do or buy.<br />
Business partners are to be included because companys success is dependent to a large extent to<br />
the success of its entire business network.<br />
Involving the community as a part of the learning process brings many benefits, it may, for<br />
example prepare potential future workforce and enhance the companys image.<br />
The top strategies for people empowerment and enablement in learning organisations:<br />
1. Institute personnel policies that reward learners.<br />
2. Create self-managed work teams<br />
3. Empower employees to learn and produce (informate workers with knowledge about financial,<br />
technical, and other data so that they can make wiser decisions)4<br />
4. Encourage leaders to model and demonstrate learning<br />
5. Invite leaders to champion learning processes and projects<br />
6. Balance learning and development needs of the individual and organisation<br />
7. Encourage and enhance customer participation in organisation learning<br />
8. Provide education opportunities for community<br />
9. Build long-term learning partnerships with vendors and suppliers<br />
10. Maximise learning from alliances and joint ventures<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowledge Management in Learning Organisations<br />
<br />
Knowledge has become more important for organisations than financial resources, market position,<br />
technology, or any other company asset. Individuals may come and go, but valuable knowledge<br />
cannot be lost or the company starves to death. The knowledge subsystem refers to the management<br />
of acquired and generated knowledge or the organisation. It includes the acquisition, creation,<br />
storage, transfer, and utilisation of knowledge.<br />
Acquisition: Organisations acquire knowledge from both external and internal sources. Companies<br />
can acquire information from the external environment through various methods, for example<br />
conferences, consultants, benchmarking other organisations, hiring new staff and collaborating with<br />
other organisations. Internal collection of knowledge means learning from what other parts of the<br />
organisation are doing.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that information acquired is subject to perceptual filters that influence what<br />
information the organisation listens to and accepts. In addition, acquiring knowledge is not always<br />
intentional.<br />
<br />
Creation of knowledge is generative. Marquardt refers to Nonaka and Takeuchis four patterns of<br />
creative knowledge production that happen at the transformations of tacit and explicit and<br />
individual and shared knowledge. The other mentioned knowledge creation approaches are action<br />
learning, systematic problem solving (current situation and problems), experimentation<br />
(opportunities and possibilities) and learning from past experiences (including failures).<br />
<br />
Storage and retrieval: In order to store knowledge, on organisation must first determine what is<br />
important to retain and then how best to retain it. Knowledge storage involves technical (records,<br />
databases, etc.) and human processes (collective and individual memory, consensus). <br />
<br />
The knowledge stored should be:<br />
4 An interesting example of the effect of added responsibility on absenteeism in a GM plant is provided. The added<br />
responsibility that also made workers more accountable is considered one of the main reasons that reduced<br />
absenteeism from 10-15 percent at other Gm plants to 2,5 percent at the plant in question.<br />
? Structured and stored so the system can find and deliver it quickly and correctly. (information<br />
will be retrieved by different groups of people in different manners)<br />
? Divided into categories such as facts, policies, or procedures on a learning-need basis<br />
? Organised so that it can be delivered in a clear and concise way to the user<br />
? Accurate, timely, and available to those who need it.<br />
The retrieval of knowledge may be either controlled (users trigger retrieval) or automatic (situations<br />
trigger retrieval).<br />
<br />
Knowledge transfer and utilisation involves the mechanical, electronic and interpersonal<br />
movement of information and knowledge both intentionally (memos, reports, training, briefings,<br />
tours, mentoring, etc.) and unintentionally (job rotation, stories, task forces, informal networks etc.).<br />
Four factors may limit the transfer: cost, cognitive capacity of receiving unit, message delay due to<br />
priorities of sending knowledge, and message modification or distortion of meaning either<br />
intentionally or unintentionally.<br />
<br />
Top ten strategies for knowledge management:<br />
<br />
1. Create expectation that everyone is responsible for collecting and transferring knowledge<br />
2. Systematically capture relevant knowledge external to the organisation.<br />
3. Organise learning events within the organisation to capture and share knowledge<br />
4. Develop creative and generative ways of thinking and learning<br />
5. Encourage and reward innovations and inventions<br />
6. Train staff in storage and retrieval of knowledge<br />
7. Encourage team mixing and job rotation to maximise knowledge transfer across boundaries<br />
8. Develop a knowledge base around the values and learning needs of the organisation<br />
9. Create mechanisms for collecting and storing learning<br />
10. Transfer classroom learning to the job (less tan 10 percent of the learning that occurs in the<br />
classroom is ever transferred to the job. This percentage can be increased by a deliberate<br />
strategy).<br />
7. Adding Technological Power to Organisational Learning<br />
The technology subsystem is the supporting, integrated technological networks and information<br />
tools that allow access to and exchange of information and learning. It includes technical processes,<br />
systems, and structure for collaboration, coaching, co-ordination, and other knowledge skills. The<br />
three major components are information technology, technology-based learning, and electronic<br />
performance support systems.<br />
Information technology is the computer-based technology used to gather code, process, store,<br />
transfer, and apply data between machines, people, and organisations. Information technology<br />
enhances knowledge transfer in organisations:5<br />
? It can improve the ability of people to communicate with one another, because it blurs the<br />
boundaries of the company and increases the range of possible relationships beyond hierarchies.<br />
? It makes it easier for people to communicate directly with one another across time and space.<br />
? It reduces the number of management levels needed; yet at the same time provides and<br />
enhanced potential for span of control.<br />
5 An interesting point: information technology is as much an organisational as a technical issue.<br />
? It contributes to flexibility, with mobile workstations, relational databases, and the storage of<br />
knowledge in open databases rather than in the minds of individuals.<br />
<br />
Technology-based learning 6 refers to the video, audio and computer-based multimedia training for<br />
the deliver and sharing of knowledge and skills away from the job site. The future learning<br />
environment will be modular (single skills), multisensory, portable, transferable (across languages<br />
and cultures) and interruptible. Technology-based learning will be under the control of the<br />
employee, because most jobs are becoming ever more complex and require higher levels of skills.<br />
In addition, the skill and knowledge mix required will be in a state of flux.<br />
<br />
Electronic performance support systems use databases and knowledge bases to capture, store,<br />
and distribute information throughout the organisation so as to help workers reach the highest level<br />
of performance in the fastest possible time, with the least personnel support7. The system consists of<br />
several components including, but not limited to, interactive training, productivity and application<br />
software, and expert and feedback systems. An EPSS can<br />
? Help improve the learners job performance, not just their knowledge<br />
? Provide this help just in time, when and where the worker needs it<br />
? Furnish instant access to information, methods, tools, and decision aides<br />
? Use computer technology to leverage the expertise of a coach or mentor<br />
? Accelerate on-the-job training and retention of learning.<br />
? Significantly reduce training time and cost.<br />
? Increase flexibility with worker assignments<br />
? Enable the organisation to train difficult-to-reach workers<br />
? Decrease paper documentation, such as user manuals, evaluations, and tests<br />
? Increase employee self-sufficiency and empowerment.<br />
Performance support systems can be either manual or electronic. Manual systems incorporate<br />
coaches and paper-based texts and tools. EPSS us computers to capture, store, and distribute<br />
knowledge throughout the organisation. According to Scott Levin, an EPSS should have nine key<br />
components:<br />
1. Competency profiles for each worker.<br />
2. Expert knowledge base<br />
3. On-line help<br />
4. Integrated training and job aids.<br />
5. Electronic integrated reference system<br />
6. On-line documentation (including any continuous improvements that the employees themselves<br />
devise)<br />
7. Monitoring, assessment, and feedback system<br />
8. Link to external applications<br />
9. System information<br />
An EPSS cannot work in isolation. There must be experts available who can provide advice beyond<br />
that of the computer. This combination of humans and machines blends creativity with vast<br />
information resources.<br />
6 Some of the discussion in this part was a bit off-the-ground and sounded more like a sales pitch than a result of critical<br />
thinking: <br />
<br />
The mind is cut off from outside distractions and ones attention becomes focused on the powerful sensory<br />
stimulation (light-sound matrix) that bombards the imagination. It becomes possible for ideas and mental images to float in and out of a persons consciousness. While in this highly euphoric mental state, the learning disc opens ones learning centres to peak receptivity while pouring in a new knowledge and skills. Huh!<br />
7 Here this definition comes again!<br />
<br />
Top ten strategies for technology application:<br />
1. Encourage and enable all staff to connect into the information highway (Internet)<br />
2. Develop multimedia, technology-based learning centres (CBT and CD-ROM are generally more<br />
effective for knowledge-based skills, and interactive technology may be most effective in<br />
behavioural training).<br />
3. Create or expand interactive video instruction8<br />
4. Use technology to capture knowledge and ideas from people within and outside the organisation<br />
5. Acquire and develop competencies in groupware and self-learning technology<br />
6. Install electronic performance support systems<br />
7. Plan and develop just-in-time learning system<br />
8. Build internal courseware technology and capability<br />
9. Develop awareness and appreciation of technology as a powerful tool for corporatewide<br />
learning<br />
10. Increase technological responsibilities of management and human resources staff.<br />
<br />
It is important to remember that one never fully is a learning organisation. Change always<br />
continues, as well as learning. <br />
<br />
The chapter presents the 16 steps taken by various organisations in<br />
order to become learning organisations:<br />
1. Commit to becoming a learning organisation.<br />
2. Connect learning with business operations (direct connections between learning and improved<br />
business operations makes it easier to persuade people)<br />
3. Assess the organisations capability on each subsystem of the systems learning model.<br />
4. Communicate the vision of a learning organisation (the most sophisticated vision is of no use<br />
unless it can be clearly understood by others)<br />
5. Recognise the importance of systems thinking and action (a company cannot become a learning<br />
organisation by focusing on just one subsystem or on one part of the organisation)<br />
6. Leaders demonstrate and model commitment to learning<br />
7. Transform the organisational culture to one of continuous learning and improvement<br />
8. Establish corporatewide strategies of learning (encourage experimentation, recognise and praise<br />
learners, reward learning, spread the word about new learnings, apply the new learnings)<br />
9. Cut bureaucracy and streamline the structure<br />
10. Empower (to possess the necessary freedom, trust, influence, opportunity, recognition, and<br />
authority) and enable (to possess the necessary skills, knowledge, values, and ability)<br />
employees. Significant resources of time, money, and people are allocated to increase<br />
employees skills not only in present job but also for future, unforeseen challenges.<br />
11. Extend organisational learning to the entire business chain<br />
12. Capture learnings and release knowledge (quickly throughout the organisation)<br />
13. Acquire and apply best of technology to the best of learning.<br />
14. Encourage, expect, and enhance learning at individual, group, and organisation levels<br />
15. Learn more about learning organisations.<br />
16. Continuous adaptation, improvement, and learning.<br />
8 Largely outdated by now.<br />
9. Rover  One organisations Journey to Success as a Learning Organisation<br />
<br />
A comprehensive case description of how Rover turned annual $100 million losses into large profits<br />
($56 million) in the early 1990s by deciding to become a learning organisation with a focus on<br />
total-quality culture.<br />
10. Building, Maintaining, and Sustaining the Learning Organisation<br />
<br />
Building a learning organisation may be difficult, but so is maintaining and sustaining it when it is<br />
operating. Many an excellent, even learning company has dropped from its high perch.<br />
It is preferable to begin building a learning organisation at the very top  to get top leadership<br />
committed. But it is possible to begin in any part that has the potential to affect the others. Start<br />
where the energy is! <br />
<br />
Things to consider include:<br />
? Work with the directors, managers, union and human resources department<br />
? Begin with a diagnosis<br />
? Raise consciousness and start with a company conference<br />
? Start with one department and Focus on one of the key business issues.<br />
<br />
Keys to a successful transformation into a learning organisation:<br />
? Establish a strong sense of urgency about becoming a learning organisation. The idea is to make<br />
the status quo seem more dangerous than the unknown.<br />
? Form a powerful coalition pushing for the learning organisation<br />
? Create a vision of the learning organisation. Without a vision, the effort can dissolve into a list<br />
of confusing and incompatible projects. Communicate and practice the vision. Remove<br />
obstacles (bureaucracy, competitiveness of individuals rather than collaboration, control. Poor<br />
communications, poor leaders, rigid hierarchy) that prevent others from acting on the new<br />
vision of a learning organisation.<br />
? Create short-term wins. Most people wont stay on the long march unless the journey has some<br />
short-term successes.<br />
? Consolidate progress achieved and push for continued movement. Declaring the war won can be<br />
catastrophiil changes sink deeply into the culture.<br />
<br />
Ten facilitating factors that support and sustain the learning organisation:<br />
1. Scanning imperative. Learning cannot continue without a solid awareness of the environment<br />
2. Performance gap. Performance shortfalls are opportunities for learning.<br />
3. Concern for measurement. Discourse over metrics is a learning activity.<br />
4. Experimental mindset. Support the practice of trying new things and being curious about how<br />
things work.<br />
5. Climate of openness. Debate and conflict remain acceptable ways of solving problems.<br />
6. Continuous education. One is never finished learning and practising.<br />
7. Operational variety. There is more ways than one to accomplish business objectives and work<br />
goals.<br />
8. Multiple advocates or champions.<br />
9. Involved leadership. Creating vision is not enough. Leadership at any organisational level must<br />
engage in hands-on implementation of the vision.<br />
10. Systems perspective.<br />
<br />
I hope you can draw the paralells between this and SWCCG. There are lessons here for all. The PC, the players, TDs and that untapped resource of potential new players.<br />
<br />
I know it was long, but I think its important we all learn about this for the sake and continuation of this great game.<br />
