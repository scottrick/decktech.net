Its not because theres more of them (though there is, 23:21), its because more of them are important. Anyway, I thought Id write an article detailing my thoughts on why I think some shields are never pack while others are never forget. Im no expert, and I wasnt playing the game at a high level when a lot of the tactics shields were designed to kill were around, so Id welcome feedback on my choices.<br />
<br />
Ill tackle them in alphabetical order, with text for completeness.<br />

<b>A Useless Gesture</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Cancels Don&#39;t Underestimate Our Chances. When opponent plays an Interrupt and has 3 smugglers on table, if that Interrupt is placed in Lost Pile, place it out of play. Ketwol may exchange a docking bay only once per game.</i><br />

Theres three potentially abusive strategies which this tries to curb and it only does a good job of curbing one . I think this card has killed Ketwol decks off so well that they should be seen in the same class as operatives  dead and completely buried. That final sentence is so powerful that its now essentially useless. It does a really bad job of stopping underestimate our chances and WYS, though. Because shields cant be played as a response, chances are if your opponent plays underestimate its too late and you better hope they havent got some nasty tricks up their sleeves cause the battle damage could be game ending. Few people pack multiples of underestimate, though, and pulling this as a pre-emptive action in case they  do have one seems like overkill, so that line doesnt justify playing the shield. And neither does the anti-wys/smuggler line. Not only can the WYS deck just keep themselves to two smugglers (eg luke, JK + backup on the ground, Han + R2 + falcon in space), they can still play from lost all the interrupts they played before having three on the table and any they lose to satisfy force loss. So the shield pretty much lives up to its name.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Play if youre thinking youre going to be playing vs WYS, because it might help a little bit. It won&#39;t make it an auto-win, though.<br />
<br />
<b>Allegations Of Corruption</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Once per game, may use 1 Force to stack one Interrupt just played here. To play any new Interrupt of the same name, player must first stack it here and use +1 Force for each Interrupt in stack, even if Interrupt is normally free.</i><br />
<br />
This is like the swiss army knife of shields because it helps shut or slow down so many potentially abusive strategies revolving around used interrupts, especially cycling high destiny ones. Sense, Barrier, Artillery, HDWGITM, ICBW, blaster deflection, hyper escape, might of the republic. The only problem with this card is knowing what interrupt to grab, but thats only because its so powerful.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Very close to an auto-play shield. It should be in pretty much every deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Battle Order</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Unless Battle Plan on table, for either player to initiate a Force drain, that player must first use 3 Force unless that player occupies a battleground site and a battleground system.</i><br />
<br />
Another extremely powerful shield, this does a great job of punishing un-balanced decks. The only reasons why you wouldnt play it is if youre pretty sure your opponent is going to pull battle plan on you (eg. Ralops speed flip) or if youre playing an unbalanced deck yourself and you dont want either of battle plan/order to hit the table. Even then you might want to keep it, cause it might hurt your opponent more than it hurts you.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Unless youre pressed for shield space in an unbalanced ground/space deck, this should be under your SE.<br />
<br />
<b>Come Here You Big Coward</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While you occupy a battleground and opponent occupies less than two battlegrounds, cancel: Asteroid Sanctuary, opponent&#39;s Force drains at non-battleground locations, and opponent&#39;s Force retrieval.</i><br />
<br />
One of 3 DS shields with no rough LS equivalent, its also one of the most powerful. The asteroid sanctuary text isnt so important anymore thanks to Asteroids Do Not Concern Me (v) which has largely superseded that card. The other part will win you games, though, by making it quite difficult for many types of LS decks to retrieve at all and cancelling both abusive LS drains (eg. Dagobah clouds) and non-abusive ones (eg. the LS takes over your hoth non-bgs or undefended death star and suddenly cant get some good drains out of it).<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Certainly in the top 5 and possibly in the top 3 most versatile DS shields, its close to an auto-play, especially if youre using non-bg locations in your deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Crossfire</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. S-foils and Maneuvering Flaps are suspended where you have either a weapon present or a starship (or vehicle) with maneuver > 3 present.</i><br />
<br />
Another non-mirrored shield but this time its closer to a never than an auto play. Not only is it unique and thus difficult to play if youre running the very good crossfire (v), it only suspends two (currently) unpopular effects under conditions which are by no means easy for a lot of decks to satisfy.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> One of the few DS shields I almost never consider packing. Only think about doing so if youre afraid of speeder or fighter swarms and have the necessary vehicle/fighters to satisfy this card.<br />
<br />
<b>Death Star Sentry (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Opponent must use an additional X Force to deploy a non-unique card (other than Jawa), where X = the number of copies of that non-unqiue card at that location.</i><br />
<br />
X-Wing or alien swarm is one of those tactics which have lots of bullets (eg. His name is Anakin) but which could make a resurgence if those bullets are sufficiently unlikely to be played, as Chus recent success with an x-wing swarm deck showed. This card does a pretty good chance of stopping the swarm, so if you can fit it or if you expect to see a swarm deck then its worth packing.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> A niche shield, but does a good job of stopping some potentially powerful LS decks which might otherwise be difficult to counter.<br />
<br />
<b>Do They Have A Code Clearance</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. If opponent just retrieved Force using an Interrupt or Utinni Effect, you may place that card here. Opponent&#39;s Force retrieval is reduced by X, where X = number of cards here.</i><br />
<br />
The final shield with no LS counterpart, its another pretty powerful one. Not only does it mean you dont need to use allegations to stop a retrieval card-retrieving-retrieval card loop (eg harvest, OTE) but it slows down the use of both multiples of similar retrieval cards and more general retrieval strategies like luke (v) or celebration, if they get a card stuck on here first. Its a good card, the only trouble is knowing if you should pull it before your opponent has played their retrieval card (hint: if they put owen/beru combo at the farm  pull it!). Finally, the effect version of this is pretty useful and a grabber to boot (cold feet (v) pulls it) so that will take this card out of some decks.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> A pretty versatile shield which you should be reluctant to leave behind.<br />
<br />
<b>Fanfare</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Cancels Order To Engage and Scramble. Once per game you may take any Immediate Effect into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. While opponent occupies no battleground systems, Staging Areas is suspended.</i><br />
<br />
Neither staging areas nor scramble are a big enough of a threat to play this card. Staging areas is much less versatile than mob points which might be why its almost never played anymore (unlike mob points) and scramble is both not particularly scary and never seen anymore. OTE is slightly more scary but some of the most abusive combos, like hyper escape, arconas and bo shuda have been curbed by cards like firepower (v) and cold feet (v). So the only time Id really play this card is if youve got an immediate effect in your deck.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Seldom needed, because many DS decks dont have any imm effects in them.<br />
<br />
<b>Firepower (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. If opponent moves from a location you occupy during your turn, they lose 2 Force. At end of opponent&#39;s turn, if you control two battlegrounds (a site and system) and opponent deployed a card with ability and did not initiate a battle, you may retrieve 1 Force.</i><br />
Definitely the most versatile (v) shield, even post-redux. Its got a great retrieval mechanism which, even if it doesnt retrieve any cards for you, can encourage your opponent to either do stupid things like battle you when they shouldnt or hold off deploying characters. And the anti-movement text hits a few common cards, like dodge, and other less common but potentially abusive ones like arconas.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Its not an auto-play, but it should be a serious contender for most decks, especially if theyre reasonably balanced.<br />
<br />
<b>Frozen Dinner (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Colo Claw Fish is canceled. Tawss Khaa affects Force drains only at her site. Once per game, may take Pinned Down into hand from Reserve Deck; reshuffle. While Ellorrs Madak (V) on table: limit one copy on table, replace each &quot;2&quot; in its game text with &quot;1&quot;, and opponent may retrieve Force only once per turn.</i><br />
<br />
A lot of text here. The first part is almost so powerful that its obsolete  the fish has barely been sighted for months now. The second part became a lot less necessary post-redux, because not too many people are playing Sergeant Doallyn (until he gets (v)-ed I guess). And the final part has <i>almost</i> obsoleted itself through its power (and the redux went a bit further by making tusken breath mask non-A). Still, AiTC and other Ellors-based decks can still be pretty mean, so its almost worth keeping around for that. Finally, pinned down (v) can be good against non-alien decks (cancelling dodge vs LSC or a speeder react at the right time can win you the game) so that card fits in your deck, then definitely you want this shield.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Its something of a niche shield, given that its only exceptionally useful vs Ellors (v) decks, but it still warrants serious contention in many decks.<br />
<br />
<b>I Find Your Lack Of Faith Disturbing (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While Deep Hatred not on table, opponent may only use 1 combat card per turn. While opponent has 2 Jedi on Naboo, you lose no more than 2 Force to Force drains at opponent&#39;s Naboo sites. We&#39;ll Handle This may only target droids and spies.</i><br />
<br />
The most useful part of this card duplicates the effects of resistance against Light Saber Combat (and some other) decks when less stringent conditions are satisfied. However, if your deck is likely to be able to set up resistance in the first few turns (eg sycfa), then you probably dont need this shield. If youre playing, say, a reactive mains deck vs LSC, though, then this is much more useful because not only will it mean you dont take crippling force loss while you set up your force, it will encourage a the LS player to spread out early to continue doing decent drains and then make it more difficult for them to clear your chars off naboo with either the finger of death or saber combat. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> This can be an important card if you either cant neuter LSCs drains from resistance/decree or if your deck needs to send Jedi vs a LSC player. But its kind of useless in a dark LSC deck<br />
<br />
Leave Them To Me<br />
<i> Plays on table. While you occupy a Subjugated planet location, operatives are forfeit = 0, operatives do not add to Force drains, and your Force drains may not be reduced. (Subjugated planet is defined on the Objective card Local Uprising.)</i><br />
<br />
This is the only card I didnt recognise, looking down the list of shields. Operatives are dead. The rules change, no escape and good DS counter cards like epp maul killed em. This card is utterly unnecessary in the present environment.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Yay, a shield you can safely leave out of absolutely every deck. I know someones going to go out and build an operatives deck to try and prove me wrong, but you know Im right :).<br />
<br />
<b>No Escape</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. At opponent&#39;s &#9674; site where opponent&#39;s creature present, you may deploy without presence or Force icons, and your Force generation there is +1.</i><br />
<br />
Almost as necessary as the previous shield. Even if it didnt have the creature restriction, it wouldnt be all that useful due to the popularity of the no escape effect. But given the popularity of that effect, no ones really going to be playing nudjs to <> sites unless they have no escape protection (Eg wys(v)) so this shields kind of pointless.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Another one thats safe to leave in the shoe box. <br />
<br />
<i>Oppressive Enforcement</i><br />
<i>Plays on table. Your Immediate Effects may play for free. Whenever opponent cancels your card with Sense or Alter, place that canceled card in Used Pile.</i><br />
<br />
A hugely versatile shield, theres only a couple of reasons why you wouldnt want to play it. If your deck has almost no interrupts or non-A effects (eg. Some RalOps) then its obviously not very useful. If youre playing a lot of Sense/Alter/Control yourself then you might feel confident enough to leave it out (but youll be kicking yourself if you lose a SAC war). But really, the only reason I wouldnt play it, unless I was extremely strapped for shield slots, is if I was using the TiNT/OE combo effect or was very confident that my hunt down objective was enough protection for me.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Close to an autoplay, but some decks might want to risk leaving it out. For most decks, though, that will be a big risk as a well timed sense or alter can really ruin your day.<br />
<br />
<b>Reactor Terminal (v)</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. You lose no Force to opponent&#39;s Boonta Eve Podrace. Opponent&#39;s Force retrieval from Boonta Eve Podrace may not be canceled. Unless opponent occupies more battlegrounds than you do, I Did It! is suspended. When played from Fear Is My Ally, does not count against your thrice per game limit.</i><br />
<br />
This is an interesting one. On the one hand, podracing is moderately common and quite abusive so this would seem a natural shield to pack. On the other hand, theres other ways of stopping pod damage (decree (v)) and this is very much a double edged bullet. If your opponent plays start your engines and you do have this shield, the most important thing is to not pull this effect until after they draw > 24 race destiny. Thats because they will most likely be relying on their race for retrieval, and even if you only threaten to disrupt that retrieval with CHYBC or secret plans (which cant be done once you play this), you will quite possibly cause them some mid-game headaches as they try to save up force and spread out characters to satisfy those cards. If your opponent cant satisfy those cards, its often best to not play the shield and just lose 6 cards from hand rather than let them have a 6 card injection, but that will depend on the game. Anyway, its a good way of stopping pod-racing damage (if played correctly) but it isnt necessarily in all decks and you wont want to play it every game vs pods anyway.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> If youre strapped for slots and face a choice between this or CHYBC/secret plans, then drop this. If you think you can set up a 3+ battleground imperial decree (v) by mid-game then you also probably dont need it. Otherwise, its a shield worth thinking about, unless youre playing pods yourself, in which case you should just win!<br />
<br />
<b>Resistance</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While you occupy at least 3 battlegrounds or opponent occupies no battlegrounds, you lose no more than 2 Force from each Force drain or &#39;insert&#39; card.</i><br />
<br />
This is a very versatile shield useful for shutting down decks like gungans, senate, EBO or matching sabers mains which like to drain for 4+ at a well guarded location. Its also a rough substitute for lack of faith (v), if you are able to occupy 3 bgs. <br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> This should be in most decks unless you have a deck which is unsuited to sitting at battlegrounds (eg. A very reactive deck or one which likes to play at non-bgs like walkers) or which has other reliable ways of stopping large drains (undercover spies, hit squads).<br />
<br />
<b>Secret Plans</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. If opponent is about to retrieve X Force, opponent must first use X Force or that retrieval is canceled. (X is equal to the full amount of Force allowed to be retrieved, regardless of the number of cards in opponent&#39;s Lost Pile.)</i><br />
<br />
If you dont play this, youll be kicking against so many different LS decks which use retrieval as a side strategy and if the LS has built their deck heavily around retrieval (eg. QMC) youll have a much more difficult game without this.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Almost the only reason why you wouldnt want to play this is if youre starting the Imperial Arrest Order/Secret Plans effect.<br />
<br />
<b>There Is No Try</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Sense and Alter are now Lost Interrupts. When any player makes a destiny draw for Sense or Alter, and that destiny draw is successful, that player loses 2 Force.</i><br />
<br />
A double edged sword and a very powerful shield for that reason. Its probably unnecessary if youre playing hunt down because your opponent wont be sense/alter-ing your cards that often. Its also usually a bad idea if youre running sense/alter yourself (but even then, if youre out-SACed then you might wish you had it). The direct damage also gets shut down most of the time by honor of the jedi (which is why some people still like TiNT/OE+no escape). Nevertheless, sense and alter will be a much less attractive option for your opponent if they have to send three cards to the lost pile to cancel one of yours.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Should be in many types of deck, but is a lower priority than oppressive enforcement in most cases because the damage can be prevented by HoTJ and it doesnt protect your cards, merely hurts your opponent.<br />
<br />
<b>Weapon Of A Sith</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. For opponent to steal a weapon from target character using a non-(Episode 1 icon) card, must first draw destiny. If destiny +1 > target&#39;s ability, weapon stolen. Otherwise, attempt fails and stealing card is placed out of play.</i><br />
<br />
This card isnt as useful as it might be because blaster rack (v) isnt played as often as saitor (v), perhaps due to better DS EPP options (Im looking at you maul) and the lack of a quick draw (v) equivalent. Due to that, weapon levitation isnt used by light players all that often, the main card this shield shuts down.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Weapon levitation can still be pretty painful (and might have a resurgence because it helps gets maces saber out post-redux) so if youre playing matching weapons then its probably worth using this shield. Just remember to pull it before battling.<br />
<br />
<b>We&#39;ll let Fate-a Decide, Huh?</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Cancels Frozen Assets and Beggar. Each player may play only one card with &#39;sabacc&#39; in title each turn. You may cancel an opponent&#39;s card with &#39;sabacc&#39; in title by losing 1 Force from hand.</i><br />
<br />
This shield has almost obsoleted itself by being so effective. Frozen assets and beggar are pretty abusive in conjunction with draw their fire, though, and certain decks (eg. Jedi presence tosche station) have taken advantage of the fact that many people stopped playing this shield. However, if the LS really wants to deplete your force pile they can play treva horne, so this shield might not be worth the slot. And sabacc is annoying, but not usually annoying enough to warrant either the slot or the shield pull.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> I hesitate to say it, but this is probably going to be shield #13 or #14 in most decks. If youre particularly concerned about a beatdown or sabaac deck you know is being played then you might squeeze it in, but its not versatile enough to put in usually.<br />
<br />
<b>Wipe Them Out, All Of Them</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. While opponent has a non-unique alien or non-unique starfighter in battle, opponent may not draw more than two battle destiny.</i><br />
<br />
Ive always thought this card was kind of random, but I guess it might be useful against WYS palace raiders. Other than that, I cant think of any decks built around non-unique chars/ships that draw 3+ destiny (gungans do 2, x-wings might do 2 at haven). In any event, preventing the third of 3 destinies against one particular WYS variant, which seems the most this card would do, doesnt seem a good enough reason to play it to me.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Unless youre quite certain to come against palace raiders, Id pass on this one.<br />
<br />
<b>You Cannot Hide Forever</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. If an &#39;insert&#39; card was just inserted or revealed, it is canceled.</I><br />
<br />
One of a bajillion bullets that killed inserts. Its probably not worth playing nowadays. Resistance is a more versatile shield and many decks play YCHF effect anyway, so they can use that if they smell inserts coming.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Its good vs inserts, but inserts are pretty dead and theres other ways of neutering them.<br />
<br />
<b>You&#39;ve Never Won A Race?</b><br />
<i>Plays on table. Unless opponent occupies three battlegrounds, I Did It! is suspended. If Sebulba&#39;s Podracer on table, your Force loss from Boonta Eve Podrace is reduced by X, where X = number of battlegrounds you occupy.</i><br />
<br />
Given that this has been almost completely superseded by reactor terminal (v), the only reason I could imagine anyone using this was if they were racing themselves and had a fear of losing the race.<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict:</b> Maybe think about it if youre racing, but otherwise forget it.<br />
<br />

The 8+8=16 in the first two categories means youre almost always going to have to make reasonably hard choices. This will be exacerbated if youre using the RefIII SE with interrupts, creatures or grabbers underneath it (most of the time youll only be able to include &quot;versatile&quot; shields). And, to finish off, heres my standard list of shields to put under Drop (v), in a deck which starts IAO/SP. These are what I find, at the moment, to be the most versatile 12:<br />
