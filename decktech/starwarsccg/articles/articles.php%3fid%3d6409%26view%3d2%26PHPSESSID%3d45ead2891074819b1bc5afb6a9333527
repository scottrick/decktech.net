<br />
Well, the name pretty much tells you what the articles will consist of.  A listing of the 20 SWCCG players who were either the greatest players, the most influential personalities, or a combination of both.  Here are a few things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1)  Since it is Greatest AND Most Influential, the players won&#39;t be ranked exclusively according to playskill.  In some instances, a player might end up ranked above a superior player because of what the 1st player meant to the game or the people who played it.  <br />
<br />
2)  However, &quot;Greatest&quot; IS given higher priority than &quot;Most Influential&quot;.  Playskill and/or deckbuilding expertise will be weighted more heavily than influence.<br />
<br />
3)  Anyone on the Top 20 should be proud of their standing, and not be insulted that they ended up at around #12 instead of around #6.  The game had tens of thousands of players.  Appearing ANYwhere in the Top 20 puts you in the top one-tenth of the top 1%, of all players to have ever entered a tournament.  No sense bickering about how so and so should be #4 instead of #7.<br />
<br />
4)  Especially since the list is based partly upon the opinion of just one individual.  Yeah, I&#39;ve considered ratings when making the list.  Yeah, I&#39;ve considered standings at high-level events.  Yeah, I&#39;ve considered head-to-head records between strong players.  And yeah, I&#39;ve considered first-hand testimonials about the players in question, from other people.  But in addition to all this, my own perceptions play a role in choosing which players are ranked where.<br />
<br />
5)  That being the case, yes, the list is biased.  I think it would be nearly impossible to make a list that wasn&#39;t biased.  At least for anyone who had ever played the game, or personally knew any of the players that would be on the list.  And anyone who didn&#39;t play the game, or know any of the players, would probably never compose such a list in the first place.  <br />
<br />
6)  All of the entries for the Honorable Mentions will be relatively short.  In the top 20, the entries will, on average, run longer.  Entries in the top 10 will probably run longer, on average, than 11-20.  However, some players&#39; entries will run longer than the entries of some players ranked above them.  This won&#39;t be due to the bias I&#39;ve admitted to in the previous paragraph.  Some players I&#39;ve seen play more than others.  Some I&#39;ve heard more about than others.  The more information I have about a player, the longer his entry is likely to be, regardless of his standing in the top 20.  <br />
<br />
7)  And yes, although I have not yet written the entries for the top 20, I do expect that my own entry will be the longest.  If ANY Player on this top 20 list were to create his OWN top 20 list, I fully expect that his entry would be the longest on his list.  Not because of his pride or his ego, but simply because he can&#39;t help but have more information and knowledge about his own experiences in the game, than he does in regard to any other player.<br />
<br />
8)  For the most part, I&#39;ll reference myself in the 3rd person.  To do otherwise would, in my opinion, interfere with any documentary-type-feel that the list could have.<br />
<br />
With all that out of the way, here are the Honorable Mentions.  Great or Important Players who did not quite make it onto the Top 20.  There are 20 Honorable Mentions.  They will not be in exact order (in other words, don&#39;t take this list to be ranked from #40 up to #21).  However, in general, the closer to the END of this article a player appears, the nearer he was to being included in the Top 20.  <br />
<br />
Honorable Mentions:<br />
<br />
Nick Jones - Dude!  This guy won Day 2 of &quot;Worlds&quot; one time.  If you don&#39;t believe it, just ask him, he&#39;ll tell you all about it.  He may have also beaten a good player in a team tournament once, although his team still didn&#39;t win the tournament, and the other player&#39;s team did.  <br />
<br />
David Irvine - Not a very well-known name, but a solid player from the Southeastern US with a consistently solid rating to back him up.<br />
<br />
Angelo Consoli - Angelo won the single largest 1st place prize in the game&#39;s history.  Few players had any idea who he was the year he won that prize at the &quot;World Championship&quot; event.  He wasn&#39;t much of a factor at the event the following year, and then wasn&#39;t really heard from again.  Nevertheless, winning the largest prize there has ever been would have to count for something, and even if he only won a cash prize 1 or 2 other times in his entire career (which may be the case, as there weren&#39;t a lot of high-profile events in his area), that victory alone would still place him among the top 5 cash earners in the game&#39;s history.  <br />
<br />
Jim Li - A very consistent player, usually playing in areas like Minnesota or Iowa.  The player base that he gained a lot of his experience against was VERY active, ensuring that he faced a variety of opponents, decks, and playstyles, all of which he was able to maintain a good rating against.  <br />
<br />
Justin Warren - With Matt Lush in Korea, Justin took over as the biggest name in the game for the state that is &quot;like a whole other country&quot;.  For some time, Justin was the dominant force in Texas.  He also placed 2nd at the Houston DPC, and was an all-around great guy in the eyes of the SWCCG community.  <br />
<br />
Don Kitzman - &quot;DPC Dan&quot; was a quality player from the Northwestern US.  He had a number of impressive showings in, as you might guess, DPCs.  <br />
<br />
Mike Gemme - While sometimes thought of as &quot;the other guy&quot; in the KTOD, overshadowed by his partner Justin Desai, Mike Gemme actually maintained a pretty good head-to-head record against Justin in the events they attended, and was himself a very capable player who was not to be overlooked.  Like Justin, Mike also had a sharp wit, and from what I can tell, was the target of numerous man-crushes from other SWCCG players who found him, in their own words...&quot;sexy&quot;.  Mike&#39;s famous virtual card, nicknamed the &quot;Gemmeperor&quot; posed a significant threat to LS senate decks until countered by the virtual Mon Mothma.<br />
<br />
Matt Lush - Unquestionably one of the most widely recognized names in the SWCCG community, the &quot;Old Skooler&quot; had also been regarded as a very powerful opponent in his day.  After returning from his stint in Korea, Matt made a return to the game, but didn&#39;t meet with tremendous success.  This did nothing to diminish his legacy however, as all of his old compatriots were just thrilled to have him back.  <br />
<br />
Andy McClure - Andy played the game for several years, but was not &quot;at the top of his game&quot; for most of that time.  However, when Andy really applied himself, and did play at the best of his ability, he was tough as nails.  Using decks that weren&#39;t always popular in the meta, Andy caught some opponents unprepared, then kept them on the defensive by playing error-free down the stretch.  <br />
<br />
Scott Lingrell - Scott is well-known for having designed some of the zaniest and most innovative deck concepts to ever see the table.  Stranger still, they actually won sometimes!  Scott boggled the minds of onlookers by even defeating the likes of Hayes Hunter on some occasions with his twisted ideas.  Best known for his RST racing deck, Scott was also behind the &quot;place your own Obi out of play&quot; TIGIH deck that Greg Shaw would use to take 2nd place in a &quot;World Championship&quot;.  There are probably innumerable other &quot;freak decks&quot; that Scott was the brains behind, and never credited for.  The SWCCG community was always curious to see just what he would come up with next.  Scott remains heavily involved in the game&#39;s future, currently serving as a Player Advocate in the PC.<br />
<br />
Mike Raveling - As part of the previously mentioned Minnesota scene, Mike was generally regarded as &quot;the guy to beat&quot; in his area, and maintained a consistently high rating in one of the most active metas in the nation.<br />
<br />
Eric Hunter - Although big brother Hayes usually kept him out of the limelight, Eric was a very strong player in his own right.  The virtual Wokling that he designed became a staple card in many LS decks.<br />
<br />
Martin Falke - In earlier times, Martin was generally regarded as one of the better players in the European Continent, and was very well respected by his peers there.  Martin had a flair for unusual card combinations that the opponent could not see coming but could still be crippled by.  He also achieved and maintained a high rating for years on end.  <br />
<br />
John Arendt - John is well-known for co-designing the AoBS deck entitled &quot;Dark Surgeon&quot;, along with Alex Tennet.  The deck long-remained one of the highest-rated submissions on Decktech, and was used in numerous tournaments for a long time to come.  John also was able to maintain a VERY high rating (2100+, and consistently ranked in the World&#39;s Top 15), despite the challenge of living in the same state (and often playing in the same tournaments) as the likes of Thaddeus Chenoweth, Kyle Craft, and Brian Hunter.<br />
<br />
Gary Carman - One of the few winners of the &quot;World Championship&quot; event that was never really accused of fluking his way into the title.  Even though very few people knew who Gary was before the World Championship he won, the quality opponents that he defeated en route to his win were quick to admit that, yes, this guy did know his stuff, and deserved to win the tournament.  Aside from being a quality opponent, Gary was also regarded as a quality guy to hang out with.  However, after his win at Worlds, Gary for the most part disappeared back into obscurity.  Who knows how high in the top 20 he might have been ranked had he continued to attend high-profile events.<br />
<br />
Steve Brentson - It is generally accepted as fact that Steve Brentson played the highest number of sanctioned games, of all the players to ever pick up a deck.  While this shows a tremendous amount of dedication to the game, it would not be, by itself, a huge accomplishment otherwise.  What makes this fact interesting is that Steve was also able to maintain an impressive rating year after year after year, even though he was playing more games than ANYone.  The rating system (like most other ratings systems) was designed so that a player&#39;s rating would become more and more reliable, the more games the player participated in.  This is probably why the only other statistic listed next to a player&#39;s rating, was the number of games he had played.  You see what the player&#39;s rating is, and then you see how certain you can be that the rating is accurate.  The more games played, the more you can be sure that the rating is well-deserved.  Making Steve&#39;s high rating as well-deserved as it possibly could be.  The only thing keeping Steve from the top 20 was that he consistently was unable to succeed against the vast majority of the players who WILL appear in the top 20.  <br />
<br />
Raphael Asselin - Raphael was the very first winner of the &quot;World Championship&quot; event.  He is also held in high regard by the other members of his Quebec-based playing community.  <br />
<br />
Brian Rippetoe - Brian was never really one of the most famous players in the game, and didn&#39;t win a lot of prestigious titles.  But he played simple, solid decks, and played them better than his opponents did.  He maintained a consistently high rating while playing in an area that contained some of the game&#39;s top 10 players, and no matter how good you were, if you were paired against Brian Rippetoe, you best have been prepared for a fight, and would be foolish to underestimate him.  <br />
<br />
Dominic Gaudreault - In an area that contained names like Raphael Asselin and Yannick LaPointe (and Patrick Dinelle?!!), Dominic was still able to establish himself as a force to be reckoned with.  Dominic had one of the quickest rating-climbs the game has ever seen, and then had a good showing at a &quot;World Championship&quot; event, and then...seemed to stop playing.  If Dominic had continued to play, and continued to succeed, he might have cracked the top 20, or maybe even the top 10, but the SWCCG community was never certain that he was more than the proverbial &quot;flash in the pan&quot;, since he played SO few games.  If Brentson&#39;s rating was the best-proven in the world, then Dominic&#39;s was among the least-proven.  We&#39;ll probably never know for sure whether he would have become the fearsome player that it appeared he might.  <br />
<br />
Paul Myers - Paul held one of the highest ratings in the world, for years on end.  Paul basically lived in the top 5 of the World, spending a lot of time in the #3 slot.  He dominated the other players in his state, and for the most part, his entire region.  And when attending major events in other regions, Paul proved that he was more than just a big fish in a small pond.  Paul misses the top 20 by the narrowest of margins, due to the fact that he was usually unable to take 1st place in those major events.  Cut short by the elite players, who he could not quite overcome.  <br />
