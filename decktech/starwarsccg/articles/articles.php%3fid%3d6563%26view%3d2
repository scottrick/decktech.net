<br />
SWCCG has been around since 1995.  It&#39;s nearing it&#39;s 13th year anniversary this December, and while the game was lost by Decipher 7 years ago, it&#39;s still moving along nicely thanks to the extra effort by the PC.  With virtual set 16 closing in, weve had to sift through 3,000+ cards to meticulously compile the best 60 card decks possible.  <br />
<br />
Although newer sets inevitably produce more powerful cards and strategies, theres been several timeless classics that have survived from when they were released until now (and likely for years to come).  I have compiled 5 of the most prominent cards from only the eldest of sets:<br />
<br />
1) Imperial Barrier / Rebel Barrier (Premiere)<br />
Surprisingly used sparingly in my local meta when I started playing during Premiere, it gained popularity exponentially shortly after.  Thanks to Dagobah and Asteroid Sanctuary, these cards almost always make the serious consideration list when thinking of those last few cards to add to your deck.  Used interrupt, destiny 4, and only 1 force to use, it has very little drawbacks.  Add in the moderately uncommon/ineffective counters, and you have a great card.<br />
<br />
These cards alone have caused opposing players to seriously consider their options when it comes to their deploy phase.  Seeing your opponent save 1 force in their force pile has always been reason enough to become paranoid that a barrier is eminent.  These cards have become so prominent, that just saving 1 force is often times enough of an effective bluff to cause your opponent alter their strategy.<br />
<br />
Although they seem straight forward enough, theres certainly a skill in choosing your targets.  Preventing forfeit fodder from joining a battle, trapping a starship bound for a non-battleground in front of your armada, or setting up a nasty Order To Engage trap, the possibilities are endless.<br />
<br />
2) Monnok / Grimtaash (A New Hope)<br />
The bane of certain players existence (*cough* Hunter *cough*), these cards are undoubtedly game changing when used correctly.  Both used and lost functions can literally swing the tide of the game in one swift action.  We all have stories of spending 4 force and causing your opponent to lose 8+ cards from their hand, and essentially the game with them.<br />
<br />
Since the release of these cards, the question How many cards in your hand? has never caused so much fear in a players eyes.  If you reply with anything more than 12, you know youve just put a huge bulls eye on your hand that screams MONNOK ME!  Even when your hand count is seemingly safe at under 13, you immediately have to start wondering whats the fastest way to get rid of any duplicates that are doomed to be lost if your opponent is savvy enough to spend 4 force.<br />
<br />
Despite their destiny of 2, these cards are simply amazingly.  They have the ability to either destroy your opponents plan should they be too greedy, or you can spend 4 force and see what tricks they have up their sleeve and possibly catch some nasty duplicates in tow.  Since many decks play copies of important cards, the odds of catching them with crucial cards is just that more likely.  The bonus of being Holotable compatible makes them that much sweeter.<br />
<br />
Just like Imperial Barrier / Rebel Barrier, its incredibly easy to bluff your opponent, causing them to stop drawing cards in to their hand.  Asking how many cards they have in their hand, or counting out 4 force at a time while looking contemplative is enough to cause some serious unease.<br />
<br />
Grimtaash is the sole reason I made it to Worlds in 98.  A well timed used Grimtaash prevented Joseph Floyd from setting up what would have been a game ended Dark Deal the next turn.  Needless to say he was visually upset as I threw it out as my last action of my turn, smashing any hopes to make it to Worlds himself that year.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Limited Resources (Premiere)<br />
Thanks to the cumulative clarification, this card went from retarded powerful to just overly powerful.  An additional thanks to Shot in the Dark causing an errata for single uniqueness, and this card dropped again to just straight up powerful.  Nevertheless, this card just screams tech.  This is the only card on the list that can realistically go in every DS deck no matter what the other 59 cards are.<br />
<br />
Although it can be played early to mid game with assured effectiveness, its that late game moment when you really can cause the most damage.  When the LS is getting low on life force and theyre holding on to those last few precious cards in their hand, losing 4 additional force is just painfully huge.<br />
<br />
Even when played during the LS players turn, it can be amazingly effective.  LS player tracking a destiny and has to activate just the right amount of force?  Play make them lose two force, many times making them have to decide to either toss that tracked card off the top, loss precious force, or a card in their hand theyve been saving for just the right moment.<br />
<br />
Although its a lost interrupt, it has a solid destiny of 5 and few effective / common counters.  There is a drawback in that the cards power comes from proper setup, which often times boils down to the wielders skill level.  Its so tempting to lose this card early game when your opponents hand appears to be as far from empty as possible.  Skilled players will hold on to this golden nugget for an hour, closing the door on their opponents hopes to pull out a victory.<br />
<br />
4) Were Doomed (Premiere)<br />
With the popularity of 3PO and R2 as the sets were released, this card saw more and more use.  Its one of those cards that would seldom get a second look by a new player, but experienced players know just how important this card can be.<br />
<br />
As the game progressed, force drains waned from effectiveness while direct damage and little pings here and there became more prevalent.  Insurrection / Mobilization Points brought docking bays to the limelight as common force drain locations, often topping out at just 1.  Objectives and effects now helped augment the damage potential of a deck rather than relying on force drains.  Were Doomed combined with R2 or 3PO (both of which are easily deployable in many LS decks) basically takes away any damage the DS can produce.  Combined with an It Could Be Worse, Menace Fades, or Jedi Test 1, and the LS player can handle a full turn of drains, Objective direct damage, Occupation effects, etc. without a sweat.  This card can effectively shut down any damage a DS player can produce.<br />
<br />
Its a destiny 5 used interrupt, which is amazing in its own right.  With some minor tricks, its easy to track and be played every turn without fail.  Its easy to just use Threepio With His Parts Showing to nab it every turn.  He even works with the card on his own, who wouldve thought?  Getting R2 or 3PO on the table is usually a simple task, especially by end game.  Just drop them down somewhere safe and theyll many times be untouched all game.  A final bonus is that since you can only play it when you have less than 15 life force, the odds are that your opponent will have already spent their grabbers on the plethora of other highly effective interrupts the LS has at their disposal.<br />
<br />
5) Ghhhk / Houjix (A New Hope)<br />
Yuck, a destiny 1 lost interrupt?  It must be exceptionally potent in order to make the cutit is, it does, and it has for years and years.  Ever since this card has been released, people have put it in their deck.  When released, it unquestionably changed the way we approach the game.  It has since changed would be beat downs to minor inconveniences at the expense of your opponents hard saved force and battle crew, essentially causing them to lose a full turn just to make you to lose 1 force from your hand.<br />
<br />
As both sides gained more and more powerful, getting 25+ power with 5 battle destinies and excluding / instantly killing 2 of your opponents characters all in the same turn became a real and common possibility.  Clash of the Sabers, Sorry About The Mess, Dr. Evazan, etc., all helped strand a meager force of characters at a site for a game ending beat down.  Thanks to Ghhhk and Houjix, you didnt have to worry about spreading out and losing the game.<br />
<br />
As the game progressed, alternative uses became evident.  Suicide squads powered by Scum and Villainy and First Strike allowed for healthy force retrieval while removing an opponents key character and causing a direct damage of 1.  Again, bluffing came in to play as players would avoid going all out against a weak force for fears that their efforts would be in vain should their opponent have this common card in their hand.<br />
<br />
Despite the low destiny and the fact that theyre lost, theyre immune to sense and have no direct counters.  It wasnt until Draw Their Fire / First Strike when their effectiveness was ever challenged.  Although Frozen Assets helped turn Ghhhk in to a false failsafe, the power combo has since been toned down with several counters.  Both Ghhhk and Houjix find their way in to multitudes of decks of varying themes.<br />

Honorable Mentions<br />
<br />
Sense, Alter, Control <br />
SAC has always and always will be mainstays in top tier decks.  Although theyre popularity is unquestionable, they did not make the top five because they really are brainless in their uses.  Theyre only use is to cancel other influential interrupts and effects.  So while theyre certainly powerful, they do not do anything in their own right.  Add on the countless counters (Do or Do Not, Wise Advice, Objectives, etc.), and they have gone from upwards of 20 in a deck, down to nearly 0 in the last few years.<br />
<br />
Revolution<br />
Much too powerful in the early stages of the game, its effectiveness has finally been toned down to reasonable levels.  This card was the core to so many powerful beat down decks that would often end the game in just one battle.  Its uses went far beyond that though, and ultimately made it in to several types of decks.  The Throne Room Mains and Revolution combo was cause enough for a DS player to essentially be force starved for too many turns to do anything effective the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
With all of the pullable battlegrounds and faster speed to the game, Revolution just isnt what it used to be.  Force is no longer as precious as it once was, and lucky starting hands arent needed to defeat an early barrage of Revolutions.<br />
<br />
I can recall using Revolution on Yodas Hut more than any other location in the game.  A an contested force drain of 2 was just amazing.  Good times<br />
<br />
Mantellian Savrip<br />
The original Houjix, this card still has uses.  Not having to lose the battling cards on the table is a huge benefit over Houjix which has a one time use before it hits the lost pile.  The LS player can effectively hit a character and clear another with attrition using just EPP Obi-Wan while losing unnecessary cards from their hand to satisfy and overflow damage and attrition.  Exceptionally powerful once up and running, it can be an unavoidable thorn in an unprepared DS players side.<br />
<br />
Too easily canceled by Masterful Move, a common recycling destiny 6 (pull both Monnok and Ghhhk to boot), Savrip has suffered in effectiveness.  Too often will the LS player rely on this effect only to suffer a mid battle Masterful Move or Alter, causing the forfeit fodder in their hand to be worth just 1 card as they damage overflow from the battle ends the game prematurely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats all for now.  I skipped over many cards, but perhaps Ill make a part 2 if this is well received.  Hope you enjoy!<br />
