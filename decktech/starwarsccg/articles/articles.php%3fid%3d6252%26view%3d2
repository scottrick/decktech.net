What can I say?? I love writing about SWCCG. The inspiration for this article has come from many former players contacting me about getting back into the game. I have written many articles about increasing your player base and helping to teach new players, but I have yet to write one about what former players need to do to get back into the game. Many players quit before many of the Decipher sets were released. Now that there are over 10 Virtual sets, many players find it overwhelming to try and jump back in having been gone for years. Having been one of those players myself back when I returned to the game, I decided to help all those former players out by giving them a guide to what cards to buy, what some newer cards do, and what the best way is to return to the tournament scene. I believe I am a great example of a player who returned with a lot to catch up with, and can now say I am back to the competitive level I once was.<br />
<br />
This article is a very special one because in the beginning, the majority of you that are going to read it are already going to know literally everything I say. I took the time anyway because I believe this is an article that needs to be on the PC website for any former player who is interesting in getting back in. We are always looking for more players, so it just made since that we do all we can to help get anyone who loved the game to return with confidence. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*****WARNING****** <br />
From this point on, if you are a current player and dont want to waste your time please stop reading. I created this completely for returning players. Nothing in the article will be teaching you anything you dont already know. I urge you to simply stop reading and not rate this article low because you didnt learn anything. If you simply want to know how I did on the article, please feel free to continue. But I dont want all of these low ratings from old current players who have known all of this for the past 3 years. <br />
************************<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, so where to begin. What would you tell a former player who wants to get back in?? From my conversations, it seems to me that many players quit at all different time periods, but the majority are those that quit somewhere between Endor and Coruscant. I know that some quit before or after that, but I am only going from who I have talked to. I myself quit a few months after Tatooine was released. I had never even read one card from Coruscant. So when I came back to the game, I had a lot to read and understand. It was almost too much. I know that some of you are feeling the same way. You want to return and relive that feeling of winning a tournament or maybe just beating your good friend, but you feel like it is too hard to be worth it. Well, that is what this article is going to fix. In this article I decided to just answer the five most commonly asked questions in great detail all at once. Then I added a list of Episode I cards that are needed for any returning player to be competitive. Finally, I ended by listing out the more popular V cards from each set to save you some time with read all of them. This should provide a simple and stress free approach to getting back into SWCCG.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Top 5 Questions I Hear from Former Players:<br />
<br />
1)	What are Virtual cards, and why do older cards have that (V) thing next to them on players deck lists?<br />
2)	What are Defensive Shields, and how do they work?<br />
3)	What is the deal with the Players Committee or PC?<br />
4)	How do I get back into the game and find players in my area?<br />
5)	What cards do I need to buy?<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I bet some of you older players reading this are saying, No way are players asking about all that stuff, doesnt everyone know all that? Well, the truth is that every player is different. The players that quit way before Death Star II and didnt continue to play card games have no idea about Decipher losing the license. All they do is open their very old Decktech account and begin reading decks that dont make any sense with those (V) things next to them. Think about how very different the game is with V cards and Shields. The whole process of even building decks is no where near the way it used to be. This blindness to current players is why so many former players find it scary to return to this game. Thats why this article is a very important tool for the PC for any player wanting to return who is feeling lost and confused. <br />
<br />
So lets breakdown all of those questions so older players can feel welcome to the new Star Wars CCG. <br />
<br />
<br />
1)  What are Virtual cards, and why do older cards have that (V) thing next to them on players deck lists?  <br />
<br />
Virtual cards are simply new game text of former cards. Because the game is controlled by the players, we have no way of creating new cards for the game. So the Virtual cards can be made to replace the text of already existing cards, that way the players dont really have to purchase anything new. All they have to do is go to the swccgpc.com website and print them off. Then just cut out the card and place it in the sleeve in front of the old text. You could also get some double sided tape to permanently change the text of the card. Some players also choose to use rubber cement for the higher end cards so as not to damage them. These new Virtual texts are not considered an errata of the card. You are still able to play the non Virtual version of the original card. The new text is simply giving you a choice depending on your decks strategy.  <br />
<br />
As far as that (V) symbol, to keep players from having to say Use the Luke Skywalker Virtual text, the new lingo for letting players know which version of a card to use is to simply call it Luke Skywalker (V). The (V) is all that is needed for all current players to know what you are talking about. Anyone currently playing knows that the (V) behind any card means that the Virtual text is being played. Usually now a days, you would only see specific versions of cards as their (V) version because any older player would know that the non (V) version is usually not even worth looking at let alone putting in a current deck.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  What are Defensive Shields, and how do they work?  <br />
<br />
You would seriously not believe how many former players have completely no idea what Defensive Shields are. I myself had no idea how they worked or what to do with them. The only thing you probably noticed was they were the same card as those you used to play in your deck. Well, you are exactly right. A Defensive Shield is pretty much the exact same card that used to be played in your deck as a counter for whatever powerful card you might have to face. Any deck that feared Sense or Alter had to play the Wise Advice and Do or Do Not effects, or after Reflections 2, you could play with the Combo. It was almost a standard for any deck that didnt have SAC already in it. As Decipher left the game, they created these shield cards to help decks to be built with less slots being taken up by so many different counter cards. So now you can find the same cards like Wise Advice in the form of a Defensive Shield. Only it may have part of its original text missing, like the adding one to training destiny is no longer on the shield version of the card. Think of all the many really scary and powerful cards that you used to have to counter against. Now you have a shield to help give you more room in your deck for your strategy. They give you all the counters you might need in one place, and the great thing is they dont count toward your deck total. <br />
<br />
They work with a new card type introduced in Reflections 3 called the Starting Effect (SE). The first of these were Fear is My Alley for Darkside and An Unusual Amount of Fear for Lightside. The Defensive Shields are placed underneath the SE unseen by either player. The SE is the only card you count as part of your 60 card deck total and is played at the beginning of the game when you are putting out your starting stuff. When you choose, you may play a shield from underneath the SE on the table. It acts like an effect putting whatever its text says into play the moment it hits the table. The difference is you are not limited to a specific phase when choosing to play one. It could be your very first action of the game before you even activate your first force or anytime during your opponents turn. The strategy for playing shields is that the SE limits how many shields you may play in a game. The original SE I mentioned only allow 3, but a newer SE was released in V set 8; Drop (V) for DS and Thrown Back (V) for LS (both are uncommon cards from Coruscant). These Starting Effects let you play 4 on the table in a game. The difference in the V and the Ref 3 SEs is that only the Ref 3 SEs allow you to play cards from underneath them. The V designed SEs state that only shields may be played. If you build a deck and want to use specific V cards that allow you to play cards from underneath your SE, you have no choice but to play with the Ref 3 versions. Oh, there is also a third Starting Effect; Sudden Impact (V) for DS and Ineffective Maneuvers (V) for LS out of V set 5. They were created to be used in the Classic tournament format so that you would still be able to play shields. They are very restricted and cause you to lose 2 to play a shield. These SEs are not at all a good choice for any major tournament, but a must for anyone playing in a Classic format.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, the shields themselves are still unique versions of the effect they used to be, so if one is on the table, you may not play the same effect even if the V version makes the card a totally different game text. Example would be Ultimatum (V) from V set 8. If you are playing with this card in your deck, only the shield or the effect may be played on the table.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  What is the deal with the Players Committee or PC?<br />
<br />
The Players Committee was created by Decipher to carry on the administration aspects of the game when Decipher lost the license to make SWCCG in December of 2001. This includes creating cards, updating rulings, and organizing prize support for local and major tournaments like States, Regionals, Nationals, and Worlds. They are the main engine of the game now, and the sole reason it has continued since January 2002. The whole PC is made up of volunteers who love the game and want to keep it alive so all of us loyal fans can continue to enjoy playing with fresh ideas and strategies. To help players to learn and grow with the new SWCCG, the PC has created a website that includes all virtual card sets, announcements, articles, deck lists, and a current player message board where you can continue to talk with current players. The website is www.swccgpc.com and is totally free to be a part of. When you visit the site, make sure to look around all the many links at the vary top of the screen. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4)  How do I get back into the game and find players in my area?<br />
 <br />
The key to getting back into the game is by first going to the PC website and printing out ALL the current Virtual sets. They are all free in PDF format and will easily pull up on any computer that has Acrobat to be printed out. After you have all the V cards, the next thing to do is figure out how far behind you are with the Decipher made cards. If you quit at Endor, then you will need to get some cards from Death Star II, Reflections 2 & 3, Tatooine, Coruscant, and Theed Palace. Of course, there is no real need to just poor a whole lot of money into this game. The great thing is that you can literally find any card you need on www.ebay.com. Ebay is the other reason that players are able to continue to play this game with no current card stores carrying SWCCG.  You are able to go and buy any and all cards you need for any deck at any time. Another great website for getting singles that you really dont want to wait on is www.thecardvault.com. They have an excellent selection of SWCCG singles from all sets, some more than others, including most of the Defensive Shields from Reflections 3. The best part about them is the shipping because it literally only takes two days to get an order placed on Monday if you use an automatic payment.  <br />
<br />
Once you have the cards you need to build a reasonability current deck, the next thing to do is find players to play. Now this is probably the hardest part of getting back into the game because you have to have someone to play against. The key is to first check the PC and Decipher website for tournaments. You can look for posts of tournaments all over the country many months in advance. That was the way I got back into the game. I decided to check the Decipher website under the Find a Tournament page just like I did way back when, and I saw that my local store was holding tournaments again. I decided to go and play even though I didnt own a single card past Tatooine and didnt have a single V card in my decks. By showing up to the tournament, I was able to get the phone numbers of all the local players that still played the game. Since then, we have continued to get together and play for fun as well as run tournaments every single month. The PC website message board can provide you will all current players in your area. You can even post an announcement that you are looking for players in your city or near your city. <br />
<br />
Now I know that not everyone is as lucky as I was to have a store that still had tournaments, but that doesnt mean you yourself cant take the initiative to get them going. Even if you only have two players at first, if you are posting tournaments in your area. In time, players will begin to show up because they will do exactly what I did and see that you are hosting tournament again. The tournament is the most important aspect to getting players back into the game. From there, you can always try and contact former players just to play a few fun games. You will be surprised at how much many players miss playing this game. Finally, you can always take it upon yourself to teach new players. It is the hardest to do, but you hold the key to how many players you want to play with. Try checking the local card shops for card players. Some will be open to learning the game and if you already know how to play the game they are playing, you can easily teach them by comparing the two games mechanics. When you are ready, you can make plans to compete in qualifying tournaments for Worlds, which is held in August every year at GenCon. <br />
<br />
Lastly, with the game the way it is, you now have the opportunity to win a tournament and earn the right to design your vary own Virtual card. Never before would Decipher have allowed the players to create cards, but now with the game in the hands of the players. You can create a completely original game text for ANY card that has not been Virtualized. Of course, the tournament you are playing in has to be announced that the prize is a V card design. Some special V card tournaments may have a few restrictions on what type of card and which sets you may use. Any major tournament like States, Regionals, Nationals, or even Worlds will not have any of those restrictions. Of course your card has to be approved by the PC and in some cases the players themselves on the message board (Biker Scout Gear).  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5)  What cards do I need to buy? <br />
<br />
The hardest part about being out of any card game for any amount of time is deciding what cards to buy. The key is not to feel like you need to buy everything you dont have. As I mentioned, I didnt own a single card from any set released past Tatooine. I had to do a lot of catch-up and it did take time to get the where I was when I quite. All I can say is the easy thing to do is simply find a deck type that you want to build and just purchase the specific cards on either ebay or thecardvault websites that you are missing. Then as you begin to see how different decks are playing and what cards are more common, you can purchase more. In time, you will have all the cards you need to be competitive again. <br />
<br />
Now to help those who dont really know what decks to build and maybe just want to play an older deck strategy with the newer cards, here is a card list for both sides of all cards that are a must for almost any current deck. This list is based on those that may have quit before Episode I cards were released. If you read what these cards do, you will understand why they are on this list. If you did quit before sets like Death Star II, Endor, or maybe older than that, you will need a specific deck list and to simply buy the cards you need for that deck. Most of the cards currently played from pre Episode I sets are all Virtual cards and you would be able to read and decide which ones of those you would need for your deck on PC website. I would list the game text of all these cards, but I dont want this article to be too over the top for the current players reading this. To get the game text for any card, just go to the SWCCG card library at www.jasonmaas.net/swccg/<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkside:<br />
<br />
* Fear Is My Alley  Found in Reflections 3. Not the most popular anymore, but still needed for specific deck types that pull cards from underneath it.<br />
* Drop  Found in Coruscant. Its uncommon, so you should find it quite easily. <br />
* All darkside Defensive Shields  Found in Reflections 3. You need to own a copy of all of them just in case you need them for your meta.<br />
* 3x Darth Maul with Lightsaber  Found in Theed Palace and as a Tournament Foil. You will need to get three copies to get the full potential. <br />
* 2x Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter  Found in Reflections 3. Also known as Broken Fett, you will need at least two in a deck but owning three is never a bad thing you want multiple destinies.  <br />
* 2x Blizzard 4  Found in Reflections 3. You need two for decks like Walkers (Imperial Occupation (V) in V set 4), Huntdown, or any deck you want to get an Imperial warrior out for free. <br />
* 2x We Must Accelerate Our Plans  Found in Coruscant. You will need to own at least two for purposes of pulling effects and a twix site.<br />
Blockade Flagship: Bridge  Found in Coruscant. Site pulled by previous card, owning one should be enough. <br />
* 2x Masterful Move & Endor Occupation  Found in Coruscant. You will need two copies for 80% of all dark decks built. <br />
* 2x Short Range Starfighter & Watch Your Back  Found in Coruscant. You need two when you want those matching ships out fast.<br />
* They Must Never Again Leave This City  Found in Reflections 3. Gets the Executor out Free, what more could you want?<br />
* Darth Sidious  Found in Theed Palace as a Reg and AI version. Owning one is fine, but some decks might need two.<br />
* Darth Maul  Found in Tatooine as a Reg and AI version and in Reflections 3 as a Foil. Great in space on his ship, can auto control a location<br />
* Mauls Sith Infiltrator  Found in Coruscant as a Reg and AI version and in Reflections 3 as a Foil. When matched with Maul can auto block and drain over low ability characters with using Tatooine Maul or you can hold off Battle Plan by Cloaking to prevent them from battling you.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Lightside:<br />
<br />
*An Unusual Amount of Fear  Found in Reflections 3. Same FIMA for DS, needed for pulling card from underneath it. <br />
*Thrown Back  Found in Coruscant. Uncommon, like its DS brother<br />
*All lightside Defensive Shields  Found in Reflections 3. All needed for any possible deck you might face. <br />
* 2x Qui-Gon with Lightsaber  Found in Theed Palace and as Tournament Foil. Any deck you play EPPs, two is standard. <br />
* 2x Mace Windu  Found in Coruscant as a Reg and AI version and in Reflections 3 as a Foil. Most powerful V card for LS, two is standard, three is better. (Make sure you have a Jedi Lightsaber (V) for him to play with)<br />
* 2x Han, Chewie, and the Falcon  Found in Reflections 3. Most powerful LS ship, although not always easy to keep in play. <br />
* 2x Lando, Scoundrel  Found in Reflections 3. Strongest version of Lando, although no as easy to get out with DS Lando (V). Good to own 2 for any possible deck that you want this destiny 5 character running around your deck. <br />
* 2x Chewie, Enraged  Found in Reflections 3. Most powerful printed character to date, nice with a destiny adding Leia or Han. <br />
* 2x Leia, Rebel Princess  Found in Reflections 3. Very powerful version of Leia who is one of the key cards for helping the LS beat the DS aliens Scum decks. <br />
* 2x All Wings Report In & Darklighter Spin  Found in Coruscant. Even more power than the DS version because Luke Skywalker (V) can pull it. <br />
* Threepio, with Parts Showing  Found in Tatooine as Reg and AI version and in Reflections 3 as a Foil. Most powerful version of Threepio, seen in many LS deck designs. Main engine for easy lightside tracking without Traffic Control.<br />
* Qui-Gon Jinn  Found in Tatooine as a Reg and AI version and in Reflections 3 as a Foil. Great for using a Qui-Gon with Immunity to Attrition and against Alien decks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now I know there are many more cards that are good for both sides that I didnt mention, but my main point for having a list like this at all was just to give a blueprint for the key cards that a returning player would be wise to own when building current decks. The returning player will figure out in time what other cards are needed. I also know that I didnt give that much help to those that may have quick many sets before Episode I, so I do apologize for that. If you are one of those players, please feel free to ask any questions about older cards that are now popular. Of you are blind to Death Star II, get your hands on Emperor Palpatine or Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. Both are also Foils in Reflections 2. <br />
<br />
As an added bonus to this article, I thought I would include a list of the most popular Virtual cards and what sets they are in to point returning players in the right direction. It would have been nice for me if I had been able to see a list like this, and I didnt have to learn about specific cards from tournament games. Nothing is worse than losing a game because you didnt know a card existed. I know I may have left out a card here or there, but I really just wanted to point out the best cards (in my opinion) from each set. That way a returning player doesnt have to take an hour and read every single V card. This list can be used as a cheat sheet to what cards you are most likely to see at a current tournament. For current players, this list is merely a starting point, so please no replies about how I left a specific card off. I cant list all the V cards. I made sure to list the most popular. Please make sure to read the Premium version of the Virtual cards, because they include any errata that the V card may have received since it was released. Hope this helps.<br />

To conclude this article, I wanted to let all of you know that the game has lost none of its glory. Even though we dont have new sets to buy or large 200+ player tournaments to play in. The game is still just as awesome as it ever was. I welcome you back to the game that continues to grow and change having been lost by its creator years and years ago. Please feel open to ask me any question over dmail or visit the PC website and start getting involved on the message boards. I hope this has been an informative tool for you on your quest back to glory. <br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and remember current players, this wasnt for you. <br />
