I will make only 2 points on that:<br />
<br />
1) Chu said that I was mistaken about the dark objective being impotent when it does not flip, because it can be used as a non-flip platform for DS mains of some type or another.  This may be true, but it isn&#39;t really relevant to what I was saying.  That is not his fault, however, because I might not have been clear enough.  When I was discussing how you are in a &quot;world of hurt&quot; when you cannot flip the dark objective, I was talking specifically (and exclusively) about a deck that IS designed for the flip.  If the walker deck is built to flip, and fails to do so, it will definitely be in a &quot;world of hurt&quot;.  IF the deck is built NOT to flip, then he&#39;s right that you can still be okay.  That&#39;s just not what I was talking about at the time.<br />

2) Chu said that I had a couple of things wrong in my article &quot;such as occupying sites reducing the destiny required for Target The Main Generator&quot;.  Not sure what he means by that.  What I actually said was &quot;Occupying Hoth sites will reduce the destiny draw for Target the Main Generator&quot;, and that was written from a LS perspective.  So I didn&#39;t say that the LS occupying Hoth sites would reduce the destiny required for TTMG.  What I said was that it would &quot;reduce the destiny draw FOR TTMG&quot; (or in other words, that it *increases* the destiny draw required for TTMG to succeed).  And this is generally true.  The DS adds one to its draw for each Hoth site it controls.  If the LS is occupying some of the Hoth sites, then the DS is not able to control them, and so the bonus to the draw for TTMG is reduced.  In theory, it would be *possible* for the LS to occupy a hoth site without it reducing the draw for TTMG (for instance, if the LS occupied the MPG and the DS did not), but that would virtually never happen (and I&#39;ve never seen it happen yet).  <br />
<br />
On to the rebuttal of Chu&#39;s last article:<br />
<br />
I agree with Chu that the EPPs themselves were a bad idea, and nothing more than a marketing gimmick for Decipher.  But obviously that hasn&#39;t been enough to keep many players from wanting to see them included in the Classic format, due to the greater deck efficiency they brought.  I said in my article that Classic could probably be playable with or without EPPs, but from the sound of what Chu had to say in his own article, he&#39;s probably disappointed that they have been reinstated in the format.  <br />
<br />
Also reinstated, Brangus.  When discussing the banning of Brangus from Classic, Chu said &quot;I guess this is probably necessary&quot;.  Since I agree, I was surprised to see Brangus brought back into Classic.  What did not surprise me was seeing that, sure enough, Brangus won the Classic tournament at DPC Chicago.  <br />
<br />
Okay, so where in this rebuttal will I start disagreeing with Chu?  Here.  He describes the banning of WYS as necessary, and I can&#39;t agree with that.  He makes a number of other statements that I cannot agree with, regarding WYS.  <br />
1) &quot;Watch Your Step completely pummeled Ralltiir Ops&quot;<br />
I don&#39;t think so.  The disappearance of Ralltiir Ops had nothing to do with the rise of WYS, and everything to do with the printing of Ounee Ta.  Without Ounee Ta, I think RalOps would have continued to be a viable decktype far longer than it did (well past the arrival of WYS), and I know a number of former (and even a couple of current) RalOps players who agree with me.<br />
2) &quot;WYS would still outmatch all the slow dark decks&quot;<br />
I don&#39;t think so.  One of WYS&#39;s biggest weaknesses in the Open format is to a very fast deck, that being Watto.  But one of WYS&#39;s other biggest weaknesses, in any format, is to a very slow deck, that being ISB space.  Not only has Big Blue ISB long been one of the best WYS killers in all the land, but it was, in fact, designed specifically for that purpose.  <br />
3) &quot;no other deck (light or dark) is nearly as quick&quot;<br />
Just isn&#39;t true.  WYS is quicker than many decks, but has never been the fastest thing going, and still isn&#39;t now.  In fact, there CONTINUE to be new decktypes made (even LS ones) that are faster than WYS (Local Uprising, anyone?)  <br />
<br />
Next, I find it bizarre that another one of the Classic rules he disagrees with, is the banning of all Ep1 cards.  He doesn&#39;t seem to realize that the format originated as &quot;SWCCG without Episode I cards&quot;.  The inclusion or exclusion of Maintenance cards, EPPs, Brangus, WYS, etc were all just afterthoughts.  As I understand it, the original framework for Classic was just playing without Episode I cards.  To disagree with banning them is to disagree with the format in general.  The only Episode I cards that I would advocate for use in Classic are defensive shields (and the starting effect you put them under).  <br />
<br />
I had said that I disagreed with using Classic for Day One of Worlds, and explained why.  When asked about the idea of using Classic for Day One of Worlds, Chu says &quot;I think that&#39;s a great idea&quot;, but really says nothing more about it.  I&#39;d be curious to see why he thinks it is a great idea.  <br />
<br />
His &quot;tangent&quot; (as he put it) doesn&#39;t seem very well thought out to me.  He says &quot;To me, if the top prize of $500 is split up between 5 ratings brackets or age brackets or however a tournament director wants to do it, and this means 20-30 more players play, then everyone wins&quot;.  Well, could it be any more plain and obvious that this is not true?  Of course not everyone wins.  Of course someone loses.  The player who wins the tournament (and would have won the $500 instead of $100) loses.  In some cases, the someone who loses could very easily be HIM (since he&#39;s had some success at larger events).  And therefore, not even HE would travel to such events anymore.  None of the top players would, because they&#39;d know that even if they battle their way through the tournament and win first prize, it won&#39;t be enough to cover their travel costs.  If you fly to a large event and win it, and lose money on the deal, something is wrong.  So, with his idea, would these types of events draw more of the newer and younger players?  Absolutely.  But would it draw more of the newer and younger players from out of state?  Absolutely not.  And would it cause the players who DO travel out of state for these tournaments to stop doing so?  Absolutely.  They would no longer be &quot;high-level events&quot;, because the high-level players wouldn&#39;t bother to show.  These tournaments would just become large local events, because nobody would travel for them.  Yes, Chess can get away with breaking the prizes down according to age range or rating, because it is vastly more popular than SWCCG.  If the total prize money is a LOT more than $500, then you can split it into these categories, and winning your category would still get you enough money to make it worth trying for.  Even Magic: The Gathering is in a position to do this.  SWCCG is not.  There simply aren&#39;t enough players in the game to generate enough prize money at these events to break that prize money down into categories and still have that money be worth coming from out of state to try and win.  People will fly to try and win that $500 he mentions.  But if it is just $100 out of that $500, will they still fly to try and win it?  No.  The game needs to be made more popular before his idea will be feasible.  <br />

<br />
Okay, on to the new article.  The topic for this article is:  &quot;What is important and what is not important in becoming a high caliber tournament<br />
player&quot;.  I&#39;ll be breaking it down into 3 categories.  The first will be the things that are of the greatest importance, in becoming a high caliber player.  The second will be things of moderate importance, and the third will be things of little (or no) importance.  In each category, they will be listed in order of importance.  So let&#39;s get started.<br />
<br />
Things that are of great importance in becoming a high caliber tournament player:<br />
<br />
1)  &quot;The Feel&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Feel&quot; is difficult to put into words, but it is the single greatest thing that seperates the good from the dead in SWCCG, and is also one of the most difficult things to try and &quot;learn&quot;.  In the majority of cases, a player either has &quot;The Feel&quot;, or they do not.  It is *possible* to gain &quot;The Feel&quot; through experience, but you&#39;re 100 times better off if you have it through sheer natural aptitude.  &quot;The Feel&quot; is what tells you what your every move will be in a game of SWCCG.  When someone is playing in a tournament game, they are aware that they have several options at every turn.  In every one of these instances, they may consider their options, and then make the decision they think is best.  Generally, ONE of those options occurred to them before any other.  And that is very often the one they select, because of the old adage about &quot;trusting your gut instincts&quot;.  The more of &quot;The Feel&quot; you possess, the more often your first instincts will be the correct decision, and the more often you will follow that first instinct, with the knowledge that it is correct, without delay.  &quot;The Feel&quot; is what answers all of your questions about what you will do next.  Should you save force this turn, or not?  If not, should you use the force to deploy cards, or draw it?  If you use it to deploy cards, should you deploy in space, or on the ground?  Or both?  Should you battle this turn, or run away, or stay without battling?  If you battle, where should you do it?  If you run away, where should you run to?  If you stay without battling, should you reinforce the location first, or draw cards to attack it later, or save force to use weapons/interrupts in the upcoming battle?  These kinds of questions go on inside your head almost endlessly during a game of SWCCG.  Some of them come along more often than others, and some of them are tougher to answer than others.  But the point is that at any given time, the possibilities that lie before you in a game of SWCCG can seem nearly endless.  There seems to be no end to the different combinations of things you could do, or at least try to do.  Do you always seem to know which one is BEST, and know why?  If so, then you probably possess &quot;The Feel&quot;, and you should count yourself lucky.  But if you do NOT always know which decision will be best, or if you often see your &quot;gut instinct&quot; blow up in your face, or if you often think to yourself &quot;This is a really tough call...I&#39;m just not sure which of these options is better...I guess I&#39;ll just pick one&quot;, then you probably do NOT have &quot;The Feel&quot;, and that&#39;s bad news.  Why?  Because as I indicated earlier, getting &quot;The Feel&quot; when you don&#39;t already have it is extremely difficult.  There is no easy way to gain it if you don&#39;t have it naturally.  The only way to acquire an artificial version of &quot;The Feel&quot; would be through a lot (and I do mean A LOT) of game experience.  Play again and again, and experiment with different options, and pay attention to the results.  Eventually you may begin to get a &quot;Feel&quot; for what will happen if you do this, vs. what will happen if you do that, and can start to make the right decisions more often, without really having to think about them.  But you will probably never be able to do it quite as easily as the player who had &quot;The Feel&quot; without trying.  But even if your &quot;Feel&quot; is artificial, it will still be extremely valuable.  As one player put it, when describing the way I play SWCCG:  &quot;You see and understand the game on a level that other players simply do not.&quot;   There is no greater weapon than &quot;The Feel&quot; in this game.  <br />
<br />
2)  Know Your Cards<br />
<br />
Know the gametext and &quot;key words&quot; (that appear in the lore) on every card in your decks.  You never know when the fact that a certain character in your deck is a &quot;scout&quot; or &quot;leader&quot; may help you (or hurt you), so be aware.  Know that your capital starships are destiny +1, or that you can lose 2 force to cancel walker barrage, and every other little bit of seemingly insignificant text that you &quot;never use&quot; on your cards.  Sooner or later, that &quot;useless text&quot; could mean the difference between victory and defeat.<br />
<br />
3)  Know the Rules<br />
<br />
There are a tremendous amount of rules for this game that don&#39;t appear on any of the cards.  And any little one of them could have a huge impact on a given match.  You have to know rules about timing, and characteristics, and &quot;matching&quot; weapons/starships, and a zillion other things.  If I initiate a battle that I intend to cancel with Stunning Leader (just to take care of Order to Engage), can you play Fallen Portal before I play Stunning Leader?  If I forfeit EPP Obi-Wan, can you use Sidious before I play a Jedi&#39;s Resilience?  If so, can you still use Sidious before I play a Jedi&#39;s Resilience even if you made Obi-Wan lost with Dark Strike?  Will Menace Fades protect me from the additional force loss caused by It&#39;s Worse when used to cancel ICBW, if the ICBW is being used to reduce a force drain?  If my Walker Garrison objective says my force drain bonuses cannot be &quot;cancelled&quot;, can they still be &quot;ignored&quot; by your Jedi Test #1?  If I use the card from Colo Claw Fish for destiny, can you still reduce it with your political effect?  If you cancel my destiny draw, can I still switch it for the card on Colo Claw Fish?  If I move Thrawn from the Executor docking bay to the bridge of the ship, can I then shuttle him down to a related site, or are those both regular moves?  And does it cost force to move him from the docking bay to the bridge?  Can I land Saber 1 at the Endor: Rebel Landing Site?  If I play I have you now against Luke, and then my dark jedi is lost before battle destiny, do I still draw 2 extra destiny?  What is the errata to &quot;It can Wait&quot;?  IS there errata to &quot;It can Wait&quot;??  If you are SURE that you KNOW the answers to all these questions, you&#39;ve been keeping up on your rules, and you&#39;ll have a distinct advantage over many opponents.<br />
<br />
4)  Know your Opponent&#39;s Cards<br />
<br />
Knowing all the text on your own cards is critical, but knowing the text on ALL the cards is useful.  Then you&#39;ll be better able to predict what cards your opponent may be able to use against you in a given situation.  If your opponent&#39;s objective lets him deploy &quot;x&quot; from reserve deck for free at any time, you&#39;d better know what &quot;x&quot; does.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Things that are of moderate importance in becoming a high caliber tournament player:<br />
<br />
1)  Know the &quot;Meta&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you know what all the cards do, it sure helps to know which ones you&#39;re likely to see.  Then you know which ones to pack counters against, or which ones to be scared of during a certain game, as opposed to the ones that you know &quot;nobody plays anymore&quot; or &quot;nobody plays in this area&quot;.  Knowing your local &quot;meta&quot; can be really helpful for week-to-week tournaments, where you see a lot of the same people time and again, and where many of them use the same decks time and again.  If you know what is popular in your local area, you know what to watch out for, and what to prepare against.  There&#39;s no sense playing 4 counters for dark senate if everyone in your area plays dark combat.  Figuring out the &quot;meta&quot; for larger events is considerably more difficult, but can still be valuable.  Every deck has its strong and weak matchups against decks from the opposing allegiance.  The absolute &quot;BEST DECK&quot; may not necessarily be the best deck for a particular event.  The &quot;meta&quot; is volatile and unpredictable, but knowledge of it can be a useful asset.  <br />
<br />
2)  Focus/Mental Tenacity/Concentration/Patience<br />
<br />
Presumably, your deck will have a general theme to it, or certain goals that you expect it to accomplish.  You have a gameplan for what happens when things are working properly.  However, things do not always go according to plan.  And you need to know what to do when they don&#39;t.  You have to know when to stick to that gameplan, and when to adapt it for the situation, and when to abandon it completely to try something else.  Figuring this out involves some of &quot;The Feel&quot;, but it also involves a little bit of EFFORT.  It involves a little bit of focus, or concentration, to determine how badly you&#39;ve been thrown off track, and what to do about it.  &quot;The Feel&quot; DOES help a great deal with having a good first instinct about how to handle these situations, but I think this particular situation deserves a seperate mention, because some players who actually DO have &quot;The Feel&quot; to some degree, still lack patience and focus in these situations.  They won&#39;t invest the time needed to figure out what has happened and what should be done about it, because they&#39;re used to &quot;The Feel&quot; just bailing them out all the time.  (as it often can!)  But if your &quot;Feel&quot; was working on all cylinders that day, then maybe you wouldn&#39;t have been in this precarious situation in the first place!  You need to have enough patience to analyze the situation.  If you&#39;ve been thrown off track only because your opponent has had a lucky draw, or some lucky destiny, or because you&#39;ve had the opposite, then you can probably feel safe in continuing to trust your instincts.  (And those instincts will tell you when, or if, it is time to stick to the gameplan, adapt it, or abandon it)  But if the problem is simply that your decisions have not given you the results you expected, then your &quot;Feel&quot; might be a little bit off in this particular deck matchup, and you need the mental toughness to (quickly) examine what&#39;s gone wrong, and try to get yourself back on track.  All too often, I&#39;ve seen GOOD players lose games because they reacted incorrectly when backed into a corner.  They lacked the patience to look at what was happening and figure out what to do.  This usually led to one of two mistakes:<br />
<br />
A) They were hellbent on playing things out the same way that has always worked for them before, ignoring how this game was different from those others.  Their usual strategy continued to not work for this game/matchup, and they continued to fall behind in the game and slowly lost.<br />
OR<br />
B) They rashly decided that their gameplan was not working (when in actuality it WAS working, and the only reason they were falling behind was because of unforseen luck factors) so they pitched their usual strategy out the window, and started using desperation tactics to try and make up the gap.  When those tactics backfired, they quickly lost.<br />
<br />
These two mistakes are obviously much different (since one player is sticking to the plan when he shouldn&#39;t, and the other is abandoning the plan when he shouldn&#39;t) but they are both caused by the same problem:  Failure to stop and focus on what is really happening in the game, before deciding whether to move forward with their normal strategy, adapt it, or abandon it.  <br />
<br />
3)  Tracking<br />
<br />
I think we all pretty much know what tracking is, and why it comes in handy.  There is no substitute for knowing exactly which card you&#39;re going to draw for that crucial weapon destiny, or battle destiny, or choke vader destiny, or duel destiny, etc.  So yes, tracking is a very useful tool, as long as you don&#39;t let it distract you from the other occurrences in the game.  It is possible to get so wrapped-up in your tracking that you ignore or forget something far more rudimentary.  You should also not take chances on your tracking unless you know you are good at it.  &quot;Going for the Gold&quot; (example: I&#39;ll target Epp Obi-Wan with Vader&#39;s choke ability) when your tracking is RIGHT will get you much further than just taking the conservative approach (example: I&#39;ll target KalFal with Vader&#39;s choke ability) using blind draws.  But &quot;Going for the Gold&quot; when your tracking is WRONG will also hurt you much more than taking the conservative approach.  In the above examples, the conservative approach with blind draws will probably choke KalKal, and then kill Obi-wan with attrition, and Vader probably dies to the saber or attrition.  Going for the Gold with good tracking would choke Obi-wan, and put a beatdown on KalFal, while Vader lives.  MUCH BETTER than the blind approach, eh?  But Going for the Gold with bad tracking could miss the choke on Obi-Wan, and then attrition kills KalFal (IF KalFal does not reduce your destiny to zero).  Vader dies to the saber or attrition, but Obi lives, KalFal might even live, and you could easily take battle damage yourself if KalFal reduces your destiny to zero and Vader wa by the saber.  MUCH WORSE than the blind approach.  <br />
<br />
4)  Know Your Opponent<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re playing against someone that you&#39;ve played against often, then you probably know a lot about their tendencies.  &quot;Chuck always goes for the Beatdown&quot;.  &quot;Bob never plays Houjix&quot;.  &quot;Timmy never runs Barriers&quot;.  &quot;Joey never pays for Battle Plan unless it is at least a drain of 2&quot;.  &quot;Scott never draws above 12 cards&quot;.  These kinds of things let you know what to expect from your competition, and as a result, what to do during the game.  You can sometimes ignore what &quot;The FEEL&quot; is telling you, because of this kind of special information.  Examples:  &quot;I shouldn&#39;t move Obi in front of Vader because I could be walking into a beatdown using R3 Fett&quot; can *probably* be ignored if your opponent is John and you know that &quot;John&#39;s favorite card in SWCCG is Fett in Slave I, so he never uses R3 Fett in a deck&quot;.  &quot;I can&#39;t deploy Obi in front of Vader because he&#39;ll duel me with the Circle is Now Complete&quot; can *probably* be ignored if your opponent is Adam and you know that &quot;Adam doesn&#39;t own a copy of the Circle is Now Complete, so he was trying to trade for one before the tourney started, but didn&#39;t get one&quot;.  To gain this kind of information for larger events, you can read the deck postings of specific players (to see if there are certain cards or strategies that they always/never use), read their tournament reports (to look for certain tendencies in their style of play), or talk to people who see them play regularly.<br />
<br />
Things that are of little (or no) importance in becoming a high caliber tournament player:<br />
<br />
1)  Know Yourself<br />
<br />
Pay attention to how you play the game yourself.  If you find yourself saying &quot;I always do this or that&quot;, then make sure that &quot;this or that&quot; are good things to be doing.  That way you won&#39;t repeat your mistakes.  If you notice that you play better using certain decks or strategies, use that knowledge to your advantage, and play decks that work well with your own tendencies.  <br />
<br />
2)  Practice<br />
<br />
If you &quot;Know your cards&quot;, and &quot;Know your opponent&#39;s cards&quot;, and &quot;Know your opponent&quot; and &quot;Know yourself&quot; and know how to do &quot;Tracking&quot;, well all of those things are good.  But all of them can be forgotten if you&#39;ve taken a long layoff from the game.  Getting in some practice games before charging headlong into your next tournament can help you shake off the rust and get back into form.  Practice can also be part of the afore-mentioned &quot;Experience&quot; if you are trying to artificially create &quot;The Feel&quot;.  Tournament experience will probably help more than Practice, but Practice is not completely useless when attempting to reach your goals.<br />
<br />
3)  Confidence<br />
<br />
Having &quot;The will to win&quot; and &quot;The will to succeed&quot; will not get you very far in a game of SWCCG.  Drive, determination, and confidence will not get you very far in a game of SWCCG.  Believing in yourself will not get you very far in a game of SWCCG.  You&#39;re only as good as your next move.  If you convince yourself of anything more than that, you&#39;re only setting yourself up for disappointment.  You can &quot;imagine yourself achieving your goal&quot; in your mind all day long and it won&#39;t mean JACK if your opponent has a better deck and better skills.  You&#39;ll never beat a top tier player armed with nothing better than a positive attitude.  <br />
<br />
4)  Reputation<br />
<br />
Good players generally have reputations.  Good players almost always have good ratings.  But neither is REQUIRED in order for you to be a good player.  You don&#39;t have to be 2000+ to beat someone who is 2100+, and your opponent doesn&#39;t have to recognize your name for you to be better than he is.  (not even if you DO recognize HIS name)  Your rating and your reputation will not go out and win games for you, and if you think they will, your rating will soon be lower, and your reputation will soon diminish.  Having been the top-ranked player in the World for over 4 1/2 years, I think I&#39;m in as good a position as anyone to gauge what kind of impact reputation and rating have on a game of Star Wars.  It has been my decks and my abilities as a player that have allowed me to win over 800 sanctioned tournament games.  Not a single one of those opponents has ever said they lost to me because of my rating.  Or because of my reputation.  Or because they were scared and by playing the &quot;Top Dawg&quot;.  Or because they thought they would lose before the game even started.  I won&#39;t win any games with intimidation, and neither will you, so don&#39;t worry about trying to build your notoriety.  Reputation and ratings make fun bragging rights, but they won&#39;t bring you any closer to winning that $$$ at DPC Anywhere.  <br />
