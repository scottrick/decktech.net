First, I want to thank you for your time Brian.  Your success at SWCCG is well documented, but can you give us a brief overview of some of your major accomplishments? <br />
<br />
Well, I like to think it was a lot harder to win events before the year 2002. So I will list those accomplishments real quick. I won the Seattle open in 1999. I won the Corellia Regional in 2000. I won the Detroit Grand Slam in 2000. I won my State Championship in 2001. And I took 2nd in the Gencon Open, and one of the Canadian Opens in 98, the Gencon tourney has 170 + players, I was pretty excited going 6-0 and being like 4 dif away from going to worlds, the 1st year I competed.  I also got top 4 of Worlds in 2002.  I also placed well in several other events, Grand Slams, States, Regionals, Worlds, etc.<br />
<br />
2.	Of all of your major tournament finishes, which is the one you are most proud of, either because of the competition, or because of your own personal success?<br />
<br />
I&#39;d actually say that going 6-0 at Gencon in 98, and being 4 dif away from going to worlds was what I am most proud of. The large field, and the fact that I actually could have gone to Worlds that year, if I would have been an ass. The player I played against in the finals accidentally shuffled his hand into his deck, after he played the signal, in the 2nd game, after I won the 1st. If I had wanted to be an wookie about it, I could have had him disqualified, and went to worlds, but I didn&#39;t want to win it that way, and since I was getting smoked bad anyways, and realized he still would have beat me, I just had the judges give him a 10 card hand, and we continued playing.  I am also quite proud of winning the Seattle Open in 99, for my 1st trip to Worlds.<br />
<br />
3.	Brian Hunter recently wrote a series of articles about the most influential players in the games history, and this certainly sparked some interest in the game by former players.  What did you think about this list, and importantly, your place on it as one of the most influential players ever?<br />
<br />
Well, I would like to start off by saying it was a good article. I just felt as though many things he said were ridiculous, and players who should have been on the list werent, and then of course players that should likely not be on the list, or as high, were, because Hunter wanted to be able to boost his own ego.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I think that for many years now, I have been well known in the SWCCG community. Not only in my own Region, but around the world. I certainly never thought of myself as the cream of the crop, but I also knew I was a really good player, and certainly capable of beating any player on any given day. After Steve Brentson moved to Conneticut in 98, I never really had a really good partner, like a Hays/Lewis combo, or Chu/Sokol/Twiggs, or Yannick/Dom. So I never had as good a partner to work on stuff with. I had some pretty good partners, I would say, but not of the quality of those players. I do think I was certainly good enough to make the list. Ranking isnt as important to me though. Only I know what I have really accomplished, and those I have influenced, and that is enough for me.<br />
<br />
4.	You took some time off from SWCCG, but came back and had strong finishes on all three days of the world championships this year.  Were you following the game during your hiatus, or did you have a crash-course with all of the new cards?<br />
<br />
Well, I have always played off and on for fun, just not a whole lot. From the 2003 Worlds, to present, I probably only played 20 or so games, give or take. I did follow the game, and tried to play in my states in 2005 I think it was, but Scum/WYS V were huge NPE&#39;s for me. So I stopped again. When I decided to start up again this year, I just talked to several players, updated some old decks, and had at it at gencon. I did ok in both events, and decided Worlds might be fun. So I talked to some people about it, found decks, tested, and then played.<br />
<br />
5.	Who do you think are the top 5 players currently playing SWCCG, either in order, or not?<br />
<br />
Top 5, sigh, you are going to make my conversation with Hunter seem bogus, but then again, it was basically just to ruffle his feathers. In no particular order: Reid, Hunter, Chu, Shaw, and I guess Meeker, he did win Worlds right? I may have forgotten some people, so I will apologize in advance. Just named ones right off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
6.	There is significant debate about how different the game is now from its glory days.  Having played both recently, and before the license was lost, what are your thoughts about the differences?  Can todays best players be compared with some of the best of all time?<br />
<br />
Well, in all honesty, I think most of the players left playing, aren&#39;t even as close to dedicated as the players from before the license was lost. In its glory days, everyone who played outside of little kids was pretty darn good. I would say that the average player from before the license was lost, would be comparable to what some of the best players playing now are. I don&#39;t know if I said that right, and I don&#39;t want to hurt any feelings, or get called out by Nitsuj again, but I really think for the most part, the level of play now is a lot less than it once was. Of course, this doesn&#39;t go for everyone, and I certainly believe some of the players playing now could compete, and do well pre license loss, but I just think that most of the people playing now, don&#39;t understand what it once was to play in events.<br />
<br />
7.	What do you think about the upcoming Match Play championship that is going to take place in Philadelphia?<br />
<br />
Well, it is a good idea in theory I guess. I don&#39;t think it is as amazing as everyone seems to think, and I think half the players wouldn&#39;t even bother if they didn&#39;t live as close to it as they do, or if the money prize wasn&#39;t there. I think single elimination is bad. Putting up that kind of money when one bad matchup, or something totally ridiculous in play thing happening, sends you packing. I mean it should be interesting and all, just not something that i am that interested in. For the record, I don&#39;t think that the format for day 3 of worlds this year was that bad. A Swiss between the players who earned their way into top 12, and then a final duel for the 2 people who played the best out of those 12, seems reasonable.  I can understand people liking the match play style as well though, just not something I really cared to attend is all.<br />
<br />
8.	As you are aware, the past few virtual sets before V-12 underwent a major overhaul through errata, the redux, and finally the re-edit.  What are your thoughts about V-12 and the direction of design by the players committee?<br />
<br />
Well, I think that having so many redux, and re-edit&#39;s is ridiculous, and am against it. I think that fixing the totally retarded broken cards is fine, but I really hate having to waste the money to keep buying printer ink because the cards I had been using get changed. It is a hassle, and a headache, and for the record, I haven&#39;t even bothered looking at my cards since the re-edit came out, because I am pissed I have to print out all the new cards and stuff to play.<br />
<br />
I do like the V cards in general though, and thank the PC for doing such a great job. Just get tired of all the cards changing, and having to print out new ones every single time.<br />
<br />
9.	Many of us know you are an avid fantasy football player.  Exactly HOW many teams did you have?  What was your final trophy count?<br />
<br />
HAHA! Ok, Im not even going to lie, I got a ton more carried away this year than usual. Because I just like drafting, and once I find out the drafts are available, I get a little too carried away because I don&#39;t want to wait till august for my real drafts. I was in 40 leagues this year on yahoo. I made the playoffs in 32 of the 40, made the final in 12 leagues, and won 10 championships. One of my id&#39;s has 8 1st place trophy&#39;s out of 12 teams ;-)  I found myself getting really bored though with it this year, and not being as interested in most all of my teams. Next year I have decided not to do more than 16, and might even only do 12, just so I don&#39;t find myself in the same spot I am this year, bored, and disgruntled with the whole thing. I joined 2 fantasy basketball leagues this year also, and am having a funner time than I did in football. Maybe because I have so many fewer teams to worry about.  OH, and one more thing, FU John Kitna!<br />
<br />
10.	The players committee has banned clear sleeves, which were widely abused in the game for a long time.  What are your thoughts about this decision?<br />
<br />
Well, I think I gotta start by saying. THANKS A LOT BRIAN HUNTER! After having said that, I think it is good for the game, so people quit using it as a method to cheat. It is bad enough some people try and use foils to cheat. Plus colored sleeves are so much purtier!<br />
<br />
11.	Who is your superbowl pick?<br />
<br />
Hmmm, superbowl pick. Well, I have picked the team playing the Colts to win each week, but was foiled both times. If the Chargers keep playing the way they did all year, I really don&#39;t see how they could be beat. So I am going to go with the Chargers. I want to add though that I think the winner of the Pats/Chargers is my pick, because I learned a long time ago, never count the Pats out!<br />
<br />
12.	On another note, who the heck is this guy!? http://i42.photobucket.com/albums/e340/the_infamous_trench/rofl_monster.gif <br />
<br />
Hmmm, ever notice Andrew Howard tries to claim every single neat nickname I ever try and make popular! But then again, maybe it really is him in that wolf suit, or JP Losman!<br />
<br />
13.	What is the J.P. Losman reference?<br />
<br />
Howards little brother looks just like JP Losman, when they picked me up for worlds, I was like whoa! JP Losman just picked me up!<br />
<br />
14.	And on that note, any final comments?<br />
<br />
Not really. I guess I want to thank all the players, and the PC for keeping SWCCG alive. It is truly the best CCG I have ever played.<br />
<br />
Thanks Brian.<br />
