I didnt want to put too much in the first post of the Encyclopedia because it was already big enough. I decided to add supplements as another tool for education on the SWCCG decks. I will update the supplements with the main Encyclopedia so the tools for our game can only become stronger as time goes on.<br />
<br />
This article will cover what I like to call the Hall of Broken Decks. You could call this a type of Hall of Fame to the SWCCG universe for those who created decks that were so broken that they were given an errata or counter cards to specifically kill the deck so no one else would have to suffer a game against it. <br />
<br />
This article was a very difficult one to design because I dont have the deck lists or even complete strategy for all of the broken decks that were made over the past 10 years. I mainly wanted to spread the word of some of the decks that I am sure all of you have never known about. Though some of the decks were mainly just strategies created by Decipher. If the strategy was created by a specific player, I tried my best to give personal credit to the person who designed the deck if I knew who the original creator was. Unfortunately, I was not able to include all of them at this time. Like the Encyclopedia, I plan to update this with more decks as I learn of their existence. At that time I will also be glad to add the creator of any deck that was previously not printed in this first edition. One deck I didnt include in this edition was the Super Retrieval with Floating Refineries. I know this deck was broken and needs to be in this article, but I didnt have the full story to how it really worked. As I learn about it, I will include it in the next edition.  <br />
<br />
Like the Encyclopedia, I know that this will not be teaching all of you something new because many have been around the game since its creation and have known about these for sometime. Please take care in rating because I wanted this to be another fun tool for the game for all levels of players and no tool can always be something new to every level player.   <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
To explain how I picked which decks to include, I wanted to create an article that could bring together all of the totally broken or retarded strategies that have since died due to an errata or maybe counter cards that were created to specifically kill the decks strategy. Many older players will remember these decks, and how hard it was to play against them. For the newer players, I hope this can give you an insight to how the game has changed over the past 10 years.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(01) - Totally Broken First Turn Darkside Lockdown<br />
<br />
<br />
The start this article, it made since that I go ahead and show the most Broken Deck every to be made for the SWCCG game. So broken in fact that it was the single reason that both Limited Resources was made (.) unqiue and Shot in the Dark was changed to only once per turn. Most people believe that the First Turn Dark Deal was the cause for Shot in the Dark being changed, but it was this deck that really made things come to light. <br />
<br />
It was a DS deck created by Brian Rippetoe in Nashville, TN. The reason you never heard of this deck is because he never played it in a tournament. He just built it and played it for fun then showed it to the VP of SWCCG when he was visiting all the different cities. Once the VP saw how totally retarded this deck was he immediately got both cards changed. Brian would have gone undefeated all year if had only kept it a secret.  <br />
<br />
The deck was created right after Cloud City was released. Back then, Objectives and Starting Interrupts did not exist, so you were forced to start just one little location. The lightside was still very strong on Dagobah, so the MOST popular lightside starting location was Yodas Hut. Literally 90% of all good decks started that location because it was a safe 2 icon site that the darkside could not take over and drain. The only other popular choice was Obis Hut, but was not the best because all good darkside decks played on Tatooine, and could take over that site and drain for 3. I do also remember the Cloud City: Guest Quarters being played too, but no good player ever started it because it was giving the darkside a site to take over early. You must understand that this was all during a time when there were no battlegrounds and no cards that could prevent drains at non battlegrounds. So you were forced to protect those sites as well as keep them away from the larger drain locations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Main cards in deck:<br />
* Hoth: Ice Plains (starting location)<br />
* Shot in the Dark <br />
* Broken Concentration <br />
* Sleen <br />
* Imperial Supply<br />
* Admirl Ozzel<br />
* Scanning Crew<br />
* Uncertain is the Future<br />
* Ability, Ability, Ability<br />
* Limited Resources <br />
* Dark Waters<br />

Ok, this is what the deck did. The darkside would take his first turn and play like 12 Shot in the Darks so that he could get one in his opening hand. Then, once on the table, he could use the broken text to lose a card that he didnt need (like one of the 11 Shot in the Darks) to draw a card from the top of Reserve. Before the Errata, he could do this over and over and over again until he had the set up what he wanted. The whole goal was to get Ozzel out to the Plains, then Ability x3, Broken Concentration, 2 Sleens, and the rest of your hand was Limited Resources. The Sleens would deploy to the Hut to absorb both icons so the lightside was left with only the one activation you generate yourself. He used the Dark Waters effect to get the Sleens to Obis Hut if that was the chosen start. The Imperial Supplies would give him activation so he could play Scanning Crew to look at the lightsides hand, and Uncertain is the Future to change the lightsides hand if they should have ANY locations. <br />
<br />
The point was to make sure that the lightside player couldnt get ANY more force after their first turn because he could play Broken Concentration to pay 2 Force and put the 1 Force you did activate right back on the reserve, so you NEVER got to pay for ANYTHING or get ANY new cards into your hand. With no force to get anyone out, you would lose 2 to Ability x3 each turn. He never had to do a single thing after that, because there was nothing you could do. You couldnt draw any cards. There was no way to search for anything, and if you did get lucky in your opening hand. It would just get changed. Once your hand got below 3 cards, he would end the game with like 12 Limited Resources. At 4 cards a pop, that was a 48 card loss all at once.<br />
<br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Limited Resources was made Unique and Shot In the Dark was changed to once per turn.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(02) - First Turn Dark Deal<br />
<br />
<br />
Right behind the Broken deck is this deck that WAS played in tournaments and another reason that Shot in the Dark was changed. This deck used the same idea of Shot in the Dark to lose a card to draw a card over and over until the strategy was set up. This deck did the same thing, only it gave the lightside a chance to win. Only, it wasnt a very good chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mains Cards in deck (multiples of all):<br />
* Dark Deal<br />
* Cloud City sites<br />
* Imperial Supply<br />
* Free Deploy Characters<br />
* Cloud City & Storm Troopers<br />
* Trooper Assault<br />
* Obsidian 7 & 8  <br />
* Miiyoom Onith<br />
* Shot in the Dark<br />
* Scanning Crew<br />
<br />
<br />
How it Won:<br />
<br />
This deck won because it would literally set up Dark Deal first turn. You would start with a Cloud City site like the Chasm or the Carbonite Chamber. Then lose and draw until you had all three sites, the effect, Cloud City, the TIE, and characters at all the sites. You would want to get the Dining Room out in the middle, and put Miiyoom Onith there to remove all the characters that could come after you. The Trooper Assaults would protect the Troopers and add to their power. The +4 with Dark Deal made them very powerful on the ground. The drain was like 9 depending on if they got a character out on their first turn. Scanning Crew would usually remove the Obi or Luke that they might have gotten in their opening hand. Then you could drain and Onith all game until it was over. It was totally retarded to play against because there was no way of fighting off the drains that early while all of your characters went lost. <br />
<br />
The main reason why this is not the most broken deck was that it did have the possibility to lose if your deck was just not on your side. Since there were no cards to search for anything, if all the multiples of the key cards were together at the bottom, you would literally kill yourself. Usually, you would still be able to set it up, but if you only have 13 cards left, to the opposing 50. It doesnt matter what you had set up. <br />
  <br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Shot In the Dark was changed to once per turn. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(03) - Classic Dagobah<br />
<br />
<br />
The main reason I posted this deck was because it was so impossible to beat back when it was released. Though it never got any kind of errata, the idea was so retarded, that it was the single reason for the creation of battlegrounds. After this strategy was released, they realized that they needed to made cards that would prevent draining on locations that were not battlegrounds. Once you see this deck, you will understand<br />
<br />
<br />
Main cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* Dagobah (Starting)<br />
* 4 or 5 Dagobah sites<br />
* Yoda<br />
* Son of Skywalker<br />
* Lots and Lots of SAC<br />
* Anger, Fear, and Aggression<br />
* Anakins Lightsaber<br />
* Lightsaber Proficiency<br />
* Only Jedi Test 1<br />
* Revolutions<br />
* It Could Be Worse<br />
* On the Edges<br />
* Traffic Control<br />
<br />
<br />
How it Won:<br />
<br />
This deck won by setting up Yoda and Son of Skywalker on Dagobah to train, much like MWYHL does now, only you did it all without an objective. That meant you had to play multiples, usually 4 Yodas and 4 Sons. SOS could pull his lightsaber. You throw a Lightsaber Proficiency and Revolution Yodas Hut for a drain of 4. Dagobah rules states that NO characters, vehicles, or starships may deploy to Dagobah UNLESS they say they can in their text. At the time, ONLY Yoda and SOS had such a text. You are not even allowed to Ellis your characters over, so NO darkside ANYTHING could ever get to ANY Dagobah location including the system without literally deploying to a system, piling up, and moving over, then landing on the planet.<br />
<br />
With that kind of protection, you had a set drain of 4 ALL GAME. Then you could even play I Have a Bad Feeling About This to move their Presence of the Force to the Hut to make it a 5. Anger, Fear, and Aggression added an additional 4 card loss with each turn going by without the darkside battling anywhere. You would complete Test 1 to make ALL of their bonus drains gone. Then what damage they did do to you would just get retrieved with an On the Edge and a tracked destiny set up with the Traffic Control. If that wasnt enough, because you didnt need ANY other cards with ability in your deck. You could play with like 7 Senses, 6 Alters, and 5 Controls. No red card was EVER staying on the table unless it was immune or allowed. <br />
<br />
You have to understand that there was NO Come Here You Big Coward, NO Resistance, NO Imperial Decree, and NO Ability x3. Cloud City did introduce two of these cards right after Dagobah, but it still didnt matter because the Presence on the Revolved Hut would still provide a drain of 3. Then you could still It Could Be Worse or just retrieve the lost force from Ability x3. It was just a totally retarded strategy, and the first deck I ever built that would win all the time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(04) - Dagobah Undercover<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a deck idea that I myself created back when Cloud City had just been released. It took me from being a regular player trying to figure out the game to winning tournaments against Clint Hayes and Steven Lewis. This deck also didnt get any kind of errata because it never got played in a large forum. It also could be beat by TIE Ghhk Odds, but Odds in itself was not a very easy strategy to get around while it was strong. <br />
<br />
Main cards in deck: <br />
<br />
* Dagobah (starting)<br />
* Yoda<br />
* 5 Undercovers<br />
* 5 Spies<br />
* Anger, Fear, and Aggression<br />
* Lots of SAC<br />
* Revolutions<br />
* Landing Claws<br />
<br />
<br />
How it Won:<br />
<br />
This deck won by totally abusing the Undercover spy. Much like the Dagobah deck, it would set up with Yoda at the Hut, which would have the Revolution. The difference between the two decks is that it didnt do any kind of training. Back then the ONLY ways to get around Undercover spies was with Interrupts and Effects that could be canceled with SAC. The only other way was with Lt Poltritum from A New Hope who could break the cover only if they draw that characters ability for destiny. If you put R2-D2 in front of him, it was almost impossible to break. The deck played more SAC then any other deck with 8 Senses, 7 Alters, and 6 Controls. It also played Landing Claws with the Leaders in their ships to block drains in space because Landing Claw also couldnt be canceled with anything but an Interrupt. The deck would win by the small drains on Dagobah, Anger, Fear,& Aggression, Uncontrollable Fury, and late game drain at Kessel when the darkside has lost their space. There were 5 Undercover spies with one being Leia Organa who would get a Reflections put on her for constant retrieval all game. As a last mean thing to do, I also played like 5 Revolutions because they too could only canceled with cards that SAC could get around unless they played Imperial Decree, which back then was almost never seen. Truly, in its day, the only deck that possed any kind of threat to this strategy was the next broken deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(05) - TIE / Ghhk / Odds<br />
<br />
<br />
The worst of all of the Odds based decks. Unlike other decks that would try and win with Just the Odds popping over and over again, this deck would also battle and drain in space. It could even get Imperial Decree going with Yavin 4 and Hoth systems being controlled. This deck rarely lost to anything, and was so frustrating to play against that many players would give up half way through the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* Kashyyykk (starting)<br />
* 7 to 8 TIE Fighters<br />
* 5 to 6 of 3,720 to 1<br />
* 3 Odds Characters<br />
* Victory & Imperial Star Destroyers<br />
* 7 more planets<br />
* 6 Ghhks<br />
* Presence of the Force<br />
<br />
<br />
How it Won:<br />
<br />
This deck was built to always get at least one TIE and one Ghhk in your opening hand. Though it didnt happen 100% of the time, there were very few games where the combo was not in your opening hand. You played with the regular TIEs because they were not being played for their power so you just wanted ones that were cheap. So you could put out one TIE first turn to Kashyyykk for a drain of 2, sometimes even a drain of 3 if you pulled the Presence of the Force in your hand also because the deck would usually play 4 of them. From there, as you draw your systems, you would deploy them with yet another TIE. As the lighside was trying to find their own sites and space. You were doing good damage and setting up odds with TechNor for 6, Feltipern Trevagg for 4 and Miiyoom Onith for 3 as well as additional card removal by getting rid of their characters so they had no characters for Odds. Random cards like Victory class star destroyers, Look Sir, Droids, and Barriers made it totally impossible for the lightside to beat this deck. It even had the power to beat the Dagobah deck by causing early damage before they could set up. With no Battle Plan, it made no difference if you ever played anyone on the ground.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(06) - 98 Worlds Spaceport/Droid Merchant Never Ending First Turn <br />
<br />
<br />
This deck had a very short run, but made an excellent choice for timing. This deck was the only deck that beat Operatives at the 98 Worlds. That year, Special Edition had been released a good two weeks before Worlds that year and everyone was on the look out for Operatives. This one deck provided the tools to get around all of that crap that Operatives had created. <br />
<br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* Tatooine: Mos Eisley (Starting)<br />
* Lots of 4+ destiny droids<br />
* Lots of Droid Merchants<br />
* Lots of Spaceport Speeders<br />
* Lots of How Do We Get Out of This Mess<br />
<br />
<br />
How It Won:<br />
<br />
This deck was the lightsides version of the broken Shot in the Dark deck only it never ever let the Darkside get another turn. The darkside would take their first turn, getting their opening hand and then set up usually Operatives. It would deploy a good 6 cards and then maybe draw a few. Then the lightside player would get out a Droid Merchant and begin to deploy a droid, sell it with Spaceport Speeders, activate force to deploy another droid, and retrieve droids over and over with the Merchants. This could happen over and over until the full hour was over. The darkside player never had the 3 force left from their first turn to play the grabber if they had one, so there was no way to stop the endless turn. The deck never got a full win, but that didnt matter because it could get a timed win with differential in the 50s because the only cards on the table at the end were the starting site and the Merchant. I dont know about you, but I will take a 1(+50) four times at Worlds when there was a deck like Operatives being played. <br />
<br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Once Worlds 98 was over, Droid Merchant got a total over hall so much so that it is not even a playable card. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(07) - Retarded Operatives<br />
<br />
<br />
The only strategy completely created by Decipher right before the 98 Worlds that completely killed everything in its path. It was so retarded that if you didnt play it in worlds, you had no shot at making it into day 3. It was a strategy that was built exactly the same for both sides of the force and even lasted past Worlds for a good 2 months before it received any kind of errata.  <br />
<br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* 20 to 25 Operatives<br />
* 5+ <> Sites for that planet<br />
<br />
<br />
How It Won:<br />
<br />
Operatives won because of the objectives Local Uprising / Imperial Occupation, which have now both been virtualized by the PC to be totally new deck types. The objectives allowed you to pull all of the <> sites and then once flipped gave totally unheard of bonuses to the Operatives themselves. The lightside gained in forfeit and the darkside in power. They all deployed for 1, retrieved a force when deployed to the planet, added a destiny when at a site, and even got a drain bonus. So you could set up drains of 2 on like 6 different <> sites with just one operative. When the opponent came after you, you could Ghhk/Houjix, react with vehicles, or just Barrier for an Operative beatdown. That is why you played so many copies. They got so much bonus to power after you flipped that if you had 5+ at a site, you would easily over power the opponent and retrieve a card with each one deployed.<br />
<br />
After 2 months of this crap, they made the first errata to only allow one Operative per site and they no longer occupied by themselves. Though this did hurt the original deck type, it still allowed for a retarded set up for lightside by just deploying one with a Rebel Snowspeeder for protection from being hit or eaten. Then Epps could deploy and finish off any character that tried to invade the planet. The deck could still get drain bonuses, destiny bonuses, and massive forfeit. <br />
What Got Changed:<br />
With the creation of Death Star II, effects that later became shields were made to totally shut down this strategy. <br />
<br />
<br />
(08)  Frozen Assets / Draw Their Fire Beatdown<br />
<br />
<br />
This deck was the quickest way to win a game EVER in the SWCCG history. I know this because I chose to play it for over two years. It was very simple. Get a good amount of power at a site, play Frozen Assets to freeze their force pile and get Draw Their Fire out so that in battle, they couldnt pay the +1 force to play ANY of their Interrupts including Ghhk. This meant you didnt have to worry about anything. No SAC, I Have You Now, dueling, Hidden Weapons, nothing. It was just battle and game. The weird thing about it was that the strategy could be played in multiple deck types. You could use Profit, MWYHL, TRMs, QMC, and even Hidden Base. All that was required was these two cards and enough power. You decided where the beatdown would happen. <br />
<br />
<br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
* Frozen Assets<br />
* Draw Their Fire<br />
* Quick Beatdown either in Space or Ground<br />
<br />
 <br />
Because of the many different types of decks, I really couldnt go into too much detail on what the main cards were. The easily way to do this was with Luke and Obi. Because with Courage of a Skywalker and Jedi Presence, you could get Luke by himself up to power 20+. Then add a Chewie for 12 more with Obi and destiny, you would be in the 40s. Time this with a lone Vader or maybe a random 2 characters at a site. You could easily cause 35+ cards in overflow if you could hit the character(s) with lightsabers. Many times, with Jedi Luke with Chewie, I could get my power into the 50s, so they had to lose their whole reserve deck after their 3rd turn. The key was setting up the activation as well as having all the key cards in your hand. Sometimes it was really fast, and others it could take a few turns. In the end, it never mattered, but once the Assets was down, they never had any force to stop anything you were doing. So the game would just end. <br />
<br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Frozen Assets can now be canceled with a mere shield. <br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
(09) - Computer Interface (V) First Turn EBO<br />
<br />
<br />
The first totally retarded strategy completely created by the PC. It was just one of those cards that slipped through the cracks and didnt even come to the surface until after a year of its release. The deck completely worked around the card Computer Interface (V) which would allow you to go through you deck completely to set up EBO with Y-Wings as long as you could get a Lobot (V) to Cloud City first turn. <br />
<br />
  <br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* Yavin 4: Throne Room (starting)<br />
* 8+ Copies of Lobot (V)<br />
* 18+ Copies of Computer Interface (V)<br />
* Free Deploy characters (Phylo, Tigaro (V), and KalFal)<br />
* 6 Copies of Y-Wings<br />
* 5 Systems<br />
* Insurrection Combo, Wokling (V), and Strike Planning (starting)<br />
* Cloud City: Docking Bay<br />
* EBO Effect and Sites<br />
* Protection Interrupts (It Can Wait, Yoda Stew, and Houjix)<br />
<br />
<br />
This deck was the easiest thing ever to play. Computer Interface (V) allowed you to look at the top 3 cards and take any number of them into hand and put the rest back. As long as you always had a Computer Interface (V) to play, you could go through your whole deck and get every card out needed to set up EBO first turn for a drain of 12+. All of your characters deployed for free and when you got EBO going, your Y-Wings would be free also. So you really only needed the force for the protection Interrupts. You could go through you whole deck until there was nothing left but Computer Interfaces and Lobots. The Yoda Stew allowed you to get some of those extra Lobots back into your Force so you could protect Lobot from next turn beatdown. Although the deck could be beat if there was no Lobot in your opening hand or you got to the point of not having a Computer Interface to play. The reason it was so retarded is if you could get two turns of full drain out on the darkside, they would not have the resources to take down all of your ships or get Resistance going. The deck was simply way too fast, and way too unfair. Once again, it was played at Origins, which gave it time to be errataed before Worlds. So no one had to play it when it would have mattered. <br />
<br />
<br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Computer Interface (V) was errataed to say that the card can only work once per turn. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(10) - Den of Thieves (V) / Super Activation<br />
<br />
<br />
This deck was created by Brandon Schele early in 2005 right after V8 was released. The card was built around a Scum based deck, much like the Scum decks you see today, only it abused the original printed Text of DOT (V) to get you retarded amounts of activation even during the opponents turn. The original cards allowed you to activation 3 force for each character with Plotting to Kill Jabba in their lore. You were allowed to do this each time you activated a force. So if you started Wipe Them Out, All of Them (NON V), you could activate monster force during both players turns. <br />
<br />
<br />
Main Cards in Deck:<br />
<br />
* Scum based start (Tat System, Jabbas Palace, & Audience Chamber)<br />
* Den of Thieves (V)<br />
* Wipe Them Out, All of them,  <br />
<br />
<br />
This deck is still very new so, I dont need to go into too much detail. If you are curious to how the deck was built and set up. It is currently posted on Brandons page. <br />
<br />
What Got Changed:<br />
Den of Thieves (V) was given the errata to limit the bonus to being only 1 additional force in place of the 3 and it now said only during your activate phase. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, there you have it for now. I know there are MANY other broken decks out there that I didnt mention. I plan to add them over time like I said. Please dont rate me low because I forgot one. I did my best from my experience and have no problem fixing this later. We have to start somewhere for anything to become truly great. Right now, I would call this good, but not complete. Over time, it will be complete. I need your help to do it. So please feel free to dmail me ANY broken decks you remember that need to be in here for recognition.<br />
<br />
