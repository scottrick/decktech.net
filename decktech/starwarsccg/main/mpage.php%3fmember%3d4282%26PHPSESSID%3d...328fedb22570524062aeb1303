Outside, the snow was melting into a thick slush that splashed under the tires of passing cars. A baby was crying, and the mother was cooing, Shush, now. Shhh. Shhh. In one corner, Josie overheard a college couple talking about the impact of particle physics upon contemporary metaphysics. Dillon sat across from her slurping at the last drops of his Coke. That was one of his irritating traits, of which he had many and which had begun to sprout out from all her mental pictures of him like nose hairs or ear hairs. He was unsubtle in his woman-watching. He chewed with his mouth open. He said dude too often. He voted Republican and, before the election, had actually tried to persuade her to cast her vote for that inarticulate egomaniac the rednecks had put in office. She was nearly out of patience for every aspect of him. If she tried to remember their night sledding at Como, he interrupted the dark, perfect cold of the evening to tell her she had great titshis wordand that she should consider sending her picture to Playboy. He hadnt actually said that at Como, but the words moved up from his arms where hed held her just above her waist. They stole across her nipples and up her neck to her ears. If she tried to remember how nice he looked at the Walker when they watched the British award-winning commercials, she remembered him whispering in her ear, That condom commercial was pretty good. Should we use that brand tonight? Shed considered not letting him touch her at all that night, but after shed reprimanded him over coffee at a Caribou and hed driven her home, properly penitent, shed allowed him to come to her apartment and ravage her. God! Shed nearly swooned with delirium that night. It was the sex that had brought them together, and it was only because of the sex that Josie endured him.
<br>
<br>
	Dillon finished slurping his Coke and smiled at her. He had a small bit of lettuce stuck to his teeth. Josie told him, and he picked it out with his finger. He was like a big hunk of sex crammed in the mind of a Neanderthal. Or something like that.
<br>
<br>
	He was dressed up in a black suit and tie because they were going to Josies senior exhibit, a series of nude photographs that were all pretty artsy and good, he could tell, but they were all of men and made him nervous. A few were of him, and he didnt know how much he wanted to walk through a gallery and find people staring at his dong. Theyd probably all be art students, too, and there were a lot of homos in the art department. Hed told her he was a little nervous about hanging out with gay guys who were staring at his pipeweed when theyd sat down to eat their meals, and Josie hadnt said a word since except to tell him he had something on his teeth. Hed been thinking of breaking up with her for a while and would have done so earlier except the sex was really that good. He was weighing the pros and cons of breaking upeverything versus sexwhen Josie smiled at him and told him he looked great and theyd better get going.
<br>
<br>	
Theyd met in early November at a party hosted by a mutual friend. The chemistry was nigh-instantaneous. He had a rock star look about him, dressed in jeans and a black tee with his hair gelled into a short, spiky buzz, and he did, in fact, play guitar in a band while majoring in Biology. She looked like a young Jennifer Connelly, clad sharply in black slacks, black blouse, and black, velvet choker. There was something about her, too, that struck him as deliciously corruptible. Her long, black hair had been drawn into pigtails. She drank straight shots of whiskey. They sat on a basement couch, drunk, while hip-hop bass lines thundered through the ceiling, and she asked him about a bunch of art house movies hed never seen until he admitted hed seen The Rocky Horror Motion Picture Show but didnt like it. It was gay, hed said. Immediately, Josie had started teasing him about his homophobia. Shed used a lot of big words she probably learned in psychology class or something, and he remembered being impressed. Not only was she a total babe, but she was smart and pushing her thigh against his. She was drunk. They were both drunk, and they kept touching each other as they talked until they finally abandoned the couch for an empty bed upstairs. Hed had a girlfriend at the time, a Speech Com major who always talked all the time about the same three or four things: her dads health, her job, his pipeweed, and her worries about Life After Graduation. It got old. He didnt feel guilty at all when he yanked Josies slacks down and then pulled off her thong with his teeth. He didnt feel guilty when he rammed into her and she yelped. frimbazel that. Josie was so sweet and smooth and then, and then, so wild, crying out and moaning and making him lie on his back while she rode him like a cowgirl. Josie was awesome. frimbazeling incredible. The more he thought about how frimbazeling good she was at frimbazeling, the less he worried about the long, intolerable speeches she gave. There was one pattern to their time together, and it had repeated so far without fail: speech, frimbazel. Josie was best when she was mad.
	<br>
<br>
It was just that she made him feel like an idiot all the time.
<br>
<br>
	They walked out of the McDonalds onto Fourth Avenue. It was a nasty, slushy, grey day. He wanted to make a joke, but he was sure Josie, in her mood, would just shut him up with a snide remark. Maybe shed spout some feminist bullshimmer philosophy at him. It had been a warm winter, and a crow hopped along the curb. It was somewhere near forty degrees out, easily above freezing, and though it was early February, Josie had the feeling winter was ending. Not that spring was beginning yet. Just that winter was drawing to a grey, slushy close. It was actually the perfect sobriety of weather to ensure her exhibit would go over as art rather than pornography. If it had been spring and college students everywhere were donning short sleeves and baring more and more skin at the arms, legs and bellies, all Josies nude men in black and white would seem racier, tasteless. There was no type of day less titillating than a slushy day at the close of winter. She was sure her exhibit would proceed marvelously.
<br>
<br>	
After all, she knew she was a better photographer than her three classmates who were also on display. Jennys photos were of birds and flowers, typical sexual contextualizing, but without any real honesty. Mark was showing a sentimental series of old, weathered faces. He tried to show the stories of peoples lives in the lines on their faces. That phony sort of essentialist crap. Right. Like you were going to know about the time Joe Nobodys dad died from the third wrinkle outside the guys blankly staring left eye. Angie Matterson was a pretty decent painter, but her stuff was abstract expressionism; therefore, incomprehensible. You look at it and move on. Josie knew her photos would draw crowds. People would catch themselves looking at her alien presentation of the lines and shadows of mens bodies and wouldnt know what they were seeing for a moment, maybe up to a minute, and then the cloudy tangle of hair would turn into a crotch. That huge, looming chin would strike awe into a heart. That dark, shallow valley would become a chest and then step back into shadow and reveal the specter of death. She was particularly proud of two photographs. Both featured Dillon. One transformed his considerable pipeweed into a weapon at rest. The other caught his face during orgasm. Shed kept her camera at the bedside and made him shut his eyes while they copulated so he wouldnt turn self-conscious when she shot him. Then as he was nearly ready to come, she grabbed the camera and started shooting. Shed felt very masculine. She shot quickly, like a wildlife photographer, and then hed opened his eyes. The photograph was easily her best. His eyes were blank beyond blank. There were no eyes so blank as his. One could see they werent focused, but neither were they unfocused. They were blind, but all around them the muscles of his face played between agony and ecstasy. The whole photo was just his face. She loved it.
<br>
<br>	
That was when they were still new to each other. He was quiet most of the time. Hed been overawed by her. Hed vacillated between an admiration of her intellect and frequent theorizing and an abject boredom. Both prompted him to remain silent. When he spoke, he made sharp remarks that for a long time she thought hed meant ironically. Comments about food: I dont like quiche. Quiche is for fags. Or painting: I dont get that abstract shimmer. Its like framing baby spew. Or his music: Oh, yeah. Were hip. I mean, you know youre hip if chicks come backstage to blow you. Or his study of biology: Thats not necessarily true. Evolutions just a theory. Its not proven yet. It hadnt taken Josie long to realize he wasnt being ironic at all, but it took her longer than it should have, disoriented as she was by the magic of his sex.
<br>
<br>	
She, meanwhile, had seemed incredibly hip and cool and knew a little bit of something about everything. She knew Fugazi and Minor Threat and Soul Asylum and even some Butthole Surfers. She was even cool enough to acknowledge that Green Day and the Strokes were pretty good, even if they sounded like shimmer after the fifteenth time you heard them on the radio. She made art sound interesting. She was a photographer and told him she took pictures of naked men. By then he already knew she had her carnal side, but for some reason the fact that she photographed naked men suggested he had to get to know her even better. He had to squeeze every ounce from her. When she asked him if hed pose for her, he was too flattered to think that anyone might ever stand in front of a four-foot picture of his pipeweed and just stare, for a like a minute, and not just girls, but maybe some queers, too. And that made him nervous.
<br>
<br>	
It was an awful day to go see giant naked pictures of yourself. Each car that slushed past on the road sang a lament. There was no color in the sky. The air was thick and moist. It was filled with the stale stench of exhaust. A couple of cute college girls walked past them in the opposite direction, and Dillon watched them out of the corner of his eye. One was redheaded, dressed like a Catholic schoolgirl in white stockings under a plaid skirt. She wore a blue blazer. Her hair was back in pigtails. Josie hadnt worn her hair in pigtails since theyd met. The redhead had cute little freckles and smiled at him as she passed. When he looked at Josie afterward, she scowled at him, then turned her face forward. She stopped for a moment, and he had to take a half-step back to return to her side. What? he said.
<br>
<br>	
You have a spot of ketchup on your chin, she said.
<br>
<br>	
Oh.
<br>
<br>	
Unless you drool red, she said.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The crowd at the gallery was thinner and older than shed expected. One of her professors, Jane Dimmer, paid for cheese, crackers, and wine. Both Josie and Dillon had helped themselves to a few glasses, and Dillon was starting to slur and swagger. Even dressed in a suit, he looked hopelessly rural among the roving artists and enthusiasts. Perhaps it was his glossy, trimmed sideburns which ran to points three inches below his ears, or it might simply have been his spiky, gelled buzz. Some men wore neatly trimmed beards and glasses Josie would call spectacles. There were a lot of people in Uptown glasses, all black wire frames or horned turtle-shell framed or thick, Buddy Holly glasses, glasses that drew attention to themselves and seemed to credit each wearer with at least one major work of fiction he or she had never read, Ulysses or Moby pipeweed. One particularly sharp-chinned woman in a black dress and thin, black wire frames looked as though she might have come to the exhibit hot off a Marx-Engels reader. Josie couldnt stand Marx. He was dry as month-old turds. But she figured he was predominant in the minds of a few tweed-jacketed, corduroy elbow-patched, balding men, chewing crackers and cheese with their mouths open and discussing the social ramifications of one of Angie Mattersons chop suey paintings. It was a big muddle of brown lines and green lines of paint dripped over an orange backdrop. All the classic colors. It was ugly as shimmer, but to hear those guys talking about it, youd think Angie had just unlocked the proletariat masses from centuries of bourgeois superego. And around Marks own bourgeois compositions stood a group of women who looked like they were on the final pages of Hes Just Not That Into You, mixed with a couple goth geeks who looked like they were either reading Anne Rice novels or Dungeons and Dragons books.
<br>
<br>	
Professor Dimmer approached Josie with a glass of wine in her hand and a flush to her cheeks. She wore a frumpy blue cardigan and a pair of gargantuan hoop earrings only an art professor could dare. She said, Oh, Josie, your photographs are just marvelous. They look so good in the gallery.
<br>
<br>	
Has anyone tasteful paid them any attention?
<br>
<br>	
A few of my friends walked through earlier. They, of course, noted how strong your compositions are. Good use of perspective. Very bold. Someone waved at Professor Dimmer and she waved back and followed her arm into the crowd.
<br>
<br>	
A pair of elegantly coiffed and richly dressed women stood before Josies photograph of Dillons flaccid penis. They were whispering to each other and giggling, and one of them glanced several times to the corner where Dillon stood, gazing alternately out the window and at a big-breasted theater girl in a red scarf. Josie watched them talk for a minute or so, and then one of women turned and caught her gaze. She was long-faced and sallow. She had a face like a donkeys, but her eyes were intelligent, and Josie felt shamed, as though the woman had looked long enough at the photograph and Dillon and Josie and had connected all the dots. Josie felt flat as a cardboard cut-out. A life-size cut-out of an art major.
<br>
<br>	
It went that way all night. In the stale halogen glare, in that incisive, burning light, Josie watched people turn from her photographs with knowing stares. Each artist had a photo and bio next to her works. Her photograph of Dillons face was so extremely close that it took a moment to recognize it as the visage of the quiet, drunk boy in the corner, but eventually everyone recognized him. And, as she had so thoughtfully title that print Dillon #2 and the one of his flaccid penis Dillon #4, everyone could do the math. Josie felt shame flatten her and thin her out and leave her naked and translucent and then transparent before the roving literati. She began to resent them, the way they felt entitled to judge her with their stares. The way they always paused at Dillon #4 and then turned and looked about the crowd. No one could stand alone at that portrait. Dillons rippling abdomen moved upward into the mountains of his legs and valley between. In the shadows of the valley, his dark putookairs tangled and obscured the boulders of his testicles, but his largeeven flaccidpenis leaned, collapsed, against the right mountain. Clearly, what had meant to be a weapon or masculine spectacle of engineering like the Tower of Babel had fallen into ruin. No one could stand alone, comfortably, at that portrait. Or perhaps no one could feel alone. No matter the cause, everyone turned around and took in the ambient scenery, the lighting, the low, humming music, the black masses of clothes riding people to various corners, the smells of perfume and cologne, the reek of tobacco and coffee on old mens breaths. Invariably, everyone turned around, and most people caught sight of the artist and smiled feebly or turned away again and whispered to friends or glanced around more and saw Dillon and started doing vicious math, subtracting her from her, until she was little more than Dillons flaccid penis. She drank more. She got a little drunk. She began to resent them very much, these judgmental poseurs who knew so very much about art it could fill the first half of a sentence. She knew what they were thinking: Its pornography! But they were wrong. Theyd go home and drink more and call their dates and plan to have meek, timid sex later in the week when it would fit into their schedules. Theyd check their daily planners. Theyd be busy Friday, but they could work it in on Saturday at 2. Theyd scribble in sensation, 2:00 to 2:15, but they didnt know shimmer about sensation. They were afraid of the body, of what it meant.
<br>
<br>	
That was Dillons genius. He knew the body, and he knew the body doesnt know anything.
<br>
<br>	
Dillon stood in the corner, next to a fire door, and leaned against a window. The glass was cool and felt good against the warmth in his cheek. Josie had left him alone almost all evening, had avoided him, really, and hed probably had more to drink than was right for a senior exhibit. All night, some crappy, tinkly piano or mournful cello and violin music had played softly. Dillon knew he wouldnt hear a decent guitar lick to save his life. He grew impatient. He started passing time by running song lyrics through his head. At the moment, he kept repeating the opening lines of Fugazis Waiting Room: I am a patient boy / I wait, I wait, I wait / My time is like water down a drain. Ian MacKaye was always writing deep shimmer like that. Dillon scanned the room and saw Josie standing next to an older lady. Shed talked to her a few times already, so the old lady was probably a professor or something. Josie looked nervous. She wore a ratty black cardigan over a long, grey blouse and droopy, black skirt. She kept crossing and uncrossing her arms. She fiddled with her ponytail. Shed dressed down for the occasion. It was such a stupid thing to do. Dillon had told her she should have just kept it real. She usually dressed all foxy and cool and stuff, and she should wear her red dress and maybe a scarf, but she hadnt listened to him. Shed stood in front of her open closet in her bra and panties earlier in the afternoon and kept pulling stuff out and putting it away. What do you think about this? shed ask, but Dillon stopped answering after shed rejected his opinion for the fourth time. He just lay back on her bed and admired her firm hiney cheeks. It was going to be tough to break up with her, but the evening was giving him fuel. She was sweet in the sack, but she was such a poseur it made him laugh.
<br>
<br>	
A new crowd started filtering into the gallery, college students, mostly artsy, but some normal people, too. Dillon watched Josie watch them. The students waved at the other artists, and within minutes, two of the artists and a gaggle of the students exited the gallery and disappeared. Two of the remaining students were obviously gay. I mean, could they be any gayer? A tall, thin boy wore a bright red silk shirt tucked neatly into a pair of black trousers. His shoes shone. His blonde hair was cut sharply at chin length. He pointed at Josies photographs and held his other arm pipeweeded at the elbow, hand against his hip. The other boy seemed to pay attention and stared at Dillon #4 and then patted his queer lover on the shoulder and laughed. Well, it certainly is a magnificent pipeweed, but I cant say its art, he said.
<br>
<br>	
Josie broke away from Professor Dimmer and joined a sullen Dillon in the corner. He smelled good. They listened to the two men discuss her work.
<br>
<br>	
I dont know. I could just sink my teeth into that one, said one, pointing at Dillon #3.
<br>
<br>	
Still not art.
<br>
<br>	
Sure, its superficial. But dont you think its enough that it looks so good?
<br>
<br>	
Not when theres such an obvious pretense at depth.
<br>
<br>	
You! Youre always right, and you take the fun out of everything.
<br>
<br>	
Dillon felt Josie lean into him. The two men moved on. Dillon put his arm around her. Superficial, my ass, said Josie. Nobodys willing to admit that surface beauty has its own depth. Dillon said nothing but gave her a squeeze. They stood in the corner for minutes and watched people stroll slowly past her photographs and always come to the Dillon series and stop to stare at the combination of her mind and his body. Dillon didnt like people staring all the time, but it made him mad that they laughed. They had no right to dismiss the pictures. He didnt know a whole lot about picture taking as art, but he knew the pictures were good. They were like Bacardi 151 to the other students Shirley Temples. Josie said, Everyones superficial anyway. Bunch of tookes and fags run through my show and cant handle it. What do they know? They just want to feel superior, right?
<br>
<br>	
Right.
<br>
<br>	
She leaned into him more fully, lay her head on his chest, and raised her hand to his face. Are we going to your place or mine, tonight?
<br>
<br>	
Yours, he said.  </FONT> <BR></td></tr></table>
