<font size=4><B>Virtual Set 15 Game Summaries:</B></font><BR>
4/4/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s WYS Beats (Scrambled Transmission (V)) played moderately. The Force choke this game was key. On top of killing my Political Effects, he deployed Captial Support (V), rendering my attrition meaningless. A first turn deployment of Ability, Ability, Ability never caused any Force loss. TIEs without Hyperspeed were cornered into losing battles. FL-21.<BR>
4/4/08: My pSavrip played conservatively vs. Wise&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played aggressively. The engine limped along without Threepio, and I never controlled Tosche Station. Two blind Senses failed to cancel Masterful Move, so I was forced to resort to using Yoda&#39;s text. The second play killed Savrip, and the deck was compromised from that point forward. FL-7.<BR>
<BR>
4/8/08: SYCFA w/CPI played moderately vs. QMC played aggressively. Path Of Least Resistance and spies cleared Death Star Gunners and prevented the successful play of Commence Primary Ignition. FL-33.<BR>
4/8/08: My pSavrip played moderately vs. jarnotp&#39;s  CR(V) Tusken Raiders played moderately. He was Force choked badly, and between being unable to satisfy Battle Order and my retrieval of 2-3 each turn, he was never able to make a lasting dent anywhere. FW+33.<BR>
4/8/08: My pSavrip played moderately vs. OldAnticuchos&#39; Invasion played conservatively. Advantage set the pace of the game, but time and again Quick Draw (V) saber swings missed my opponent&#39;s tanks. When Laser Cannon Battery sent Home One packing, things degraded further. FL-10.<BR>
<BR>
4/9/08: My pSavrip played aggressively vs. Severus&#39; Court w/ Sarlacc played aggressively. Catastrophic blind destiny draws dominated the game, and all three characters I deployed to Tatooine were captured. Once Court flipped, feeding the Sarlacc retrieved my opponent&#39;s entire Lost Pile. FL-32.<BR>
4/9/08: My pSavrip played aggressively vs. Severus&#39; Court w/ Sarlacc played moderately. Nobody was captured, and with the pSavrip Engine going, Sev was shut down. FW+38.<BR>
<BR>
4/10/08: My pSavrip played moderately vs. telecaster&#39;s LSC played cautiously. Both of us started the game with strong hands. There were some small-scale battles, but tele lost as many Lightsaber Combats as he won. FW+34.<BR>
<BR>
4/11/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. telecaster&#39;s Profit played moderately. It was a damage race from turn two onward, and Imperial Decree (V) and This Is Outrageous made tele look like he was standing still. There was only one battle. FW+27.<BR>
4/11/08: My pSavrip played moderately vs. OldAnticuchos&#39; Invasion played moderately. Quick Draw (V) saber swings frequently hit my opponent&#39;s tanks, and when that didn&#39;t work, attrition did the trick. FW+22.<BR>
<BR>
4/12/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. Kinslayer&#39;s QMC (w/ ST(V)) played moderately. He lost 6 Force early to cancel 3 Political Effects, but Squabbling Delegates retrieved two Motion Supported. Cloud City Celebration helped for a turn, but Limited Resources and battle damage were the final straw in a game where I dominated at Bespin. FW+19.<BR>
<BR>
4/14/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. egonolsen&#39;s SYCFA KDY(V) played moderately. Two consecutive Grimtaashes hit him for a total of 8 cards, including some linchpins. Once my retrieval loop was setup, he didn&#39;t have any other options but to draw up. FW+35.<BR>
4/14/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s WYS Beats played moderately. Force choke and Capital Support (V) dominated the game when he couldn&#39;t overwhelm me with power outright. The end game was an unfulfilling differential dance. FL-21.<BR>
<BR>
4/15/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. Kinslayer&#39;s CCT SD(V) played moderately. Battle Plan, Ultimatum and Control prevented about 23 Force loss, and he deployed a ton of cards. That bought me enough time to cover the Tatooine sites and go on the offensive at Brian&#39;s sites. FW+18.<BR>
<BR>
4/16/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played aggressively. I never broke his attrition, never hit with a weapon, and managed to cover 28 battle damage by losing 3 mains from hand and my character at the site before succumbing to heavy Control phase and Visage losses. FL-32.<BR>
4/16/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played aggressively. This game was a runaway in the same manner that the last one was, except that the Force choke was worse. Wise controlled every battleground at the end of the game. FL-26.<BR>
4/16/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played aggressively. I caused battle damage in multiple battles, but sacrificed too much to shut down Visage damage. FL-23.<BR>
<BR>
4/17/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Kinslayer&#39;s Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately. Choke and damage, his weapons hit, and mine missed. Attrition was meaningless. FL-28.<BR>
4/17/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Kinslayer&#39;s Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately. Choke and damage, his weapons hit, and mine missed. Mantellian Savrip was canceled, and I quit after losing a mid-game battle by over 20. FL-34.<BR>
4/17/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. Kinslayer&#39;s Hat played moderately. Evasion was never played, his guys got hit, my forfeit covered battle damage, his Force drains got canceled and mine got increased, I retrieved, and he lost. FW+22.<BR>
<BR>
4/18/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played aggressively vs. Severus&#39; MWYHL played aggressively. There was lots of early battling, but Coward prevented most of Sev&#39;s retrieval, and my retrieval was uncosted. Sev finally completed Jedi Test #6, but he was taking 4 damage between turns and was unable to mount a comeback. FW+13.<BR>
<BR>
4/20/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. FeelGoodLost&#39;s TIGIH played aggressively. Blaster Proficiency dominated a game in which I drew everything but cards that could help me win the game. FL-16.<BR>
<BR>
4/21/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. egonolsen&#39;s Court w/Rancor. Tatooine Celebration covered his damage, and he never managed to capture or eat my characters. FW+31.<BR>
<BR>
4/23/08: pSavrip played conservatively vs. spideyguy0&#39;s AoBS Mistryl played aggressively. He got going early, killed Mantellian Savrip, scored an Elis beatdown for 10, and scored a second beatdown for 10. FL-23.<BR>
4/23/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. Wise&#39;s WYS Beats played conservatively. A four battle destiny beatdown at Tatooine ensured a quick loss. Capital Support (V) negated key attrition twice. FL-29.<BR>
<BR>
4/24/08: My TRMbuster played conservatively vs. egonolsen&#39;s Court w/Rancor played moderately. Leia bailed Luke out of the Dungeon, and DTF/Beggar beats cleared ego from the table. FW+30.<BR>
4/24/08: My TRMbuster played conservatively vs. egonolsen&#39;s Court w/Rancor played moderately. An attempt to capture backfired and cost ego 8 in battle damage. Taking 6 damage a turn during control phase and causing a net loss of 0 led ego to concede. FW+35.<BR>
<BR>
4/25/08: KToD Senate Variant played moderately vs. Severus&#39; MWYHL played moderately. I established heavy damage once Tikkes blanked Honor Of The Jedi, and from that point on, it was about tracking destinies to hit Jedi at his Naboo site. FW+11.<BR>
4/25/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. patmagroin&#39;s Court w/Rancor played conservatively. Early space battles ended with Home One dominating Tatooine, and pat was forced to pursue my Jedi across Tatooine. When he finally arrived, he never was able to fire any one of three weapons. FW+34.<BR>
<BR>
4/28/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. DarthCrusher&#39;s RTP played moderately. Visage, drains at the War Room, and a failed EPP strike led Patrick to concede. FW+31.<BR>
<BR>
4/29/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. kurtisblow&#39;s ISBeats played moderately. He locked down a Force drain of 2 that never budged all game, but his attempt to take Tatooine from me ultimately fizzled. Yoda, Master Of The Force (V) canceled a last ditch Elis Helrot, and from that point on, I was retrieving more than kurt was going to damage me for. FW+17.<BR>
<BR>
4/30/08: KToD Senate Variant played aggressively vs. troopershark_ny&#39;s IITFYS(V) Naboo Mains played moderately. He outactivated me 2:1, and between Leia (V) and Scrambled Transmission (V), the drain race was rigged in his favor, and I was unable to mobilize any significant offensive. FL-9.<BR>
<BR>
5/1/08: TRMbuster played aggressively vs. master_luke&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played aggressively. I looped EPP&#39;s with impunity all game, and I never lost a Force to Visage. master_luke passed on his only opportunity to pull No Escape, and it cost him a respectable differential. FW+35.<BR>
<BR>
5/5/08: TRMbuster played conservatively vs. master_luke&#39;s ISB LSD(V) played conservatively. An early Houjix against Sunsdown, two plays of Grimtaash on a hand too large, the two-time Sensing of Twi&#39;lek Advisor, and finally Alter prevented master from ever scoring a free or reduced deployment. The first battle cleared him from space, the second cost him all but a pair of ISB Agents, and the third followed Sorry About The Mess, setting up the beatdown of a lone trooper. FW+33.<BR>
<BR>
5/6/08: TRMbuster played conservatively vs. Kryptofis&#39; Monkey TIEs played moderately. First-turn Revolution on Wakeelmui reduced Kryptofis&#39; activation to 1, and only Kuat Drive Yards (V) prevented the game from degenerating into a total rout. I ended up grabbing two systems for a total Force drain of 6. Key Interrupts were Sensed, and his small fleet crumbled. FW+29.<BR>
<BR>
5/12/08: TRMbuster played moderately vs. egonolsen&#39;s SYCFA KDY(V) played moderately. There were a number of space battles, and a significant amount of system-to-system movement. Weapon Levitation hurt ego on the turn he deployed Darth Sidious and Dark Jedi Lightsaber (V) and pulled Lightsaber Parry with Captain Bewil (V). The end game dragged on for many turns, with overwhelming power, undercover spies, and It Could Be Worse preventing either side from Force draining effectively. In the end, Hyperspeed was a determining factor in preventing ego from blocking my Force drains. FW+10.<BR>
<BR>
5/13/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played aggressively vs. master_luke&#39;s WYS played aggressively. Though Vader didn&#39;t deploy until the end of the game, the damage flowed swiftly towards master_luke. He was never able to effectively play Interrupts from Lost Pile. FW+21.<BR>
<BR>
5/15/08: TRMbuster played conservatively vs. teaforthetillerman&#39;s BHBM played moderately. His LSD(V)-Sith Probe Droid (V) start allowed him to begin dueling Luke With Lightsaber almost immediately, and when No Escape finally negated Honor Of The Jedi, it was time to showdown at the Throne Room. Sorry About The Mess & Blaster Proficiency was key, and both Colo Claw Fish and Beggar were instrumental in limiting the tillerman&#39;s options. FW+26.<BR>
<BR>
5/16/08: TRMbuster played moderately vs. Manhi&#39;s SYCFA KDY(V) played conservatively. He didn&#39;t win any battles, and his Force drains had minimal impact. Grimtaash destroyed his tech, and my Force drains did the rest. Mess emptied my hand for differential. FW+39.<BR>
<BR>
5/19/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played aggressively vs. troopershark_ny&#39;s MWYHL played conservatively. Destiny manipulation was key in preserving his Jedi, but eventually Sidious managed to put four out of play. That was the only thing I accomplished during the course of the game. FL-22.<BR>
<BR>
5/21/08: TRMbuster played moderately vs. Manhi&#39;s Court w/Rancor played aggressively. I took out Scum And Villainy early, but made a trio of tactical errors that dragged the game out. Luke was eaten by the Rancor. Then Lando Calrissian, Scoundrel ate Hermi Odle. FW+25.<BR>
<BR>
5/22/08: TRMbuster played moderately vs. Severus&#39; Hunt Down Docking Bays played cautiously. Honor Of The Jedi prevented me from losing any Force to Visage Of The Emperor, and yet I managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by allowing my opponent to play I Have You Now for overflow in a battle where Draw Their Fire would have prevented it. FL-10.<BR>
<BR>
5/23/08: TRMbuster played cautiously vs. Manhi&#39;s CCT/IG-88(V) played cautiously. After a lengthy mid-game, his shields were busted, leaving me free to clear his presence from the table. If he had not grabbed How Did We Get Into This Mess?, I win by 40+. FW+30.<BR>
5/23/08: Invasion Dueling played moderately vs. SunRa&#39;s Profit played moderately. The game was fairly interactive: Don&#39;t Forget The Droids (V) was Sensed, A Jedi&#39;s Resilience canceled the result of the one duel that wasn&#39;t tied on his blind destiny draws, and Han was ultimately freed. An illegal take-back was insisted upon, and the disadvantage it cost me resulted in my loss. FL-22.<BR>
<BR>
5/27/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. deserteagle0906&#39;s BHBM played moderately. Vader was placed out of play before Luke could be dueled, and eagle confessed that he had no Masterful Move for my Mantellian Savrip. I would have setup Celebration, retrieved my entire Lost Pile, and put back my hand with Threepio. FW+40.<BR>
5/27/08: TRMbuster played aggressively vs. Remaker&#39;s SYCFeAr played cautiously. The game was defined by me being choked and resorting to deploying the first location I drew, Alderaan: Blown Away. Sidious took the Docking Bay anyway, and my entire fleet succumbed to the few star destroyers he deployed. FL-25.<BR>
<BR>
5/28/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. Kryptofis&#39; ROps played aggressively. An early Grimtaash halved his hand, and from then on, his Objective was constantly bounced back to the zero-side. He initiated all of two Force drains, and had a number of Interrupts canceled. I was able to retrieve my entire Lost Pile before he could draw up. FW+37.<BR>
<BR>
5/29/08: Invasion Dueling played moderately vs. egonolsen&#39;s HB(V) Naboo played moderately. The game started out slowly, with activation kept at very low levels. We sparred at Naboo with ships that were immune to the best destinies we could throw at each other, and there was some scuffling in the Throne Room as well. A Maul Strikes duel was Sensed, but Qui-Gon was eventually sent packing. Once egonolsen was forced to regroup on Naboo by landing the Falcon, the game was pretty much decided. FW+24.<BR>
<BR>
5/30/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. Manhi&#39;s LSC played aggressively. His blind draws were pretty bad, and I outactivated him 2:1 for the whole game. My Jedi were able to Force drain for most of the game, Alter against Mantellian Savrip was Sensed, and my retrieval engine undid most of the damage he caused me. FW+31.<BR>
5/30/08: Invasion Dueling played aggressively vs. tusken84&#39;s MWYHL played moderately. Immune-to-Coward Jedi Testing retrieved all of Nico&#39;s Force loss. Grimtaash was the beginning of the end. Catastrophically low destinies were the end of the end. After losing the Throne Room to a lone and unarmed Obi-Wan Kenobi (V), I resigned. FL-33.<BR>
5/30/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. tusken84&#39;s LSC played moderately. Podracing caused some late game damage, but Yoda prevailed in the battles and survived lightsaber combat. Maul was placed out of play early, and the pSavrip engine recovered a good amount of Force loss. FW+30.<BR>
<BR>
6/3/08: pSavrip played aggressively vs. JayD&#39;s CCT Podracing played moderately. Battling at the sites kept things lively, and JayD&#39;s pressure ensured that I didn&#39;t retrieve more than I was taking in damage. Watto&#39;s Box made for a big win in the podrace, but Sebulba (V) was cleared from the table after that. Finally there was some battling at the system, and when I finally prevailed, JayD lost 12 Force in battle damage. FW+11.<BR>
<BR>
6/4/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. longcatislong&#39;s Harvest played aggressively. long&#39;s early attempts to cause meaningful attrition failed, and he never hit with a weapon. Visage and S&D took their toll, and after having his second Jedi placed out of play, he called the game. FW+20.<BR>
6/4/08: TRMbuster played aggressively vs. LordGanner&#39;s SYCFA Flip played moderately. Corran got me inside the Death Star, where EPP&#39;s hacked up all of the Death Star Gunners. Alderaan was saved, and LordGanner resigned. FW+34.<BR>
<BR>
6/6/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played cautiously vs. Manhi&#39;s Harvest (V) Mains played moderately. I drew bad destinies, and he drew good destinies. FL-16.<BR>
<BR>
6/9/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. kurtisblow&#39;s Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately. Out Of Commission & Transmission Terminated placed Vader out of play a turn after kurt picked up Vader with his zero-side. Corran Horn took out Visage Of The Emperor. With the pSavrip engine running, I was able to lock down Tosche activation at the point in the game where I needed it most, and I was able to negate kurt&#39;s damage engine. I also managed to track low destinies for Sense. kurt conceded once I pulled Battle Plan. FW+22.<BR>
<BR>
6/10/08: Light Senate Beats played aggressively vs. master_luke&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played moderately. I drew nothing but bad destinies, never hitting or breaking immunity to attrition. I conceded after getting thumped on the second beatdown attempt. FL-30.<BR>
6/10/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. Kinslayer&#39;s LSC played aggressively. Maul was placed out of play, as were two of my Jedi. Brian won the podrace. Timely Endor Occupations canceled my Tatooine Celebrations, but in the end Celebration stayed on table, as did Savrip. However, unlike previous games in this matchup, I failed to find Obi-Wan With Lightsaber until it was too late, and Circle finally got him. FL-18.<BR>
6/10/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. dough54321&#39;s CR(V) Tatooine Mains played moderately. A single Don&#39;t Forget The Droids (V) spanking turned a blow-out drain race into a close drain race. FW+7.<BR>
<BR>
6/11/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. longcatislong&#39;s QMC played moderately. Goo came out early, and I paid a fortune to deploy mains, but they seldom left the table. He managed to evade the most severe of battle damage, but he didn&#39;t cause much in the process. FW+32.<BR>
6/11/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. master_luke&#39;s Profit played moderately. First Strike and a persistent Force choke kept the game close. Sidious placed three of master_luke&#39;s Jedi out of play, but an attempt to inflict the same end on Mace failed. In the end, it was Mace who saved the day. FL-5.<BR>
<BR>
6/12/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. Wise&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played moderately. Visage Of The Emperor was canceled before it ever caused Force loss, and for the greatest portion of the game, I held Tosche Station. However, predictably persistent EPP strikes and repeated bad Force Pile draws and bad destiny draws eroded my position until I lost control of the table. Your Powers Are Weak, Old Man destroyed three Jedi Lightsaber (V)&#39;s. I continued to draw badly as my approach became more desperate, and that sealed my final loss. FL-11.<BR>
<BR>
6/13/08: pSavrip played moderately vs. master_luke&#39;s Hunt Down Back Door played moderately. In this game, I did not get choked, and did not have Celebration or Savrip canceled. FW+16.<BR>
6/13/08: Hunt Down Docking Bays played moderately vs. Thew&#39;s HB Drains played conservatively. Direct damage overwhelmed Thew early, and he never attempted to disrupt me on the ground. Finally, I probed Thew&#39;s Hidden Base. Before Visage dealt the last blow, Force Lightning sent Vader to the Lost Pile. FW+20.<BR>
<BR>
6/16/08: Biggerest Blue played moderately vs. master_luke&#39;s Light Senate Beats played moderately. I flipped my Objective, Han, Chewie, And The Falcon came and left with battle damage, and master_luke conceded with Hoth firmly in my grasp. FW+22.  </FONT> <BR></td></tr></table>
