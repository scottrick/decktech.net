<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>2i and Magi Nation Duel at Gen Con - World Championship! posted by DeckTech on Mon Jul 29 2002 <br>Here it is, the big jewel of the MND crown!  The <b>World Championships</b> at GenCon.<br>
<br>
Jen Hunter reports in that the excitement is building to a frenzied pace for this event.  She invites all DeckTechers to either participate or stop by and take a gander at the highest level of play of this outstanding game.<br>
<br>
So far the MND attendance at cons this year has DOUBLED!  Get involved in this great game, because it's taking off.  And the best part is, it's taking off straight from the underneath... err, I mean underground!  You've got to love a game that's built from the ground up.<br>
<br>
Stop by and get a demo and some free stuff.  Meet the staff.  I want to call <b>Special Attention</b> to the Friday 2pm tournament<br>
<br>
2:00pm Magi-Nation Sealed Deck Tournament <br>
  Each player receives one starter and two boosters to build a deck, competing against other players. Excellent for starting players and a new challenge for Experienced players. <br>
<br>
That's right, you play for <b>FREE</b>, and you keep your cards.  All of you.  If you miss this chance, you are gonna be kicking yourself.  And for those not familiar with MND, you can really trade your cards, it's in high demand!<br>
<br>
Also with many of our DT guys and gals playing, expect to see some killer tournament reports and decks after the championship.<br>
<br>
With tons of promotions, a friendly and highly competant staff, tremendously skiled players, and possibly the best game being sold, 2i has an up and coming winner that you will want to check out.<br>
<br>
So enough hype from me, here's the schedule<br>
