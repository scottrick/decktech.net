DPC final duel<BR>
<BR>
(2)TJ Holman vs (4)Don Kitzman<BR>
<BR>
TJ chooses light<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
Don starts prep defenses for YCHF, IAO, and I'm Sorry.<BR>
<BR>
TJ starts HFTMF for menace fades, battle plan, and squadron assignments.<BR>
<BR>
Don starts secret plans with his objective.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Players shuffle, cut, and wish each other luck.<BR>
<BR>
Don pulls two sites with I'm sorry before activating five.  West gallery and carbonite chamber.  Don deploys his sites, pulls S+D with YCHF, pulls bespin cloud city with his objective.  Don plays a tremor in the force into Tj's deck.  Don draws four, leaving one.  TJ activates five, popping tremor, stopping him.  TJ leaves his five and ends his turn.<BR>
<BR>
Don activates 11, searches with his objective for CC occupation and cc docking bay.  Don deploys bespin from his hand.  Tj begins joking about how quiet the room is as everyone silently watches the game.  Don draws five, leaving seven.<BR>
<BR>
Tj activates 12, searches his deck with Wys for Kessel.  He reveals falcon to pull captain han from his deck to deploy it to bespin, cloud city.  TJ draws six, leaving the rest.<BR>

<BR>
TJ activates 1, Don imperial supplys lost, then allows TJ to finish.  TJ plays cntl/tunnel vision to pull a card from his force pile.  Tj asks for a ruling on simultaneous deployment with squadron assignments vs kiss a wookie returning any card.  Can kiss a wookie target the simultaneous deployment of two cards by targeting one of the cards?  Time passes, the judges converse.  The ruling is that when the two cards are deployed, they would come out.  Don could then adjust the action by kissing the ship, causing the pilot to be lost.  Anything played under a card would be lost unless the card says otherwise.  Tj finishes pulling the card with tunnel vision.  Tj plays insurrection.  Tj reveals outrider, searches his deck and pulls dash and deploys to bespin.  No kiss is played.  WYS is flipped.  Bantering ensues, "He didn't even have the card!"
