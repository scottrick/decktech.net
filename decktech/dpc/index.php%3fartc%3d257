<br>
I repeat that DecipherCon has nothing to do with anything around here.  I'm sure whoever wins it deserves a lot of respect, but it doesn't have a goddam thing to do with DT.  <br>
<br>
He can make fun of the DT player of the year all he wants.  That's his opinion, and my opinion is that his opinion is retarded.  And Hayes if you think the Winner of <b>Decipher</b>Con has anything to do with the <b>DeckTech</b> Player of the year, as you seem to indicate, then you must be retarded as well.  Here's a hint: look at the words in bold.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I'm concluding you are retarded Hayes.  Uh, "<b>Not once did you declare any sort (of - sic) criteria for determining the player of the year</b>"??  Uh, yes, i did.  It was the person who won the most at DPC events.  Or did you miss that?  Guess you did.  Guess you missed the poll for like a month too.<br>
<br>
Hayes, furthermore, you and your brother can "Hysterically laugh" as you state all you want.  You both won jack at DPC events.  You won nothing, and Brian won every event.  Taking away from Brian's accomplishments, just because you don't like him, is ridiculous.  Give the guy some props, you two sore losers.  I'm sure if you beat him at DecipherCon, he'd give you yours.<br>

By the way, give me a break.  I'm sure you were real offended i called you retarded.  I could care less if you call me that.  Oooh, a retard, harsh.<br>

Anyhow, just because you're a teenager doesn't mean i'm going to cut you slack.  You two are more than old enough to account for your actions.  You were acting like a jerk, so was hayes.  I hate sore losers.  You don't like Brian, too bad for you.  Don't take it out on me, i'm doing something cool giving out an award, and you chumps are like making fun of it.  Quit being petty.<br>

I was giving his resume, not boasting and giving him well deserved props.  You are trying to take that away from him and i don't appreciate that.  Therefore, i ripped into you, and will continue to do so if you keep acting retarded, and trying to put down my friends accomplishments.  Hayes by the way you want to hear hysterical laughter?

I'm not losing my cool, i'm just calling these two out, so to speak.  We know why they are making fun of the DT player of the year, it's cause they are jealous.

If you honestly believe those statements are true, Neal, then it is my 'opinion' that you are retarded.<br>
<br>
Look at this thread Neal; you're the only one getting upset here.  Additionally, neither my brother nor I ever made fun of the DT POTY program, calling it stupid or worthless or anything like that.  And how could you think that either of us (or anyone, for that matter) could be jealous of Hunter (especially over him getting a Rook Endura)?<br>
<br>
But that's really not the issue here.  Robert is right.  You could have made your point to my brother differently, considering you represent DT.
