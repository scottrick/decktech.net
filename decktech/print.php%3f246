New poll is D'resh<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Tue Oct 1 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Oct 1 2002 <br>I love the color layout on the nar cards.<hr>shivam bhatt said on Tue Oct 1 2002 <br>Wow.  thats the weakest crushing ever.  Most crushing type spells fit the theme of the region, so i was hoping that this would shed light on what exactly a frozen creature is.  Only 3 energy from the magi though?  Thats pretty sad.<hr>Tom Scott said on Tue Oct 1 2002 <br>You have to think about it in terms of energy advantage, however.  Paying 4 to do 7 to the opposing side is not quite as good as Crushing Fungus (stops energize), but I prefer it to Crushing Roots (+3 to one creature).  <hr>CJ Damelio said on Tue Oct 1 2002 <br>where are the polls?<hr>Dylan Breen said on Wed Oct 2 2002 <br>This card is awasome! but i expected more from the word crushing ice. Like a whole bunch of iceicles or something. Also i cant find the polss can someone tell me where they are.<hr>Owen Kelly said on Wed Oct 2 2002 <br>anti-creature and anti-magi in one easy to swallow card! cool. the polls are on the main decktech page (decktech.net)<hr>Chris Slye said on Thu Oct 3 2002 <br>Wah! Radget! My poor, sweet Radget!<hr>Adrien Fon said on Fri Oct 4 2002 <br>My gosh is that a week crushing card. Oh well, can we see if MikeL will show us the top 2? That would make 3 cards shown on the new poll! Anyway, when does the new one end?<hr>Mohales Deis said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>Great card, although I expected more from the theme that's why I voted for it. AND WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE VOTING FOR SPINED HYREN?! Vote for SANDSTONE HYREN!! Why? because we already know how Spined Hyren looks like because it's pic. is in the BOA4. But we no nothing about Sandstone Hyren and the name sounds better aslo it's for two regions KT and D'resh. We get to knock done 2 regions at once VOTE SANDSTONE HYREN!! please<hr>Adrien Fon said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>Man, WHERE is the hyren?!?! There is NOTHING that looks like a Hyren. Is it the orange, spiky thing or which one?<hr>Mohales Deis said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>yeah the one at the bottum that looks like a Tunnel Hyren with spikes/spines growing out of him<hr>Mohales Deis said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>yeah the one at the bottum that looks like a Tunnel Hyren with spikes/spines growing out of him. When is the poll over?<br>
VOTE <b>SANDSTONE HYREN!!!<b><hr>Mohales Deis said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>QUESTION:<br>
Can we see the top 2. I mean at Insiider we got to see the top 3 because there was over 150 votes but here there's as of right now 225 votes. And how about if there is a tie can we see 2 cause right now both Hyrens are tied.<hr>Adrien Fon said on Sat Oct 5 2002 <br>Yeah, at insiider.com we get to see 2 and if you already HAVE the pics we deserve to see ALL of them, or at least 2. Go to insiider to SEE the spined hyren. And Mohales, are you HYRENSAGE over on insiider? This is Smangoo! Whats up?<hr>Tony Sorrentino said on Fri Oct 11 2002 <br>Enough with the Hyren. Let's see something totally for a change. Vote Sandstorm Orshaa.
