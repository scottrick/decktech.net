<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>Worlds 2001 update posted by David on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Once the contract is complete I will be able to give you more details. But I just wanted to let you know that the DeckTech staff and community leaders have planned a World Championship event for this year. <br>
<br>
The details will be posted as early as late today, or tomorrow. I also want to take a minute to explain what I feel. I hope you will understand me.<br>
<br>
By giving into fear we allow those people that hate us, and our way of life, a real victory. Fear can make us prisoners in our own homes, states or countries. This self-imposed imprisonment is as real a threat to our freedoms as any physical jail cell can be. It is not easy but we must resist the temptation to fear. <br>
<br>
I firmly believe it is the duty of every free person to guard that freedom zealously. I pray to God that in the months to come we do not allow these terrorist to steal from our community something that makes us truly great. <br>
<br>
Once a year we come together. We are people from all walks of life, from all areas of the world. Our religious beliefs are diverse and our political affiliations wide ranging. We are male, female, poor, rich, thin, fat, tall, and short. We are every nationality and every ideology. As a community we are divided about practically everything. However, once a year we come together. <br>
<br>
We come together and for a few days lay aside all our differences and have fun. Gaming is a hobby for the civilized world. It brings us together. It lets us experience different cultures and expand our horizons. Someone who has never experienced it may not understand. To sacrifice all of this out of fear would be a grave mistake.<br>
<br>
It is because of this that I have decided to proceed with the event. It was not an easy decision. A large event like this is expensive and DeckTech and I simply cannot do it alone. For this reason I will be asking for you the players to assist by contributing your time and money in order to make it heppen. I am not exaggerating when I say without your contributions, and commitments the convention will not work. More details will be announced soon. Till then decide if this is something you really want, and be prepared to answer in action as well as in word.<br>
<br>

I am sure the denver area plyers(including myself) will do as much as we can!<hr>Steven Lewis said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Once again Decktech bails out Decipher.  Why don't you guys just start printing cards and releasing expansions for crying out loud!  :)<hr>Leia said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Things have been getting heated and tempers have been flaring all over the place, but the fact remains that you guys have been doing everything you can to pull this together.  For that, a big ol' thanks is in order:)<hr>hardpack said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>sell posters on line. the money will go to deckteck. this way everybody will be contributing something...<br>
please make it vegas...<hr>Baroni said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Thank You<hr>Smokes said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>I will not attend Worlds unless Reflections III is allowed and if it is held in Las Vegas.  I think that practically everybody in Southern California supports the tournament to be in Vegas and to allow Reflections III. <br>
<br>
If I do attend the tournament, I WILL offer as much support as posible, money wise and time wise.  <br>
<br>
Whether I attend or not, I wish Deck tech the best of luck with this tournament. <hr>Alpha Blue said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Good job, guys. I knew you would come through for Decipher. Now the question is, "Will the top players stay in because of this decision?"<hr>Jedi Jawa said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>David Akers for President!<hr>Boba Fett 48 said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>You guys kick @$$. Just tell me where to send and when.<hr>Brandon said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Deck tech, For the People, by great people...<hr>Raphael Asselin said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Hum.. that cool.. Keep it on the east coast and less than 16 hour ride and you will have a bunch of happy quebecker ready to bring title back to were it belongs... :) <br>
<hr>chicken soup said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>#&!% that shyte u know what im saying<hr>Black 7 said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Well said David.  See, we can agree on something, keep up the good work.<hr>deck said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>i want to make sweet sweet love to you all<hr>mock said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>That is pretty cool. If the con is anywhere near me I'll do what I can. Unfortunately I probably won't be much help... but just let us know the details as soon as possible.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>cool<hr>Darryll Silva said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Bravo. Nice speach David...u guys deserve everything we can get and some..For this I will do  what I can and I will try to raise money at my local tournies and where ever else is it possible...thanks guys!<hr>Matt said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Make mine in Vegas!<hr>Matt Mason said on Wed Oct 10 2001 <br>Woah, Matt said 'Make mine in Vegas!' And I'm a Matt, and I want it in Vegas too! Haha! See? 2 out of 2 Matts agree, Vegas! And if you guys want to do a yj worlds, I can get PLENTY of SoCal people to show up. Trust me ;)<hr>Carson the Great said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Decktech, the driving force behind Star Wars CCG<hr>Patchell said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Im glad to hear it?  Why no hint on location?  I think it should be Vegas. As Jim Morrison says, "The west is the best, baby!" NO, seriously though, weve been screwed out of worlds many times, and Vegas is a WorlD Resort, so what better place to hold a worlds?<hr>edmund said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>stop telling david where to have for christ sake. if you don't like it don't bitch at him, bitch at decipher.<hr>Paul Todd Feldman said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Great job Decktech.  I really hope that you contact Wizards of the Coast and let them know if they do indeed win the contract to Star Wars CCG that you guys would be willing to set up the tournament scene.  Decipher is on its last legs, but I think the game is going survive the company. See you at Worlds!  <hr>Scot Vales said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Hooray for DeckTech taking the lead.  I am pleased to see the players taking the game back from Decipher.<br>
<br>
PS: In your paragraph about "all walks of life... rich and poor"; I don't think that there are many poor playing this game.  It's far too expensive to play and stay competitive.  (Cost might be the only reason I eventually leave the game.)<hr>Info Broker said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Money is important in fact, money is very important.  Where ever we have this thing, money is a huge deciding factor.  And to Scot..I sure feal poor at times.  I pretty much live from check to check...but there is something I can give.  Of course besides willing to pay any entry fee, I can give some uncut sheets for you to have as some side prize or something.  Or some of my many T-Shirts...Probably no ones wants them, but at least something for prizes other than money.  I don't know just thinking.<hr>Puke said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Most people want this held in Las Vegas.  <br>
<br>
I pay whatever it takes to attend this tournament (within reason).<br>
<br>
Thanks guy<hr>Info Broker said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Matt Mason..I am just curious...how many can you bring for a Yj Worlds?  Just wondering about numbers here.<hr>NC rocks said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>we have maybe 6-12 people who might be interested in playing YJ, if there will be a tournament. Also, tho I hesitate to bring it up, there are quite a few for Star Trek and Jedi Knights...just think you may want to consider this too in the planning stuff<hr>Trust me said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Oh it is all being considered.  But numbers are important, so if there is YJ, ST, or JK people that will travel anywhere, then that is the number that will help in getting the right Venue.  And yes...Decktech is looking to do it for all of the games.  Although that may not be possible...but we will try.<hr>Kyle said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Go Decktech... Go David and Neal... Go Vegas..<br>
<hr>wujenta said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>First of all: Decktech rules.<br>
<br>
I was going to DCcon to play SW with some new people, but some friends of mine  want to play YJ and Star Trek too. We are not many people, but count 2 for YJ and 2 for STrek at least.<hr>someone who knows said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>"A World Championship," As Decktech is allowed to call this event, will be held in VA in conjunction with Mike Carr.<hr>Luca/Tzizvvt said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Thanks, and well done, David (and everyone else!).<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, I'm sure that people would be happy to compete for the prestige of being champ, rather than money if it comes down to it.<br>
<br>
I won't be at worlds this year, but good luck to everyone.<hr>Pär B said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Please dont let it be in vegas its way to far away. Think about it the west coast is as far west as you come in the star wars comunity and absolutely not in the center.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for making this happen.<hr>Lt. Page said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>You guys are great.  Congrats for taking leadership and helping the SWCCG community stay together at a time when it may be falling apart.<hr>Mike said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>The guys are working hard to make this happen....note to smokes...whoever the h.ell you are....who cares if you come or not?<br>
And all the other morons who keep trying to stuff your ideas down everyones throat...screw you 2!!!<br>
<br>
This is only happening out of the kindness and respect for the game that David and Neal have. I think Neal had an anyeuresm or something last night from listening to all you blowhards out there who think they know it all. When the pressure is on...the real players step up...help out...and contribute...while the silent masses as some of you like to call yourselves loom in the shadows and throw pot shots. How sad. Go Decktech!!<hr>Jan Argilagos said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>GO DT GO!<br>
This is awesome! Thanks alot.  I would play ST also (even though I suck at it) as long as it don't overly conflict w/ SW<br>
<br>
Thanks Neal/ David<br>
Bronze Dynamo, Out<hr>Smokes said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Look, Mike.  Decktech asked if I would come and support Worlds or not.  Dont treat me like Im some kind of a.sshole for answering.  I simply told them in an honest way if I would go or not and how others in my area thought.  The purpose iof this board is to find out what people want, so da.mnit, im going to be honest.  <hr>Osama Bin Laden said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>So i didnt stop your worlds????? Well maybe i have a new target<hr>Shane Outlaw Watner said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>I would love for it to be in Vegas.  I will pay whatever entry fee DT decides.<hr>Matt Mason said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Info Broker....Well I've got at least 5 or 6 people that I can personally drag myself. But I know that if you guys hold it in Vegas, and give me a good month at least to contact everyone, you'll get around 15-20 ranked yj players at a minimum. Maybe more, depending on when I get more details about when and how much. Thanks alot guys, I know this tournament will be great!<hr>Chris Kroutil said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Yes.  I will support this tournament, but I wont be able to go if it is too far away.  I know a lot of other people who will support it too.  <br>
<br>
Distance is going to be a problem no matter what, whether its in Vegas or Orlando or wherever.  So it will be a hard choice.  My vote goes for Vegas becasue if its in Vegas, people would have more reasons to attend (other than SWCCG).  To spend 2-3 days at the tournament and rent a hotel is practically a vaccation.  Vegas is a great vaccation place.  <hr>Garion said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Well done!. Please tell me if I can help anyway from Spain.<hr>Greg Heisler said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>I Personally think that you should try and not make it anywhere but Virginia.  Cause otherwise all those people you told to wait with there plane tickets are still going to have to pay a $100 Change Fee if not.  Trust me, this happened to me.  <hr>Alfred Dong said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Decktech, how much you guys rule is beyond what I can say. <br>
<br>
All you do is keep this game alive and running, something Decipher just doesnt seem to know how to do anymore. <br>
<br>
I will do my best to be there, wherever it is. <br>
<br>
<hr>Mike said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Hey smokes....No one cares what you think or if you come or not.<br>
<br>
Good bye.<hr>curious inquirer said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>when are you guys gonna post details so we can make travel arrangements?<hr>avatar24 said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>so what's the deal..?  you guys promised a post by Wednesday - now you're taking the Decipher way of promising one thing and not delivering<hr>David said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>I need more time to finish the contract. I am trying very hard. As soon as we have a contract I will make an announcment.<hr>Black 7 said on Thu Oct 11 2001 <br>Yeah guys, these things take time.  What Decktech is doing now is the best thing they have ever done for the game, and it can't be done over night.  To find a location, date, and space at the last minute is not an easy thing to do, and once again I send out my congrates to you guys for doing it.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Fri Oct 12 2001 <br>Thanks a ton david<hr>Michael Ganley said on Fri Oct 12 2001 <br>Look It is great you guys are picking up decipher's droped ball I would be willing to help support you guy's in any way Me and the Jedi Force Group have about 30 pepole still coming to Norfolk Va. to get together as friends so if there is a YJ woulds it will be there Regardless of weither or not you have the Wars Tournament there as Decipher origionaly planned.  We also have a large number of Wers and Trek players coming to the old Worlds Location for tournament's that weekend.  This will be hapening regardless weither or not worlds is there.  I hope worlds is in norfolk.  Everyone who is coming is doing so because they have already bought there plane tickets and aranged for room & board, so . . . Anyway,<br>
<br>
<br>
 Best of luck.<hr>Ian Vincent said on Mon Oct 15 2001 <br>Many players have said that Decipher have created something bigger than they are.<br>
<br>
When this convention is a massive success, Decipher will have to agree!
