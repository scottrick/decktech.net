<br>
Yeah I know&amp;#8230; It&#146;s like ancient history by now.  However, I promised a Worlds Tourney <br>
report, and I would hate to disappoint the readers who have waited so patiently (and <br>
anxiously) ever since I put up the first report in February.   I want to make the disclaimer <br>
that some of the details of the games may have been lost in the 11 months between then <br>
and now, but the essence of the games is still there, and, thanks to Decipher, all names <br>
and scores are accurate.  Lets see&amp;#8230;. I left off at the end of day 1 with me crashing on my <br>
bed about 2am.  I woke up at 7 to the sound of the Fire Alarm.  Yeah, great start to this <br>
day.  Well Me, Mike, and Ray all haul arse out of bed and outside.  In my rush to get <br>
dressed I grab my Dcon badge, complete with the brand-new semi-finalist attachment and <br>
clip it to my shirt&amp;#8230;. Yeah I know, stop laughing :oP.  Well, after the manager comes out <br>
and tells us it was a false alarm, I stagger back in, barely awake, and go over my Day 2 <br>
deck with a fine-toothed comb.  This was the deck that Rob Corbett gave me to play after <br>
he wrecked his car and stranded himself back in Ohio.  Honestly, who goes 45 mph in a <br>
25 on a road named CURL Drive? Scrub move there, Rob. :oP Anyway, looking over it <br>
(it was a 33 card deck, the one on Rob&#146;s page has an extra KFC) I decided that running <br>
with just one ship would be suicide, so I added a 2nd Dominion Battleship.  In addition, I <br>
moved about 2 [Ref] cards to the draw deck for cycling purposes and moved the <br>
Reflection Therapy and the Revolving door to the tent.  I took a shower and Mike <br>
organized my deck and wrote out the list.  Then Ray checked it, then Mike Double-<br>
checked it, then I triple-checked it after I got done with my shower.  No DQ for me <br>
baby!!! We head down to the Restaurant for their Breakfast Buffet, and are met in the <br>
elevator by the Swedish contingent of Johnny Ohlsson, Simon Karlsson, and one other <br>
really cool guy whose Name escapes me (sorry man! You&#146;re cool though ! ;-) ).  These <br>
guys were great to hang out with, and I was really glad I had a chance to get to know <br>
them outside the arena of competition.  After breakfast, which Ray skipped, we meet up <br>
with him and head over to the main Dcon area.  Mike takes his spot at the judges table in <br>
front of the iBook they used to keep score for the weekend.  It&#146;s a miracle that thing <br>
didn&#146;t crash&amp;#8230; must have had some Bynar Enhancement or something&amp;#8230; They get started <br>
not too far from on time and the long day begins.<br>
<br>
Game 1.  My Dominion draw-fest vs. John Bergman&#146;s AMS/ Scan<br>
<br>
Whew&amp;#8230; where to begin.  I had not heard of John before, but we got to talking and I <br>
found out he got his seat by defeating Brad DeFruiter at the Colorado regional.  Contrary <br>
to what he might say due to his modesty, Brad is an awesome player and beating him is <br>
no small feat.  I was worried, and with good reason. On turn 1, john Discards AMS, plays <br>
a full planet scan on his OP mission, then plays AMS for 2 guys he needs to pass my <br>
dilemmas.  Now if you look at the decklist (this version is on Rob&#146;s Page) you&#146;ll see only <br>
12 dilemmas that go under opponent&#146;s missions.  That is the single biggest weakness of <br>
the deck, and unfortunately for me, John&#146;s Deck is designed to take out dilemmas.  My <br>
first Turn I do the Deyos download, masaka myself, Play a free founder, report a young <br>
Jemmie, switch it out and draw to end my turn.  His second turn he discards/toffs/plays <br>
AMS and gets 2 more guys.  He attempts, clearing my dilemmas there, but needs one <br>
more turn to solve.  My Turn I play a young Jemmie, Report a Dominion Battleship, and <br>
Fly over to the Founder HW, beam down, join the Founder, attempt, Hit the <br>
BPD/Sarjenka combo for 15, swap the Jemmie, and end my turn.  John&#146;s third turn he <br>
does another AMS shuffle and solves Reported Activity for 50, so now he&#146;s up 50-15.  <br>
He draws and on my turn plays a Scan on Repair Mission (?).  I report more people and <br>
attempt the HW, but hit Dead End.  That&#146;s Bad.  Now the only way I can salvage <br>
anything is if I solve Tulaberry with Victory is Life (which was luckily in my hand).l  No <br>
Dice, my Strength was only about 50ish and I would at least another 2 turns to get <br>
everyone I need out.  And, if you&#146;ve ever played AMS scan, you know that&#146;s about 2 <br>
turns more than I had to work with.  I swap a flash on John&#146;s next turn but he gets <br>
through with all the people who count still there and I die a horrible death.<br>
<br>
FL 100-15<br>
0(-85)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well, at least I wasn&#146;t shut out<br>
Lows: Not solving a mission really sucks<br>
<br>
Well after that beating all I can think is Welcome to the Big leagues.  I thought I was <br>
ready.  But, with seven games to go, I realize that this first round loss may be a blessing <br>
in disguise, as I should have an easier game 2.  However, this IS worlds, so there may not <br>
be such thing as an easy game.<br>
<br>
Game 2.  By Bruised and Beaten Gamma dudes, vs. Dale Hanak&#146;s <br>
Bajorans/Dabo/random cool stuff<br>
<br>
So much for an easy game 2!!! Geez, I LOSE and get matched up with a 2 time world <br>
qualifier?! Yikes! Unfortunately my recollection of the details of this game is not that <br>
good, maybe due to the fact that it was an INTENSE game&amp;#8230; We both get out to a <br>
relatively quick start, solving one mission each, making the score 55-35 me.  Then we <br>
just start bouncing off of each others dilemmas.  He gats the Q&#146;s planet out before I do <br>
and it&#146;s a quadrant away.  So now we&#146;re going to 140, which sucks because I solve Quest <br>
for the sword the next turn for 40, taking me to 95.  The next turn he solves Relocate <br>
Settlers taking him to 65.  Time starts to wind down, and Dale solves Refuse Immigration <br>
and plays Dabo taking him to 106.  The next turn I play my espionage card for free on <br>
Investigate Rumors (Gotta Love Lovok Founder) and attempt but get stopped.   His turn <br>
he realizes he cant get past the Scientific Method(?) I seeded at Q&#146;s Planet and just plays <br>
Dabo trying to stay ahead.  My Turn I attempt, finish Investigate Rumors and then Time <br>
is called&amp;#8230;. WOW great game&amp;#8230; I cant believe I pulled it out.<br>
<br>
TW 125-112<br>
1(-84)<br>
<br>
Highs: Pulling out a nail-biter against a top-level player<br>
Lows: None, great GREAT game.<br>
<br>
Well, I won a game, now I just gotta win 6 more :o)<br>
Game 3:  My Skinless Teethed (is that a word?) Jemmies vs. Genard Finley<br>
<br>
Ok, this is one of those times where time catches up with me.  I have ZERO recollection <br>
of this game.  I will venture to say he was playing Romulan, but that&#146;s about it.  <br>
However, in my defense (and no offense intended) it was  a rather quick game.  Deyos <br>
came down, Jemmies came out, cards were drawn, missions were solved, and I won 100-<br>
0 in pretty short order.<br>
<br>
FW 100-0<br>
3(+16)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning, crawling ever so slowly up the ladder<br>
Lows: Not remembering a single thing about this game :oP<br>
<br>
That&#146;s ok, This next one I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll ever forget.<br>
<br>
Game 4: This months issue of GQ vs. Peter Leggeri&#146;s Borg<br>
<br>
Wow&amp;#8230;. A Borg Deck&amp;#8230;.. With Dual-Icon missions&amp;#8230;.. after the rules change&amp;#8230; ok&amp;#8230;.. <br>
well, I&#146;m not quite sure how to approach this.  I didn&#146;t really pack any Borg-Hosing <br>
dilemmas, so I gotta be Way fast on this game or resistance will be futile.  I also expect <br>
this to be pretty non-interactive (as most of my games are).  Also, being a Borg Player <br>
myself, I gotta give this guy props for even trying it in the current meta, given that <br>
Tribbles Dilemmas could hurt, among other things.  So we get started, and We both just <br>
build up for a few turns.  I score the quick 15 from BPD/Sarjenka and he heads out onto <br>
the (alpha) spaceline.  Well, I see his strategy at the first mission.  He beams down a <br>
single scout at a dual-icon mission targeted by Establish Gateway and then bounces all of <br>
the Space/Planet Dilemmas to his ship unless they would be better off on the drone on the <br>
planet.  So, my dilemmas are getting wrecked left and right and there isn&#146;t anything I can <br>
do about it&amp;#8230;. Even my flash just takes out a scrub.  Ouch! So At this point I&#146;m up 55-50 <br>
having scored the Homeworld and the only thing keeping me in the game is the fact that <br>
he has a conspicuous lack of EFC cards.  I ask him about this and he tells me that he <br>
doesn&#146;t believe EFC cards are needed to make a winning Borg Deck.  Uh&amp;#8230;. Ok, but <br>
Service the Collective rocks no matter how you slice it.  He Probes his 3rd Objective and <br>
is up 75-55.  My turn I attempt to Subjugate Tulaberry, but get stopped.  His turn he <br>
scouts his 4th mission.  My Turn I solve Tulaberry and Win 100-75.  If he had been <br>
running Service he would have had me by probably a turn of 2, but as it is I pull it out.<br>
<br>
FW 100-75<br>
5(+41)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning is a good thing&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.<br>
Lows: Not deserving the Win when you get it isn&#146;t.<br>
<br>
SO I&#146;m back in the top half of the field finally, and I know it is only gonna get tougher, <br>
not to mention there are still people being Dqed for decklist problems.  Also, consider <br>
that I am coming off of 10 Hours of straight gaming followed by 5 hours of sleep, <br>
followed by a fire alarm, followed by another 5 hours of gaming.  This is where I manage <br>
to almost totally lose it, right there in the middle of worlds: As Peter and I are picking up <br>
our decks, I look at the Kivas Fajo-Collector that was in my discard pile&amp;#8230;. And think to <br>
myself: I don&#146;t remember putting a Kivas in my deck&amp;#8230;. Uhh&amp;#8230;. Crap! MIIIIKE!!! I run <br>
up to the judges table and tell Mike.  Sean O&#146;Reiley (sp?) looks at me and goes &quot;You <br>
Cant be serious! I checked your deck myself and it came out fine.  So we pull out the <br>
decklist and, sure enough, there is a Kivas there, and I&#146;m officially stupid :oP.  So after <br>
going to the bathroom and giving myself CPR for about 5 minutes I get ready to <br>
continue.<br>
<br>
Game 5: Goofy Fool (me) vs. Dan Webster.<br>
<br>
There isn&#146;t much to say here, I just outsped him.  I got a God Draw, with every card I <br>
needed to make as I card play, plus a young Jemmie, plus 2 Univ. Jemmies.  I was set up <br>
completely on turn 3, attempting on turn 4, and winning by Solving Quest for the sword <br>
and playing Victory is Life on turn 6ish.  He played a Phoenix for points when it was <br>
apparent that I was going to win and being the goofy fool that I am (see title) I forgot <br>
what Intermix Ratio does (SCRUB!) and I let him have it.<br>
<br>
FW 100-10<br>
7(+131)<br>
<br>
Highs: A semi-easy/quick game allowed me to get food and calm my nerves some&amp;#8230; At <br>
this point I realize I have a shot<br>
Lows: Being Stupid about Intermix ratio and not knowing my own stupid decklist.<br>
<br>
So now I&#146;m in the top 12.  I politely beg Kathy and Evan to end it right there, but I get <br>
evil looks so I slink away and get my deck ready :o)<br>
<br>
Game 6: Ugly Brown dudes vs. Chris Brennan&#146;s Klingons<br>
<br>
Time has eroded the play-by-play details on this one but I do remember he: a) was <br>
playing Klingons  b) Is a very good player with solid strategies c) Took me to the very <br>
edge of my game. We start out and he is playing mad people and Androids (???) and <br>
setting up just as fast as I am.  I get my standard turn 2/3 15 points and chill long enough <br>
to get a respectable crew built up.  Around turn 5-6 I attempt and someone important gets <br>
killed but borath knows some extraordinary methods so they stay around long enough to <br>
bust up the combo Chris had there so I&#146;m up to 55.  So, as a Response he goes on a 2-<br>
mission tear with AMS dudes and a Phoenix And all of the sudden has 85 points! Yowza! <br>
SO I scramble, and knowing that my cool dude (Bashir Founder?) is toast at the end of <br>
the turn I throw everyone at Tulaberry and manage to squeak by his Chandra/FF Combo <br>
and have JUST enough strength to solve.  He would have won on his next turn and I went <br>
first, so that&#146;s how close this game was.<br>
<br>
FW 100-85<br>
9(+146)<br>
<br>
Highs: Chris is the Man! And, since we were so close on score, he still has a solid shot at <br>
day 3, so that is good, as I don&#146;t want to eliminate a good player who deserves it, <br>
especially when they&#146;re such a sport<br>
Lows: Not a dang one :o)<br>
<br>
So now I just need to win 1 more and I&#146;m in.  I go and get dinner because Evan and <br>
Kathy let us take a 20 minute food break.  (Read: They&#146;re hungry :oP) and contemplate <br>
the importance of my next 2 games.  At the beginning of the day I predicted a score of <br>
10(+200) would be the minimum to get in to day 3, and I aint there yet.   Even if I win <br>
game 7, I would at least have to keep it close in game 8 to be sure.  I get my game face on <br>
and head back to the gaming room<br>
<br>
Game 7:  My Dominion boyz vs. James Monsebroten&#146;s Romulan High Point SSM Solver<br>
<br>
Well, we start seedingand I am seeing his theme: High-Point Romulan space missions ala <br>
Loca/R&#146;mor.  He seeds AMS, ASP, Make it so and a few hidden agendas, as well as A <br>
spacedoor at his outpost&amp;#8230; pretty typical setup actually. He goes first, and before I even <br>
draw my opening hand, he has a SSM crew together on a Warbird and is downloading <br>
SSM with make it so/Ready Room door.  Holy Crap! I hear Attempting on Turn 1 = Bad <br>
for opponent.  Well, my deck does have anti-speed defenses and I think I pulled out every <br>
one of them this game.  I flash swapped a Scientific method when he brought al of his <br>
Science over and scored 3 points off a Bailiff.  Meanwhile, I&#146;m trying to get set up as fast <br>
as I can.  I do manage to hit my 15-point combo on turn 3 and solve on turn 4, and play <br>
Victory is Life because I managed to have it at the time. So I&#146;m at 63, but he is at 92 and <br>
has 2 missions solved.  I draw to end and get a Palor Toff, which I use to get the flash <br>
back.  His turn he attempts and Q&#146;s planet comes out.  Not wanting to give up any more <br>
points I get random person with a bailiff and other random person in the Box (and yet <br>
other random person out of play).  He ends up solving the mission but he only has 132 <br>
since I got his Mission specialist.  He looks at me quizzically and says &quot;You know, I have <br>
NEVER had to solve 4 missions before now with this deck to win&amp;#8230; I&#146;m impressed&quot; He <br>
then proceeded to mob a planet and solve it easily for the 140-63 win.<br>
<br>
FL 100-63<br>
9(+109)<br>
<br>
Highs: A good game from a good opponent&amp;#8230; he earned every bit of that victory.<br>
Lows: Not being able to secure a spot for day 3, SSM Wrecking me.<br>
<br>
So now it&#146;s crunch time.  Win, I&#146;m in, lose, I got nothing to do but cry.  Then Mike <br>
comes up to me and says &quot;Dude, no matter how you slice it you will be playing a former <br>
world qualifier in game 8&quot; Well&amp;#8230; suck, but look at it this way&amp;#8230; If I win I&#146;ll know I <br>
earned it. So here come the pairings and let&#146;s see who the lucky contestant is!<br>
<br>
Game 8: GQ fun stuff vs. Kris Sonsteby&#146;s Klingon Blood Oath Armada<br>
Well, Mike was right&amp;#8230; I do indeed get to play a former world qualifier for the trip to day <br>
3.  so much for sneaking in through the proverbial back door.  We get started and he <br>
looks discouraged when he sees gamma quadrant missions.  Armadas don&#146;t do as well <br>
when theres 80 million lightyears between them and the other guy, and a dedicated solver <br>
should be able to outspeed an armada.  This game was rather quick, surprisingly.  We <br>
take our time seeding and then start.  I go first and start setting up my drawing engine.  <br>
He sets up Blood oath so both our decks are up and running.  I get my traditional turn 3 <br>
15 points and he has all of his BO people plus some other downloaded people plus some <br>
random card play people plus all the BO ships.  He tries to wormhole me to Alpha but <br>
OWR says No No and I stay where I am.  Here is where He made one critical mistake: <br>
Seeing that he couldn&#146;t fight me he loaded all of his people up and went mission solving.  <br>
However, on his first attempt (Reported Activity) He beamed down 2 random scrubs to <br>
redshirt and hit my alien parasites.  I then proceeded to walk all of his klingons into a <br>
berserk changeling one at a time.  So now he has 2 people out on a stranded ship and no <br>
card drawing mechanism that is reliable, but we keep playing.  I solve Homeworld <br>
without incident but when I head over to Tulaberry I hit a Firestorm.. Kris Says &quot;Bye Bye <br>
Founders&quot; and I&#146;m like &quot;Nope, Kukalaka fireproofs them&quot; but I get stopped by a <br>
Chandra/FF combo.  However at this point it doesn&#146;t matter as Kris has pretty much <br>
conceded the game and I just wait the 2 turns to finish it up.  He plays Phoenix and <br>
Againd I forget how to read with regards to intermix Ratio, but it doesn&#146;t matter<br>
<br>
FW 100-10<br>
<br>
11(+199)<br>
Highs: Winning, making it into Day 3<br>
Lows: Kris Disrespecting me by saying stuff to people after the game and on the bbs later <br>
on.  I really didn&#146;t appreciate that, but whatever&amp;#8230; I&#146;m going to day 3 and he isn&#146;t, so he <br>
can say what he wants.<br>
<br>
Well, 11(+199) &gt; 10 (+200) so it looks like I&#146;m in.  (WOOHOO) After a very LONG <br>
day, I check in with Ray and Jared to see how they did.  Ray finished 35th and Jared <br>
finished 48th.  Not too bad for a couple of first time Worlders :o)<br>
<br>
After getting my picture taken and my finalist badge and receiving many congrats, <br>
especially from the Michigan guys, I find Jason Drake and thank him for his wonderful <br>
deck design, as he was the one who originally came up with it.  We get to talking and our <br>
talking turns into a strategy session in the lobby of the hotel with about 6 other guys who <br>
finished between 13th and 25th.  I point out how I lost to Scan and SSM so the first <br>
modification is 3 Amanda Rogers, then I decide to Add O&#146;Brien Founder and Leyton <br>
Founder for more skill support and we tweak a couple things then I call my girl, tell her <br>
that I was in day 3 and that I love her, and them collapse&amp;#8230;. No SportsCenter tonight&amp;#8230; <br>
I&#146;m too dead to stay up for it.<br>
<br>
To be Concluded&amp;#8230;. In the not too distant future, I promise! :o)<br>
<br>
Thanks for Reading,<br>
