I&#146;ve tried it with high point missions, gamma missions, PNZ, Holograms, Mirror Quad etc. etc. Out of all of them, I came up with a good deck, it would use MQ AU personnel to d/load the Equipment (seeding a Crossover so I could play &#146;em) and it would also use Holograms for all the mission requirements (see Jason Drakes and Steve Boyles decks). So I show up at the tourney like 30 min&#146;s before and see Dunlap (who I knew would be my biggest competition all day). 10 People show up (9 finished) and we are getting ready to start. Dunlap comes up to me and jokes that we&#146;re gonna be paired up first. Well, just my luck he turned out to be right.<br>
<br>
First Game - John Dunlap.<br>
<br>
	He&#146;s playing a Fed deck based around solving Hunt For DNA and Runabout Search (his only 2 missions, the rest are all space). He starts off by going first, and deploys some AU personnel and grabs Ajur w/ Defend Homeworld. Then he grabs Adm. Riker w/ Going To The Top and uses Riker to get the Starship Enterprise.<br>
	My turn I Kivas, get some OS personnel and draw. He goes again and plays some more personnel, and moves over and does the Ajur random thing on Hunt For DNA. 3 left, 2 are mine and 1 is his. So I go, do a STP drop, get out like 5 personnel or something. I go for Explore Dyson Sphere, hit Oops!, then a Cytherians. I take the long trip w/ the Future Enterprise through space (the final frontier). <br>
	He goes and does some reporting. I go, and keep travelling down the spaceline (this happens for like 2-3 turns, he reports, I move, repeat).<br>
	So finally, I get back to Exp. Dyson Sphere and solve it for 35 + 10 from mission specialists. He goes and attempts Hunt For DNA first and first up is Edo Probe followed by a Dead End (I was very lucky in the shuffling/random stuff). So he&#146;s stopped, I go keep on travelling &#146;cause of Cytherians. He goes and solves Runabout Search the next turn (he does the Boratus thing on that) but he hits a Higher the Fewer (only for 1). So that puts him at 34. He&#146;s desperately looking for a colony now - he&#146;s got 2 in his deck and only about 5 cards in his deck left. I finally get back to civilization and solve Cargo Rendezvous for 35 + 10 from mission specialists. So that&#146;s a full win thanks to his Cytherians.<br>
<br>
Full win 100-34. 2(+66)<br>
<br>
Props: Beating my mentor - he taught me to play 2 years ago and I&#146;ve only been able to beat him a handful of times (this was the first time in a sanctioned tournament).<br>
<br>
Slops: His hand, he needed to get a colony to beat me - last 4 cards, the bottom two were colonies.<br>
<br>
Second Game - Kevin Hawkins.<br>
<br>
	He&#146;s playing Romulans and I get my thing going. I get the drop down with 4 personnel <br>
(he IOAG&#146;d me) and attempt Explore Dyson Sphere. I get past the dilemma&#146;s there and score 10 from Crystalline Entity (Lore was in play) and 10 more from mission specialists. He goes and gets some personnel out, and then I go. That turn I solve Cargo Rendezvous and run into Tarellian Plague Ship (the combo dilemma) and score 5 from that plus I score 10 from mission specialists. So that puts me at 100 and I win the game.<br>
<br>
Full win 100-0. 4(+166)<br>
<br>
Props: I scored 15 points off of his Dilemma&#146;s.<br>
Slops: He was kinda my padawan learner.<br>
<br>
Third Game - Larry Dekker.<br>
<br>
	He&#146;s playing a cool Klingon deck (entitled &quot;The Q Civil War, Right Here In The Klingon Empire&quot;). It&#146;s based on the Voyager episode where Supernova&#146;s are going off right and left. I was expecting an interesting game after I saw him seed 4 artifacts (I was perfectly balanced). So he goes and plays a personnel. I go, do the STP drop, get out 6 personnel and hit a mission. I run into a Cytherians. He plays 2 more personnel and I get back to my outpost, finish the mission and I&#146;m at 60. I go for a planet mission the same turn and solve it for the win. He got out a total of 3 personnel and 2 ships. His deck would&#146;ve been a lot better if he could&#146;ve got the opportunity to get it going.<br>
<br>
Full win 100-0. 6(+266)<br>
<br>
Props: Fast deck once again.<br>
Slops: I kinda wanted to play a little more and see if he could really do some damage to my deck. I hated shutting him down so early &#146;cause he&#146;s a fun player to play against.<br>
<br>
Fourth Game - Michael Fitzsimmons.<br>
	He&#146;s playing Rommies too - except his is old school with Red Alert. Not really much to say about this game, it was over in about 15 min&#146;s. I got the drop out perfect, his dilemma&#146;s did nothing to me, and I played IOAG to kill his red alert. It all went perfect.<br>
<br>
Full win 100-0. 8(+366)<br>
<br>
Props: Winning fast.<br>
Slops: Being a jerk and winning too fast ;)<br>
<br>
Fifth Game - Zachary LaFluer.<br>
	So he&#146;s playing his usual Dominion slaughter house deck. I know I&#146;m screwed unless I can get a good draw and go fast enough. The last time I played him, I hit his Hippocratic/Aphasia/Tarellian Plague Ship. So this time, I waited an extra turn for another Medical. I do my usual STP drop on turn 2 for about 5 this time. He&#146;s getting Founder&#146;s for free and Jemmies out like crazy, but he can&#146;t draw a ship at all. So I attempt Dyson Sphere and hit - you guessed it, Hippocratic/Aphasia/TPS. He had a filter before Hippo (Chula: The Crossroads I think) and he stopped someone w/ Bio. I get McCoy to nullify Hippo, skill share  Bio w/ Spock using Kirks communicator and I get lucky and he picks a hologram to be disabled. So I cure it and send Lt. Watley on her merry way to the Tarellians for 5 points. I solve the mission with specialists for 45 and that puts me at 50. So I go for a planet mission and get hit hard by a bunch of killer dilemma&#146;s, but I beat the wall at the end (can&#146;t remember what it was). So here I am at 90 points. I move to another mission and I&#146;m out of range. So he gets a ship out and flips over Invasive Beam-In. Luckily I&#146;ve got a Kevin Ux so I use it. He moves everyone in the Gamma Quad to the Alpha Quad and is stopped. My next turn, I attempt Repair mission - hit Edo Probe, then Higher the Fewer for 13 and then Cytherians. So I&#146;m set, I&#146;ve got the Future Enterprise moving down the spaceline end to score me 15 - then all I have to do is get back to Repair Mission and solve it for the win. Well, he attempts a Construct Depot mission, only to run into Fer. Infestation, Higher the Fewere and Dead End. So he&#146;s stopped. I&#146;m at the end of the spaceline now (I love low span missions) and I start moving back. He&#146;s got one turn left, but he can&#146;t do anything (low range on his Jemmy Attack Ship). So I move back to Repair Mission and solve it for the win.<br>
<br>
Full win 100-0. 10(+466)<br>
<br>
Props: Kevin Ux for killing his Invasive Beam-In. Dead End for working right.<br>
Slops: Stupid Cytherians even tho it helped me win.<br>
<br>
Sixth Game - Drew Christenson (sp?)<br>
	Drew&#146;s from Phoenix and the last time I played him was at last years AZ State Champs. He was playing Ferengi then and he was playing Ferengi this time as well. So I go, do a Kivas and get all the AU personnel I&#146;m gonna need plus the Future Enterprise. He goes, does the huge ferengi downloading and I&#146;m up. I attempt Dyson Sphere, get past his dilemma&#146;s and Q Flash and solve it for 45 (mission specialists). So now all I need is a Holo-Projectors to get to the planet mission. I don&#146;t have one... So I masaka myself, still don&#146;t have one...So he goes, gets all his personnel together and heads to Cargo Rendezvous (we duplicated it) and attempts. He gets past all the dilemma&#146;s except the last one which is my Scientific Method. So I attempt Repair mission, hit some more dilemma&#146;s that I get past and solve it. So I&#146;m at 85. I draw 1 and get Holo-Projectors. He goes, reports some personnel, does some daboing and attempts another mission, only to lose 13 points to a higher the fewer. So I go, play Holo-Projectors and then solve Cargo Rendezvous for the win.<br>
<br>
Full win - 100-0. 12(+666)<br>
<br>
Props: Solving a mission after he beat all but one dilemma under it.<br>
Slops: Bad draw on not getting a Holo-Projectors.<br>
<br>
So I&#146;ve won the tournament right now, all I&#146;ve gotta do is beat Dunlap again and the state title is mine for yet another year. <br>
<br>
Seventh Game - John Dunlap. <br>
	So we start out the seed phase again and I seed the following:<br>
Edo Probe/Ferengi Infestation/Dead End at Hunt For DNA Program<br>
&amp; Edo Probe/Ferengi Infestation/Higher the Fewer/Dead End at Runabout Search<br>
<br>
I figure if any of those stay after the random selections, then it should do a little damage or slow him down long enough for me to win. So he gets the coin toss and goes first. He got another bad hand and forgets that discarding ASP counts as executing orders (so he doesn&#146;t get a card play). My first 2 turns consisted of just Kivasing (I wasn&#146;t getting any AU personnel, just Palor&#146;s and Kevin Ux&#146;s). So he tries to Masaka himself and I Ux the Masaka. So that slowed him down a little more. Now, I finally do the drop on turn 3 for about 5-6 personnel. But I&#146;m thinking it over a lot &#146;cause I don&#146;t want to hit a Cytherians and have to travel the whole spaceline again. Ends up what I did was far worse. I had the Pasteur from the STP drop and I staffed it w/ 3 AU personnel w/ no Command Star (just enough so I could attempt the mission, but not have to move for Cytherians) that way I could bounce it back w/ STP if I needed to. Well I get past the first dilemma hit Chula: The Chandra. Uhura contines. Now I&#146;m thinking like Friendly Fire or Beserk Changeling or something is next. WRONG! It&#146;s.....Q?!?!? So anyways, he gets to rearrange the spaceline, he puts my mission w/ outpost at the far right end, has 7 space in between, and then the rest of my missions (followed by his). So now I&#146;m pretty much screwed, since each of those space missions is 5 range. So next turn I solve that mission and start heading through space (The Final Frontier). He goes and does the Ajur thing on Hunt For DNA. Well, after the random selection was done - my 3 dilemma&#146;s were left! So now he wants to build up a little more before he goes attempting that. He&#146;s trying to figure out which one I seeded the Dead End at this time (he didn&#146;t realize I had 2). So I go and travel some more (it takes me about 4 turns to travel back to civilized space). He plays a personnel and does Boratus&#146; thing on Runabout Search. That leaves 1 of mine and 2 of his. Mine&#146;s first so he can SSM it, but he&#146;s gotta get Kirk or Beverly out first. So he&#146;s impatient &#146;cause he&#146;s at 0 and he goes over and attempts Hunt for DNA. He hits Edo Probe and then Dead End (losing 10 to Edo). So that stops him. So here I&#146;m at 40 (Repair Mission + mission spec) and he&#146;s at -10. I go and travel. He goes and gets out Kirk. I finish travelling and attempt Cargo Rendezvous. I get stopped by an Executive Authorization (McCoy w/ friends is 3 missions away on the Future Enterprise). He goes, plays Odo and d/loads the Communicator. My go - I move Future Enterprise to Cargo Rendezvous, beam down McCoy and d/load IADNAB to get Paul to get a PADD which gets me past Exec. Authorization. So I solve the mission and I&#146;m sitting at 85 points. He goes and gets out Thomas Paris (he had to wait for the Trans. Skill) and heads over to Runabout Search. He gets rid of my first dilemma w/ SSM and his is Balancing Act and then Horga&#146;hn. So he solves Runabout Search for 40 and he&#146;s at 30 (Edo). He takes a double turn and builds a colony. He then moves everyone there and next turn he&#146;ll be at 57. Just enough to get past the Dead End and win the game (&#146;cause of the Horga&#146;hn). So here I am, 85 and he&#146;s got 57. He wins in one turn unless I get 15 points. I&#146;ve got that colony in my hand but it won&#146;t do me any good now. So there&#146;s Sensitive Search on the right and Reported Activity on the left. Time for a coin toss on which one I&#146;ll attempt..hmmm...I&#146;ve got the skills for Reported Activity on the Holograms, so if anyone else dies, I can still solve it with them. I&#146;ve only got 2 computer skill and I&#146;d hate to have those 2 picked off by dilemma&#146;s. Hmmm.. So I pick Reported Activity. Beam everyone down and hope for the best. First up, Friendly Fire. I&#146;ve got James T. Kirk and Sulu w/ OS Phaser to get past that. Next up. Horta. Kills some average shmoe (at least something&#146;s going my way) and I cure it w/ Spock, Kirk and McCoy (just like the show :)). Last up, Chula: The Game. Dang. I used to stock in Lisa Azar to get past that - but I took her out to put in Albert Eistein for the Holo theme. Dang. So here I am now, stopped, no way to get past it, wishing one of those stupid tricorders could give me greed or something. So it was a well played game, kept me on my toes til the very end. When it was over we were both really tense and alert. That last turn could&#146;ve gone either way. So he flipped over the dilemma&#146;s under Sensitive Search. Unscientific Method (which would&#146;ve killed Einstien) and Scientific Method (McCoy would&#146;ve nuked that sucker). So great. I could&#146;ve won right there.<br>
<br>
Full loss - 85-100. 12(+651)<br>
<br>
Props: Great game, I got just about everything I needed when I needed it.<br>
Slops: Picking the wrong mission at the end. Forgetting that I could send 1 personnel down to Runabout Search to counter his colony.<br>
<br>
So anyways, I come in 2nd (even tho I won the tournament, go figure) and I get this nifty bag to hold my anthology box. It&#146;s a cool intimidation factor now :)<br>
Hope you read this far - it was a great tournament - and special thanks have to go out to Alex Camacho and his wife Bonnie for putting up with me and my smart alec attitude for 7 1/2 hours =)<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all at Decipher Con! (I&#146;m also hoping it&#146;s gonna be in Vegas this year!)<br>
