But oh well, its been a while and study = boredom, so here we go. <br>
<br>
Pre tourney stuff:<br>
Well I`ve been changing my deck around at odd times lately. The last deck I took to a tourney was a mirror deck, and I accidentally forgot the cross over. Oh well, I still won the tourney somehow. This time I had to pay a little more attention as the deck was for a regular constructed. So the night before I put together a deck I have wanted to make for a while now, and since its dead once voyager comes out I decided to make it now. The general idea is a guaranteed first turn Ajur on runabout search, followed by a senior staff meeting. I know the deck has been played, but oh well.<br>
The tournament only just gets sanctioned and William Springer is forced to play to make the 8th person.<br>
<br>
Round 1: Me deck versus Matt Blackwell`s dominion deck<br>
Well I win the toss and the seeding begins. One side note here is that we both only have 12 dilemmas under the opponents missions (For the most part most people only had around 15 dilemmas). The only important thing of importance is I seed the Cosmic String Fragment, a Barclay`s, and a Horga`hn under runabout search and Matt seeded a couple under his.<br>
First turn I get a decent hand, play a Kivas, pick up the ISS Enterprise, and drop it with 4 people including Ajur. Ajur and my mission specialist destroy some cards, I download FO Spock and he calls an important staff meeting, but of course Amanda wrecks the party, so I pass a Ferengi infestation, get some points from Barclays and hit the dead end. Well that stops me. <br>
Matt Defends Homeworld for Deyos, and uses ASP for a card draw, then plays a Young Jemmie. And that was about it. On my turn I was off, played a personnel, moved over and attempted Agricultural Assessment with 8 people, leaving a couple on the ship. First comes a Dalrok, but that is switched out for a Q-flash. I gave him 5 for Mr. Scott, then FO Spock went to the box. I ended out facing everything in the flash, except&amp;#8230; Q`s Planet ;)<br>
Well a phaser makes short work of the Ferengi Infestation, and I get 30 points, which puts me at 35. Matt Plays and draws. If there is anyone that suffers worse from a Rakal Shuffle, I really really feel sorry for them. So the rest of the game was pretty straight forward. I went to attempt Repair mission and was stopped by not having enough officers, that was crazy. Matt attempted the only mission he could (No ships = badness), and after a Barclay`s and Sarjeka was stopped completely by a dead end. I got the officers, solved repair mission, followed by runabout search for the game.<br>
2(+80)<br>
We finished in 25 min so, Matt pulled out another deck (Alliance) and we finished that game in my favor within the first round time (In fact only 1 game finished before our second game did), Pretty much the same outcome.<br>
<br>
Pros: Matt`s always a great player to play against. The Placement of the dead end<br>
Cons: Matt`s bad hand made it a one sided game<br>
<br>
Round 2: My Deck Vs. John Ross` Cardassian deck<br>
Oddities in the seed phase: John seeded 5 cards under Cardassia. Looks like he was doing the same thing.<br>
<br>
I went first again. So another good hand, I play another good hand, only to realize that I forgot to download my support personnel first. Doh. Luckily I have the solution. I played FO Spock from hand, revealed obelisk, got a new hand, and downloaded my support personnel from the bottom of the deck. Ajur did her trick and FO Spock called another meeting, giving me 45 points (Horga`hn was gone though). John tried to use mission debriefing, but Kevin doesn`t like waiting, so that was canceled. I moved over towards Repair Mission and play another SSM from hand and breeze past the dilemmas there for another 40. And that ends my first turn. John plays one for free and another for his turn and that`s about it. By the 4th turn I had cleared out Agricultural Assessment for the win. That was another really quick game so, I talk about strat with him (He wants a fast reliable deck, don`t we all), while watching Mark play a game of Pokemon with a kid at the store. I think he plays just about every game.<br>
4(+180)<br>
<br>
Pros: The deck working properly and winning in the first couple turns.<br>
Cons: John not realizing that Chula the Way Home relocates a personnel back to their facility. I think he was trying to copy part of my defend homeworld deck that sucked (Too slow and boring to play)<br>
<br>
Round 3: Me Vs. William Springer`s Alliance Drags deck<br>
Seed Phase: William forgot to seed 2 dilemmas under Mine Dilithium<br>
Well I lost the toss, so William went first. So he downloads Morn and a gun, and puts him in the bar to set up a card draw. On my turn, I do the same old thing. Ajur luckily takes out the scow combo. I complete the mission for 50 and get the Horga`hn, and Ux the Mission Debriefing. So I move over to the next mission. I SSM meeting the 25 point outpost mission, but drags came out and I only score 15 for it, so I`m at 65. That ends my first turn. I decide not to play Kivas Fajo Collector, as William had Mirror Image out. In hindsight I should have played one to get a tent for a Goddess, but risk is part of the game. So I beam down a bunch of people to agricultural assessment and attempt. I get past Ferengi Infest, but drags kills the away team. So I beam down FO Spock for the 20 points. That ends my second turn, and William gets to go. So he plays Security Chief Garak to the nor and moves over to the Promemade shops and draws a couple. Well even though I`m short some people I move over to Repair mission a SSM it. I pass every thing I was hit with Oops. Leadership wasn`t a problem but somehow only one staff remained. So I regrouped, and went to pick up the female that was stranded. <br>
At this point it we were both playing a card or so a turn. So the other highlights. A captained ship attacked the starship enterprise, because I was a moron, cause when I checked for staffing of the Future Enterprise I included the ISS Enterprises AU icon. Oh well, he didn`t have enough weapons to destroy the ship, and with no Battle bridge I only lost one range. So next turn I picked them up on the captained Future Enterprise (With Captain`s Logs out of course), cloaked and went back to my outpost. I finally drew the second wormhole and a turn, and a DRAGS latter I won.<br>
I don`t know about anyone else, but I`m looking forward for the Drags counter.<br>
6(+280)<br>
<br>
Pros: I finished a game with William within 40 minutes.<br>
Cons: DRAGS. Yes I hate them, and it is why I stock both Goddess and deflectors in the tent<br>
<br>
Round 4: Me Vs. John Bergman`s Rommy all around deck with Androids<br>
Well John and I go about 50/50 in win ratios against each other, and he won last time so I`m feeling pretty good about my odds. It didn`t hurt that to win the tournament all I had to do was score 3-4 points. Well nothing interesting happened during the seed phase, except that John was using Home front on his own homeworld. So on the first turn I played a Kivas as the first action (stops Mirror Image), and for the first time I don`t have Ajur in my hand, and I don`t feel like using Defend Homeworld for her so I just play a card, and say go. I figure what`s the worst that could happen. Well here it goes. John uses ASP for Tomalok, Spacedoors for a ship, then wormholes over with a discarded STP and flips plans of the Tal Shiar for an espionage on Runabout Search, and attempts, so that Ajur can`t get rid of his dilemmas. It was only moderately successful. Barclay took out his first planet solver, and Cosmic String Fragment destroyed the ship. So all in all it was quite costly. One of the games turning points in fact. So on my turn I forget to count how many cards are left under Runabout Search, and download Ajur. Yup, she sure can`t target a planet with only 3 dilemmas. So I pick up and drop the ISS Enterprise, use Make it So to get ready room door for SSM meeting and Chula the Dice is nullified (I never get any hard dilemmas, oh well), and hit dead end. So it`s fare game for the first person to get 50 points. John Defend Homeworld`s for Telok and reports an android for free, along with a Dederidix Advanced, and its back to my turn. Well I tent for a Goddess (Good thing as my ship was to end out right by John`s Outpost and ship) and play it. I move over and complete Agricultural Assessment after using a special download or two. John flips Mission Debriefing, but you know what I think about that. Yup, you guessed it I Uxed it. I then move over towards Repair Mission. John plays an Android and something else. I move over and attempt repair mission, and pass it for 40 point (I`m at 70 now). But I can`t get back to the outpost, and I decide against downloading Captains Logs with the RRD in my hand. So its Johns turn and in comes a Dederidix Advanced, which damages the ISS Enterprise, luckily it was not enough to destroy it, which of course was another good thing for me. So I move back to my outpost, dock, and my people walk off. At this point I have the game if I can fly a range of 12, which means a shuffling exercise or the future enterprise. So at this point John wormholes back to attempt missions. Well he passes Ferengi Infestation with ease, but only has one engineer, so the Scow stops him (And before anyone says anything, I don`t blow them up. I just like the time required to pass them). So I set up the shuffling process with the enterprise and the ISS Enterprise, with two a group of 4 AU people that can complete the mission waiting at the outpost for the Future Enterprise. Well John needs an Engineer, and Ruk is in his hand. However both of his STPs are spent. He plays a Toff though and gets it back. I don`t have an Amanda in my hand so he is safe, but I note the range and determine that I`m all good. John moves the Scow, but can`t move back. So on my next turn I make it back to Runabout Search for the Game. <br>
8(+380)<br>
<br>
Pros: John`s a great player. Since he always includes battle in the deck, I`m always on my toes. Close game despite the score.<br>
Cons: I just realized that I should not have been able to SSM past the dice. Oh well. If it were the dead end I would really feel bad.<br>
<br>
Outcome:<br>
Matt Garrett (me)<br>
Matt Blackwell<br>
John Bergman<br>
Mark Ponting<br>
William Springer<br>
John Ross<br>
Atticus Bergman<br>
Philip Garrett<br>
<br>
I get a foil Assign Mission Specialists for winning the tourney, so all I really want now are a couple of foil Space Time Portals. I mean come on, they would look soo cool.<br>
<br>
And if anyone cares, I played a pickup game against Atticus` captured DD deck, cause John and I finished pretty early. All I will say is that Goddess is god. That and Kevin Ux: Convergence screws Interference crap decks. Lastly I won`t post the deck, because no one on here likes them, and that it is dead once Voyager comes out anyway, but if you want details on it, just Dmail me.<br>
