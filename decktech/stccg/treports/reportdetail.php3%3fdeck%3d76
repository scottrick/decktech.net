The competition was fierce, but the players remained courteous and exhibited sportsmanlike conduct throughout the event. In fact, this was probably my most enjoyable non-regional tournament I have attended (and not just because of the result). I can truly say that every player I faced, we both wished each other luck, and games were smoother than any in recent memory. No major rules questions or infractions to speak of; just a good tournament, all the way around. But anyway, onto the event coverage:<br>
<br>
I brought my modified version of Chris Heard&#146;s deck posted on decipher.com, &quot;Beyond Kolinahr.&quot; Keeping true to the theme of Vulcan supremacy, I had added a few old friends to assist (Admiral Riker, Kirks, etc.) With Barzan Wormholes to drop ships full of Vulcans, and Live Long and Prospers to keep my hand full when my opponent lost a personnel with many skill dots, I called the deck &quot;Family Business.&quot; I&#146;ve never really played a Federation deck in this high of a tournament, but many years ago, I had wanted to build an all-Vulcan deck, and finally its time had come.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Jeremy Commandeur<br>
<br>
A fellow Ambassador, as well as also holding a place on California&#146;s Top 20, Jeremy and I always have great games together. This game stayed true to form, with both of us committing huge tactical errors. Jeremy went with a tried and true Hirogen hologram deck, busting through killer dilemmas like tissue paper. After a successful ship drop on turn 1, I committed the first error, by playing Isomagnetic Disintegrator on turn 2. The plan was to recover the Palor Toff that was in the discard pile, then Toff for IsoDis and play it again, to restock my draw deck. Which would have worked, had I not lost the Toff on an All Threes, and no Sherlock on the table. DOH!<br>
<br>
So I had 10 decent personnel to work with (James T. Kirk among them), as Jeremy started tearing through dilemmas with his Olarras et al. Jeremy then committed his big whoops by attempting a space mission after he had played his second Temporal Vortex to the table (he had Sherlock out and was trying to reduce his hand size). Borg Ship. His fleet was lost, and he basically resigned himself to the fact that I had the upper hand. Which I would have had, if I had Sherlock out when I had played All Threes. DOH!<br>
<br>
I blandly started trying missions, and to my surprise (and a Live Long or two), I made it through two missions, which with Kirk&#146;s help (and Jeremy&#146;s Alien Parasites/REM Fatigue) brought my score to 80. Jeremy quickly rebuilt his crew, and they were soon off again, trying to even the match. At 75 points, I knew the end was near. My 4 man crew aboard the Pasteur limped across the Alpha Quadrant, with walls insurmountable. As I attempted one last mission. time was called.<br>
Modified Win 1 (+5)<br>
Score 1 (+5)<br>
<br>
Game 2: Mike Bauer<br>
<br>
Mike sometimes runs the Pasadena tournaments, and is known far and wide for being a Borg specialist. He continued the trend; as we faced off and he seeded his DQ missions with 35 point planets, I reset my dilemma-seeding strategy for Borg. He seeded his dilemmas in batches of 3, with the exception of 4 under my Wormhole Negotiations, and 2 under Avert Disaster.<br>
<br>
Mike got a somewhat slow start, as did I, only getting one Barzan drop in four turns. Mike soon had Tomalak of Borg aboard, and began scouting his space mission for Establish Gateway, as I made it through one of my missions for an anemic 23 points (40 points minus 17 on two Higher the Fewers). Mike completed scouting, and probed well, and began an Assimilate Planet scouting attempt on the following turn. I ran to another mission, with time running out, and made it through to bring my score to 63. Mike completed Assimilate Planet, and time was called.<br>
Modified Win 1 (+13)<br>
Score 2 (+18)<br>
<br>
Round 3: Jeff Schwartz<br>
<br>
Of all the Southern CA players, Jeff is the one I most dislike playing in tournaments. Not because we don&#146;t have good games (and we do have some good ones), but because he is the player I am most in contact with, and whom I play against most frequently. Jeff is famous (infamous?) for his wild deck concoctions, and today was no different. With a plan to destroy two Borg cubes and bring George and Gracie to Earth for the one-turn win, and Frools aboard Ferengi Trading Post with 211th Rule of Acquisition secured (so no Ref cards could be downloaded without discarding HUGE amounts) we began.<br>
<br>
Jeff had only seeded 6(!) dilemmas under my missions, one for each. I got a decent opening hand, dropping Enterprise-A with James T. aboard (I managed to get him in play every game). Jeff shuffled some personnel around, but didn&#146;t drop any Frools at the Trading Post. He explained later he outmaneuvered himself worrying about what I was going to do, since I had seen him play similar decks before. I busted through one or two dilemmas, solved his Geological Survey (my cheap move of the day), and picked up the win on turn 3, despite the heavy winds outside.<br>
Full Win 2 (+100)<br>
Score 4 (+118)<br>
<br>
Game 4: Dan Webster<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, at this point, with timed wins abounding, I still was in the running to make Final Confrontation. I had to make it past Dan Webster first though; Dan and I have enjoyed only a couple games together, and he always presents a challenge for me. Playing in the Delta Quadrant with the all too familiar Fed/Vidiian alliance, I had seen him play this deck at our last meeting, and it was an extremely good deck. Large-scale amounts of personnel reported by turn 3, good skill mix, equipment handy, etc.<br>
<br>
Dan was the second player to hit me with a Higher the Fewer, for 13 points this time. Vulcan got locked out for 2 turns by a Friendly Fire, he was making it through my combos with relative ease, but missed on a Sheliak combo that made it there before my Freindly Fire expired. My big mistake in this game: I got greedy! With an extra Barzan Wormhole in my hand, I played it in the DQ near one of his missions I was sure I could steal. I made it over there, beamed down, and Dan flipped HQ: Defensive Measures. DOH! Now that I had wasted 3 turns making it over there and back, Dan had pretty much wrapped up the game. We finished with about 5 minutes to go.<br>
Full Loss 0 (-73)<br>
Score 4 (+45)<br>
<br>
Game 5: Stephen Lee<br>
<br>
Our first game, finally! I had been anxious to play Stephen at last year&#146;s State Championships, but alas, it was not meant to be. We finally got paired up against each other, and we both expressed our satisfaction of getting to play each other. Again in the Delta Quadrant, Stephen had Hirogen holograms jumping through dilemmas like nobody&#146;s business. We began our match.<br>
<br>
Opening hand: trash. I smoothly downloaded Luther Sloane and Dr. Selar via Defend Homeworld and Assign Support Personnel, respectively. I then ditched a QtR for Obelisk of Masaka, subsequently downloading Masaka Transformations, with 7 new cards. Also trash. No personnel, no ships, but some manipulation Interrupts (Smooth, The Power, etc.) After playing a few interrupts, I was up to 10 cards in hand, including Palor Toff. I retrieved the Masaka with Toff, and played it again, hoping for 9 better cards. And I got them. 4 personnel, a ship, and a Barzan Wormhole. :)<br>
<br>
Stephen has some problems with my dilemmas, as I pass through his relatively easily (minor losses to Fal-tor-pan). I think T&#146;Lar probably died and came back 3-4 times. I finished up for the full win.<br>
Full Win 2 (+65)<br>
Score 6 (+110)<br>
<br>
Game 6: Chris Sizemore<br>
<br>
Of all the San Diego players I hoped not to face, Chris was highest on the list. I had playtested against him 2 or 3 times, and had problems against his deck every time. He was playing DQ Hirogen holograms with Cyrus Redblock helping out. Also presenting a problem was the fact that Chris was playing with very few flesh and blood personnel who could actually be killed, leaving my Live Longs to save my Vulcans, and not much else.<br>
<br>
I had a decent opening hand, playing Admiral Riker turn 1, downloading Enterprise-A, which downloaded T&#146;Lar, who downloaded Fal-tor-pan. I returned Enterprise-A to hand, and after getting a Barzan in hand from a Ref-cycle, dropped it with crew. Chris downloaded Cyrus first turn on a Holodeck Door. I made it through an early mission, with Dr. McCoy&#146;s help nullifying a Scientific Method, for 30 points. I also cleared out Wormhole Negotiations, but couldn&#146;t draw a Q&#146;s Tent or Mr. Tuvok to save my life (my only Mindmeld interrpt was in the Tent). Where&#146;s Premiere Sarek when I need him?!<br>
<br>
Chris&#146;s holograms made short work of my dilemmas, and as time wound down, I knew I wasn&#146;t going to make it. Chris was prepared for my Borg Ship, and assembled a fleet to destroy it, but miscalculated his ATTACK total. A one-minute warning was called, and I had one turn to make the difference. I threw some people at a mission unsuccessfully, and Chris called &quot;Devidian Door&quot; to my surprise. I had never seen him play with one in that deck. I ended my turn, Chris drew to end his turn without showing a Door, and I picked up the win.<br>
Full Win 2 (+100)<br>
Score 8 (+210)<br>
<br>
Chris later explained that if he had destroyed the Borg Ship, he would have won (which is true), and would have had a good chance at making Final Confrontation. He wanted one of us to make it, and knew I had a better chance at it, and without my prior knowledge, decided to lose the game. I was, needless to say, quite shocked at his action, and thanked him before moving on to the final match.<br>
<br>
(NOTE: I had no discussion with Chris prior to the game about his action; we discussed both of our chances to make it to FC, but had neither of us had agreed to lose in such a way, nor had we discussed splitting prizes as an incentive. I realize what Chris did may seem questionable, but again, I had no prior knowledge of what he was planning.)<br>
<br>
Garrhet Noda and I ended up on top of the heap after 6 rounds of play, and after Chad Williams (our excellent TD for the day, thanks much!) had checked both our decks, we shuffled them thoroughly, and sat down for the last match of the day.<br>
<br>
FINAL CONFRONTATION: Garrhet Noda<br>
<br>
Garrhet and I have played many a game against each other, and we&#146;re pretty evenly matched, as far as strategy goes. Garrhet and I each knew the other was going to be in the Alpha Quadrant (yay!), and planned accordingly. After figuring out whether or not there was supposed to be a 1 hour time limit (we finally decided to have a time limit), we sat down to begin our match.<br>
<br>
To my surprise, he seeded Bajor, along with a couple other Bajor region missions. He seeded Deep Space Nine early with Quark&#146;s Bar, Holosuite, Promenade Shops, Docking Ports, Guest Quarters, and Bajoran Shrine, and I regretted not having put Ops and a couple other sites in my deck. I seeded dilemmas to best suit his apparent mission selection, but I was on the fence, deciding whether or not he was planning to seed an Orb to pick up early. He passed, and now I was suspicious. I ended up seeding 17 of 18 dilemmas, and passing on the last, missing a chance to place Your Galaxy Is Impure. He did not seed an Orb, and he had not planned to seed one. DOH! Garrhet finished up by seeding a Neutral Outpost(!) with a War Council aboard, as well as a Fed/Baj Treaty.<br>
<br>
I went first (thankfully), with a decent enough opening hand, but no ship. I did have a Toff available, and after he nullified my first Data, Keep Dealing with Amanda, I figured it would be as good a time as any to retrieve a ship. I got Enterprise-A, and dropped it with T&#146;Lar aboard, and used it to download James T. Kirk. Garrhet quickly nullified Fal-tor-pan with Kevin Uxbridge after I downloaded it, and after suspending play for an Oof to put him at -10, I was beginning to worry. I flew the Enterprise-A over to Bajor, and Garrhet played What Does God Need With a Starship? I allowed him to stop/unstop, and he chose Enterprise-A, of course.<br>
<br>
Garrhet had seeded Bajoran Resistance Cell as well, and downloaded Kira (TWT) with Defend Homeworld, and Shakaar Edon with I&#146;m a Doctor, not a Bricklayer. Having two Resistance personnel, he then downloaded Espionage: Baj on Car to Alter Records (Bajor), and drew two cards. His engine was very polished and worked well; he was able to play at least three personnel each turn. He downloaded Cyrus and Commander Data both with Holodeck Doors on subsequent turns. He got Leeta on an All Threes, played her for free to Quark&#146;s Bar, and downloaded Dabo. He proceeded to rig his probe with a Data, Keep Dealing, and scored the first 6 points, bringing him to -4.<br>
<br>
I reported Guinan to Promenade Shops from hand, and docked Enterprise-A there (VIP aboard). I moved some personnel around, and did a little probing of myself for Prom Shops as well as Dabo, and scored 6. I had sent Dr. Selar to Quark&#146;s Bar, and T&#146;Lar to Prom Shops. Garrhet proceeded to attack them both on his next turn, which I questioned if he could do, since he had the Baj/Fed Treaty out. It was ruled he could as long as he had no Federation personnel present.<br>
<br>
He began attempting missions, hit a Lethean Telepathic Attack, and was stopped. I figured I better get in gear if I was going to win this thing. He jumped into A Fast Ship Would Be Nice, and I chose Kira, but sent her back to his hand with Live Long, netting me 6 cards. Voila. Ship and personnel ready for a Barzan drop. I dropped USS Pasteur on my turn, zipping over to a mission to attempt, when Garrhet played a pair of Wormholes, sending me back to my outpost mission. I actually considered attempting that mission instead, but it would have only been worth 30 points at best, so I traveled again, and he Wormholed my ship again! *SIGH* Now I have an Operate Wormhole Relays stapled to my forehead, for all those wondering.<br>
<br>
He finished up a mission for 40 points (mission specialist in tow), and probed successfully for Dabo a third time to bring him to 48 points. I had probed unsuccessfully on Dabo the previous turn, missing a chance for 6 extra points, which would decide the game. I ran over to Fissure Research and attempted quickly, making it through the dilemmas to score 40 points, but time was called and it was not enough.<br>
Loss 46-48<br>

THINGS I NEED TO ADD:<br>
Sarek from Premiere. DIPLOMACY x3 on Wormhole Negotiations!!!<br>
Operate Wormhole Relays. DUH!<br>
More Live Long and Prospers. I really think this is THE way to go against Cyrus Redblock.<br>
<br>
Overall, a good time was had by all, and Garrhet walked away as the Champ (by 2 points). ;) Thanks to all involved, and to Squeeze Play, for hosting the event.<br>
