<br>
This was my third attempt at directing a tournament (the first was sanctioned, the second was not).  Turnout didn&#146;t look too promising at first, but players slowly trickled in and there were just enough for the tournament to be sanctioned if I played.<br>
<br>
The night before I threw together an obscenely large Fed/Vidiian DQSS deck (you know it&#146;s bad when the number of personnel in your deck is quite larger than the number of TOTAL cards in most of your draw decks even six months ago).  It combined a little bit of everything... Ajur on Cure Deadly Virus, using Containment Field to shrink my hand for free Handshakes, plenty of card drawing with DQSS, Mutations, Power, Handshake, etc.  Free plays from HAFH, Vidiian Sodality, and heavy use of the Caretaker&#146;s Array.  Lots of Genetronic Replicators, and the plan was to do a space and a planet mission for the win, with some help from a Horga&#146;hn.  Lots of Q the Ref cards, too.  It was far from refined, but I wasn&#146;t really planning on playing. (Decklist is under &quot;Dirty Downloading&quot; here on DeckTech.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, here&#146;s what happened in the games I played:<br>
<br>
Game one was against Jason Drake, who was also playing a very large DQ speed deck with The Power, et. al.  We both dumped personnel into play at an alarming rate.  I got Ajur over to Cure Deadly Virus, but as luck would have it, the one dilemma of Jason&#146;s left under the mission was a Dead End (first-encountered).  Jason used the DQSS/Revolving Door/Q&#146;s Planet combo to snag an early Horga&#146;hn by closing my Tent with the Revolving Door, then playing Q&#146;s Planet immediately thereafter giving me no time to re-open my Tent (not that it mattered, since I couldn&#146;t have done it anyway).  He took good advantage of the Horga&#146;hn to solve a space mission and a planet mission with a Ressikan Flute to get to a quick 100 points while my personnel were still stopped from the Dead End.  My dilemmas were weak for several reasons: one, as I was pretty tired by the time I got to dilemmas, I just threw some stoppers together; and two, with all of the self-seeds under CDV, I only had room for eleven dilemmas total.  Unfortunately, nothing that a good Federation megacrew can&#146;t pass when armed with a Horga&#146;hn (many of the dilemmas were &quot;stoppers&quot; aimed at simply delaying an opponent, but a Horga&#146;hn made these considerably less effective).  Full loss, 100-0.  Cumulative 0 (-100).<br>
<br>
Props: Finding out that Jason&#146;s moved back to Western Washington.  Welcome back!<br>
Slops: What are the odds that the *only* dilemma of Jason&#146;s left would be a Dead End?!<br>
<br>
Game two, vs. Leianne Kilkenny.  She was playing a Borg deck, but her deck didn&#146;t have much speed.  I used Voyager to blow up a Scout and some assorted drones early on while waiting for some personnel.  That&#146;s one of this deck&#146;s flaws: on occasion it tends to stall until it draws more personnel, manipulation, or Handshakes to get its momentum going again. Anyway, I blasted through two missions seeded fairly heavily, but with weak dilemmas to get to 90, then solved Liberation by megateaming through the dilemmas using Genetronic Replicator for an easy 100-0 win before she got her Cube staffed (&quot;Kelvan Show of Force?  What is that?&quot;).  Full win, 100-0.  Surprise of the day: I had yet to see a single mission outside of the Delta Quadrant.<br>
<br>
Props: Actually finding a way to work some random battle into a Federation deck.<br>
Also, Genetronic Replicator + Vidiian Harvester rocks!<br>
Slops: Against a faster Borg deck, the third-fourth turn stall would have definitely kept me from a 100-0 win.<br>
<br>
Game three, vs. Ryan Agnew.  Ryan was playing a Romulan deck (finally an AQ strategy!).  I did my typical thing, with Ryan giving plenty of complaints about all the actions I was taking on my turn (regularly going through more than half a dozen cards on a turn between Handshakes, Power, Mutation, Ref-cycling, etc. and playing a lot of them, too.)  I solved Deadly Virus early on, and redshirted my way through a combo involving a Borg Ship and Aggressive Behavior at Investigate Quantum Singularity.  (Thank you, Chakotay!)  My Battle Bridge kept my ship from being destroyed by the Borg Ship (I didn&#146;t stock Temporal Vortex because I only seeded a Temporal Micro-Wormhole, although I did plan to download a STP later on... this was an oversight from putting the deck together as late as I did).  He solved one mission since I only had room for eleven dilemmas, giving me a 100-40 win.<br>
<br>
Props: Lots of card manipulation lets you dig through your deck at excellent speed.  The game didn&#146;t last too long, but I had already dug through nearly half of my nearly 100-card deck.<br>
Slops: My poor dilemmas again.<br>
<br>
Game four, vs. Eric Wood, the only undefeated player.  I was hardly surprised to discover Eric was playing Q-Bypass yet again.  Unfortunately, one of my earlier opponents put me in a huge bind by telling me during our game that Eric was playing Bypass.  So, I got to try to pretend I didn&#146;t know that Bypass was coming, and I tried to think whether or not I would notice it early enough to anything.  (Sidebar: that&#146;s one of the things I hate about playing in tournaments you run... you can&#146;t help but &quot;scout&quot; when players call you over for rules questions, etc.)  Anyway, he got his Q&#146;s seeded as we finished the &quot;seed dilemmas for your opponent&quot; phase and entered what we newly dubbed the &quot;cheesy self-seed phase.&quot;  He laughed as I seeded four dilemmas under CDV.  I was going to throw a fifth down first, but I passed to try to outseed one of his Q&#146;s.  (I figured that even with no prior knowledge I would have tried to outseed a self-seed).  However, he passed too.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I knew this would be a tight game since I didn&#146;t have any explicit Bypass counters.  I got lucky with my Ajur shuffle (perhaps making up with my poor luck against Jason to start), removing all of his dilemmas (thanks to Eric for only seeding two dilemmas there!), letting me get to a quick 55-0 lead and grab a Horga&#146;hn.  I knew Eric was really close to Bypassing by this point (he just needed an extra card play), so I split up my crews and attempted Investigate Quantum Singularity.  Another Borg Ship/Aggressive Behavior combo.  Here it was just a matter of ending my turn so the Borg Ship would move away, then taking a double turn with the Horga&#146;hn and using Chakotay to clear through the Behavior to win 100-0.<br>
<br>
Props: Outspeeding a Q-Bypass deck!<br>
Slops: Finding out ahead of time that Eric was playing Bypass.  Players, you aren&#146;t doing anybody any favors by telling others what people are playing!  It puts them into a terrible moral dilemma (at least if they are honest, which I&#146;d hope).<br>
<br>
I ended up in second place, with Jason first and Eric third.<br>
<br>
Ruminations:<br>
<br>
Really odd score distributions.  One player had 0 victory points, THREE had two victory points, with less than twenty differential points separating them.  Another player with three victory points, and then THREE more with six each (Jason, Eric, and myself, in a rock-paper-scissors sort of relation: Jason beat me, I beat Eric, and Eric beat Jason).<br>
<br>
The Delta Quadrant rocks.  The top two decks (Jason&#146;s and mine) were large DQ mission solvers using plenty of deck manipulation.  I love DQSS and Vidiians + Genetronic Replicator!<br>
<br>
Horga&#146;hn still is awesome.  The top three decks all made good use of a Horga&#146;hn.<br>
<br>
One player had a rather nasty Handshake/Blood Oath/Outgunned deck going on.  Few players stocked an extra Obelisk in the draw deck, and I heard of several instant armadas caused by discarding one&#146;s hand to download all the personnel and ships.  I also saw him capture over 30 (!) personnel from a Federation megacrew by outgunning the Pasteur.  Needless to say, he drew out his whole deck in one fell swoop.  Sickening.  Timed wins and weak mission solving kept him from placing higher, though (he had one full win and three modified losses)<br>
<br>
I really need to get my draw deck sizes under control.  For the longest time, I subscribed to the small draw deck philosophy.  Even after Tribbles came out, I was still going around with my 30-ish decks.  Now, looking at the last few tournaments, I&#146;ve ballooned first to 60-70 cards for a few tournies, and now I&#146;m close to the 100 limit.  Heck, I used over 40 *personnel* in this deck.  Then again, it&#146;s been serving me well in tournaments, so it may not be all bad.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here&#146;s the complete results (with brief deck descriptions, when I could get them... since I was playing as well, I couldn&#146;t scout around to see what everyone was doing):<br>
<br>
1. Jason Drake		6 (+265)	Fed DQSS<br>
2. Steve Boyles (me)	6 (+160)	Fed/Vidiian DQSS + Ajur/Cure Deadly Virus<br>
3. Eric Wood		6 (+135)	Fed Q-Bypass<br>
4. R.J. Smith		3 (+52)		Federation space mission solver<br>
5. Tom Vuchelen		2 (-71)		Klingon Blood Oath<br>
6. Jeremy Pederson	2 (-76)	<br>
7. Ryan Agnew		2 (-90)		Romulan mission solver (with some personnel battle?)<br>
8. Leianne Kilkenny	0 (-375)	Borg DQ deck<br>
<br>
Huge thanks to Broken Games for hosting the tournament, and to everyone who came!<br>
