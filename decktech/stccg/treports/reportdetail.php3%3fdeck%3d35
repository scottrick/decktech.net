The stage was set for another heated SoCal tournament at GamesandCards.com&#146;s store in Eagle Rock, CA (near Pasadena). 8 players in all came to play in the last sanctioned tournament in our area before the Voyager release date. Chad Williams was our tournament director, as we started around 1:30 pm...<br>
<br>
Game 1: Tim Scott (1466) Klingon Blood Oath<br>
<br>
Tim and I had played about a month before at State Championships, and the rematch was on. Tim seeded, among other things, Warped Space, which I stared at for quite some time. After committing myself to the task of stealing it, I seeded Lack of Prep/Dead End there, intending to pick up Good Day for 50 points first, then heading over to get to 95, meanwhile hoping for some 5 bonus points in there somewhere. Tim played first, dowmloading Kang with Defend Homeworld, which I did as well. He proceeded to Tent for Dax, as I downloaded Daval with ASP. On my turn, I pondered the possibility of using an Obelisk via Q the Ref to download Masaka Transformations, since my hand wasn&#146;t looking all that great. I decided to give my deck two turns to give me a [BO] personnel before I used my opening hand Q&#146;s Tent to retrieve Koloth (which I ended up doing anyway). <br>
<br>
After a few plays, I was set to plow through Good Day. Tim had not seeded Good Day, instead opting for Qo&#146;noS and the Great Hall. I cleared the dilemmas, sending down Kurak first, and her biting it on Denevan Neural Parasites. The mega-team charged in afterwards, clearing the remaining two dilemmas, and solving for 50 points. Mining Survey was right next door, and so was my uncontrolled Empok Nor. Typically it is the target for my 34th Rule draw engine, but I chose to commandeer and solve the mission. Daval scanned at SciLab, and found a Cardassian Trap. After having done some beaming among ships present, Loreva braved the Trap alone, and passed with no ill effects. She was then stopped by a Maglock. I figured now was a good a time as any to score Warped Space, since bonus points didn&#146;t seem to be in the picture.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Tim was reporting personnel at a respectable pace, and chewing through some of my dilemmas. By the time I solved Warped Space, however, the game balanced on the last dilemma after the Maglock at Mining Survey. I went all out, sending all my crew aboard, knowing that if I hit Cytherians, I could simply Tent for Where No One Has Gone Before, and win on the next turn. It turns out to be a Borg Ship. Having 2 QtRs left, I ditch one to download Temporal Vortex, and the game is mine. 100-0, 2(+100)<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Tim, for being a great opponent<br>
Chad, for playing my Frool/Transporter Mixup deck!<br>
<br>
Slops: <br>
Me, for cheesing out and stealing his mission<br>
Pokemon kids, for swearing a lot<br>
<br>
Game 2: Daniel &quot;SIGMUND&quot; Novak (1657) Federation VCM Engineers<br>
<br>
Dan and I have played many games over the years, and I was using one of the two decks that I&#146;ve beaten him with. Dan is always a great opponent; he knows what&#146;s going on and plans his strategy without stalling (much). ;) Just kidding DJ. Anyway, he chuckled after seeing my mission choices, and mentioned something about me not letting him down. I laughed and complained how I had been having difficulty making or playing any other deck than my trusty old Council deck. We began with him playing first.<br>
<br>
Again I was forced to use my opening Q&#146;s Tent to grab Koloth; I went about my business quickly, commandeering Empok early (and passing his Ferengi Infestation there). I managed to get past 2 dilemmas there, but the third stopped my guys cold; Chula: the Game. My own dilemma being used against me! Unfortunately, I did not have Quark out at the time (he would have passed it), so most of my crew were stopped for two turns. However, the backup team made it through (with the help of I&#146;m a Doctor, Not a Bricklayer) for 45 points. <br>
<br>
As Dan and I busied ourselves trying to fake the other one out, I had been using my QtRs to counter his Scans and VCM, as well as using Mirror Image to copy his draws from Kivas Fajos. He then went to attempt his Reported Activity. After hitting my Q (and not being able to pass), I rearranged the spaceline with Reported Activity on my left, and his remaining missions on the right, with all my missions inbetween. He subsequently returned his Starship Enterprise to hand via STP, and was about to report it again, when he simply ended his turn.<br>
<br>
I hurried along, heading for Good Day. Before my mission attempt, Dan smartly played Oof! on me, tying the score (I had played one Amanda to kill one of his Going to the Tops, but he responded with Q2). Interesting fact; if I hadn&#146;t forced him to use his Q2 in defense, he would have had it available to nullify my Q dilemma (which of course I would have nullified with my Amanda). I encountered Dan&#146;s Flying Pancakes (Neural Parasites), and 7 Away Team members disappeared. I lastly encountered his Alien Parasites/REM Fatigue. I had enough to get by AP without a problem, but the REM would force me to return home to cure. I scored 45 from Good Day (Kor had died from a Pancake), and another 5 after returning to my outpost. 85 for me. <br>
<br>
Time is running out, and Dan seems hesitant to attempt any missions. He plays a Q&#146;s Tent to retrieve Q&#146;s Planet and subsequently plays it. I groan, because I had attempted Relief Mission earlier, only to be stopped by a Dead End. I had planned to waltz over and score it for the win on my next (and last) turn. I attempt to see if there&#146;s any way I can get 140. The only way was if I could manage to pull a Q&#146;s Tent, and go get my Distortion, solve Relief Mission with Kromm for 25, play Distortion, and blitz A Good Place to Die, scoring 30 more. Well, it was not to be, as I ran out of QtRs, which meant no more cycling, and I couldn&#146;t download Obelisk for one last shot. Kromm solved Relief Mission, and time was called. 110-40, with unsolved Q&#146;s Planet in play, 3(+160)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Dan, for another great game<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Dan, for not solving his Q&#146;s Planet so I could get the full win! (after all, he had a Flute underneath, and I seeded no dilemmas there). ;)<br>
<br>
Game 3: Michael Garland (1464) Klingon Blood Oath<br>
<br>
I had seen Michael a month ago at State Championships, but had not had the pleasure of playing him. I groaned as we seeded Doorways, and he placed a Storage Compartment Door and a Q-Flash out. Blecch. At this point, Michael was at 4(+190) to my 3(+160), so I needed to win to pull ahead. Michael seeded Wormhole Negotiations, and I had won the coin toss (the only time I did all day). I passed repeatedly, trying to get him to acquiesce into a quick game, but he seeded consistently, and I followed suit. I only placed Alien Parasites/REM Fatigue at his Wormhole Neg., since I was next door AND going first. He had 5 hidden agendas, and any one of them could have been an HQ: Defensive Measures, but the payoff was too tempting. We started our match.<br>
<br>
I had downloaded Vekma instead of Loreva as my MEDICAL mission specialist; after getting Kang out with Defend Homeworld (and having Kang download Blood Oath), I played Quark SOK from hand. I cycled a [Ref] card, and played a Q&#146;s Tent to get Koloth to hand. On his turn, Michael also downloaded Kang/Blood Oath, and made no attempt to get to Wormhole Negotiations quickly. I shrugged mentally, and played Koloth, downloading a Bat&#146;leth. I burned a QtR to download Obelisk (which downloaded Masaka), and I used one of the draws of the 5 I got to download IKC Lukara to that location. I luckily drew a couple [Ref] cards on the redraw, and cycled one to get a draw, which I converted to download Dax (who I really didn&#146;t need except for the Alien Parasites). I went to attempt Wormhole Neg, waiting for him to flip a Defensive Measures. He didn&#146;t, and I was quite pleased when I scored 50 points + 5 more upon returning to my outpost.<br>
<br>
After my initial flash in the pan, my game went quickly downhill. Tribbles started popping up all over the place. I was NOT amused. They ended up slowing me down enough to the point where I could not get over to Mining Survey fast enough to solve it before the end of the game. Michael solved Distress Mission with two mission specialists for 45, and the game was pretty much brought to a standstill by the Tribbles. On my last ditch attempt to solve Mining Survey, I hit Scout Encounter/Quantum Singularity Lifeforms. He downloaded the Cha&#146;Joh in Romulan mode with no crew aboard. We timed out on his next turn. 55-45, 4(+170).<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Michael, for actually remembering to play his Tribbles EVERY turn<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Michael, for actually remembering to play his Tribbles EVERY turn<br>
Me, for cheesing out once again and stealing a mission (but c&#146;mon! Wormhole Negotiations??) ;)<br>
<br>
At this point, Michael led with a 4(+180) to my 4(+170), and Dan&#146;s 4(+140). Michael and Dan ended up playing each other, which was beneficial for me, since I knew that they both had a good chance of scoring on each other. Even if Michael won, Dan would only need to score 11 points for me to slide into first. Of course, this was contingent on me scoring a 2(+100) in the last round. I felt confident as I met my final opponent for the day:<br>
<br>
Game 4: Eric Treadway (1477) Federation VCM/Empok with Enterprise-E crew<br>
<br>
Eric was a very pleasant fellow (we did some nice trading after the tourney as well!), and we sat down to face off. I wondered what happened to the other 7 (soon to be 9) affiliations, as I saw Earth and other missions get seeded that were similar to Dan&#146;s in many ways. Eric seeded VCM and Office of the President, as I seeded 6 HAs. We began with Eric playing first; he had wanted to seed an Empok Nor as well, and ended up still seeding 3 sites there. I wondered who would get there first as we began.<br>
<br>
Eric&#146;s first play was Luther Sloan. I gasped as he played it not on Empok to commandeer first turn, but at his Office. I just blinked in disbelief, and chalked it up to inexperience. I ended up commandeering Empok about 3 turns later (and Eric downloaded 15 Equipment cards!), at which point I scanned the bottom and found a Conundrum. I planned to cancel it with Senior Staff Meeting, and got Kang, Dax, and Loreva aboard IKC Lukara. After cancelling Conundrum, they hit my first Q-Flash of the day. 3 inconsequential cards later, I hit his Alien Parasites/REM Fatigue. <br>
<br>
After he had control, I reminded him that he could not attempt Mining Survey since he did not control Empok. Instead, he attempted his Reported Activity, and my crew was stopped by my own Lethean Telepathic Attack. Kang got zapped and would have died, were it not for Dax being present to boost him to a total of 19. 2 turns later, the Lukara returned to Empok and cleared out the AP after docking and receiving reinforcements. I didn&#146;t have 3 MED at the time, so I ended up solving for 45 with Kromm as a mission specialist, plus 5 more when the ship reached my outpost later that turn. I then planned to head for Good Day for the last 50.<br>
<br>
Eric&#146;s deck was slow against mine; with It&#146;s Only a Game on the table, his VCM engine was severely limited, as well as his aborted attempt to get Red Alert out. I beamed down to Good Day with Kras aboard in orbit just in case of a Crisis... first was an Artillery Attack, to which Martok fell victim. Next was another Q-Flash, in which I faced his entire Flash. 11 cards later, after Daval turned into a targ, and T&#146;Kar was taken captive, I faced his final dilemma: Primitive Culture. I had more than 6 Klingons present, and wrapped the match up without about 10 minutes to spare. 100-0, 6(+270)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Eric, for having nifty cards in his deck (including Ocular Implants, Tijuana Crass, and Data Laughing!)<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
None!<br>
<br>
After the dust settled, Michael ended up beating Dan 100-45, which was enough for me to claim first place. I received my Dal&#146;Rok foil, and was pleased with my performance. Afterwards, the bulk of us went to dinner and discussed post-Voyager strategies... but that&#146;s for next time. Thanks for reading.<br>
