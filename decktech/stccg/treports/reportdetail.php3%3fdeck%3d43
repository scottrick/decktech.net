Both booster packs were booster drafted...<br>
<br>
Well it was a slightly gloomy day but still 14 players showed up to our first and hopefully not last Voyager Warped Speed sealed deck. Each player purchased a Starter Deck and two boosters. The boosters were booster drafted, which is explained below for those who have never done it before (The starter decks were not drafted in this manor, whatever was gotten in the starter was kept to start with).<br>
<br>
In the booster draft you open a pack and take one card out and then pass the remaining cards in a certain direction (clockwise or counter clockwise). My table drafted in a group of 4.<br>
<br>
So on to the pulls...My starter deck was nice, my rares were Chakotay and Neelix. The first pack I opened I took the rare, a Hanonian Land Eel. I drafted lots of other good cards from the first round as well including: Thaden, Chell, and Paxim. The second pack I opened I kept the rare again, Seven of Nine (woohoo!). Some of the other cards I took from the second round included: Drenol, Nadirum, Type 9 Shuttlecraft, Noah Lessing, The Next Emanation, and Blue Alert.<br>
<br>
So I had a nice mix of personnel and ended up using Aftermath, Study Interstellar Colony, and Restock Supplies. The restock supplies for fun factor, but it was also easy for me to solve as well seeing as I had a cook and some biology personnel.<br>
<br>
Round 1:<br>
Anthony Barrett<br>
<br>
Well I started out this game with a few mistakes. I don&#146;t know why but I didn&#146;t have 10 seed cards. I didn&#146;t seed a personnel, ship, or equipment because I had thought I put enough cards in to cover my seeds already. Outpost, 8 dilemmas and The Next Emanation but I was wrong, I only had 8 for some reason. Most of the game went to me reexplaining the game to Anthony. Anthony hasn&#146;t played in a few months and was reacquainting himself with the game. I did the best I could to help him along. The game went slowly for this  reason, he got a 35 point planet and I got Study Interstellar Colony for 35. Good and bad, he pulled two Aggressive Behaviors. But I was only using one space mission so he put both under there. Of course when I went after the mission I had all three of my main personnel out already, Chakotay has 2 Anthro and Neelix also has one. Eventually the game timed out with both of us having each scored a 35 point mission. Another funny thing to note was we both pulled Seven of Nine cards (both were NA border).<br>
<br>
True Tie 35-35<br>
1(+0)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 2:<br>
Anthony Howard<br>
<br>
So now after I realized my mistake, my seed deck was full this time around. One more dilemma (Common Thief) and a ship to seed at my Vidiian Outpost (U.S.S. Intrepid). This game went much faster having two players who know the game and are regular players (this game took 15 minutes). Seven of Nine in my opening hand and my guys roll to victory getting Aftermath and Study Interstellar Colony. He would have gotten some points if not for my Gravimetric Distortion.<br>
<br>
Full Win 70-0<br>
3(+70)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 3:<br>
Jeremy Miller<br>
<br>
Jeremy is one our better regular Swiss players, but this was his first sealed deck and first look at the Voyager cards. This game was also fast. Jeremy used some stuff I was expecting, The Phage popped up once and he used Nanoprobe Resus. He got Thaden with the Phage and wanted to do it again but he tried to Nanoprobe resus on The Phage then play it again on the same mission attempt. But since I had started mission attempt I wouldnt let him. Generally I did my space mission (Study Interstellar Colony) first then my planet, even though I put my outpost at the planet (Aftermath). So I got my space mission first and then he got a mission for 30. I got Aftermath for 35 and the win. I heard later on he had Villagers with Torches and a Twisted dilemma, a combo which would have hurt me bad as well if I had to face it.<br>
<br>
Full Win 70-30<br>
5 (+110)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 4:<br>
Thomas Kamiura<br>
<br>
Thomas was in very good shape coming into this round being the only undefeated player left. Thomas and I have had some duels in the past in Swiss, this however was our first Sealed Deck confrontation. So the game starts out quite slow, we keep playing personnel and I cannot for the life of me pull a third Security to insure safety against any Kazon Bombs I might run into. I send down two expendable personnel to the planet, he flips torches. I start getting worried because he has enough to get both of his missions as long as his better personnel didnt disappear to dilemmas. I keep waiting, I finally draw a Security, but its too late he goes and does both of his missions on the next turn before I can as he easily got past my Gravimetric Distortion with Dereth (rare Viidian with Navigation x2).<br>
<br>
Full Loss 0-65<br>
5(+45)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 5:<br>
Chad Williams<br>
<br>
I knew this was going to be a challenging game. I heard him play Janeway last game, so I knew he had her in his deck. Turned out he had Janeway, Tuvok, and a few other good rares (maybe another good bridge personnel which I cant remember now...). Anyways this game I dont have too much trouble getting my Security out. I go after my space mission first, I clear out all of the dilemmas except Navigational Hazards and get stopped cause a Common Thief took out Drenol my only Stellar Cartography. He goes and gets a mission for 35, easily getting past a Lack of Prep but I get a lucky pull which he loses two Engineers to Spatial Rift (one of which also had Astrophysics). On my turn I start to go after my missions even though Im still havent gotten Seven of Nine out yet. Beam everyone down and attempt Aftermath...I lose Chakotay to a Trabe Grenade so I cant solve because he was my for the Honor OR Treachery needed to complete the mission. I know he might win on the next turn and draw my two cards. I pull Thompson and Drenol and know that I can win on next turn (Drenol has Stellar Cartography and Treachery). He goes after his space mission now, easily gets past the first two dilemmas, Kazon Bomb and Implication. He hits my Gravimetric Distortion, he only has two Engineers and only one Astrophysics. I lucked out on pulling his Engineers on his first attempt. He gets stopped and cant do anything. I play Drenol and Thompson on my turn and get Aftermath and then my space mission for the win.<br>
<br>
Full Win 70-30 (?)<br>
7(+85)<br>
<br>
<br>
Heres how it ended:<br>
1. Jeremy Miller<br>
2. Thomas Kamiura<br>
3. Garrhet Noda (Me)<br>
4. Tristan ?<br>
5. Chad Williams<br>
<br>
Jeremy took the Assign Mission Specialists Foil and the Plasma Torpedo Foil went to a random person, sorry all I can remember is his name was Tim. Congrads to all.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Michael Bauer the TD for a sucessful tournament. Hopefully our tournaments can draw just as many people in the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a few observations...<br>
- Implication at first glance looks like a good dilemma, but actually its easy to get past since two of the start deck cards have Law, Magistrate Drang and Nimira. I drafted three Implications and ended up using two of them the whole time.<br>
<br>
-The Next Emanation also looks like a nice pull. Unfortunately only a handful of personnel are unique and your lucky if they die...I realized this and realized I was wasting a seed slot on it, and by Round 4 it was out of my seed deck.<br>
<br>
-The Delta Flyer doesnt have a tractor beam...whats up with that?<br>
<br>
-Some good dilemmas to get:<br>
<br>
Kazon Bomb was effective on several occasions because all the personnel are weak.  Since Security wasnt totally abundant (I had 4, I heard one person didnt get any, a few others had few as well). Its also a common.<br>
<br>
Spatial Rift is quite awesome for this format of sealed deck because the cunning on all the personnel is very low. The only major counter to this would be Lower Decks most likely. I saw two persons who pulled Lower Decks out of 14. A common.<br>
<br>
Twisted, this card was totally awesome. I never saw it during the tournament but I only had two personnel who had cunning over seven (Chakotay with 8 and Seven of Nine with 9). Combined with Villagers With Torches, make it a little bit of a pain. This of course is made easier with Lower Decks. But again...not that many people had it.<br>
<br>
Gravimetric Distortion is a great dilemma for any format. Its only a wall but its a tough space wall. Astrophysics and Engineers are in abundance but it stopped most of my opponents long enough for me to win. 4 Engineers or 2 Astrophysics is tough, a personnel with 2 Navigation is also hard to pull as well, since all three are rare (Paris, Karden, and Dereth). Also there is only one double Engineer in this set, Arturis, also a rare.<br>
<br>
Crisis is a pain. I ran into it twice. Got stopped by it once. I forgot it was in this set otherwise I would have been ready the first time. There are plenty of Officers in this set....plenty. I was playing with at least 8 (2 Drenol, 2 Cavit, 2 Paxim, Stadi, and Chakotay). Yup, I know probably too many, But Paxim has Astro, Stadi is a range booster for my Intrepids, Cavit is my back up Leadership and I needed his Transporter skill just in case for Restock Supplies, Lastly Drenol because of his Stellar Cartography and Treachery. Another common. </span></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="reportread.php3?report=43"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/read.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="reportreview.php3?report=43"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/review.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><a href="reports.php3"><img src="/stccg/global/images/back.gif" border="0" ></a></TD><TD></TD></TR></TABLE></span></td>
