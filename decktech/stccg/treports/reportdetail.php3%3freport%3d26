California State Championships Tournament Report<br>
April 14 2001<br>
<br>
Prelude:<br>
<br>
This story starts 4 months ago in December. As soon as I heard about the world champship cuircut (and that the States gave an invite to the worlds) I decided to play Defend Homeworld trigger deck at states. I started to play the deck and after 6 weeks, people started stalling against me (“stalling” in terms of not attempting missions, not sitting there and wasting time) and my deck would lose by 5 points at literally the last second. As a result, I choose to play a Q-bypass deck at the last minute instead. I used a Federation Cargo Run Deck (that is still undefeated) to figure out the metagame; no Hide and Seeks were found, so I was good to go. No one except the director knew what I was playing before the event.<br>
<br>
The Deck:<br>
Q-Bypass: Don’t You Understand? I Got it At Goodwill!<br>
<br>
SEE Decktech: STCCG: Decks: LCARS search “Don’t You.... At Goodwill!”<br>
<br>
Q-bypass just gets easier and easier with all those jump start cards, and as a result I could get out 2 leadership and 64 INTEGRITY without the use of a card play (and I could use the card play for a Revolving Door for a Q-Flash if needed). AMS: Benjamin Maxwell, Norah Satie, ASP: Serak, DH: Anya, Salia, GTTT: Admiral Riker, Starship Enterprise, Dr. McCoy, IAADNAB, Reginod, Plasmadyne Relay<br>
<br>
The Deck Title is basically a pun. It explains why played this deck... I got it from a cheap store that sells cheap (as in both inexpensive and cheesy) stuff.<br>
<br>
The Night Before:<br>
<br>
We play Friday nights at the local shop (where the States were) and about every other week there is some sort of tournament. This week there was a swiss tournament, I spent my last day of Spring Break conjouring up my Bajoran Orb deck (my longest-lesting deck), but I forgot it! At that is worse that forgetting to download Kivas Fajo. As a result, I borrow someone else’s deck (Federation Space). The following day I could not forget my deck.<br>
<br>
 The tournament had 28 players (frankly, I did not care how many player showed, but rather who showed up) consisting of every major player of every player base except last year’s ComiCon winner (darn!). I had Photocopies of my deck so could double check it and not lose a game. When you are in the running to win, you can not afford even a loss, so I was playing it safe. After Jeremy read and re-read and paraprased the tournament guidelines, the pairings finally were read.<br>
<br>
Game One vs. Jeremy Davis Klingon Blood Oath<br>
<br>
I won the coin flip, and we started. As an inexperienced player, he was not aware of any self-seeds that could be coming, so I seeded all my Qs after him. During play, I was going to sit there and let him take a turn because he still had one hidden agenda left. Since he was an inexperienced player, he may have decided to put Hide and Seek in so against such players I would let them take a turn, but he reveal his last hidden agenda, and I won on the first turn. He was a little depressed by the fact he would not get a turn until the third round, so I told him that he would not be the only one, and we cleaned up and played Tribbles.<br>
<br>
Ups: winning by the skin of my teeth; if he had a turn, my Starship Enterprise (my only ship) would have turned to the dark side.<br>
<br>
Downs: having an inexperienced player sit around for 2 hours<br>
<br>
2 (+100)<br>
<br>
Game Two vs. Alfred Dong Federation Space<br>
Decktech Name: HHH<br>
<br>
Alfred won the toss. During the seed phase I made it look like I was seeding 15 dilemmas (putting sites in front of the mission) but I only had 9 dilemmas; he passed, and I passed too afetr seeding about after of my dilemmas. I flipped over my sites (which were in front of the mission), and he was mad. He was doing what I was doing except without the Qs. Going to the Top, Admiral Riker, Starship Enterprise, Dr. McCoy, Reginod, etc. He stole my Study “Hole in Space” which I should have flipped my HQ: Dfensive Measures to block him, but I did not realize that at the time. I download all my personnel and pass my Qs with no problem. On the last mission I solved, there was a Hide and Seek. I asked, “Why didnt you seed that?”<br>
<br>
He is all, “I do not have any dilemmas to seed under there?”<br>
I said, “You do... once I overcome Q and *discard* all the dilemmas under the missions”<br>
“Oh!”<br>
He flicked me off with both hands, and start to plot his revenge after the tournament.<br>
<br>
Ups: Winning despite Hide and Seek<br>
<br>
Downs: Having no allies to rally his revenge; losing a mission.<br>
<br>
4 (+165)<br>
<br>
Game Three vs. Brain Spencer Bajoran Orb<br>
<br>
Well, I went frist in this game. Since I did not know Brain and he was undefeated, I had to assume he was one of the better players in Southern California. Fortunately, he overlooked my Qs, and seeded his Orbs at Characterize Neutrino Emissions. I download everything I needed, but I had to let him take a turn because he looked like he could be playing some Ferengi (including Brunt), so I had to make him use his Quark’s Isolinear Rods (so he could not download Brunt when he may need it). He took his turn, and did exactly what I wanted him to do; I crashed his Defend Homeworld, so he flipped Quark’s Isolinear Rods. On the next turn, I won. He congratulated me on outsmarting him in the seed phase.<br>
<br>
Ups: Playing a player I never played before; having a somewhat good opponent in the final<br>
<br>
Downs: having a somewhat good opponent that will beat me in the final<br>
<br>
6 (+265)<br>
<br>
Game Four vs. Danny “Romuldan” Mo- Romulan STA Speed (same thing as last year)<br>
Last Year’s Regional Winner<br>
<br>
Dan won the toss, and we continued. He only outseeded me on one Q (but that is where I seeded the Magic Carpet Ride OCD, which I needed). Dan also add a Q-Flash (with a Beware of Q; heck ***Q BACKFIRES***) to make it harder to win. I downloaded all the things I needed, and then when he wanted to download, I suspended play to download the rest of my personnel I needed; afterwards, I crashed his download. As a result, it took him two turns to start solving missions (with only 9 dilemmas, I do not have a lot of defense once he starts attempting missions). I tent for my Revolving Door and play it on his flash. Crash the download for AU door. I go out all my personnel and took a HUGE risk by attempting Investigate Coup, the only mission outseeded. Lack of Preperation!  He tries to swap it for a Flash, but wait; oh darn, he can’t! I pass it grab the OCD and score the other two missions for the game. He called it, “A *Not So* good game.”<br>
<br>
8 (+325)<br>
<br>
Ups: Winning against last year’s regional winner (Note no Risa regional has ever had an out-of-state player, so the California State Championship was basically a Risa regional.)<br>
<br>
Downs: Possible repeat for finals. Having someone call it not so good game.<br>
<br>
Dinner Break, I sit around for forty-five mintues thinking that I can always get food later (yeah right!)<br>
<br>
Game Five vs. Matt Kirk Council of Bloody Referees<br>
Decktech Name: “Firgin”<br>
<br>
I figured that he was playing Klingon; Klingon shirt, tournament reports, etc. Matt was the smartest player I played, he actually seeded Hide and Seek as an *Event*, seeded Quark’s Isolinear Rod’s, seperated my missions, and more. In the seed phase, he outseed me at three missions, so I would have to take at least two major risks. Added to that, if I am stopped, he battles; then, I screwed! In the game, I get out to fast start. I Crashed him on turn one, but he had QiR. I blocked his Blood Oath downloads with Obelisk of Masaka/Computer Crash, so he could not kill me in one turn. It took him about five turns to get out his armada, but it also took me five turns to get my Q crew out (with Enrique and Julian to helpout with any fillters they may have been outseeded. I attempt Investigate Coup (the one with the OCD I need)... Q, but he has Hide and Seek: Female/Scow and New Essentialist. I hit Female/Scow first andthe mission attempt stops after Norah Satie goes away, so I tow the Scow with Reginod and Enrique, then the New Essentialists come and Enrique and Anya have the honor. That is forty points with AMS and I travel to Releif Mission (right next to Wormhole Negotiations) and attempt Wormhole Negotiations... Lack of Preperation  again. Solve with Sarek, Salia, and Admiral Riker. Currently, I am a sitting duck; I am right next to his Empok Nor, and on the next turn, I am forced to pull the ship to my hand (say about forty cards). He uses Q the Referee to pull Scorched hand right out of his deck. Fortunatly, he picked my only ship and 40 INTEGRITY in personnel to quickly pass those Qs (once I get hem out... 7-8 turns). Matt starts attempting missions... Reflief mission takes him one turn (for only 25 points though) and a Good Day To Live has Dead End, so he his “stopped”. Time runs out on the next turn. <br>
<br>
85-25<br>
<br>
9 (+385)<br>
<br>
Ups: None<br>
<br>
Downs: Having a player complain about stalling; yet another player saying it was not such a great game.<br>
<br>
<br>
	I want to note that I took a lot of time to think in those six to seven turns because it was such a tight situation. Generally, the opponent should be able to win in five to six turns, so I normally win before my opponent or lose in those six turns. As a result, I take all the time I need because I “know” that the game should end rather quickly. I have learned from experience (Round Four ComiCon Team Play ‘00 vs Stephen Lee, etc.) that taking time to think pays off even if that means taking half hour turns; not in terms of timing out, but actually find a creative way out of a unique situation in order to win. That game would have been a simple race, but probably would have close (if I drew the right cards). I was not trying to stall in that situation, but rather finding a way out of a tight situation. (Three Klingon Bird of preys chasing a primative  Contitution, is a tight situation) I just want to make people understand. If anyone is taking a long time, call over the TD *BEFORE* the game is over so he can watch. If the player *abuses* the 60-minute time limit in an obvious way, he must award the game to appropiate player. If the TD did not watch, he can determine whether or not it was stalling. That is a lesson to EVERYONE, including me.<br>
<br>
Game Six vs Dave Doulass -Some Federation Deck<br>
<br>
	At this point, I am in the final; that’s the good news.... Against either Dannymo OR Brian (who were playing each other for the seat at the final confrantation), both of which I have played, so I tell them whoever wins will be the State Champion (if they are smart...); that’s the bad news. As a result, I flat out told him what I was playing... Q -bypass. In the seed phase, I am outseed once, but am unable to seed one Q (unfortunately, may OCD did not have a Q under it). Get out my ten person crew, and start attempting missions starting with the one without a Q (but the OCD), I hit Horta and Lack of Preperation. One person dies... Narah Satie and solve the mission for 35. I move to the next mission Avert Disaster, I attempt. Unfortunately, he outseeded me here... Hide and Seek. !@#$%. I shuffle my personnel and he cuts... remember if I fail Q (and my opponent if smart), I lose. If flip them over one by one. Julian, Benjamin, Reginod... at the point I know that I start saying that he has one the game, but the Hide and Seek (represented by the Starship Enterprise) has not hit yet. With only three cards to go I yell, “Stop’em ALL!” As they keep getting stopped I yell louder and louder until he flips over the second to last one... Admiral Riker! They are all stopped and I will not fail Q! I raise my hands in the air and yell, “Yeah he stopped them ALL!” Then this HUGE Warhammer poster falls off the wall and lands on my head! David gets one more turn, he fails a Dead End at his Empok Nor he just commandeered, and next turn I solve the space mission next door for the win!<br>
<br>
Ups: Practicing for Finals; winning Despite Hide and Seek; having fun yelling!<br>
<br>
Downs: Having a player lose their final tournament game!<br>
<br>
11 (+485)<br>
<br>
At this point we take a hour break for prizes, etc. before Dan and I play the final.<br>
This is what First Gets: (Ahhhhh!) Plasma Torpedo FOIL, State Champion Pack, Invite<br>
Second: (Crap!) Reflection Pack, Runner-Up Pack, NO Random FOIL entry <br>
<br>
Final Confrontation:<br>
<br>
Okay he we are two high school students, one REALLY optimistic (he won the final in 20 mintues last year quick and simple), and the other REALLY pestimistic about the final (hence, Forgetting about Kivas Fajo). Dan knows this deck from the time before: Ferengi Bugs, Dead Ends and Female/Scow, so all of his Soong-type Androids turn into ENGINNER. Last thing, we are playing at eleven o’clock at night the weekend before school resumes from Spring Break! Enjoy!<br>
<br>
	The game starts, Dan goes first. We seed out missions; this time Dan seperated my missions, so the OCD was mandatory. We seeded, and Dan passed away (and a should have passed too because I had Mission Debreifing, but it was too big of a risk), I started to seed, and evetually he quit passing. We seeded out all the dilemmas and he started passing again, which ment I HAD to seed. At this point I seeded 7 of 10 of my hidden agendas. I ask Jeremy the Amassador a dumb question: “Is there any penalty to mis-seeding?” (It should have been: What am I doing wrong?) The answer is that you can not solve the mission, so I seeded my addtional Q the Referee and Quark’s Isolinear Rods as junk seeds far away under missions I was not planning to solve. Then he fell for Q’s illusion and “outseeded” me there. I add to think wether or not to seed Obelisk of Masaka... 1 minute, and 2 mintues pass, and could not make up my mind if I wanted to junk seed it. After TEN minutes, I decide to seeded it as a junk seed, and he falls for it. During the seed phase, because I took so long to seed, we both forgot whose turn it was and Jeremy said, “I only answer rules questions! I am not paying attention!” Fortunately  the others knew exactly whose turn it was. We end the seed phase (I have TWO open Qs!!!) and one outseeded mission. We start after using 25 minutes for the seed phase. Dan knows from all my cheese, he should flip all his Q the Referees first. I take advantage of his lack of downloading and download all my stuff before he does. Then when he downloads I have everything (except Reginod), and he doesn’t because of my Crashes! I tent for Julain and Enrique to cover that outseeded mission (unfortunately, I forgot I only had two Q’s Tents, so no Revolving Door for me!).<br>
Eventually, I have my whole crew (ten personnel) out on the fourth turn and start attempting missions. I got one and then OCD to the outseeded mission... Odo’s Cousin... I got that Reginod and Dr. McC... Q-Flash via Beware of Q... !@#$% Q Bites Back!!!! I forgot the Revovling Door!!!! He filps the Q cards I know I lost at this point (but only if his smart!)... Hide and Seek Dan says, “Shuffle them up!”. <br>
	I am all, “Sure! Q2!” He did not play the Hide and Seek as an Event. That is Mistake the First! ...Q-Type Android (Serak YEAH!)... Fightin’ Words ... Q’s Planet !@#$% ... Penalty Box (Norah Satie)... Mandrin Balief (+/- 5 Points). I can only score 120 someone points with my missions because I junk seeded under the other missions. I continue the misson Q... Norah Satie was put into the box, so I show him the 60 remaining INTEGRITY I need and solve the mission.<br>
	Were you paying attention... Dan nor I certainly were not. I only had 1 Leadership with Benjamin Maxwell (the Fightin’ Words forces all the leadership to be lost). Fortunately, Jeremy will not let Dan take back my move (That is Mistake the Second), and got the remaining mission... I wo... but I need 140 poins to win because of Q’s Planet (I only ahd 115 right then). If Dan was going to win this one, he needed to do it fast and flawless. Dan quickly score two missions putting him at 75 (or so) points. With no more missions to solve, I attempt Wormhole Negotiations... Maglock turns into a flash... and then Cytherians. I am at 110 after the Q-Flash (because of Mandirin Bailif). On Dan’s next turn solves yet another mission to give him a total of Hundred points. There are less than five minutes to go, I drew a Palor-Toff, for a Q’s Tent... Regenerate. And Dan’s next turn, he solves yet another mission (125) and heads for Q’s Planet; first, he uses Q the Referee to download Oof!... wait... there are no more! That’s mistake the third. He attempts with everybody, He hits my Q! I immediately score my Cytherians (It is all tied up 125, but I have the regulation play tiebraker). There are thirty seconds left; I draw and let Dan go. He tents for Pheonix. I draw and let him go, plays Pheonix and solves Q’s Planet for the win! 135-125 with literally one second to go. Now that is such a great game.<br>
<br>
Ups: Having a good game with such a chessey deck; having beaten the winner in all world qualifiers I have played in the last two years (Dannymo (Twice); Greg Fuller)<br>
<br>
Downs: Making one huge mistake in the beginning (overlooking Q flash/Beware of Q)<br>
<br>
11(+484)<br>
<br>
To all: I will be ComiCon this year, last year we had NO ONE came from out-of-region. We only had 24 people last year (and the year before that... 18). Come down ... Or else. <br>
<br>
To all, again: If you are wondering why I play cheesey decks, I do not know either. I REALLY lucked out this time: Of 7 games, 5 played Hide and Seek (3 seeded, 2 in Q-Flash). So I have NO clue why this deck worked; I guess I played people who did not understand the function of the card. If you do not like the deck, play Hide and Seek; simple! Currently, I am planning a somewhat cheesy deck for post-Voyager at ComiCon, be prepared!<br>
