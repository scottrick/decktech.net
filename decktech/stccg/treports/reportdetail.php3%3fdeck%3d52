After seven weeks (technically eight, but one with a weak<br>
showing dosen&#146;t count) of solid legue play with number raninging from 6-15 at<br>
tournaments, this si the final week. Having just came in three weeks ago, Eric White has a<br>
solid average of 6.3. Right below him is myself, holding onto a 5.8. I&#146;ve had three<br>
undefeates, the most of anyone, but one horrid tournament where I went 1-3 sufficently<br>
caused a big enoguh blow to force me to work for this. Wendell White, Jr. (no relation to<br>
Eric) is also right in the running with a 5.7. Greg Hodgikins (spelling?) is also following<br>
our trail with around a 5.2. Seven weeks of playing comes down to this -- Eric needs to go<br>
2-2 and then if Wendell or I go undefeated, the one that does wins. However, if Eric goes<br>
3-1, he&#146;s got the box. Sufficet to say, today will be very interesting. <br>
<br>
11 people show up (which is impressive, with three of regulars off shooting a movie),<br>
including a new player for the third week in a row. I arrive a good fourty-five minutes in<br>
advance to find eight people already there. Two come later and three drops out during the<br>
four game tournament. Ever since Voyager has came out, I&#146;ve gone undefeated. First time,<br>
I ran a a DQSS deck that used the Array to drop in people from the Alpha Quadrent for<br>
mission solving/dilemma busting. Other time, I ran a Vidiian mission solver with DQSS<br>
and Theft to get people out and Genetronic Replicators to bust throguh missions. At this<br>
point, I&#146;m fairly tired of DQSS decks, but I know I HAVE to win today to get the league<br>
prize -- bragging right (oh, and a box of Voyaer, too). So I mix the two decks together<br>
and decide to run space with Scans for mission solving. We start shaprly at four, and we&#146;re<br>
off... <br>
<br>
Game 1: New Player <br>
I hate this. Well, I mean, I like the win, but he had just starting getting cards today and I<br>
had to help him sort out between a seed deck and draw deck. He beamed down and hit a<br>
Lack of Preparation early on. I went slow and sort of stalled myself a bit, trynig to show<br>
him important things to learn, like downloading. I win in about fifteen minutes, but happily<br>
show him many new things and he gains enough interested to come back later, whcih is<br>
what was key here. (Plus, he took almost all of our common/uncommon box, so he&#146;ll have<br>
some cards. ;-)) <br>
Full win, 100-0 <br>
2(+100) <br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Love getting new players, that never hurts, ever. We now have almost 18 players who<br>
have played at least once or twice here and around 12 regulars, it&#146;s great. <br>
<br>
Slops: <br>
Little competition. <br>
<br>
With less than a minute left, a Great Thing Happened(TM). Wendell pulled out a very<br>
close win against Eric, 100-95. That means if I can remain undefeated and if Eric takes<br>
one more loss, I have the box. Of course, I start to get fairly nervous here. Just have to<br>
play it straight... <br>
<br>
Game 2: Greg Hodginskin (sp?) <br>
<br>
Greg had won his first game in a little less than fifteen minutes, 100-0, and wasn&#146;t playing<br>
newbie, so, needless to say, I was fairly nervous. I win the coin flip and he sets up with a<br>
fairly standard Romulan deck with a fairly small draw deck, but also runs two Space in the<br>
Alpha Quadrent (obviously for Examine Singularity). While this is a pain, it lets me run<br>
four dilemma combos under what appeared to be key missions -- Pegasus Search and<br>
Shattered Space. I start my engine on turn one by getting Torres opening hand and<br>
Quark&#146;s Roding her to the Voyager and use Kivases to draw some cards. His first turn is a<br>
very fast one, using all possible downloads (Spacedoor, Defend Homeworld, ASP, and<br>
Temporal Mico-Wormhole for R&#146;Mor) and also grabbing two free reports to the Romulan<br>
Headquarters. (He used a neat trick with Beyond The Subatmic to get one of them.) He<br>
proceedes to Tent for a Black Hole and flies over there, using Examine Singularity to<br>
close his own Hole and grab 15 points. He goes back to his outpost and picks up everyone<br>
and attempts Investigate Sighting II. He has much doubel redudandcy for the mission and<br>
dilemma, but I realize his last mission will be Pegasus Search for 50 points and the win<br>
(with mission specalists). Knowing my Scientific Method is there, I use A Fast Ship<br>
Would Be Nice under Pegasus so kill off some of his Science. He gets the points but is out<br>
of Range. <br>
<br>
On my next turn, I simply play more people with the Array abd Kivases with Schism. I<br>
have drawn all three of my Scans and know that I can get missions by turn three. He<br>
proceeds on his turn to hit a Kelvan and Scientific Method at Pegasus. While he had many<br>
skills by this point, he didn&#146;t have 3 SCIENCE. I rush over to Reinitlize Warp Reaction,<br>
after having Scanned, and know there is a fairly simple Scientific Method/Hippocratic<br>
Oath/Barclay&#146;s comob there, so, using McCoy to kick out the Oath, I nab a quick 45 there.<br>
Heal Life-Form is next, and(post-Scanned), I know there is a Scout En@#$%er/QSL combo<br>
there. I leave the Flyer behind, let Voyager take the the brunt fo the combo and move the<br>
Flyer over... only to have it Wormholed to the Alpha Quadrent! I have the OWR in my<br>
Tent with a Ref, but, since I must use three Range to return back to where I started, I<br>
don&#146;t have enough to reach the mission. On his turn, I know there&#146;s only one card he needs<br>
to win -- McCoy gotten out with TMW. He tries to use Beyond the Subatmoic, but I<br>
Quinn. There&#146;s nothing he can do now, all his people out unable to get his other missions,<br>
besides Pegasus. With much luck, he didn&#146;t have two more Wormholes to get over to the<br>
DQ and blow up my Voyager. I move the Flyer over, unstasis my ship, get the mission,<br>
and fly over to a Scanned Interstellar Colony. Get through dilemma and use Samantha<br>
Wildman to complete, for the win, <br>
100-55 <br>
4 (+145) <br>
<br>
Props: Despite a huge amount of typing, it was a very fast and nerve wrecking game,<br>
ending by turn four. If it had not been for my Quinn (or simply another couple of turns for<br>
him), I would have falled much faster. <br>
<br>
Slops: Not much, a great and close game. Deck worked exactly as it should, having played<br>
another speed deck and simply being faster. <br>
<br>
Wendell won, 100-5, and Eric won, 100-0. The stage is set and the die is cast. The next<br>
game is between Wendell and I, the winner knocks the other ou of the running. <br>
<br>
Game #3: Wendell White <br>
<br>
Wendell and I play like mad. We met each at DragonCon last year and have tested decks<br>
constantly ever since. He won our States (I got third and missed final confrontation by<br>
nine differntial) and we&#146;re heading up to DecipherCon together. Every time we play it&#146;s a<br>
**** close game. We&#146;re both speed deck players with almost nothing in the way of<br>
stalling. <br>
<br>
Today Wendell is running a nice Ferengi mission solver, with Rules cards and Cargo Runs<br>
for card draws. He goes first and quickly start setting up by getting Hanok out with<br>
TMW/RRD for a Rule and several Ferengi on Ferenignar. Once of his cool tricks is to<br>
then use Hanok to build a Remote Supply Depot at a Dominion mission to get two<br>
equipment for Cargo Running. On my turn, I just start setting up, getting my people out<br>
early on and Scanning. By turn two or three, he&#146;s a whole bunch of people on his side and<br>
is Cargo Running cautiously to avoid Schorched (just as I am Kivasing cautiously). I&#146;ve<br>
Scanned everything I need to and see consistency with Chula (either The Way Home or<br>
the Chandra)-Q Gets The Point (or a Spatial Rift)-Chula: The Game, all meant to slow me<br>
down. He catchs on during his third turn I am only a turn away from winning with my<br>
almost complete mega-crew and rushes to get to missions. He heads on over to Relocate<br>
Settlers and uses Birbery to attempt and gets the points. First up is A Fast Ship. He choses<br>
to lose his ship in orbit and then gets pass Executive Authorization with his Nagus. He<br>
Toffs for Hidden Fighter, but, needing the people on Ferenginar to get Alter Records, he<br>
plays it there. He takes off, move overs, picks them up and tries to move over there with<br>
nine range... until I point out it took him one Range to take off from the planet. Next turn,<br>
Seven/Harry/Torres get through Chandra/Spatial Rift and are stopped by Chula: The<br>
Game. I send over Penk (yay, Penk!) to pass through that and then, having had my Scans<br>
for prior knowledge and revelation, am able to get past a mix of Chandras, Games, Q Gets<br>
The Points, and Dead Ends for the win. <br>
100-30 <br>
6 (+115) <br>
<br>
Props: Another close game, won by Quark&#146;s Treasure lack of one RANGE. Also, Penk<br>
was absolutly huge, passing a pair of Games and Q Gets The Points. <br>
<br>
Slops: We were done first, as I had been the first couple of times, so lots of time waiting<br>
around and doing nothing. <br>
<br>
With Wendell&#146;s loss, he was out of the running for first and Greg also lost to a very<br>
creative Borg deck (keeping secret), so he was also out. We waited for Eric to win, and,<br>
sure enough, he won, 100-0. This meant my last game of this season comes down to this...<br>
a show down between #1 and #2. (Amazing, eight weeks of play and averaging scores for<br>
it to come down to this one game.) Whoever wins this game gets the box and eternal<br>
bragging rights, the loser, well, a loser (though everyone else gets to draft from a second<br>
box of Voyager, so, Second place gets first pick of the rare, so, still a good prize). <br>
<br>
Game #4: Eric White <br>
First thing we do while waiting for Wendell (who took the longest) to clean up is start<br>
yelling out Simpson&#146;s quotes and busting into &quot;drunken&quot; singing. It was great and sure got<br>
some funny looks from other players. ;-) <br>
<br>
However, once it started, it had the feel of a Finals Confrontation. Never having been in<br>
that situation, I was trying to play as slowly as I could. First thing that struck me odd was<br>
Eric&#146;s 3 Temporal Micro-Wormholes. As we finished seeding, the spaceline was this: <br>
Study Internment Site-Explore Intersteallar Colony-Reinitlize Warp Reaction-4<br>
Space-Liberation-4 more Space-my two other space missions-Cure Deadly<br>
Virus-Research Phage <br>
<br>
The first thing that struck me that was with only two missions (both planet) my choosing<br>
to not run The Big Picute wasn&#146;t overly smart. ;-) My second one was that with 3 TMWs<br>
and two high point missions, he was clearly running some Ajur/Boratus action. Seeing as<br>
he had already used many seeds early on, I took a risk and only seeded three dilemmas<br>
under each of his. It paid off when we ended and only my dilemmas were at his, with no<br>
self-seeds, making Ajur and Boratus useless. <br>
<br>
He won the coin flip and went first. On his turn, after using free reports and havresting off<br>
his now useless Ajur, he went straight down to Research Phase. Lack of Prep, no problem.<br>
Kelvan Show of Force hit him next. The alst dilemma would be Implication, so I chose<br>
between Motura and a mission specalist, killing the mission specalist. He couldn&#146;t pass<br>
Implication, but, he basically had completed one mission in one turn. I knew I had to go as<br>
fast as I could now. <br>
<br>
Early on I played many a Kivases, but a first turn (yay!) Array drop of John<br>
Doe-McCoy-Motura (my only non-reporable to Voyager people) meant I&#146;d soon be able<br>
to get throguh the Spaces and to my missions on the far left. Scans showed he had walls:<br>
Under Reinitlize was Radioactive Garbage Scow-Chandra-Conundrum and Study<br>
Interstellar Colony was Q Gets The Point-Chula: The Game-Dead End. Study Internment<br>
Site would stay a mystery, since I added in no Full Planet Scans. He flipped Mission<br>
Debreifing at this point (in case I tried Liberation this turn, which I didn&#146;t) and ditched the<br>
Ref early on for a The Big Picture -- I now had to do that extra planet mission. <br>
<br>
On his next turn, after some Harvesting, he got past Research Phage for a cool 45 points,<br>
but was stopped by his own Mission Debreifing. I loaded up and just starte crossing the<br>
Spaces. However, I had Kivases many a times during my own. While I had been able to<br>
get my people out of my hand, his own Mirror Image had given him a large hand and I<br>
Schorched. His turn, he flew over to Cure Deadly Virus and beamed down. Lack of<br>
Prepation. Turns out he had gone too fast -- there was no extra Biology. He drew and<br>
then I just proceeded to cross more Space on my next turn. <br>
<br>
He got out Danara Pel and beamed back down. A Fast Ship was a clear choice for Sorum<br>
to bite the dust for, but the last dilemma would lock him out: Executive Authorization. He<br>
had no PADD and no one to TMW in for it. His only toher source of points, a Colony,<br>
couldn&#146;t be built because the only mission he completed was where his outpost was. <br>
<br>
I got past the Spaces and got through Reinitlize to get some points w/ a scerficial Flyer.<br>
Mission Debreifing stopped me. His turn, load up some Vidiian ships to try to reach me,<br>
but he never would be able to -- his own Space created too large a barrier. I now had to<br>
risk it on Study Internment, with only two dilemma. Beamed everydown beside a Kim<br>
(complets that mission), Penk (passes the Q Gets The Point/Game combo at Study<br>
Interstellar), and Wildman (completes Study Interstellar). I hit Implication, pass with<br>
Tuvok. Last is a Dead End. Knowing the third dilemma at Study Interstellar is a Dead<br>
End, I fly over there. Penk gets past both dilemmas and Wildman completes Study<br>
Interstellar. Next turn, I complete Study Internment Site for the win. <br>
<br>
Props: Winning, for sure, especially against a great opponent like Eric. He normally plays<br>
stall decks (his last one was a 100 card draw deck with 50 Rouge Borg -- IFF/IA didn&#146;t do<br>
much to help), so something speedy was new for him. <br>
<br>
Slops: Spaces are annoying and his flipping a Mission Debriefing before I could Quinn it. <br>
<br>
The last two games are fun ones, with one losing because his only low integrity -- Anya --<br>
was selected for Spatial Rift. Wendell wins, thanks to some Dabo. <br>
<br>
I win the tournmanet, but, more importanly, the league. Eric was second, Wendell third,<br>
and Greg fourth. It was a great day. <br>
<br>

-- Winning the league and already finding someone who will buy the box for $60.<br>
Including two tourney foils I&#146;ve already sold for over 100 each, that&#146;s nearly $300 in one<br>
month by playing cards. ****, yeah. <br>
<br>
-- Great competition at Dr. No&#146;s. Wendell, Greg, Eric, Mike (our Ambassador), and Buck<br>
(store owner, always plays Borg it seems) are great, but there&#146;s also a medium range with<br>
5-7 other players who can give you some great games and surprise you a lot. Add in 2-3<br>
new players and have a perfect playing communit. A year ago, we had only five of us.<br>
Now, it&#146;s been almost two months since we&#146;ve had non-sacutined. <br>
<br>
-- Penk, for winning me games 3 and 4. <br>
<br>
-- Next league. One ends, one begins, and the prize this time is a much sought after box of<br>
Blaze of Glory... <br>
<br>
-- Voyager. Sure, too much broken stuff, but, it has brought in five new players simply<br>
because you can just invest in it and be competitive. It&#146;s great and we were all surprise by<br>
how effective it was for getting new player in the game. <br>
<br>
Slops: <br>
-- Voyager. So much broken stuff I almost felt compelled to play. I was surprised that<br>
only a handful of us have played it this week, but, it&#146;s catching only real fast. It was nice<br>
for new players, but, the it&#146;s just too good. I&#146;m sick of it all, I&#146;m going to play Alpha<br>
Quadrent affiliations for the next few weeks. <br>
<br>
-- Scans. Those, however, I feel I got to play. Dilemmas so good and almost good counter<br>
for Scans. Killing one to see dilemmas that can save a dozen is worth it. Something that<br>
definitly needs a more definitve couner in The Borg. <br>
<br>
-- Sealed Deck. First week of every month isn&#146;t league, it&#146;s something different. I know we<br>
don&#146;t like doing scnerio stuff since not eveyone has the needed cards, but, this Sealed<br>
Deck is Voyager Warp Speed. I got plenty of Voyager. Ah, well, I&#146;m just happy we<br>
actually have weekly tournies. <br>
<br>
-- Store policies. It states I can only one of each foil. I know this is to get everyone to get<br>
one so no one feels left out, but, man, I&#146;m greedy, I need the cash. ;-) It wouldn&#146;t be so bad<br>
if we had osmr other prize support, but we don&#146;t. Maybe we&#146;ll start a pack draft and it&#146;ll be<br>
cool. I won&#146;t complain too much, like I said, just happy to have the tournies. <br>
<br>
