We had a tourney for a box of Voyager then, and I played Borg.  They suck right now.  And I and the last to admit it.  I love Borg.  After my dismal defeat in the Delta quadrant, we had a SW tourney for a box, which I won, and then I ran a tourney.  So I had plenty of time to rebuild my Vidiian deck.  I got the nescessary dups I needed to run DQSS.  See my deck Vidiians--too many threats, for the card list.  There are a few changes I want to make, but see my deck for those ideas.<br>
<br>
We start a little late cause we had to wait for three incoming players.  I am ranked 44th in the region as the day begins. <br>
<br>
1. My Vidiians versus Jason and his Bajorans. <br>
<br>
Jason talked a bunch of crap before the game.  He was playing in the AQ with 2 dual missions.  I separated those from Bajor with Space.  I was able to get Black Hole out early and it was count down time.  He finally got some people over to one of the duals with the Emissary out and Boratus it.  He left a Dead End.  And the other dual is only 40 and he hit Friendly Fire.  My BH sucked up Bajor.  With no Nor and TM-W, I was able to Horgahn my way.  I got Research Phage with Barclays and Restore Victims.  He got the Big Pic, Big Deal..I played Colony and took double turns to win.  In this game I hit a Dead End at Restore Victims, but I got a Horgahn and Barclays, solved Research Phage and double timed to Restore and Colonized.<br>
<br>
2(100)<br>
<br>
Props: BH...mvp runner up for the tourney.<br>
Slops: Jason...stick to Klingons.  This was his first 100-0 lost in over a year.  I felt good, he did not.<br>
<br>
2. My Vidiians versus Chris and his Klingons.<br>
<br>
Chris thinks I am playing Borg (cause that is what I always did play).  He was shocked.  He is playing straight up Blood Oath Klingon, so I was affraid of his speed a bit.  I did my normal thing.  Got a BH out, he was like &quot;what?&quot;. hehe.  It seemed to me he was a bit slow getting people out, and I was not.  I got Genetronic Rep out on Chris so I tore through his dilemmas.  He did TH...TF me for like 19, but it did not matter.  He tried to SSM and I Amanda it.  He did solve a mission for 30.  Oh, and Quonos got sucked up before he could solve it.  My Tox got trashed when I Boratus, so no fun there.  I got Restore, Barclays, Research and Colonized.<br>
<br>
4 (170)<br>
<br>
Props:  Chris really enjoyed playing against this deck.  He liked all the ideas I had and what I did.  BH did its job again.<br>
Slops:  um...none.<br>
<br>
3. My Vidiians versus Kenneth Tice Delta Array Feds<br>
<br>
The game got set up with Liberation and 2 other missions isolated away from me with Space.  The points were 30-30-35, so I knew he would have to get points somewhere else, and he did not self-seed.  He would have to come my way.  I did my usual first turn killing Kahless to get Motura to get Dereth to get another Harvester.  I did the Boratus thing.  Meanwhile the BH hit the table, but it did not have as big an impact in this game.  He tried solving one mission and hit a Founders Secret.  His next turn he miss added and got stopped again.  He finally dropped a Flyer with some people and got the Secret, then they died with the secret to the flying pancakes (Denevan).  Then he went to the space mission with Voyager and hit a Borg Cube.  Oh, did I tell you he burned his QrR for Big Pic.  His only one.  So Voyager bites it.  And he has, I think 2 people in play.  The cube moves my way, oh, but at the end of my turn the BH sucks it up!  Since I do not have Genetronic out, I still his 35 point mission (no QtR for Fair Play).  I barely remember what I had put under there.  I just squeaked by with the Leadership...then sailed through Spatial Rift (Motura I left at the Outpost and Lower Decks was in play) and creamed the Ferengi Infestation.  Bam, 100 points, one planet, one space and no Colony.<br>
<br>
6 (270)<br>
<br>
Props:  My deck stands up against Delta Feds and wins.  Without interaction.  BH suckin up borg..hehe.<br>
Slops:  Kenneth was the TD, so we had to wait sometimes to answer questions, but I won with plenty of time, so not really a slop, just an inconvenience.  I did not get Genetronic Rep out.  Vidiians rule with that card.  I pack three just in case.<br>
<br>
4. My Vidiians versus Charles Deese and Barzan Wormholes<br>
<br>
This was it.  I knew I *could* beat him.  I did a week earlier 100-15 without the DQSS.  Alpha Quad looked like this:  Romulan Outpost Mission, Excavation, space X2, Mission where a Nor can be seeded, Wormhole Negotiations, space X2, Iconia Investigation, and Investigate &quot;Shattered Space.&quot;  I got the BH out b/w the first set of space.  He scored first using Boratus at Excavation.  He hit Denevan, I killed three people (both Mission Specs and one other).  He got the 25 points.  He must have had a crappy hand, cause he drew and did nothing for awhile.  I think he was building a Barzan drop (which he did 3 times in the game).  I did Boratus at Restore Victims and left my Tox and 2 of his dilemmas.  He attempted his Outpost using SSM, I Amanda, he hits FLI/Scow, some Romulan goes waaaaay down the spaceline and he has no other Engineer.  It takes him several turns to clear it, then he hits Edo Probe.  He abandons thinking I will solve next turn so he can continue.  I play with him and end up not solving it for 3 turns.  He could not do anything.  He hits me with Doppleganger killing Sulan and Dereth.  Man, now I have to kill my own guys to get more Physics and Transporter Skill.  No big deal with Vidiians.  Finally I solve Restore Victims when I get the hand I need for my surprise.  This is where a HUGE debate occured.  I Q Tent for Supernova.  I solve Restore Victims.  Acquire Tox.  Discard Chakotay (he was also down looking at his Mask), and play Tox and Supernova.  Then we argue over it for 10 minutes on whether or not I can play two cards since I am executing orders.  My side of story:  DQSS overrides and allows me to play or draw 2 cards at anytime other than in a dilemma.  The card allows me to do this.  He says no.  We look at different rules, no help.  Finally I call Kenneth for a final word from the official TD (being that both Charles and I are also TDs).  He sides with me (so did our current State Champ, Steven Cash).  So we both agree to it and to send Kathy an email concerning it.  I still believe it is legal.  And when Charles finds out, he may stop playing Romulan.  :)  Anyway, with the ruling out of the way I have a choice.  He has his Outpost with 2 staffed ships, and one dilemma there and Wormhole Negotiations with Friendly Fire there and 2 more dilemmas, and the Nor.  He has not used the Nor all game (and the BH will suck it up in 2 turns, it sucked up his Excavation earlier, although he had solved it).  The outpost his only miniscule points and the WN is the backbone of his deck with the Barzans...so I blow it up.  With 2 ships to boot.  That was pretty much the end of the game.  He had scored on a self-seeded Cytherians and scored Excavation (no AMS).  I solved Research Phage once I got Gen Rep out and Q Tented for my Colony.  He could not get past any of my other dilemmas (he had only about 6 people out after the Supernova).  It took me 3 turns to score 140; he had Big Pic out...hehe, made him burn his one QtR..I win.<br>
<br>
8(330)<br>
<br>
Props:  MVP: Supernova, no wait, DQSS.  That card rules in the right deck.  Charles for being a good sport about my deck and saying it was good.  hehe.  BH, sucked up two of his missions.  That card is not slow.  This was the first time I beat Charles in tourney play.<br>
Slops:  Our 10 minute argument over DQSS...still, we did not time out.<br>
<br>
so.....<br>
<br>
1.  Charles Kerekanich (me)<br>
2.  Keenan Byrd (also playing Vidiians)<br>
3.  Steven Cash (current State Champ)<br>
4.  Charles Deese (last years State Champ; top 12 in world)<br>
5. -12.  Everyone else<br>
<br>
It was a varying field..Vidiians, Romulan Barzan, a few Fed Array Drops, Dominion, Klingon Oath, and Bajor-Boratus-SSM-duals.  I now love the Vidiians.  There are a few changes I want to make to the deck, check out the card list and give me any other suggestions.  All welcome.<br>
<br>
Tourney Props: <br>
1. Vidiians, BH, and Supernovas.<br>
2. DQSS<br>
3. Kenneth for a great tourney....and a foil Kevin Uxbridge.<br>
4. Jason, for being a great sport and teaching his girlfriend to play.  He lost to her later on.  It was not his day.  Bajorans suck the way he plays them.  Hehe.  He did win 100-0 his second game and got revenge, on someone else.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
1. 10 minute argument over DQSS.  <br>
2. Steven for wearing that stupid fishing hat and escaping my wrath.<br>
3. Going to work after the tourney.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoyed the read.<br>
