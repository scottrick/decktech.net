<br>
Ok I KNOW that this TR is 4 months after the fact, but I&#146;ve wanted to post it ever <br>
since I read all the Wars reports.  I also hope this is a good example of a TR to people <br>
who are new to decktech. Be aware it is LONG, but I would hope it is also entertaining<br>
<br>
<br>
Pre Con stuff:<br>
<br>
So its 2 weeks before DCon and I have no decks.  My last really good deck scrubbed out <br>
at Origins so I&#146;m looking for a new deck.  Just before DCon, Vegas Trek Guru and new <br>
OSU student Robert Corbett tells me he wrecked his car and cant make the drive to <br>
DCon.  Rob has been telling me about this Dominion deck that draws and plays cards like <br>
a machine, and since he cant go, he offers to loan me his deck.  I think &quot;Great, now what <br>
do I play on day 1?&quot;  After extensive strategy discussions with Michael Puckett and Ray <br>
Hashman, my 2 best STCCG buds I decide to play it safe and run a Q bypass deck with <br>
the mentality that I will probably see 1 maybe 2 Writs on day 1 at the most.  Now how to <br>
do it fast? Well We ran some numbers and discovered that it is possible to get 2 <br>
Leadership and Int of 61 on the first turn.  Here is how<br>
<br>
Seed Risa with Arandis there (Int 7)<br>
Use Arandis to seed Husnock OP <br>
Seed Husnock ship at Husnock OP<br>
AMS Konmel (Navigation) and Kahless (Honor x2) (Int 8+10=18)<br>
ASP Ishara Yar (Need Treachery for Pegasus search) (Int 3)<br>
DH for Anya, d/l Salia (Int 9+8=17)<br>
Play Tumek as your Card Play, d/l Grilka (Int 8+8=16)<br>
7+18=25+3=28+17=45+16=61<br>
Grilka and Salia provide Leadership<br>
<br>
Seed OCD at Pegasus Search, attempt, bypass, solve, warp to Reported activity, repeat, <br>
win.  I thought that this was pretty solid.<br>
<br>
So now I have my decks and I&#146;m ready to play.<br>
<br>
Day 1:<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Q-Cheese vs. Johnny Ohlson&#146;s Dominion Mission Solver<br>
<br>
Wow.  First Game out of the box I have to play a world finalist who is using a <br>
deck conspicuously like my day 2. Deck.  Yikes.   Well to make matters worse, Johnny <br>
kept passing in the dilemma phase so I couldn&#146;t get my Qs down and feel good about it.  <br>
All my dilemmas are down and he has a bunch of cards still sitting in front of my <br>
missions, so I go ahead and pass without seeding my Qs.  He flips his cards over, and its <br>
his facilities and SITES!!!! I lose both my Qs and he just loses a Duonetic field generator.  <br>
I feel dumb.  Well I decide I just gotta solve missions the old fashioned way.  First turn I <br>
get my Would-be Byass crew out and draw his turn he drops about 2-3 cards and plays <br>
Obedience is victory to draw 2 extra cards.  My 2nd turn I get out Rax&#146;na and draw.  His <br>
second turn is the same as his first for the most part.  Third turn Vekor comes down and I <br>
decide that if I don&#146;t do something soon I&#146;m gonna lose impressively.  So I attempt <br>
Pegasus Search and somehow manage to get through it for 55.  I&#146;m shocked.  So now I <br>
move my husnock ship over to Reported activity and attempt there.  I get stopped by <br>
some wall that I can get by on my next turn but I also lose a specialist to a shot in the <br>
Back.  So now I need 3 missions.  I distortion and move over to Risa Shore leave where <br>
my outpost is and attempt it.  Amazingly enough I clear it so now I&#146;m at 85.  Johnny <br>
looks a little nervous at this point and he tries to close his spacedoor for a ship, but I flip <br>
computer crash.  He&#146;s stunned.  Being unable to do anything about it he reports a couple <br>
people and draws.  My turn I report whoever it was I needed to clear the last dilemma <br>
under Reported Activity and solve it for the 100-0 win.  After that I tell Johnny I&#146;m sure <br>
he&#146;d have a chance for revenge before the weekend was out, shake his hand, and go do an <br>
RFD interview with Mark Tuttle.<br>
<br>
2(+100)<br>
<br>
Highs: Beating a quality player; My deck actually being able to mission solve.<br>
Lows: None, it was a great game<br>
<br>
Game 2. My Q-Cheese vs. Some guy&#146;s Romulan Deck with DS9 (??)<br>
<br>
	This looked like a standard Fare mission solver.  He seeded DS9 at bajor and a <br>
neutral outpost with Rommie specialists at some random planet (yeah I know, NOPs cant <br>
go at planets. Sue me :oP) I got my Q&#146;s down and he went first by reporting some <br>
Romulan (Telek R&#146;mor?) to his OP and drawing.  I did the Super-Download and got my <br>
bypass crew.  And blew through Wormhole Negotiations for 50.  After I solved he <br>
flipped a Writ (OH NO!!!) and started to download Brunt.  I start sweating like a fiend <br>
and he says &quot;I&#146;ll report Brunt to my Guest Qua... Um... Where are my sites???!!!&quot; I <br>
look at the board and notice that his sites are sitting UNDER his DS9 where he put them <br>
during the dilemma phase and told me he&#146;d seed them later.  Whoops.  He then tries to <br>
download Brunt to the NOP, but I point out that his romulans don&#146;t like Brunt very much <br>
and they don&#146;t want him in their house so he has to wait until his turn to move his <br>
romulans away to writ-smack me.  I go over and Bypass Reported Activity and I&#146;m about <br>
to say that&#146;s game when I realize in my stupidity that I only have 95 points. *Groan* <br>
Well, having no other choice I attempt Study Hole in space. Edo Probe, Keep going <br>
Cytherians.. um, yeah. I then realize I have a wormhole in my hand and a STP on <br>
the table so I just bounce myself down to the end of the line and that IS game :o) <br>
FW 100-0<br>
<br>
4(+200)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning Despite playing like a scrub<br>
Lows: Winning when I should have lost, playing like a scrub.<br>
<br>
Game 3: My Q-Cheese vs. some guy&#146;s cool looking deck<br>
<br>
	Unfortunately I remember nothing about this game at all. It was over before my <br>
opponent had a turn and I apologized for that, and we both had a good chuckle.  So with <br>
50 minutes till the next round I go grab lunch :o) FW 100-0<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning, Getting lunch.<br>
Lows: None, the guy was a sport and didn&#146;t hold a grudge.  I told him I was rooting for <br>
him to get to day 2.  He was a real sport. <br>
<br>
6(+300)<br>
<br>
So now I am 1 win away from pretty much guaranteeing myself a spot I Day 2.  I <br>
go get lunch with Mike Mannino who is also off to a great start and we talk about having <br>
to play each other.  He tells me hes running a ferengi deck so I am a little nervous.  We <br>
also lament about our friends Brad Defruiter and Scott Roszkowski getting DQ&#146;d for bad <br>
decklists.  It was such crap.  Brad was off by a TACTIC! Who the hell cares about a <br>
tactic?! Not me.  So that really sucks.  After we finish we go back and they are <br>
announcing the pairings and I find out I get to play one of the very best<br>
<br>
Game 4: My moldy Q-Cheddar-American vs. Jason Drake&#146;s Fed Holos/OS/STP Drop<br>
<br>
	This was my first game against Jason and I didn&#146;t know him very well.  All I <br>
knew was that this would be a tough game.  Jason was number 1 in the world at the time <br>
and I know it wasn&#146;t inflated... he earned every point of it so I am a little nervous.  Strike <br>
that.  I was a LOT nervous.  He starts out by drawing a lot of cards using various <br>
methods.  He also was able to get a dilemma under one of my Q&#146;s so I gotta act fast.  I try <br>
to bypass at Pegasus search but he Q2s my Q (WTF?!) so I get stopped by something <br>
(Maglock?), and on his turn he drops ATA.  Yikes.  He has about 6 holos out and no real <br>
personell and I have my Bypassin fools who are about to die.  I throw myself at Reported <br>
Activity, pass the dilemma he got there, bypass and score 35 ( I left my mission <br>
specialists behind and attempted to clear dilemmas but I got through them all and had the <br>
requirements so I only get 35... slops to me).   I then return to my outpost and throw <br>
myself at Risa, and solve for another 30.  I then pick up my STP because his ATA is <br>
about to go off, so I spend the rest of the game rebuilding my crew.  He STP drops the FE <br>
with 4 people on board (I had IOAG) then uses Admiral Riker to download the Starship <br>
Enterprise and get another OS personnel.  I cant match his speed at this point and he gets <br>
through 3 missions fairly quickly before I can recover. FL 100-65<br>
<br>
6(+265)<br>
<br>
Highs: Having the pleasure of finally playing Jason.  He&#146;s a great player and a real sport <br>
too, not to mention a nice guy.<br>
Lows: Well I lost the game, but I hold my head high because I played him tough.<br>
<br>
I still feel confident that I will make day 2.  At this point, between the DQs and the Drops <br>
about 15 people that started are out of the tournament so the odds get better.  It&#146;s a good <br>
thing to because the competition isn&#146;t getting any easier.<br>
<br>
Game 5: My really smelly Q-Limburger vs. David Bowling&#146;s Klingons<br>
<br>
	Ok I really didn&#146;t want to play this game for the sole reason that playing a deck <br>
like mine against a former world champ is an insult IMO, but since I cant change my <br>
deck I have no choice.  Dave and I are talking before we start playing and he points out <br>
that I am ALMOST undefeated against him in pickup games and that this is our first <br>
meeting in tournament play. (For the record I am 3-1 against Dave in pickup games, he <br>
beat me with Old School Tow and Blow back at Origins in &#146;97) So we get underway and <br>
about halfway through the mission phase he says &quot;Youre bypassing aren&#146;t you?&quot; and I&#146;m <br>
like &quot;um... NO... *Blush*&quot; and realize that I&#146;m not fooling anyone so I get the <br>
feeling that I wont be bypassing this game which translates that I wont be winning this <br>
game.  But nevertheless I go after it anyway in hopes of a miracle. No such luck.  My <br>
outpost is 3 missions away from Pegasus search and 5 Million lightyears away from <br>
Reported activity since we duplicated it and its in the middle of his missions.  Of course <br>
he puts his outpost there.  Blah.  First turn he gets a ship and flys over to Pegasus and <br>
attempts.  I promptly flip HQ:DM and put a stop to that.  My first turn I get my stuff out <br>
and start limping over to Pegasus Search.  For some reason all of my Wormholes were <br>
evading me.  I soon realize that my husnock ship wont get there in time and I return to <br>
my outpost.  The DM counts off and Dave Pops my Q.  Oh well, at least now I can get <br>
reported activity down by me.  So I quickly separate his outpost from the rest of his <br>
missions and get the spaceline the way I want it.  The next few turns consist of me <br>
drawing cards and getting a Mission-solving crew built up and him flying his 1 ship back <br>
to his outpost.  He also reported 1 dude and popped my Q on reported activity.  Blah.  <br>
That&#146;s no good.  So once I decide it&#146;s time to go I go and get past Pegasus search for 55.  <br>
His turn he attempts Reported activity, ignoring his own Edo Probe and then hitting my <br>
Dead end.  So he&#146;s stopped.  I move to toward Reported Activity.  I try to distortion but <br>
he Vortex&#146;s it.  His turn he tries A good Place to Die and gets stopped by Scientific <br>
method.  My turn I get almost to reported Activity.  His turn He solves A good place to <br>
Die but he only has 20 points and cant get passed the dead end on Reported activity or go <br>
anywhere else so I win next turn 100-20.  Great game.<br>
<br>
8(+345)<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing Dave Bowling. He is great! Earning the Victory.<br>
Lows: None.  I&#146;m kinda glad he popped my Qs<br>
<br>
So now I am a mathematical lock for Day 2 but I also have a chance to win day 1, which <br>
I would love to do.  So I decide to play relaxed but stay competitive.  This next game was <br>
quite interesting<br>
<br>
Game 6: My Q-Goat cheese vs. Mike Mannino&#146;s Ferengi Sea of Orange (I think Orange <br>
Crush would be a great deck title Mikey ;-))<br>
<br>
	Well.  A Ferengi Deck.  Ferengi don&#146;t like Q. they like to kick him around <br>
especially that brunt guy.  We seed and I seed my Q&#146;s as normal and wonder if this is the <br>
game where the luck of the meta runs out on me.  His first turn he download the Kitchen <br>
sink, because Ferengi like getting cards on the table early.  He uses Writ and QIR and DH <br>
and ASP and has about half of his seed deck in the discard pile and half of his draw deck <br>
on the table.  My first turn I get the super crew and draw contemplating what to do.  <br>
His second turn he plays ferengi conference and consolidates at ferenginar.  My second <br>
turn I tent for revolving door and slam his tent.  I ask him if he has a Kevin and he says <br>
no.  I attempt and hit my Q at Pegasus.  He gets a wide look in his eyes and he says <br>
&quot;Youre bypassing against Ferengi?!&quot; My response &quot;Yup, and if you have the Writ in <br>
you&#146;re deck I&#146;m screwed&quot;.  His response &quot;It&#146;s in my Tent! I&#146;m an idiot! I cant believe I <br>
didn&#146;t download it!&quot; So a double-bypass later I win 100-0 and hand Mike his only loss on <br>
the day.  He is still in shock and I comfort him.  <br>
<br>
10(+445)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning<br>
Lows: I feel like I&#146;m from Wisconsin with all the cheese I&#146;ve been pulling out today (No <br>
offense to anyone from Wisconsin reading this it&#146;s a beautiful state. Just well, <br>
cheesy :o) )<br>
<br>
Mike is a great guy and I hated doing that to him but I really want to win Day 1 at this <br>
point.  He vows to always pull writ 1st turn against me from now on until forever and we <br>
laugh about that. I wish him luck and go take a break and hang out with Scott and Tim <br>
Hunt and Mike.  Scott and Tim give Mike some crap for losing to a bypass deck but it&#146;s <br>
all in good fun.  We grab some more food and get back for round 7.<br>
<br>
Game 7.  My Pride of Wisconsin vs. Greg Dabkowski&#146;s Bajoran Tech<br>
<br>
	Greg is the only player at the head table (Top 6 games) that I don&#146;t know <br>
personally at this point so I get to know him and he seems like a pretty good guy.  It is <br>
tough to gauge his playing skill, but I know hes been winning so he must be good.  We <br>
start and I get my Qs safely seeded and Bypass on turn 1.  I pass the Q on Pegasus and he <br>
starts looking at his Hidden agendas.  I ask him if he has an action and he says &quot;I thought <br>
I did but I cant find it&quot; I start o wonder.  He looks at all of the cards he is legally allowed <br>
to look at and gets a confused look on his face.  I proceed to bypass Reported activity and <br>
he says that he KNOWS he had a Hide &amp; Seek in his seed deck.  We call Kathy over and <br>
I say that I think I won and Greg says he KNOWS he seeded Hide &amp; Seek.  So he picks <br>
up all of his different decks and still doesn&#146;t know what to do.  Come to find out it was <br>
laying on the floor! Well this presents an interesting situation.  Had he had it on the table <br>
he would have definitely stopped the 1st Q.  at the same time he said he had no actions so <br>
I proceeded to the second Q.  After MUCH deliberation between Kathy and the other <br>
judges, Greg and I decided that The1st Q would go through and he could hide and seek <br>
the 2nd one.  So we do that and his dilemmas stop me so I have 55.  On his turn he uses <br>
QtR to download scanner interference to download the Anti-Beaming cards.  Ouch. That <br>
slows me to a crawl as I can only beam up 3 people every other turn I also hit THTF for a <br>
bunch of points and eventually solve Reported activity taking me to 89.  Meanwhile he is <br>
building up like mad.  Q&#146;s planet hits the table so I know I have a long game ahead of me <br>
even though I&#146;m at 89.  His people solve Cardassia for 35 and get stopped at Bajor by <br>
dead end.  I know he can waltz over and solve Relocate Settlers so I wormhole his ship to <br>
the far end of the line and He surprisingly doesn&#146;t have OWR so I&#146;m back in the game! I <br>
attempt Wormhole Negotiations and he swaps in a flash and Uses Qtype Android to put <br>
Vekor under Q&#146;s planet.  Not good.  Aphasia Device/Plague ship finishes me off so now I <br>
have to regenerate and draw all of my stuff again.  Drat.  Meanwhile he is rebuilding his <br>
crew and limping home with his exiled interceptor.  Just as he is about to reach the Bajor <br>
region I wormhole him again and his facial expression is priceless! He gets his revenge <br>
though.  He solves Relocate Settlers and Bajor with a 62nd rule and then solves Q&#146;s planet <br>
to finish it.  FL 100-79.<br>
<br>
10 (+424)<br>
<br>
Highs: Reaching a fair compromise in a VERY delicate situation. Playing a great player <br>
with a great deck.  Gaining a teammate since Only 3 players from the Berserk <br>
Changelings came down.<br>
Lows: Getting locked out of first place.  But there are more important things than <br>
winning.<br>
<br>
Losing a game + gaining a friend = great deal for me.<br>
<br>
So I&#146;m pretty tired at this point.  It&#146;s like 11pm and I&#146;ve been playing cards for 11 hours <br>
straight for the most part.  I just want this game to go fast.  <br>
<br>
Game 8: Cheesy Cheesy Q Cheese vs. Ulf Benjes Drake-like mission solver	<br>
<br>
	This Game went quick.  I solve 2 missions on turn 3 and win.  I was too tired to <br>
see what he was doing.  We also didn&#146;t talk much, but there was no bad blood or anything <br>
I just think we were both exhausted.  Since we were both already qualified we didn&#146;t <br>
really care about the game and I left until the award ceremony.<br>
<br>
12(+524)<br>
<br>
Afterward I hung out with Scott Roszkowski who qualified for day 2 in YJ after <br>
joining in round 3, and Mike Mannino who beat Greg in round 8 to win day 1.  I finished <br>
2nd so I feel pretty good about my performance and I call my girlfriend to tell her how I <br>
did and go upstairs and tweak my day 2 deck and fill out my deck list TO THE LETTER.  <br>
I watch sportscenter and crash about 2am.<br>
