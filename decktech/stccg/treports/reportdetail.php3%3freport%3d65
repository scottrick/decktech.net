I&#146;m still playing Fed/Vid...but instead of using the War Council for free plays, I&#146;ve switched over to an Array drop deck.  It&#146;s like over 100 cards in the draw deck..but with DQSS and deck manipulations, it usually works out.  I&#146;ve had problems where it might take it a few turns to get cranking, but when it does..it rolls.  Today proved that, easily.  Going into the tourney, I&#146;m ranked 9th in Sector 001.<br>
<br>
Game 1: versus Bruce Parrish<br>
<br>
I honestly don&#146;t remember much about this game, it being late and all.  He was playing...you know I don&#146;t remember anything.  I&#146;ve had a long day, had to work after the tourney and I am completely drawing a blank.  I shoulda kept notes, but they only give us an hour for each round.  Hmm, I did beat him, horribly.  Oh wait, he was playing Alpha Fed VCM.  I do remember he went to SSM a mission, and I let it through (no Amandas in hand).  He hits my Chandra/Subspace Fracture and kills his entire crew.  At first he thought he could get past it...then he realized he left his Tricorder (for Science) back at the outpost.  He tried to play it off and say it was supposed to be there, but hey, if it&#146;s supposed to, it shoulda been.  So no dice. Then he tries to say he couldn&#146;t even SSM...but I tell him it&#146;s way too late, I missed it, he missed it, we&#146;re past that so they all die.  Then I Tent for Kavok and steal his Ent-E.  That slowed him down a bit.  He didn&#146;t score a thing.<br>
<br>
FW 2(100)<br>
<br>
Game 2: versus Steven Cash (ranked 2nd in Sector 001)<br>
<br>
Okay.  Last time I played Steve I beat him 100-0.  Not too shabby.  It was against a NA battle deck.  It surprised the heck out of me, but when you can harvest his only Leadership..well, it gave me the time to win.  So this game he seeds four PNZ.  I&#146;m thinking bypass.  But it was just a straight up VCM-PNZ.  Since he was just Alpha, it was pretty non-interactive.  My dilemmas slowed him down, I used Boratus (while I still can) on Restore Victims.  I got to scan the planet and see my Barclays, Edo, Dead End.  Oh, well.  I attempt and get my Barclays and abandon the mission.  He later plays a KFC while he only has 3 cards in his hand.  I debate for awhile on using my Quinn, and do.  So I&#146;m at 5 points.  I go for Inv. Qua. Singularity.  I get my Genetronic Rep out and go with a super crew.  I hit Spatial Rift, and get past.  Hit smth else and lastly is Chula: The Game.  All I can say is that Penk is the man that likes games.  Score 45, but I&#146;m out of range to get back to the Dead End.  Steve goes but his super crew gets stopped by a Ferengi Infestation.  WTF?  When does that ever happen?  Steve was having excellent luck the first half of the game...till he put his Ready Room Door on top of his draw deck and then proceeded to probe with VCM.  That was funny.  I fly back to Restore and solve for the win.<br>
<br>
FW 4(200)<br>
<br>
Game 3: versus Chris Gilliland (ranked 21st in Sector 001)<br>
<br>
Chris has really begun to shine; he plays a variety of decks from VCM, Klingon, and Delta Fed.  Today he was playing Delta..so my chances increased.  I go first and get my Boarding Pod with the Spacedoor.  He had Defend Homeworld, seeded up, and used it to get Tabor to his Voyager.  Hmm.  Well, I play Danara for free, then use DH for Seska.  Put Danara on the ship, ram, initiate battle.  I kill Tabor.  I commandeer Voyager.  Whew. Score 20 points.  This slows him down big time.  He uses Array also, but uses no Outpost.  I&#146;ve got plenty of time to Boratus Restore Victims.  He has like 5 dilemmas under IQS, so I go for Cure Deadly Virus.  Well, with Genetronic out and tons of Vidiians...I cake walk the dilemmas and score over 100.  He Oofs me.  I Oof him back. I harvested someone and got over 100.  He says good game, but being the good sport that I am, I ask him if he&#146;s sure he doesn&#146;t have a response?  I enjoy making players better so it was no big deal when he QtR for The Big Pic...I just went on to solve Liberation and win.  Oh, he didn&#146;t score a thing.  I do remember him blindly attempting later on in the game and hitting my Borg Ship...and I just started going &quot;Ship go BOOM!&quot; &quot;Ship go BOOM!&quot;  heh.  It was already damaged from an earlier dilemma..and he didn&#146;t have a QtR or Vortex in hand.<br>
<br>
FW 6(300)<br>
<br>
So, if I lose, Chris has to win by 65 in diff...Chris has to play Steve, so I feel confident.<br>
<br>
Game 4: versus Kenneth Tice (forgot rank, but he&#146;s good)<br>
<br>
Now, something funny happened here.  He seeds Voyager, so I&#146;m gonna try and Seska-steal it.  I d/l Vid Sodality and he flips Computer Crash.  The first time I have EVER seen this card played.  We sorta argue about the Incident on my next turn.  We didn&#146;t get a ruling and he let me d/l it.  I guess we found out later that was incorrect...oh well.  So I got it all game and mixed Feds and Vids.  So it seemed like a tainted game, but it was still intense.  So I proceed on my first turn to Scan since he can&#146;t d/l either.  I check out CDV and see Volcanic Eruption, Artillery Attack, Hanonian Land Eel and smth else.  This game took me several turns to build up the speed, and he went out and attempted his second turn.  He hit Aggresive Behavior and couldn&#146;t get past it.  Haha, no Chakotay out, but I finally get mine out via a Q&#146;s Tent and proceed to sit him down on Liberation facing a mask.  I got out my Traveller also and was drawing 4 a turn.  Then I started using my DQSS and KFC and War Councils...it was fun.  I think the only reason I won this was due to one card.  He attempted a planet mission and got 3 people stopped.  So I used the MVP: Temporal Rift.  He cancels it.  I Palor, and play again.  It goes through.  I move some people down the spaceline and harvest Tabor.  I Tent for Kavok and steal his Delta Flyer that had sent Chakotay solo to kill three of my dilemmas (Aggressive Behavior, Chandra, Subspace Fracture).  I Boratus and kill both of my seeds.  Oh well, at least I shuffled them up.  I solve CDV, barely remembering what was there.  Rift ends, he plays someone, I Palor it back.  He plays someone else, I Rift his ship again.  He had tried to Rift my ship also this game, but I was packing 2 Amandas for it and used my STP, which I later Palor&#146;d for and replayed.  I ended up Rifting his Voyager one more time.  I apologized, but told him at least I wasn&#146;t playing Rogue Borg.  He understood, heck, he was playing with them too, I was just able to keep countering them.  It seemed like we were going to time out, but I was able to get a Genetronic out and I ended up ripping through some missions.  I couldn&#146;t get back to Restore Victims (had just the Dead End left) cause I didn&#146;t have the range.  So I attempted Liberation and solved and then solved a space mission..forgot the name (pic has the red gas in the shape of a butterfly sorta).  So I pull the win.  He did eventually score points though.<br>
<br>
FW 8(365)<br>
<br>
BOOM baby!!  First place.  Charles the TD was giving out some Borg rares he got from DragonCon, a pack of Voyager and the foils.  I picked the PNZ (my third, so if anyone wants to buy..dmail me) and picked One, the self transporting thug-I&#146;m-more-advanced-than-you.  A very good day indeed.<br>
<br>
1. Charles Kerekanich IV (me)<br>
2. Kenneth Tice<br>
3. Chris Gilliland<br>
and Steve got 7th....out of 8.  We&#146;ve ragged him hard lately.  Sorry Steve...don&#146;t rate bad &#146;cause of it...you still got a Day 1 bye....stick with Alpha Fed diplomacy/engineer on the E!....or OS.<br>
<br>
Props:  <br>
My deck...I keep thinking it will scrub out, and it somehow ends up playing itself.<br>
Kenneth...I hate Comp Crash...oh, and he scouted me out too!! B4 the tourney he asked me if I play with the Rods..errg.  Duh!<br>
Bruce...it&#146;s been literally weeks since me and him have matched up...I laughed alot during his game.  Atleast he wasn&#146;t playing Ferengi this time.<br>
DQSS.  Broken. Period.  Borg+DQSS=Broken Too. (After Borg releases that is).<br>
Temporal Rift.  MVP.  It&#146;s  a Love/Hate relationship.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
It took 4 turns against Kenneth to get my speed going.<br>
Forgetting to try and use Seska to Commandeer Kenneth&#146;s Flyer instead of using Kavok.<br>
It&#146;s 3am now...time for sleep.<br>
<br>
Hope you&#146;ve enjoyed it.  Hope to see you at DecipherCon.  I&#146;ll be there.  Day one will suck.  But I&#146;ll have fun.<br>
