So I had to wait around till after voyager released to play in my state tournament.  This early release date would usualyl be bad, but the spoliers were posted early and I had a chance to get 5 boxes into my hands.  I started building deqs online (via the database and a word processor) on sunday night, however after 5 or 6 hour of work I was discouraged as nothing worked...  Then I tried again monday night, and after 3 or 4 hour of work, I got the same result.  It wasn&#146;t until Tuesday night, when I IMed and talked with a guy I tought to play trek, my protege, Chris Hines and we discussed the possibilirty of me actually using the new cards to build something, instead of trying to make deqs that played in the alpha and could get by the new dilemmas and would have isolation from the almight armada deqs.  Instead of going with a Klingon First Turn BO Armada, or a Rommie Bazaran wormhole armada or my cargo runner, or a risky PNZ, I chose to go with a Federation-Vidian Deq in the Delta.  It would use the 2 high point delta quad missions and then 4 space.  Origionally with was 4 Catalog Phenema&#146;s, but the night before the tourney I replaced one with Return Life-Form (the Janeway mission).  My plan would be to do Cure Deadly Virus for 60 with AMS pts (Ogawa, LaForge and Fitzgerald) and solve the janeway mission with a barclays there (in case for some reason a dead end was at CDV, which I did first) I would have 50 when I went back.  However, I was convinced that the only stratagy to give a player an advantage would be to use Ajur/Boratas to kill seeds at a high point planet mission, and after debating for a while if I should counter or join the stratagy I decided I would join it.  Thus I would be seeding a horgh&#146;na, sarkenja and 4 other seeds at CDV to aid in solving the mission (and to shuffle up the opponent combo anyway).  So I was set.  I playtested the deq online Thursday and won 100-0, and then at a con on friday and won 100-0 in 4 turns.  It seemed the way to go.  I also used 10 Toffs, 10 cards of Trioka, 8 KFC and DQSS in this 70 card monster deq.<br>
<br>
Tourney:  We leave for Newark (40 miles from Columbus) an hour and half before the tourney, with myself, the TD, Sam Truax and Blake Mandalis.  After about a billion freeway entrences were closed to get on 70 East, we finally got on a to newark at 1205, twenty mintues longer than it should have taken.  After getting to the tournaments early I start to get nervious as I have a shot of being #1 in the world after this tourney and even breaking (very slight chance if I got hard matchups and won) 2000.  Going in I should (if they ever update a tourney from a week ago) be 1950ish.  So I get into my car (with 20 mintues before the tourney starts) and go spend my last dollar on a 44 Oz Dr. Pepper and ride back to the store.  I then sit in my car and listen to Nelly, &#146;Ride with Me&#146; for 5 minutes and he tells me that I sould add Mission Debreifing to my seed deq, since I am running 3 Combo Scow dilemma&#146;s, so I run into the store and make this deq change about 3 milli-seconds before Mike calls the first pairings.  So without further adu:  <br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  Sorry for the lack fo details, but I played 8 more games on Sunday for the leauge championships, so I cannot remember every game.<br>
<br>
First Round:  Nick Marion (1700, 7th in Ohio) - Fed OS with VCM stuff<br>
	Well first round I was hoping for an easy game to get my deq warm, amd while it could have been harder it wasn&#146;t nessicarry a walk in the park.  I start off quick, killing hte seeds at CDV first turn with Royce and Ajur and leave 1 of his seeds and 2 of mine (one is Horgh&#146;na).  So I have Royce, Ajur and Ogawa attempt first turn and one dies to a land eel.  I then spend the next two turns getting my SCI, SEC and Str&gt;50 set up (basicially a Rock and Penk have half of it ;)).  I Ref for IOAG to limit the probing, and solve CDV 3rd turn.  Aquire the horgh&#146;na and move back to my OP.  I spend up another turn or 2 building and then I attempt RLF, SSM away 1 of his seeds, hit a barlcays for 10 and pass his last one and solve the mission.  He didn&#146;t have time to attempt anything and he wished he had been able to use DQSS.  &quot;It was sweet,&quot; he said.<br>
Result: 100-0<br>
2(100)<br>
Highs:  Having the Horgh&#146;na left at CDV.<br>
Lows: None, my deq is doing well.<br>
<br>
Second Round:  Tim Claypoole (1675, 10th in Ohio) - Cardi Nor, Cent Cmd, War Council Cargo Runner<br>
	Going into this game I know I am going to win, becuase Cardassians blow, and cannot win big tournaments.  And since states is a big tournament, they cannot win here.  Again The game starts off quickly.  I move to CDV, beam down Ajur and Royce and ask if he has an action.  He plays Thine Own Self on the Away team.  I play a mandy, to cancel the TOS, and he thinks he gets the next action.  I tell him I get the next action becuase I played a valid response to his action, thus I hadn&#146;t takent he next action yet.  After he wined to the TD for a little while it was ruled (the correct way) in my favour.  I kill the seeds including his Dead end, leaving 1 of his, but no horgh&#146;na for me.  I forget what he had left<br>
but I think it was a land eel again.  I built up people, as I prepared to pass the land eel but he eventually got by my combo at his homeworld (combo scow and twisted) for a quick 35 point lead.  However there were many more arguments about rules/cards in this game.  He thought he could download self seeding stem bolts from his tent and he didn&#146;t know that TV stops Dist of STC.  He also tried to add War Council&#146;s cunning bonus to all his NAs not just VIPs and Civilans.  But with all these problems I quickly solved CDV for a 60-35 lead, and then moved to Return Life form, SSMed away his first seed, passed my barlcayds and then passed his last seed.  Solved it that turn for the 100-35 win.<br>
Result: 100-35<br>
4(165)<br>
Highs:  Me knowing how to beat a cargo running deq becuase played one for a long time.<br>
Lows:  All the arguments about rules from the get-go, though it was still a fun game and we were joking together about all the rules questions we asked.<br>
<br>
Third Round:  Joel Skon (1501) - Rommie R&#146;mor Space<br>
	This round was very short, and I am going to have to apologize for my lack of detail in this round.  I did the Ajur thing and left 1 of his cards there.  I solved the two missions again for 100 pts, but not before I got stoped by a seed at RLF and he solved Inv. Sighting II for 30 pts.  I end up with the 70 pt win.  No snags or problems at all this round.  We finished in like 25 minutes, which gives me like 65 minutes for lunch, but since I have no cash and the Hot Dog shack across the street doesn&#146;t take my MasterCard I have to pass up on lunch and goto my car to listen more Nelly.<br>
Result: 100-30<br>
6(235)<br>
Highs:  Me winning quick to get an extended lunch break.<br>
Lows:  Me being a poor @#$% college student.<br>
<br>
With a small feild of 16 (when the expected was 25 it is small) the 4th round ment that there could only be 2 peeps at 6 VPs and they would face off, meaning the winner was basically garuenteed a spot in the final.  I know I will be playing Jared Hoffman, and after &quot;passing by&quot; some of his games I know he is playing some sort of fed DQSS deq.  This creates a problem for me as I use 3 catalog phenemoa, a mission my grandmother could steal (assuming she played at least 1 trek game prior to the game) and the Janeway mission, that 1 person can solve alone.  The big problem is I only have 11 real dilemma&#146;s to seed under misions, so I cover one of my CPs with a Combo Scow and then the Janeway mission with the usual BPD.  He also seeds the Belanna mission (the rare one, not sure the name) so I am just going to put a dead end there so I can steal it for 45 pts.<br>
<br>
Fourth Round:  Jared Hoffman (1747, 4th in Ohio) - Fed DQSS<br>
	On top of the pre-game above, he ends up seeding Assist Cooperative, so my CPs (in that region) end up getting seeded in the mix of his missions instead of by my missions.  I realise that he is going to steal them, which is why I self seed one, and hope that he goes for them all, so I can QtR-Big Picture and beat him when I solve my planet and space mission.  However from the get go, I have a bad run of luck.  I ajur CDV and leave a Q and Land eel and my horgh&#146;na (I know this becuase I manage to see what he seeded there when he was taking them out of sleves).  So I sit at my outpost FOREVER trying to come up with 2 leadership and Inv&gt;60, and with the vidians this isn&#146;t the easiest thing.  Eventually I attempt (please note I have a Rev Door in hand), and hit the Q and he swaps it for a flash.  I should have shut his tent, but I was playing like a 11 year old, so I didn&#146;t.  He Fightings Words me.  Baliffs janeway, and Boxes Danara Pel.  I look for solve and have Pel in the away team anyway, but thry to solve with the Exo x3 and Bio x2 requirement, but I can&#146;t use Pels bio becuase of FW.  I should have solved then for 45, but, again, I was playing like an 11 year old and I didn&#146;t solve it and aquire my horgh&#146;na.  Instead I wait 3 turns for the FW to count down to solve it for 60 (but he has Oofed! me for 10 already) so I get 50, but by now he has stolen two of my CPs for a 70-50 lead.  So I need to get moving.  I move to Restore Victims (the 55 pt mission) and start redshirting it.  And hit the AP combo card.  He aquires the away team and solves the mission for the 100-50 win.  So I lose, but he doesn&#146;t see the stratagy that I am going to try to steal his belanna mission, and he thinks that I only want to attempt the two planet missions, not the Janeway mission.<br>
Result: 50-100<br>
6(185)<br>
Highs:  None, I played like a 11 year old<br>
Lows:  The 2nd highest rated player in the world playing like my @#$%ing sister, and me blowing my show of being #1 in the world after today, and me blowing my shot of being 2000 rating after today, among other things including snapping a 20 game win streak.<br>
<br>
So know it is crunch time.  I check to see the other peoples standings, and realize that if Hoffman wins out, then there will only be one 5-1 player and they will be in the final.  And even if someone upset hoffman, I still needed to win, so it didn&#146;t matter anyway.  I needed to win out from here.  However, historically, I have never gone less than 5-1 in a 6 round tournament and I have never lost a final game in any tournament, and I have never lost 2 trek games in a row.  So since I just lost 4th round, I couldn&#146;t lose my 5th, since I never lose 2 in a row, and since I have never lost the final round in a tournament I will finish 5-1.  (If that made any sense please let me know)<br>
<br>
Round 5:  Dustin Chadwell (1504) - Half Alpha, Half Delta, Fed DQSS, Boratas on Run Search<br>
	I played Dustin last week in Mansfeild and somehow managed to beat him 70-60 in a timed game.  His rating is deceiving, he is an excellent player, just hasn&#146;t played many games.  He seeds study badlands and teh caretakers array with runabout search, seek life form (alpha) and assist coop and 1 other delta mission.  I seed two combo scows and dead end at Run Search and lightly seed the others, and don&#146;t both self seeding my CPs.  I try to outspeed him.  First turn I do the Ajur thing again, and I leave 1 of his seeds.  I discarded Make Us Go and Deu Feild Generator, so I am thinking that a spacial rift was left (ast+engx2 to pass), so I start building up for that.  I don&#146;t both getting my other AMS (I start Ogawa and Royce) and try to outspeed him.  He tried to get his alpha and delta guys together by wormholes but I quinn and or mandy them  (I just know I was at -10 at some point from 2 quinns).  However before I can get my astro and eng out he steals my CP for a quick 30-0 lead.  I then get it out and attempt with everyone and it is a Vulcanic Eruption that kills someone useless (maybe royce?).  (not a bad combo, lockout the planet to kill everyone...  just didn&#146;t think it was that)  And I solve with Ogawa and others for a 40-30 pt lead.  I beam up and move to RLF and attempt and solve it for a quick 80-30 pt lead.  However he has now gotten his alpha ship to the DQ by relocating it with study badlands to liberation and moves both crews to Assist Cooperative, and beams down 3 and attempts.  1 Gets stoped by my ABL and the others get stoped by my Hide and Seek.  He then beams down 7o9 alone and attempts...  I ditch a QtR for villagers to kill her.  So he beams down others and solves for 30 pts to cut my lead to 80-60.  I flip Mission Debreifing and he is stoped.  I then start building up to solve the hard Restore Victims, but not before he solved Liberation for the 90-80 lead (note had he not beamed 7 down alone he would have won at this point).  However next turn before I can lose my 2nd trek game in a row and break the laws of the space time continuum I solve RV for 55 and the 100-90 win.<br>
Result: 100-90<br>
8(195)<br>
Highs:  My Counters are sweet<br>
Lows:  Me almost losing again!<br>
<br>
Hoffman won his 5th round game and locked up the final spot and all I have to do it win my last game against a local guy I have never lost to to lock a spot in the final.  In addition, I beat him Friday night in the 1 game I playtested in 4 turns 100-0.<br>
<br>
Sixth Round: Samuel Truax (1593) - Fed Deq with caretakers array drops (no dqss)<br>
	This game starts off odd.  I have the 3 CPs that he can steal and they all end up right next to Liberation, so I self seed a combo scow at each, becuase I am tired of my missions getting @#$%ing stolen.  He seeds 5 at CDV and so I have to seed more there; I seed 8 there I think.  The Ajur does well leaving just 1 of his and my horgh&#146;na.  His seed sucks, so I beat the mission turn 2 or 3 for only 45 pts, becuase I my self seeded Abl Brain Teaster was left there.  I am up a quick 45-0 lead, however I lose 5 when I quinn something of him.  On his next turn he attempts and steals my CP by towing the scow and then TVing a Borg Ship he seeded there.  On my first turn I Rev Door his TV and he tried to STP his ship back to hand.  I laugh at him and tell him to put the ship in teh discard pile becuase that isn&#146;t a valid response to my Rev Door.  He tries to wine to the TD, but to no avail - I am right.  Next turn I solve the Janeway mission with a barclays for a 95-30 point lead, and because his ship with everyone on it was blown up I have all day to solve another mission for the easy win and the lock into the final game.<br>
Result: 100-30<br>
10(265)<br>
Highs:  Me making the final<br>
Lows:  Me hitting my self seeded ABT at CDV to make it a 3 mission win for me and for getting my CP stolen, AGAIN!<br>
<br>
	After the final game I realize that I am in the final so I go outside, in the steady rain, to clear my head and think up a stratagy to beat him.  I have been to two other final conferatations, losing both 100-0, blowing my chance (both times) of a free trip to worlds.  So I am not a newbe to final conferations or how they are played.  The slate is whiped clean at this point and all that matters is this game.  The fact that I finished 2nd in the swiss rounds would not be remembered if I won the final.  So I did what Todd Soper once advised me to do going into a final conferation, &quot;Picture your opening hand, and how you are going to counter your opponent while still playing your own game.&quot;  In addition to that, I did a little trash talking to myself, telling myself something to the effect that if I lose, I am a scrub so I have to quit playing the game (I don&#146;t remember the specifics but I think that is what it amounted to).  After playing in the rain for about 10 minutes I am in the perfect frame of mind for the final conferatation, and I head back into the store just as the pairing is called.<br>
<br>
<br>
Final Conferation: Jared Hoffman<br>
	The missions are the same, but this time I self seed a combo scow at each of my CPs.  He seeds a shelick-wall at my 55 pt Restore Victims mission, and I seed 8 cards at CDV with his 3.  I ajur the thing first turn and get rid of all of his cards and almost solve, but I lack the biology to solve so I let him go.  He plays some cards and moves a ship to RV and trips the shelick there with Kes.  Next turn I solve CDV for 50 (just owaga) and aquire my horgh&#146;na.  At his belanna mission I seeded an implication and barlcays combo.  I spend my next turn and a half building up the SSM requirements and the requirements for the mission and on my 2nd turn on turn 3 I attempt and pass the mission and the barlcays for a 100-0 win in three turns.<br>
Result: 100-0<br>
Highs:  The deq worked to perfection, and because I didn&#146;t beat him earlier he didn&#146;t know I was going to steal the Belanna mission.<br>
Lows:  Beating Hoffman; I have to goto his wedding in two weeks.<br>
<br>
