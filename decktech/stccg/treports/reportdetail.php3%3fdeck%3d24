I&#146;ll say it right now.  The deck I played at Saturday&#146;s Mirror, Mirror scenario tournament was definitely the oddest I&#146;ve played in a while.  To fully understand this deck, you have to realize the situation it was constructed under... around nine o&#146;clock at night, I started putting together a deck for the tournament, planning on playing an all-out stasis deck, Anti-Time Anomalies, Black Holes, and all.  I even asked Todd Soper (the TD) if I could borrow an Overseer Odo for the deck.  Well, around ten o&#146;clock I decided that the Black Holes wouldn&#146;t work too well with all of the cross-quadrant traffic I expected, and I didn&#146;t have enough time to fine-tune the proportions of everything else in the deck... I&#146;d do a test run, not draw any ATAs for a long time, readjust, find other problems, etc.  <br>
<br>
So, I scrapped it in favor of a Romulan/Terran PNZ deck combining Senior Staff Meetings with Beware of Q/Pla-Net (in case you&#146;ve noticed that both of the aforementioned strategies are Writ-able, I wasn&#146;t anticipating many Brunts at all -- certainly not before Stasis locked down the opponent or PNZ won, so I was willing to risk a Writ).  In the end, though, I had room for a total of eight dilemmas.  Err, maybe not.<br>
<br>
By this point, it was about 11:00 PM, and I was starting to tire (I had two midterms, a quiz, and three math lectures earlier in the day), so I hastily built a third deck.  One thing led to another, and next thing I know the draw deck&#146;s seventy-five cards and I&#146;m playing more strategies in one deck than I have in a long time (perhaps ever).  I&#146;ve splashed in some Romulans for a quick Deadly D&#146;deridex of Doom (DDD for short: Spacedoor for D&#146;Deridex, DH  for Cretak, ASP for Tomalak, AMS for some miscellaneous Romulans plus a Battle Bridge = 17+ ATTACK on turn one) which I aimed at menacing opponents with.  Plenty of Wormholes let me get to my opponent quickly, or to play Field Trip if my opponent didn&#146;t stock Operate Wormhole Relays.  Dilemmas were aimed at stopping more than killing, giving the DDD time to Wormhole in and blow stuff up.  I used a mix of walls and &quot;obscure skill&quot; dilemmas that didn&#146;t stick around but were an almost guaranteed stop (Palukoo, Vendetta, etc.)  One of the stopper dilemmas I used was the combo Garbage Scow combined with some DRAGS to kill personnel and reduce points.  To complement this, I used some Pulse Phaser Cannons in my Battle Bridge, which disable Tractor Beams.  There was also some Mister Mister and Colony stuff going on as well, plus a rather effective Static Warp Bubble.  <br>
<br>

<br>
So, here&#146;s what happened:<br>
<br>
Game one: vs. Todd Soper (Closed environment rating: none)<br>
<br>
Ah, Todd, my arch nemesis.  Of all the local players, he&#146;s the one I&#146;ve got the worst record against... just one win and plenty of losses in a variety of formats.  Heck, I worry less about games against Jason Drake than against Todd.  <br>
<br>
Today, Todd was playing a fairly straightforward Terran Empire deck.  He was kind enough to seed a Halkan Council, allowing me to download the ISS Enterprise.  He went first in the game, but made the mistake of flipping a Defend Homeworld before his QtR, allowing me to play a Full Planet Scan risk-free.  He continued by Spacedoor-ing the Starship Constitution to the Alpha Quadrant and moving to Historical Research, and downloaded oodles of personnel at Halkan Council with the standard Mirror stuff.  I got the DDD out, used a Wormhole and a Mission II to get to his Starship Constitution, which he STP-ed back to his hand.  I downloaded Evil Kirk to the ISS Enterprise and initiated battle against his ISS Enterprise, armed with a Battle Bridge and a Captain&#146;s Log courtesy of the DDD and Make It So, damaging his ship and killing a personnel thanks to a damage marker.<br>
<br>
On his turn, Todd discarded QtR for Temporal Vortex, which was actually a misplay (he had discarded his STP and had no other door allowing [AU] cards to play), but I didn&#146;t catch it in time.  He rescued the ISS Enterprise by moving it to the Mirror Quadrant and docking it at his outpost.  The remainder of the game was pretty much a stalemate.  I might have blown up one or two ships, but Todd spent most of the game in hiding.  I was going to go trip a Garbage Scow (ironically, one that Todd had seeded and I had Scanned) and blow it up at his outpost, killing all the personnel there, but as luck would have it he evacuated just before I could attempt the mission and tow the Scow.  Meanwhile, I was coming up short in the personnel department, probably because the personnel ratio is really low in this deck.  I got the Static Warp Bubble out fairly quickly, which he surprisingly did not try to nullify with his Spacedoor (although I had a Panel Overload waiting in case he tried).   I was about to Tent for a Q&#146;s Planet (and build a Colony for a few points) when the game tied out 0-0.  True tie, 1 (+0).  Cumulative: 1 (+0)<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Me, for avoiding yet another loss to Todd (so my record against him is 1-1-50 million instead of 1-0-50 million :-)<br>
Both of us, for one of the most strategic and thoughtful seed phases I&#146;ve seen (nearly twenty minutes).<br>
Todd, for seeding Halkan Council so I could download my ISS Enterprise and blast away at his first turn.<br>
<br>
Slops: <br>
The one hour limit, because this deck is too slow. :-)<br>
Both of us, for not catching the fact that he couldn&#146;t download the Temporal Vortex to save the Enterprise.<br>
<br>
It was at this point that I decided I really needed to speed up my mission solving.  I was concentrating too much on hunting down Todd, devoting ships and personnel there instead of to the missions.  Todd warned me that I would probably time out all the time trying to &quot;control the spaceline,&quot; as he put it.  He also jokingly accused me of playing a &quot;sort of stasis-y&quot; deck, much to my protestations to the contrary (&quot;Be glad I didn&#146;t pull out the ATAs...&quot;)<br>
<br>
Game Two: vs. Eric Wood (Closed environment rating: 1500)<br>
<br>
Strangely enough, three of the four games (a total of eight players showed up) went to time.  Tom Vuchelen was the only one to get a full win, and that was thanks to John Padgett II failing to show a Devidian Door.<br>
<br>
Eric was playing a deck that aimed to quickly earn a Tox or two to unbalance the opponent, then start tripping Balancing Acts everywhere.  I drew a Full Planet Scan in my opening hand again, and also got to play it before he flipped a QtR.  Once again, I took advantage of his Halkan Council to download the ISS Enterprise and start firing at Eric&#146;s ISS E on the first turn.  My DDD also prevented his Cochrane Memorial attempts by using Tomalak and friends to kill off any ENGINEERs he tried to report to Earth.  <br>
<br>
In the Mirror Quadrant, he reported a number of personnel to the Rebellion HQ, as did I.  I Tent-ed for HQ: Secure Homeworld, aiming to go after Search for Rebels, which we both had seeded.  Of course, to overcome the Lack of Prep I seeded there I had to first use a seeded Art of Diplomacy to download a Classic Type II Phaser to Evil Kirk, which I forgot to do, so I hit my own LoP for a ten point hit.  Next turn I got the download, though, and solved the mission to take me to twenty points.  Eric reported a ship in the Mirror Quadrant, but a Rebel Interceptor I reported and the ISS Enterprise were able to blow it up.  So, without much of a chance left in the MQ, he turned his attention to his Alpha Quadrant forces, which reluctantly attempted Explore Black Cluster after my Panel Overload/Scanner Interference stopped his Scan.  He was stopped by Vendetta, which allowed my DDD to damage his ship.  On his turn, with no hope of escaping (he had already discarded his STP to return a ship to his hand earlier... I really should have included a Masaka in this deck for opponents that use STPs to avoid battle) he attempted again, getting by my  Friendly Fire but getting stuck behind a Dead End.  I promptly destroyed the ship, scored five Vendetta points and was headed for another mission when time was called.  My win, 1 (+25).  Cumulative: 2 (+25)<br>
<br>
Again, this deck timed out, but so did every other player except Tom, who was far ahead at 4 (+165) right now.  Strange as it may seem, I was actually in second place at this point... Todd was at 2 (+15), and nobody else had more than one victory point.  <br>
<br>
Props: <br>
&quot;Stopper&quot; dilemmas and Dead End, for keeping Eric away from his dangerous Toxes.<br>
The DDD, for stopping the VCM and destroying any Alpha Quadrant ships<br>
Eric, for seeding Halkan Council so I could download my ISS Enterprise and blast away at his first turn.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, forgetting to download a hand weapon before attempting Search for Rebels and getting nailed by my own Lack of Prep.<br>
<br>
Game Three: vs. Tom Vuchelen (Closed environment rating: 1381)<br>
<br>
Tom was playing a KCA Blood Oath battle deck which had worked quite well in his previous games.  I started out like normal, getting a quick DDD.  He got the Gr&#146;oth and an IKC Vor&#146;Cha in the Alpha Quadrant by the second turn.  Since the DDD served no purpose other than battle, I threw it headlong into his Klingon ships, damaging the Gr&#146;oth and getting the DDD damaged in the process.  We both repaired our ships.  While all this was going on in the Alpha Quadrant, I solved Disrupt Alliance for 30 points, taking advantage of the Misters to get through killer dilemmas.  Tom tried to move the Mirror Quadrant division of his fleet (Regency 1 and two Alliance K&#146;Vorts) to attack, but I Wormhole-d all three of them into the Alpha Quadrant.  <br>
<br>
By this point, the Static Warp Bubble was really starting to hart, as Tom had discarded at least eight or nine cards.  Since he had very few Mirror forces left, I went and attempted Mine Dilithium, where he had seeded his Klingon Empire Outpost and cleared out all the dilemmas except an Oops!  I passed the Oops! and solved the mission, taking me up to sixty.  With all of his Klingons in the Alpha Quadrant, he proceeded to destroy my DDD, but not before I also took out Regency 1 and a couple of personnel on it.  <br>
<br>
With only about seven personnel left at this point -- one of the things I love about this deck is all the attrition from various sources -- he threw most of them at a planet mission, where he uncovered my Garbage Scow.  I played a DRAGS to kill off almost all of the personnel he had left in play, giving me plenty of time to build a Colony and win.  Full win, 2 (+100).  Cumulative: 4 (+125).<br>
<br>
Finally this deck didn&#146;t time out...<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Tom, for playing something other than Terrans!<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, for resorting to a Colony to win.<br>
<br>
Game Four: vs. Joseph Todd (Closed environment rating: none)<br>
<br>
Even though I was in first now, the outcome of the tournament was far from clear.  Tom still had four victory points, so he could still win if I only got a timed win.  Todd was also in range if I lost to Joseph.  <br>
<br>
This was Joseph&#146;s first sanctioned tournament, and is a very bright guy.  I can forsee him becoming a strong player within the next year or so.  His deck was primarily Alpha-focused, with just enough Mirror stuff to satisfy the environment&#146;s requirements.  This made my deck&#146;s day... I was left alone in the Mirror Quadrant to solve missions while my DDD rained terror over the Alpha Quadrant.  I got the Static Warp Bubble out early, which he nullified several turns later by playing The Traveler: Transcendence.  I destroyed his Starship Constitution fairly early on, along with his Starship Enterprise.  His STP-dropped Future Enterprise caused more problems due to its cloak, though, and he was able to keep it cloaked or docked almost all the time.  I tried to Wormhole it, but he was using Wormhole Relays.<br>
<br>
I solved Search for Rebels and Mine Dilithium again for sixty points while he attempted Historical Research.  First losing ten points to Lack of Prep, then losing all of the misison requirements to a Scow/DRAGS combo (he didn&#146;t have enough backup Anthro in play) he turned to Agricultural Assessment.  He redshirted through my Ferengi Bug while megateaming through Ferengi Infestation.  Everyone was stopped by the Lethean Telepathic Attack, though (excellent dilemma in this environment!) and I damaged the Future Enterprise.  In hindsight, I should have Flash swapped the Ferengi Infestation, but it slipped my mind (I&#146;m not used to playing decks where I have to concentrate on so much different stuff).  The next turn, he solved the mission, but my Mission Debriefing stopped him.  His hand was exposed from Ferengi Bug and he had two Kevins, but oddly enough he didn&#146;t try to Ux the MD.  So, I destroyed the Future Enterprise, his last ship, essentially locking him out of the game.<br>
<br>
Joseph was an excellent sport, not stalling as I poked my way through Colony points to win 100-20.  Full win, 2 (+80).  Cumulative: 6 (+205).<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Major props to Joseph, for not stalling and for playing in his first sanctioned tournament.<br>
Joseph, for seeding Halkan Council so I could download my ISS Enterprise and grab Security Chief Sulu at a deciding moment.<br>
The DDD, for taking out all of Joseph&#146;s ships.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, forgetting to Flash-swap Ferengi Infestation<br>
Me, for resorting to a Colony to win.<br>
<br>
I ended up winning the tournament, with Eric Wood second (the last game he won 80 to -110 thanks to his Acts!) and Todd third.  Carlin Jacobson was fourth, and I don&#146;t remember the rest of the order... I think Tom was fifth, and John Padgett II ended up last, losing the last by failing to show a Devidian Door for the second time this tournament.<br>
<br>
This deck actually was a lot more solid than I thought it would be.  A number of opponents were confused by seeing two different Emblems and two Romulan outposts after the mission phase, and the DDD proved more than adept at wreaking havoc on unsuspecting ships.  DRAGS is still as good a strategy as ever, and I killed several Away Teams with it this tournament.  <br>
<br>
The dilemmas were excellent.  Only one mission was completed on the deck all day long, and that cost 2-3 turns and the sacrifice of a ship in the process.  <br>
<br>
The one thing I would fix would be increasing the number of personnel and/or introducing a downloading mechanism to get them out more quickly.  I ended up with a surplus of Wormholes, so I&#146;d probably swap a few for extra personnel were I to play the deck again.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Todd for running a great tournament! </span></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="reportread.php3?report=24"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/read.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="reportreview.php3?report=24"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/review.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><a href="reports.php3"><img src="/stccg/global/images/back.gif" border="0" ></a></TD><TD></TD></TR></TABLE></span></td>
