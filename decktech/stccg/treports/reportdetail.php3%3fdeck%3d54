If you read the past two, you know my stiff competition in the area comes from Charles Deese (last years state champ and this years runner-up){although I have beaten him two weeks in a row  :)}, and Steven Cash (this years state champ).  I am still playing my Vidiian/NA deck.  No Black Holes, but I am packing Supernova and Revolving Doors.  I made a minor tweak last week with the addition of Temporal Rifts (which ended up starting something here, seems like a few key people reintroduced them also).  This week I added Quinn X3 (I finally pulled some out of packs), a second Temporal Vortex (I saw too many Sheliaks), and the big daddy himself: Kavok.  If you do not know who he is, go find out.  He is very meta-tech versus Fed Delta, especially if you get to go first.   BTW:  he plays to an empty Fed ship and downloads Commandeer Ship, and he has the Comp Skill...<br>
<br>
So we begin....after I find out Charles will not be playing this week.  He is running the tourney and...ahem...does not wish to lose any more points not having a good enough deck.  I feel very flattered, since I am the only one who has beaten him the past two weeks.  Did I mention he had -15 last meeting?  Jason Matthews did not show up, nor Steven Cash...so big guns were non-existant.  Oh well, Kenneth Tice and Keenan Byrd showed up and Chris Gilliland, pretty good local guys who always put up a good fight.<br>
<br>
Round 1:<br>
<br>
I get the bye.  hohum.  Charles and I play some Jedi Knights.  Scum and Villainy will be broken.  Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Bye 2(0)<br>
Props:  Luke and Obi kick butt.<br>
Slops:  Bye and Tarkin with Capitals and Troopers kick butt.<br>
<br>
Round 2: vs. Kenneth Tice Fed Array Schism<br>
<br>
We flip and I get to go first.  Yay.  My opening hand has no Q Tent, so I Obelisk/Masaka myself to try and get one.  Failure.  Oh well, I will do it the hard way.  We both spend a couple of turns playing people.  He drops the Equinox  as NA, darn, and attempts but gets stopped by the Cloud.  I drop a Cruiser at the Array where his other Equinox is and try to clamp it, but he pulls out my trick and TRifts it.  Oh well.  On one of my turns I had used the Power for three, and lo and behold, Boratus showed his head.  I lost him, so I would have go at it the hard way.  He ended up solving a 35 point mission after I killed his crew with Subspace Fracture. He took his Voyager off and picked up his crew at the damaged Eq. then shifted them all onto the other Eq. and moved to the end of the spaceline.  And he got stopped.  My turn I get Kavok and get the Voyager.  Okay, it was not first turn, but then I blew his damaged Eq. up.  I chased him with his own ship..he ended up only having the Delta Flyer left, and it was scared.  Meanwhile, Charles is walking around going 15, 10, 5...so I have to hurry.  I got Gen Rep out and attempted Research Phage.  Time was called in the middle of the dilemmas, so I prayed I had everything I needed down there.  Sure enough I do and barely squeak out a Time win.  Whew.  Usually this deck does not time, but against better players, I always make sure I am doing the right thing.<br>
<br>
MW 3(10)<br>
Props: This was a very fun game.  Stealing Voyager.  <br>
Slops: No Tent first turn, and my Cruiser getting TRifted twice, third time I had Amanda.<br>
<br>
Round 3: vs. Baker Pratt Klingon MS Battle Deck<br>
<br>
Baker does not have much Voyager, so I start to think Old School stuff.  Two differnt timelines, not much interaction with characters.  But there was plenty of interaction between players.  We had to call Charles for some rule clarifications.  On Bakers defense, he goes to school and it seems lately he has not had the opportunity to come up here as much.  He is a  good player and with some more play time, he could be really good.  In the game, I Door his Tent, then later play FPS, he thinks long and hard about ditching the QtR, but decides not to.  I end up getting my Barclays and Horgahn, then later get my Tox..but I never got to use the Tox.  I did use the Horgahn though.  Once.  I was not sure if he had Brunt, and I did not want to test him.  (he did not have him, shrug) He gets TBP out, soooo off to do a space mission.  He ended up getting a 35 point mission and I got my last space for the win.<br>
<br>
FW 5(75)<br>
Props:  A mind challenging game, we both had to think a lot and decide the best course of action just about almost everything....except:<br>
Slops:  Baker had encountered Founders Secret/Den Para. then Hanonian Land Eel...when he got stopped by the Eel, he miscalculated (medical for science) and reattempted and lost his other MS...the one time you do not need medical.<br>
<br>
Round 4:  vs. Chris Gilliland Fed VCM<br>
<br>
Last time we played, Chris was playing Klingon, so I knew this was going to be interesting.  This game was for first and third....Chris talked a bit of smack, but like his last game with me, I had plenty of tricks up my sleave.  He said he had the answer for Supernova, I shrug.  He spends the first couple of turns probing and building; after about turn 3 I decided to burn QtR for IOAG to try and slow him down, afterall, he did probe a stupid equipment and got the Adm Riker-Ent-Dr McCoy chain.  I knew he was packing TBP, so I went straight for one planet one space win.  However, I had to do 2 planets (I used Quinn for a SSM, that makes zero SSM gotten off against me in three weeks).  I get the Boratus deal off and solve Restore Victims.  I later get Gen Rep out and walk through his Den Para. combo.  I scan his space mission dilemmas and laugh.  I play Door on his Tent and go and attempt.  I TRifted a ship, his AU was in the tent :), then I attempt and hit Swarm, Scout Encounter.  I asked him &quot;Do you wish to d/l a scout wessel?&quot;<br>
He shakes his head no.  Mwhahahhahahahaha.  Door strikes again.  Then I hit the Cloud I think.  So, it is stopped.  I have to wait two turns to cure the Swarm and win.  100-0<br>
<br>
FW 7(175)<br>
Props:  I love this deck.  That last game saw soooo much deck manipulation, I thought I was playing Magic.  I Masakad myself, Power, Handshake, you name it, Kivas, Council, it was very fun.  Chris is so great to play against.  I am just waiting for the day when he will beat me.  Trust me, it should not take him long to reach that level.<br>
Slops:  None, other than Chris not scoring points.  If that could ever be a slop.<br>
<br>
Standings:<br>
<br>
Me 7(175)<br>
Kenneth Tice 6(200)<br>
Chris Gilliland 6(155)<br>
Kenan Byrd 6 (126)<br>
5.-11. everyone else<br>
<br>
Tourney Props:  <br>
This was a very fun day and I may have left out some details, but I was playing instead of worrying about the report.<br>
Killing your own guys for whoever you want is good.  Trust me.  Killing your opponents guys for whoever you want and getting 10 points is VERY good.<br>
Commandeering the Voyager.  Heck, any Fed ship is good.<br>
I saw Jackie Easterling playing Kazon.  He was doing pretty good; he was using Array to bring Romulans to help.  I thought it was very creative.<br>
Fed Array Schism is the deck down here...but mine is THE deck, it seems everyone is out to get me now, before they were worried about my Borg deck, just because of what it can do; however, now, I think they have forgotten the Borg.<br>
<br>
Tourney Slops:<br>
Jason did not show....he has my third Chakotay he is supposed to give me.<br>
Steve did not show...who knows.<br>
Charles did not play, and I got the Bye.  He says he has a cheesy deck for next week that can be played once to win a tourney..he hinted at something about whether or not to play personnel.  I was thinking he was playing tons of Is it Cool?  but knowing Charles, who knows.<br>
<br>
I got the foil PNZ...and it is up for grabs..drop me a line.  I also have the foil Kevin from two weeks ago, it is also up for grabs.<br>
