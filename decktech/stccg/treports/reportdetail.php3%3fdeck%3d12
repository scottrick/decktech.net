It&#146;s about a 1.5 hr. drive (for Jeff), but today, the rain and a certain new theme park opening delayed us only slightly as we made our way to Games and Cards, the hosting card shop. We arrived to hail and muddy roads, as we quickly found a parking space and leapt inside. 10 other players were waiting for us, so we brought the total to 12. Pretty decent for a Pasadena tourney. I made some last minute metagame substitutions after seeing who was there, and then we were paired up for round 1 of 5.<br>
<br>
ROUND 1: vs Steve Mang (Romulan PNZ, 50 card draw deck)<br>
<br>
I brought my trusty Council of Bloody Referees deck (see my profile for deck list), which basically consisted of Blood Oath accelerated by QtR (free card draws converted to downloads), and Council of Warriors on any but one of my missions if the opportunity presented itself. This was my first time playing Steve, so I wasn&#146;t quite sure to expect. When he dropped his first PNZ in mission phase, my brain started accessing standard anti-PNZ tactics; mainly, to get a ship into the NZ and keep it there. He won the toss, and had seeded a Romulan outpost on Covert Installation. I was screaming on the inside that I had forgotten to include Wake of the Borg, but it turned out to not be a large factor. <br>
<br>
I began by playing Kor from hand, d/ling Kang with Defend Homeworld, d/ling BO with Kang, cycling Big Picture and converting the draw to get the Lukara, which I quickly boarded and headed into the NZ. End of turn draw I converted to d/l Ning&#146;tao. After getting ships into the NZ on turn 2, I chose missions wisely (he had only 2 dilemmas under some missions, and 5 under others). My Senior Staff Meeting killed a Dal&#146;Rok, and I took the early lead. Steve was struggling to get ships/personnel on the table, and starting attempting missions before he had planned (I think). His Romulan Science Vessel hit a Conundrum, and had to chase down the Lukara. I simply waited for him to come to me. <br>
<br>
An Alien Parasites gave me control of his personnel, which I used to attack his stopped personnel (from Chandra). Only killed one guy, so not real productive there. On his next turn, he was poised to take Covert Installation with only an Alien Parasites remaining. I sent Lukara (piloted by Grilka by this time) and Rotarran (piloted by Martok) to Covert Installation, where they beamed down, attacked, and I played Honor Challenge from hand. Sirol and Parem bit it, but the remaining 6 or 7 Romulans proved too much for the pair of warriors. Meanwhile, the Ning&#146;tao had been successfully racking up mission points, and I needed 25 for the win. Steve attempted Covert Installation one last time, and against the Parasites, discovered he had only INTEGRITY 32! I took control and solved his mission for the win. 2(+100)<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Steve, for SEEDING Establish Landing Protocols!<br>
Steve, for being a great opponent<br>
Me, for teching Honor Challenge<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, for cheesing out and stealing his mission<br>
Games and Cards, for playing the same 3 CD tracks over and over again<br>
<br>
ROUND 2: vs Jeff Schwartz (Romulan/Bajoran RBM, 100+ card draw deck)<br>
<br>
Of course, Jeff and I have played many times before, and as such, have learned each others&#146; schtick fairly well. We began with Jeff winning the coin toss, and after seeding doorways/missions, passed on dilemmas. Occasionally, in the past, I&#146;ve done this to goad opponents into a fast game (no dilemmas), and it&#146;s worked a few times before; barring any weird stuff happening, my deck would rip through my missions (since my MS and SP complete them). Jeff knows this, and tries to get me to fall for the same trick. I consider the offer for a good minute, and then decline and proceed to seeding my dilemmas. He self-seeds a couple at Cardassia Prime and at Characterize Neutrino Emissions. Wonder what those are.<br>
<br>
We begin the play phase, and I realize that Jeff may be playing multiple RBMs (especially since he d/led Lore with Defend Homeworld). Jeff has done this in the past, and I realize the only way to beat RBM en masse, other than Reactor Overload, is to pump my guys up to be able to beat them. I proceed to use card draws to d/l Bat&#146;leths after BO is set up. I download my first ship (Lukara) and board it, expecting the worst. Jeff plays... one and ONLY one, RBM on my ship. Another [Ref] card I forgot! Intruder Alert! ARGH! I realize that now I going to have to deal with pings until he runs out of RBMs/Palors. Which takes a while. After exhausting his somewhat limited supply of RBMs, I want to go attempt missions, but he has played Memory Wipes on the Lukara and Ning&#146;tao. This presents a problem. I need Klingons to attempt my missions! I Obelisk myself, searching for either Koraga or Rotarran. Thankfully, Koraga shows up with about 10 minutes left in the round. I solve two 25 pt missions, and we time out, with Jeff scoreless. 1(+50), cumulative 3(+150)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Jeff, for grinding me to a halt with Memory Wipes<br>
Jeff, for trying to psych me out with my own trick.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Jeff, for pinging me to death (will the cheese never end??) ;)<br>
Poke kids, for being WAY the heck too loud<br>
Me, for psyching myself out and wasting time strategizing during the match.<br>
<br>
ROUND 3: vs Dan Novak (Dominion Mission Solver, 44 card draw deck)<br>
<br>
Dan is one of the better, if not best, player in the LA area. His technique and sportsmanship are flawless; my only chance to beat him was the fact that he was out of practice. He told me before our match that he had not played in 2-3 months. I thought to myself that that could make the difference. I won the toss, and DJ seeded Quest for the Sword, Founder HW, and Tulaberry, along with Construct Depot x2, and Protect Shipment. Two thoughts on his deck: either Borg or Dominion. Dan had played both before against me, and played both well, but I wasn&#146;t quite sure what he was up to until he seeded HQ: Secure HW. Okay then, Dominion. Klingons love facing Smackdown. :) I was very happy, and thought that this match would be no sweat. Although I did notice he forgot to seed Ultimatum...<br>
<br>
Dan started off by d/ling Deyos with DH (of course), and began playing Jemmies without Youth for card draws. He was also using Obedience Brings Victory for 2 draws, then another to end his turn. Not looking good. My Mirror Image is included so that he can play Kivas, and I can get cards too! Oh well, so much for that idea. I ditch the MI early to get a draw, then convert it to get the BO crew out first turn again, and I notice I have a CoW in hand, as well as Ready Room Door. I play the CoW on the next turn, get rid of the first dilemma with SSM, and pass the remaining to score my CoW. Now I&#146;m very happy. I simply wait for Dan&#146;s Dominion Battleships to come screaming into the Alpha Quad. But unfortunately, it never happens.<br>
<br>
Dan plays a Jem&#146;Hadar Warship instead, and patiently blows through my dilemmas, one by one, and scores the homeworld first for 40 + 10 from a self-seeded Barclay&#146;s. On my turn, I go for Good Day. Wrong choice. Flying Pancakes (Denevan Neural Parasites) kill half my crew, including 2 SCI, which it turns out I will need later. I frantically try to score more points on different missions, but a Dead End stops me on Secret Salvage, Odo&#146;s Cousin on Good Day, and Scientific Method on two other missions. Dan cleans up in the Gamma Quad, slowly plugging through dilemmas, scoring Tulaberry. 95-30 at this point; he plays Obedience to d/l Victory Is Life, and wants to score the last 5 points with the Jemmie who helped in the mission. After a brief discussion with Chad, he finds that Victory Is Life must be played as a &quot;just&quot; action, not during his end-of-turn actions. He makes his way over to Quest to score the last 5. Time is called before he can finish it out. 0 (-65), cumulative 3 (+85).<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Dan, for successfully completely avoiding battle with my Klingons.<br>
Dan, for getting back in the saddle with Trek tournaments<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Dan, for not giving my Klingons any targets<br>
Me, for letting the stupid Flying Pancakes kill half my crew before I needed them<br>
Me, for not including Wormholes to get to GQ<br>
<br>
ROUND 4: vs Anthony Howard (Fed/Bajoran Dabo, 200+ card deck)<br>
<br>
I had never had the pleasure of playing Anthony in past tournaments, but I had heard rumors. Dabo, Dabo, and more Dabo. I win the toss, and set up as usual. He sets up DS9 at Bajor (I think), and Fed outpost at Investigate Coup. I begin the usual way, BO crew out first turn. He responds on his turn by revealing DH, Quark&#146;s Rods, Scanner Interference, and Intruder Alert! Odo is d/led to Security Office, Quark Son of Keldar goes to his hand, then reported for free at Quark&#146;s Bar, Distortion Field is set up at Good Day, and IFF is out. He uses Quark&#146;s Bar to d/l Leeta (and Dabo) in place of card play/draw. He Dabos unsuccessfully, losing three cards. Turn 2, I d/l Lukara and head to DS9 (only 6 span away). Quark and Leeta are soon put out of their misery, and I discard Rukor and Thermal Deflectors. I then Dabo unsuccessfully. He brings Odo over to Dabo, yet again with no points scored. I flip Rods to get Quark in hand, then play him for free to the Bar. Quark, with a few friends, run to Ops to commandeer successfully. Anthony pretty much gives up at this point, but like a true sport, plays the game out. I win by finishing up a few missions for the full win. 2 (+100), cumulative 5(+185).<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Anthony, for having the chutzpah to play 200+ cards in a draw deck<br>
Me, for commandeering and having a Klingon Terok Nor! Muhaahaa...<br>
Anthony, for playing the full game in true sportsmanlike conduct<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
XFL, for making a player drop to go see LA Extreme or whatever...<br>
Games and Cards, for having a tiny bathroom<br>
<br>
FINAL ROUND: vs Tim Scott (Klingon BO, 80+ card draw deck)<br>
<br>
Tim and I hit it off well, chatting about the Riverside area (where he&#146;s from). Whereas my deck focused on missions suitable for Council of Warriors, Tim&#146;s was all about high point missions. Warped Space and Seek Life-form were both on the table, and I tried not to drool. After seeing his missions, my plan was simple; solve one of my own missions with CoW, hope that a substantial amount of his crew were at his Great Hall so I could attack them and score 20-30 points, and then finish out with Warped Space, where I seeded Edo Probe/Lack of Prep/Dead End. With at least 50 points, and the correct skills present, Warped Space was just waiting for me to get over there.<br>
<br>
I won the toss, and we quickly discovered that we were both playing Klingon. I started off with Kang in hand, along with Big Picture and RRD. I made the tough choice, and Obelisked myself, and drawing Jadzia, Worf SOM, and a CoW. Much better. I played Dax, d/led Kang and Blood Oath, put Operate Wormhole Relays underneath and converted the draw to d/l Koloth and Bat&#146;leth, and d/led Kor instead of end-of-turn draw. Tim was impressed, and proceeded to d/l Defend Homeworld with a QtR. He then discarded DH to d/l Kang and Blood Oath. Unfortunately, he had Dax, Koloth, and Kor all in his Tent, and he didn&#146;t get any Tents for at least 4-5 turns. He was also playing a regular Nor at his Search for Weapons. I commandeered, and with the help of his Commander&#146;s Office, was able to get Captain&#146;s Log as well as SSM into hand.<br>
<br>
I proceeded to Test Mission after playing a CoW there, since there were only 2 seeds present. I noticed he had a Flash active, so I put a minimum complement aboard the Lukara who were still able to play SSM; Kang, Dax, and Loreva. SSM discarded a Chula: the Dice. Then, a Flash. First was Hide and Seek; Kang was stopped. Second was Penalty Box; Loreva was sent. And third was Lemon-Aid, but since there was no score at the time, it had no effect. Of course, Dax did not have Physics + INTEGRITY&gt;28 alone, but the crew of the Ning&#146;tao did. Kromm, the Physics MS, along with 5-6 others scored 30 points and the CoW. Next door was Tim&#146;s Great Hall. Tim attempted to Secure Qo&#146;noS, and hit my Flying Pancakes with 10 personnel, losing 5. His Away Team was subsequently stopped by my Oops!, which gave me my opportunity. On my turn, I proceeded to Great Hall, and beamed down to attack. I ended scoring 33 points in battle from CoW, but Chad then called time, and I was disappointed to take the modified win instead of full. 1 (+63), cumulative 6 (+248)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Tim, for giving me a couple new ideas to try with this deck<br>
Chad, for knowing his stuff<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, for wasting time and timing out when I should have had a full win<br>
Tim, for playing Klingons and not knowing what CoW does<br>
<br>
Overall, I finished second, with Dan taking top honors, and Jeff came in 4th. For my trouble, I received 3 boosters and a much needed Smiley. Time to start making that Empire deck... thanks Chad for another great tournament, and thanks to all my opponents for putting up with my Klingons for the third time. Hoping to see you all in San Diego on the 25th for my tournament... <br>
