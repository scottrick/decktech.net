I don&#146;t bother telling you what me and my friends did, what I had for breakfast, who I was pissed at, no, I like to get down to buisness. So here we go.<br>
<br>
This report will be long and detailed since it only went 4 games. (Making it easy to remember)<br>
<br>
This tournament was held at Broken Games, was run by Steven &quot;Rachmaninoff&quot; (whatever), Boyles, ended up with 11 people, and went 4  games.<br>
<br>
My deck for this tourney was my incredibly fun (and solid) Kligon anti-speed deck, &quot;Crimson Fury&quot; (Go check it out on my D-Page, and in case Kai Len reads this, I gave a lot of credit to Ray Lacey, try actually reading the strategy section before you review).<br>
Anyway, this deck had all kinds of speed counters, and it doubled as a &#146;Drag&#146; deck, which means it used the combo of &quot;Female&#146;s Love Interest &amp; Radioactive Garabage&quot; with &quot;Destroy Radioactive Scow&quot; to annihilate and entire away team.<br>
<br>
My rating going into this tourney was 1522 (I don&#146;t play as much as I should, it&#146;s hard to juggle between SW and Trek)<br>
<br>
Game 1: &quot;Crimson Fury&quot; V.S. R.J Smith&#146;s (?) Fed report/solve deck<br>
<br>
R.J. is a good guy who, despite his low-placings, is a good player. You can&#146;t make mistakes on him. So, going into this game I knew I could win but I couldn&#146;t get careless. R.J. goes first, seeds a bunch of Fed Egineer space missions (no Drag for me), and plays with &#146;Test Mission II&#146; for an outpost, with no spacedoor. I seed my missions all in-between his, and put my outpost right next to his. R.J. seeds like 18-20 dilemmas with no self seeds (yikes!) and also seeds a AU Door, Q&#146;s Tent, and a Q-Flash, an AMS for Christopher Hobson and Leah Brahms, also seeds 2 hidden agendas and an ASP.<br>
<br>
I seed 18 dilemmas, a battle bridge, 2 STP&#146;s, an AU door, a Q&#146;s Tent, a AMS for Konmell and Batrell, a Mission Debriefing, 1 Q the ref, a Spacedoor, and Hide &amp; Seek.<br>
<br>
R.J.&#146;s first turn he uses Defend Homeworld to get Anya who downloads Salia. Then he ditches ASP for T&#146;Pan, plays another AMS for Dr. Leah Brahms and Gibson, draws.<br>
<br>
To make the early game somewhat short, we both started drawing a lot of cards and playing people respectively. Soon, I noticed we were both low on draw decks and neither of us had even ATTEMPTED a mission. Enter Mid-game.<br>
<br>
R.J. Tents and plays Q&#146;s planet (crap), draws.<br>
<br>
I STP drop the I.K.C Chang with like 7 people, R.J. has no answer for that, and attempt Distress mission.<br>
<br>
I get past a Ferengi Infestation, then lose 11 points to &quot;The Higher...The Fewer&quot;, hit a Q-Flash, Fightin, words, Penalty Box (Yint I think), Mandarain Bailif (Kor?) Q-Type android which grabs Batrell, Hide&amp; Seek stops Daval. Next, get past a Beserk Changling with 2 hand weapons (Bat&#146;Leth and Disrupter Rifle courtesy of Yint and Koloth), then solve the mission for 35 - 11 for a total of 24 points. Draw.<br>
<br>
R.J. has since played Rager and Mordock, so he if he now solves Explore Dyson Sphere (which happens to be the mission closest to his outpost), he gets like 60 points! He plays &quot;Asteroid Santuary&quot; on his ship (Thunderflare) so I can&#146;t battle it and attempts Dyson Sphere. He is stopped by a Radioactive Garbage and I flip over mission debriefing to stop him from going anywhere. He wants to play Distortion, but I use Q the ref to download a Temporal Vortex and stop that. Then, he plays Asteroid Sant. on his ship (Thunderflare) so I can&#146;t battle it. Draws.<br>
<br>
My turn I tent for a colony, Palor Toff for Q the Ref and play it, fly all but 4 people over to Investigate Disturbance, hit--Make us Go--Harvester Virus--Duonetic Field Generator, solve the mission for 35 points but get stuck on the planet by the generator. Move the Change to R.J. the Santuary is gone for some reason, he doesn&#146;t play another one, so 1 Max firepower later, and his ship and like 18 people are gone! <br>
<br>
So the game is pretty much mine at this point, but I only have like 8 cards left in my deck, and still to satisfy Q&#146;s planet AND The Big Picture. I start playing Tents every turn so I don&#146;t draw any cards for lik 4 turns, but I&#146;m still trapped behind that dammned Generator! Not sure what to do, R.J. solves the problem for me by playing 3 Kivas Fajo-Collectors...on me. Deck out.<br>
MW +59<br>
<br>
Highs: Seeing the deck work and blowing up his ship.<br>
<br>
Lows: Decking out, not playing a single &quot;Destroy Radioactive Garbage Scow&quot;<br>
<br>
Game 2: &quot;Crimson Fury&quot; V.S. Tigh Bradley&#146;s (1616) Bajoran Orb deck.<br>
<br>
Tigh seeds DS9, Chamber of Ministers, about 17 dilemmas, has 4 self seeds, 3-4 hidden agendas, a STP, Tent, a ASP, and 3 Bajor region missions, 1 Badlands mission, and 1 mission in the mirror quad to download &quot;The Art of Diplomacy&quot;.<br>
<br>
I seed first, and seed the same as game 1, only this time I get to use my Homefront on his Bajor, and I stick my outpost as close to the Bajor region as possible.<br>
<br>
My first turn I notice I have a fiendishly good hand, download a K&#146;Vort, and draw.<br>
<br>
Tigh&#146;s first turn he downloaded Mora Pol (I think) with ASP, then played Morn to Quark&#146;s bar and drew.<br>
<br>
Well, in my hand, unfortuantely for Tigh, was exactly what I needed. A Tent, K&#146;mtar, Kered, Kras, K&#146;chiQ, and Yint. See, perfect. I Tent for the I.K.C. Chang, STP drop it at the outpost, play Yint who downloads the Disrupter Rifle, I get everyone onto the K&#146;Vort, fly to DS9, dock at his docking ports with K&#146;mtar, march him and Yint into Quark&#146;s bar, killed Morn, then use K&#146;ChiQ&#146;s selected skill of Computer Skill to Commandeer the station, 2nd turn. Nice. <br>
<br>
Tigh gets out Kai Opaka and draws. My turn I play Jadzia Dax to my outpost and draw. Tigh plays HQ:Return Orb on Opaka, attempts Alter Records via Secure Homeworld, I flip Mission Debriefing, he aquires the Orb of Wisdom, stopped by his own Sarjenka, he is on Bajor with the Orb, scores 10 points, draws 3 cards, my turn.<br>
<br>
Yint and Kered go kill Opaka.<br>
<br>
Tigh reports a Raider with Sarish Rez and some schmoe, plays a Defend Homeworld (no more battles for me) and draws. <br>
<br>
As the game wears on we are both playing/drawing, I eventually start using Guest Quarters, Tigh gets out Kivas Fajo and starts using my Toffs, so really, the next exciting thing that happens as we play/draw is when Tigh attempts Characterize Neutrino Emmissions, hits a Cytherians and is stopped by Debriefing. My next turn I fly over with my K&#146;Vort (weapons 6 + 6 from Max. firepower  would mean instant death for his Raider), but he uses STP to return the ship to his hand, then re-plays it next turn and solves the mission. I fly over and blow him up. (He had Scanned and red-shirted for the solve, so no big loss to him except for the ship)<br>
<br>
I, meanwhile, start attempting missions and lose tons of points to Edo Probes and Higher...The Fewer, the score is just about dead even when Tigh attempts Verify Evidence and hits another Cytherians, this time it cost him. Almost all his personnel are on that ship, so I just solve 3 planet missions for 101 points, then Q-Cycle my Big Picture for the win.<br>
FW around 40<br>
<br>
The Highs: Nice Interaction, taking over DS9<br>
<br>
The Lows: Those damn Higher...the Fewer.<br>
<br>
Game 3: &quot;Crimson Fury&quot; V.S. Eric Wood&#146;s (1686) Fed By-pass deck.<br>
<br>
I go first, seeding the same as the game against Tigh, only Homefront is on Earth.<br>
<br>
Eric seeds 3 Mirror missions to download cards out of his 30 card deck, an STP, an AU, a Tent, a Flash, 2 Hidden agendas, an ASP, and an AMS for Maxwell and somebody to his Test Mission II and 3 self-seeds along with 13 dilemmas.<br>
<br>
Right away I think By-Pass as he has Pegasus Search right next to Earth (which he seeded Secure Homeworld on), then I know he is playing when I see the self-seeds. Good thing I seeded Hide &amp; Seek. <br>
<br>
My early-game consists of me drawing with Kivas mostly, (but I do STP the Chang with about 5 guys) while Eric downloads a bunch of cards with DH, ASP, Admiral Riker, Starship Enterprise, Mccoy, etc. So, by his 3rd turn he is ready to By-Pass.<br>
<br>
He flips Computer Crash and attempts Pegasus Search, and Hide &amp; Seek forces him to go flyin&#146; with Cytherians. But, Eric plays Transworp Conduit to get mass range (Starship Enterprise + Defiant Dedication Plaque + Mr. Scott + Chekov), but I flip Mission Debriefing to stop him, he distortions, but Q-Ref downloads Vortex, stopping him. <br>
<br>
My turn I fly the Chang over to attack, but he STP&#146;s the ship which prevents me from killing everybody, but does re-set his deck. My turn, I fly over to my outpost mission, &quot;Investigate Disturbance&quot; solve it for 40 points, Tent for a Colony and draw.<br>
<br>
Eric just starts report/drawing as I score from colony, he does do another space mission, hits another Cytherians, does it in 1 turn with Distorion/Conduit combo, and goes for MY reported activity, but earlier I had played it as my cardplay as a hidden agenda (with only 1 Q the Ref, I only re-cycle with Q the Ref if I really need to draw a card or if I know I won&#146;t need that particular card. That kind of playing came in real handy today). So, Eric couldn&#146;t solve the mission. <br>
<br>
Seeing my chance I flew over the Chang to blow him up, Eric cuts my deck and says I WILL draw to Crimson Forcfields, I smirk and...DRAW TWO CRIMSON FORCEFIELDS!! Oh well. It didn&#146;t matter much anyway since I eventually got out a Treachery and stole his Pegasus Search for the win.<br>
FW + 70<br>
<br>
The Highs: No By-Pass for him!<br>
<br>
The Lows: I STILL haven&#146;t gotten to &#146;Scow&#146; anybody yet.<br>
<br>
There are only 2 undefeateds left, me, and someone else who nobody has even scored on yet...Todd Soper.<br>
<br>
Game 4: &quot;Crimson Fury&quot; V.S. Todd Soper&#146;s (1769) Ferengi Cargo run deck<br>
<br>
Great, due to my modified victory I have to beat Todd to place, never mind winning the tourney. Just to place I have to beat the 2nd best Trek player in the State (the best being Jason Drake), someone who has spent most of his career in World&#146;s top 10 and is the only person to make to World&#146;s final confrontation twice...Freakin&#146; Great.<br>
<br>
Well, I go first and seed the same as the other games, only I make a crutial decision and decide to seed a Hazardous-Duty-Cytherians combo under Deliver Supplies as opposed to a Scow combo. <br>
<br>
Todd seeds a Ferengi Trading Post, DS9 at the Bajoran Wormhole, 1 Mirror Quad mission, (the Bajor one), a Nor, about 17 dilemmas, a tent, an AU Door, and like 10 freakin&#146; hidden agendas along with AMS, ASP, and a 1st rule and D&#146;kora Transport.<br>
<br>
My opening draw is pretty sweet, 4 {AU} people, a Tent and 2 Kivas&#146;s, but no Destroy Scows, so I download a K&#146;vort, flip Q the ref and draw.<br>
<br>
Todd downloads about 7 people (DH, QIR, 1st Rule, etc.), downloads a Multi-Dim. Transport device with Crossover, cardplay is Bev. and Will who download a Tricorder. Todd then starts a Cargo Run from the Trading Post and plays a Transwarp Conduit on his ship, does the run and passes 4 missions, Devidian Doors someone, Q-cycles, then draws. Damn.<br>
<br>
My turn I report Koloth, download a Bat&#146;Leth, and draw. Go me.<br>
<br>
Todd shows a Door, reports Lore, uses Art of Diplomacy for a phaser to him, plays a Xepolite Freighter for free starts another Cargo run with a GPL to the OTHER Nor from DS9, plays another Transwarp, does it, draws 6 cards, Devidian doors 3 people, uses Lore with the Mult. Dim. Transport device to re-group eveyone to Quark&#146;s bar, Q-cycles something, draws. Damn.<br>
<br>
I Kivas Fajo and draw. Go me.<br>
<br>
Todd shows the doors, Downloads Morn to the Nor, downloads a GPL, ditches it for a Plasmadyne relay, play another Freighter for free to DS9, starts another cargo run from the Nor to DS9, Toffs for the Conduit, completes the run and draws 6 cards. Then starts ANOTHER Cargo run from DS9 to the Nor with Kasidy Yates and the Transport device, draws 8 cards, Devidian Doors like 2 guys, draws. Damn.<br>
<br>
I debate STP dropping the Chang with 4 guys, picking up AMS&#146;s, Koloth and the Bat&#146;leth, then batteling his guys on DS9. But, I remember he just played Prepare Assault teams and Lore is there so I decide against it. Then I debate STP dropping the Chang and moving the K&#146;Vort over to the Nor and blowing up his docked Transport at the Nor (which no one is on), but, I decide to be patient as I realize he won&#146;t win on drawing cards. Instead I play Martok and draw. Go me.<br>
<br>
Todd shows the doors, reports somebody, Transwarps to Deliver Supplies with EVERYBODY on a Xeopolite (with Transwarps and Distortions he can win in one turn), and attempts.<br>
<br>
Remember what I said about that Cytherians, well it paid off. He hits Hazardous Duty and stops his 1 man away team, beam downs the neccesary people to pass the Hazardous Duty--Penalty Box--Crisis combo, but hits Cytherians. Seeing my chance, I flip Mission Debriefing stopping him, he Distortions, but I Ditch Q the ref to download Distortion and stop him anyway. Todd draws.<br>
<br>
By now, everyone is watching us as we are the last game (and hell, no one has any points) and everyone figures Todd is safe seeing as how my Chang can&#146;t make the jump. Well, I tent for a Wormhole, play it, and discard my last STP to move to Todd&#146;s location, and blow his ship, and ALL the personnel in his deck, to that big game in the sky. GO ME!!!!!<br>
<br>
From here I relax and get ready to solve missions for a easy win, then the TD shouts &quot;12 minutes&quot; Crap!! I need a full win to win this tourney. I grab a skeleton crew of like 9 people, put them on the Chang and start doing missions.<br>
<br>
First go for Distress Mission and hit Ferengi Infestation--Ferengi Bug (WTF??) and I&#146;m stopped. Next turn, solve it for 40. 7 minutes to go.<br>
<br>
Next, I for  Reported Activity, get past a Friendly Fire and am stopped by Chula:The Game. Craaaaaap. 2 turns later, I solve it for 40, up tp 80!. 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
I go for Investigate Disturbance, hit a &quot;Odo&#146;s Cousin&quot; and the crowd goes &quot;oooooh!&quot; I have Koloth, exo 1, Kras, Geo 1, but not a second Exo!! Noooooo! But wait! K&#146;ChiQ is there so I just need the one thing I don&#146;t have, time. I&#146;m stopped. 4 minutes. Next turn I turn her into an Exo, get past it and leave Daval for 5 points, get stopped behind a Crisi. 3 minutes. My next turn, i beam up Kras to the ship, get past Crisis, and solve the mission for 40 points, putting me at 120 points  for the game, and for the tourney with 3 minutes left.<br>
FW +100<br>
<br>
The Highs: Great game with interaction and mission-risks, playing Todd, (and beating him 100-0), Todd speeding through his turns when he knew time was running out (he&#146;s a great sport)<br>
<br>
The Lows: None, a very entertaining game against a great opponent.<br>
<br>
So, I finish 1st and pick up another Q&#146;s Tent foil (Decipher sent me one for finishing 2nd in states last year). Todd comes in 2nd and I think Jacob-Edwards King comes in 3rd.<br>
<br>
