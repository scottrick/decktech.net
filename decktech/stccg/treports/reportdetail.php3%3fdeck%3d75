<br>
So last week, one of my friends said, <br>
&quot;What do you think about heading to San Jose for Trek?&quot; <br>
Now, keep in mind, we live in San Diego (Southern California), and he was talking about San Jose (Northern California), a distance of some 450+ miles. <br>
I had nothing better to do, and so we went. *shrug*<br>
<br>
For our invasion of Northern CA, I partially reconstructed my old Klingon Blood Oath/Q The Ref deck, with the important additions of Barzan Wormholes and DQSS. The DQ Klingons fit right in, and filled a few skill gaps nicely. I also was able to manage 18 dilemmas, and felt very comfortable with the seed deck. With a plethora of draw mechanisms (Kivas/Mutation/DQSS/DKD/Subatomic), I felt ready to go.<br>
<br>
I flew, and he drove up to San Jose early Friday morning. I met him at the airport at about 4 pm. We went back to our Motel 6 room for a couple hours, and then descended upon the unsuspecting Bay Area players. *mwhahaa*<br>
<br>
A few familiar faces were present, and were justly surprised to see us. We were eager to start, and finally sat down around 7:30 pm for game 1 of 5 (we had 17 players). My first matchup was one for which I had waited nearly a year. To avenge my loss at last year&#146;s California State Championships. I sat down and prepared to face:<br>
<br>
Round 1: Franklin Kenter (1771, 5th in California)<br>
<br>
I settled in, preparing for reconciliation. Franklin and I had an interesting seed phase; we both expected the other to self-seed, and both ended up pitching a dilemma (my Dead End, his Your Galaxy Is Impure). He set up DS9 at Bajor with Shrine, Shops, and Quarters among others, and Chamber below with HoloDoor + 221B aboard. Along with Bajoran Resistance Cell, it looked like Franklin was going to be drawing cards for the long haul (his draw deck was around 100 cards). <br>
<br>
I had first turn, and proceeded to draw 3 from a Kivas, 1 from a Ref cycle, and still no Barzan (ship and crew were good). I then remembered to d/l Kang from DH (duh), and s/ded Blood Oath before ending my turn. Franklin got some setup on the first turn after lamenting a bad draw, and d/led Sherlock to start a DKD/All Threes combo that would set the tone for the rest of the game. DKD to put Threes on top, then probe from Shops draws it, ready for the next turn. Not too shabby. <br>
<br>
After a turn or two, I managed to get a Barzan (after Obelisk/Masaka) and drop the Lukara, after which he RBMed it. I sighed in disgust, debating whether or not to pitch my last QtR (only 1 left after DH + Obelisk). I decided against it, and they were stopped for the time being. Franklin continued a slow, methodical pattern of playing All Threes, a Resistance personnel for free, Shrine, etc. to get his hand to be what he wanted it to be. I tried to move from Wormhole Neg., but he had seeded Aid Fugitives, which I figured he had included for lots of Hippocratic Oaths. I mentally cursed myself for not having included Operate Wormhole Relays (I realized afterwards I could have played a Barzan in GQ!). Next turn, I returned the ship to hand with an STP, and dropped it w/Barzan again, and when I tried to move, he again Wormholed me to GQ. <br>
<br>
We both continued this nonsense for 55 minutes (my Barzan ships, his RBM or Wormholes), and he started panicking, since neither of us had scored points. I berated myself again for taking out my 2 Klingon Death Yells that I could have used (he had Lore at DS9 + Crosis and 4 RBM aboard 2 ships). We ended up timing out, 0-0.<br>
<br>
1(+0)<br>
<br>
Well, I guess it could have been worse. I still owe you a game, Mr. Kenter.<br>
<br>
Round 2: John Vroman (1445)<br>
<br>
John was playing a Fed/Baj with DS9 and Office on Earth, together with a VCM. I shuddered internally, as I had deleted It&#146;s Only a Game at the last minute from my deck. It turned out not to be too bad, as he had trouble drawing (and probing), and I was able to Barzan drop a ship 1st and 2nd turn, and made it through his dilemmas pretty easily.<br>
<br>
2(+100), Total 3(+100)<br>
<br>
Round 3: Tim Meng (1545)<br>
<br>
Tim and I laid out 3 duped missions (Qo&#146;noS, Good Day, and Secret Salvage II), and I knew I was in for a real game. I kept an eye on my Investigate Alien Probe, since it&#146;s not covered by Fair Play OR Defensive Measures. I hadn&#146;t seen another Klingon affiliation player in the last 4 months, so I figured I was safe. He won the toss, and the battle was joined.<br>
<br>
We both got Kang with DH, and both got a second BO personnel fairly quickly, after which the ships started coming out fast. He tented for a Klingon Civil War, which I was drooling over. I drew first blood, scoring Wormhole Negotiations while losing 3 personnel to various dilemmas (MLI/TPS hurt). He came back, scoring Romulus for 35 (+5 from AMS), and also picking up his Starry Night. Doh. I thought he would go for Sword of Kahless and something else... he ended up getting Zefram Cochrane&#146;s Telescope (good choice) and City of B&#146;Hala, which I found kind of strange, considering he didn&#146;t have any [Baj] missions... I struggled against his oddball dilemmas (In the Pale Moonlight, Emergency Conversion), and he waited to draw a Tent so he could fetch his Council of Warriors. Before he could play the Tent though, time was called. 45-35<br>
<br>
1(+10), Total 4(+110)<br>
<br>
Round 4: Dan Webster (1612)<br>
<br>
Always a treat to play Dan; he is a true gentleman and loves to have fun with this game (something I think younger players miss out on sometimes). He set up 6 Delta Quadrant missions with Caretaker&#146;s, and I briefly toyed with the idea of dropping there instead of at Barzan. I had a Yahtzee hand and dropped a ship + 4 people and ended up with no cards in hand. Dan also got a fast start and dropped the Baxial with 3 people aboard at the Array. Having seeded N/A Dauntless and Nekrit Supply Depot with War Council aboard, he got started 1 turn, and jumped into an attempt, finding a Dead End.<br>
<br>
I also got going quickly, and scored Distress Mission quickly for 35. Dan continued his one-man show on the Baxial, looking for nasty dilemmas to trip. He found a second Dead End which vanished, then hit a Cardassian Trap, and Icheb was mine. I cleared out Wormhole Negotiations except for a Dead End; I thought about waiting for Chancellor Gowron to show up so I could have some fun and solve Secret Salvage II with CoW aboard from Gowron&#146;s s/d, but I decided against it, and solved Secret Salvage II with light difficulty, and with no Mission Debriefing on the table, solved Wormhole Negotiations next door. <br>
100-0<br>
<br>
2(+100), 6 (+210)<br>
<br>
At this point, it was a bit past midnight, and I felt like I was at DecipherCon 2 1/2 years ago (1999). We had one more match to go, and it turned out I could have sneezed and missed the entire game:<br>
<br>
Round 5: Ray Liu (1568)<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, Ray and I had also played each other at last year&#146;s States; I think if I remember correctly, I cheesed out and stole his mission for the win. Well, karma has a funny way of coming back to haunt you when you least expect it... Ray was playing Hirogen in the DQ, and it didn&#146;t look good for me.<br>
<br>
Ray had the Yahtzee hand this time; going first, dropping 7-8 quality personnel on the first turn, and attempting Repair Null Space Catapult with 3 different ships (seeded N/A Equinox w/HAFH, and 2 d/led Venatic Hunters). He cleaned it up on the second turn, as I sat and watched my deck stagnate. I managed to finish Good Day, but not without losing the entire BO crew except Koloth. I then tried to supplement the crew and get over to Wormhole Negotiations, while Ray was blowing through my combos with false crews and personnel to spare. I cleared out Wormhole Neg., but that karma thing... I was one Honor short. In a Klingon deck. With the Blood Oath people. grr. Ray finished up on the next turn, and I was handed my only loss of the day. 35-100<br>
<br>
0 (-65), Total 6(+145)<br>
<br>
My performance was good enough for 5th place, and my friend and I were thankful to be done (we left at 8 am the next morning with a 9 hr drive ahead of us). Thanks to Brady Miller for a great tournament, and to Ron Bergman for providing us the place to hold it. I expect to see some reciprocation before ComicCon, Bay Area! :)<br>
