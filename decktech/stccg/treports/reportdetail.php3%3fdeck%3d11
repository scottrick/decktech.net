But it ended out that several players didn&#146;t have time to make them, and the ones that did turned out to be interesting decks. I was one of the players that didn&#146;t have enough time to build a real theme deck.<br>
I ended up modifying one of my decks and taking an Original series deck. The general strategy was to get a decent sized crew out quickly, and complete Pegasus search and historical research with mission specialists for the win.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Vs Mark<br>
He was playing a theme deck based around the line in generations, &quot;Human Males are Repulsive.&quot; So the whole deck was built around human males and klingon females. <br>
During the seed phase we ended up both seeding Pegasus search; he insisted that his foil went on top. <br>
Well on his first turn he tented for Red Alert, I was a tad nervous, as I had none of the counters. He then ended his turn. On my turn I had nothing good in my hand, so I maska^d my self, downloaded anya and salia, played a kivas, and dropped a ship with 4 people on it to Sherman&amp;#8217;s peak. I then ended my turn. On his turn he dropped 6 ships from his hand. He wasn&#146;t stocking maska, and apparently had all but 1 of his ships in his hand. I think I got off lucky. Oh well, he ended his turn. <br>
At this point I took it slower than I should have. I was a little nervous with my deck, as earlier that morning I messed with all of the personnel. I ended out waiting for the one ssm in the deck. It took a while, but my opponent was having trouble getting the cards he needed even with a traveler out. So after a couple of turns I came to the alpha quadrant, and attempted Pegasus search to get pass my borg cube dilemma. I then passed line up (What can I say, over half the crew was mirror). A couple dilemmas later I was at 55. I moved over to historical research and attempted. End result 45 more points for the win. 2(+100)<br>
Props: Him for actually trying to make a deck like that. <br>
Slops: Me waiting so long to attempt missions.<br>
His bad hand with 6 ships in it.<br>
<br>
Game 2: Me Vs Steve<br>
Steve didn&#146;t have much time to build a deck either this week, so he was playing a modified deck that he played in the mirror tournament the week before. It worked quite well actually. It used STP to drop the ferisius with crew, and ezri to grab crossover and a multi dimensional transport device to commander Empok Nor. So with that on to the game.<br>
I had yet another horrible hand, so I maska^d myself after reporting Mirror Sulu, unfortunately I did not download his phaser, which ended up in my hand. So I slowly reported cards for the first couple of turns, while waiting for my ship. In this time my opponent kept collecting on himself for cards. I really wish I had a scorched hand in my deck. Then he finally dropped 10-15 personnel on the fesarius, boy did I wish I had It&#146;s only a game. At this point I left the planet and attempted Pegasus search. All was good until I hit Cytherians; I was, on my slower enterprise, with everyone on board. So I was in for a couple turn flight.<br>
During this time my opponent reported ezri, who grabbed crossover and the transport device. With this he beamed all of his personnel to empok nor, commandeering it. He then transported back to the mirror quadrant, and back to pick up the equipment he downloaded. The only problem was he only used it for a medical tricorder, and classic tricorder. But it seemed like a cool idea. He then went over to attempt one of the homeworlds in the mirror quadrant. He lost a science and hit a dead end. On his next turn he went to Mine dilithium and attempted. He lost another science, then one to kelvan, and was stopped by scientific method. On his next turn he passed it with classic equipment, and scored 30 points. He then went to the alpha quadrant. Well I finally get back to the mission 15 points richer, and attempt for another 55 points, move over to historical research, go through a bunch of combo dilemmas and score 45 for the game. 4(+170)<br>
Props: That cool thing with empok nor.<br>
Slops: Attempting a space mission with all my people, and a 50 point one at that, defensive measures only does so much.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to wrap this thing up as its getting late, but<br>
Game 3: Me Vs Jefferson<br>
Well he was playing a deck that used at least one personnel from each affiliation. Again it was working quite well. It used brunt in the VIP quarters, Overseer odo for ore processing. Two ams klingons with space doored ships for battle, and fed and rom for attempting. With a little tweaking the deck could be really good. <br>
He went first, and set up his ore processing, and card draw set up with odo and brunt, and ended his turn. I actually had the best hand I would have this game, so I dropped a bunch of people and ended my turn. He grabbed a ship with space door and engaged cloak. After several turns I entered the alpha and attempted Pegasus again, and again hit cytherians, and again on the slow ship. So I start moving to the long end of the space line, and the klingon ships (2 at this point start following). I get to the end of the space line before the klingon ships get to me, luckily they are separated though. So with admiral riker I take a pot shot at the first ship damaging it. It may be slow, but against one ship it is very versatile. This made it impossible for him to get both ships to mine at the same time. So next turn I cloak with a romulan cloaking device, and move back to Pegasus search. During this time my opponent has been attempting missions. At diplomatic Conference he lost a science and hit dead end. At one of the space missions he lost a science and got stopped with scientific method (Forgetting McCoys special skill). He then attempted Open relations, lost a science, and stopped at scientific method. At this point I got back completed Pegasus, then completed agricultural assessment for the win.<br>
I told him about McCoy, and hit him self for not remembering.<br>
6(+270)<br>
Props: Making an 8-affiliation deck that actually worked, wow. <br>
Slops: Not remembering McCoys Skill.<br>
Me for hitting the exact same thing with a cytherians.<br>
<br>
Game 4:Me Vs Matt<br>
Matt was playing a federation smack down deck. It wasn&#146;t really a theme, but it was the first one I had seen (Smack down with phasers of course)<br>
First turn Matt downloaded morn and moved him to quarks bar, after playing 3-4 free cards to halkonian Council, and terran hideout, with rom to Quarks bar. And ended his turn. Well I had a crappy hand again. So it was another maska, and then slow reporting. I didn&#146;t even drop a ship in this round. On top of that I had to wait for my temporal vortex to get to my hand, because I new he had a borg ship under Pegasus, and I new it wasn&#146;t the first dilemma. Let&#146;s just say I&#146;ve passed it too many times that way. So by the time I was ready to move I had everyone out, and Matt had just moved his mirror quadrant personnel to the alpha quadrant. Well I had a feeling this was going to be a one shot deal, so I attempted Pegasus, ssm past ferengi infestation, and low and behold there&#146;s the cube. I ref it for TV, and continue, getting 55, I then move to historical research and attempt with everyone but the people for the mission. Of course I hit the combo I feared the whole day, denevan neural parasites, combo dilemma with alien parasites, and kelvan. So 8 people are selected for the first parasites, and I can only save 2, I pass alien parasites, and kelvin kills FO spock. I beam down and complete the mission for the win. Well I tell Matt that it would have been different had he had another turn. He says yup, as he shows me invasive beam in (He had the stolen attack ship since turn 2), Ezri for the transporter skill and the weapons to increase everyone&amp;#8217;s strength by 14 or so. No one could have survived. I forgot about the invasive beam in, and realize how pointless the asteroid sanctuary in my hand was.<br>
<br>
End result  8(+370)<br>
<br>
So I won the tournament, but there was no prize support from decipher. The td had bought some movies for support, which was cool, as I ended out with the mirror mirror episode.<br>
<br>
On a side note, here are some other cool decks that were there. An empathy vulcan deck that I suggested at the last theme tournament. A deck where every card had something to do with the number 2. This meant dual personnel, people with double skills, and dilemmas, which referenced 2. And finally a non-aligned deck that came in second.<br>
