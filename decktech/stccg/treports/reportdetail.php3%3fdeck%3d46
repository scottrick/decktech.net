It seemed well organized and well-run, but I was just there for the open. Chris Brennan ran the tournament.<br>
<br>
I only found out about this thing five days ago, so I quickly ordered some Voyager and began trying to think of a deck. I ended up basing my deck off of Robert Corbett&#146;s Ohio States deck. It wasn&#146;t an exact duplicate but same concept and key cards. The basic idea was to seed lots of dilemmas at cure deadly virus, Defend Homeworld + Temporal Microwormhole for Boratus and discard all but three there. Solve that with mission specialists for lots of points, then senior staff meeting a space missions and solve for the win. Use Vidiian Sodality + War Council + Talax for free plays and Kivas&#146;, Masakas, and Lots of Palors in the deck. Plus Delta Quadrant Spatial Schism for draws and plays. Scows and Mission debriefing for dilemmas.<br>
<br>
It turns out many people who were supposed to be coming to this didn&#146;t show, so we ended up with only 12 people, but those included the New York and New Jersey state champions and Vince Berardi who was last year&#146;s Cestus III (or whatever region Florida is in) winner. Including myself, that made for some decent competition.<br>
<br>
Game 1 versus Britt Bisson<br>
<br>
Britt was also playing a DQ deck (the first of many I saw that day), a Vidiian/Fed one. He wasn&#146;t using the schism but was using Ancestral vision for card draws. I did the Boratus thing and got rid of a bunch of dilemmas. I also Ux&#146;ed the Ancestral Vision shortly after he got Chakotay<br>
out. Unfortunately, some dilemma (perhaps a Denevan Neural Parasites?) was left under Cure Deadly Virus (CDV) which killed off my third source of exobiology forcing me to solve with Danara Pel for only 45 points. I then made a stupid error and SSM&#146;d the first dilemma under Return Life-form when it was my self-seeded Barclays! Hence I only managed to solve that mission for 40. Despite getting two Horga&#146;hn double turns, I couldn&#146;t get a third mission before time was called and ended up with a timed win.<br>
Result: Timed Win 85-65, Cumulative 1 +(20)<br>
Pros: My deck worked well, getting everything needed out soon.<br>
Cons: I didn&#146;t work well, seeding my Barclay&#146;s badly and then forgetting that and SSMing it away.<br>
<br>
Game 2 versus Sam<br>
<br>
Sam was playing a Borg Delta Quadrant deck. I beat him before he could staff his cube (thanks to Amanda-ing Awakens). Also, I could take unlimited double-turns with my Horga&#146;hn.<br>
Result: Full Win 100-0, Cumulative 3 +(120)<br>
Pros: Deck worked like a charm<br>
Cons: The Borg - they still aren&#146;t competitive<br>
<br>
Game 3 versus Jesse<br>
<br>
Jesse was playing a Fed DQ deck with Home Away from Home and DQSS. He was probably also playing Vidiians as everyone else was. He centered his deck around B&#146;Elanna Torres and the two missions she solves (or nearly solves). Fortunately I packed 2 B&#146;Elannas in my deck for decks such as his. I got started and Boratus&#146;ed all but one of his dilemmas (and unfortunately my Horga&#146;hn). Even more unfortunate, that one<br>
dilemmas was Denevan Neural Parasites and with only one Harvester in the deck, 4 people died so I had to solve CDV with Danara Pel for 45. Also unfortunately, Jesse went and attempted Prevent Annihiliation which I had seeded to steal (Sarjenka, Barclay&#146;s and Spatial Rift). He had seeded only a Barclay&#146;s there himself. So he ignored Sarjenka and scored<br>
20 from Barclay&#146;s and luckily got a bad selection for the Spatial Rift. I then swooped in and stole it, putting me at 85. Finally, I was stupid and even though I saw that a Q Flash was discarded at CDV, I didn&#146;t close his flash before I attempted the space mission and hit a 10 card flash. It ended up having little effect, because Janway still retained her name and could still solve Return Life-form. I had Q the Ref downloaded Intermix Ratio, cancelling his Barclay&#146;s points, so I ended up winning 100 nothing.<br>
Result: Full Win 100-0, Cumulative 5 (+220)<br>
<br>
Pros: Successfully stealing his mission, helping my differential by<br>
grabbing Intermix.<br>
Cons: Bad luck, Forgetting to close his Q Flash<br>
<br>
Game 4 versus Vince Berardi<br>
<br>
Vince used to live in New Jersey but has sinced moved to Florida. However, he was up visiting his mother this weekend so stopped by. Vince was the first non-DQ deck I played. He was using Guardian of Forever for card draws and Wormhole Negotiations + Barzan Wormhole to use those draws. Vince hadn&#146;t played in awhile and was a little unclear on how Guardian worked. but it was still a nice deck. I was just faster, kept my Horga&#146;hn and the deck worked like clockwork. Vince did manage to score a mission on me, but the Scows and Mission Debriefing held him off.<br>
Result: Full Win 100-35, Cumulative 7 (+285)<br>
Pros: Just the deck working again<br>
Cons: Having to call Chris over to explain that you could only travel to or from Guardian once each turn not both, and that doing that was executing orders, so you couldn&#146;t play cards after doing that.<br>
<br>
Game 5 versus Len Neidorf<br>
<br>
Len was playing a Kazon Armada with Kivases for card draws and Caretaker&#146;s array to report ships with people. He would pile his Kazon Raiders into a Warship, wormhole the warship, then launch them all and attack. I knew I had to be careful and not leave my ship exposed in this game. Fortunately, my outpost was next to CDV (actually, I built my deck so my outpost should never *not* be next to CDV), so each turn after bringing people over to CDV, I made sure the ship was still staffed, sent it back, and docked it. I Quinned his Captain&#146;s Log when he first downloaded it which saved my outpost. Because my space mission wasn&#146;t right next to my outpost, I couldn&#146;t do it without exposing myself, and I knew from the other two missions I attempted that he was also using the Scow/Mission Debriefing dilemmas<br>
strategy. I ended up doing CDV and Talax for 110 points. Of course, with Len&#146;s Big Picture in play, this wasn&#146;t enough to win the game, but time was called so I got a modified win by 100.<br>
Result Timed Win 100-0, Cumulative 8 (+385)<br>
Pros: Quinning the Captain&#146;s Log and hiding well at my outpost<br>
Cons: Hiding in fear of my life.<br>
<br>
By this point, I was assured a spot in the final confrontation. If I lost<br>
to my next opponent, by a decent enough margin, I would be playing him.<br>
<br>
Game 6 versus John Corbett<br>
<br>
John was playing an Ajur/Boratus deck too. His was a Bajoran deck with the dual missions so he could Ajur/Boratus them and then Senior Staff Meeting them (if his opponent&#146;s card ended up on the bottom of the shuffle). I was very lucky with the seeds that remained after Ajur at and Boratus did their thing. FLI/Scow and Altonian Brain Teaser at Runabout Search and Dead End at Deliver Supplies.<br>
I got off to a decent start though I had a bad draw. I tried to Amanda his SSM but unfortunately, he had a second. Luckily my FLI/Scow was on top so he was stopped by the scow. I made a bad error and thought I had left the Biology to solve CDV on the ship when it was in the away team. It<br>
turned out this error cost me the game as he won by one turn. I solved CDV and moved over to clear out Return Life-form, but left Janeway on my outpost just in case. I managed to clear out Return Life-form, but a Chandra stopped enough people so that I couldn&#146;t solve that turn. He won on his turn. To his credit, it was a great win. First, he made the first use of Alien Gambling Device that I&#146;ve ever seen. Alien Gambling Device was one of his crap seeds under the Dual-Missions. It stayed and he used it to redo the Boratus shuffle at the second dual icon when it discarded one of his cards. Also, it looked like I had prevented him from solving the other dual because of the Dead End there and him with only 45 points (well 40 that counted for winning). But he drew the Jovis, played it and grabbed Kivas Fajo to give him 5 points for the gambling device to give him the 50<br>
to pass Dead End and allow him to solve with Kathleen Tonnell who had been turned into a CIVILIAN specialist and grab the Varon-T disruptor for the last 5 points to win.<br>
Result: Full Loss 60-100, Cumulative 8 (+345)<br>
Pros: Great luck on his Ajur/Boratus shuffle<br>
Cons: Not looking carefully enough at my away team and losing the game by that turn.<br>
<br>
This meant I was facing John again in the final confrontation. By this time my back was really hurting. It always ends up hurting at the big tournaments because they always use folding chairs which don&#146;t support good posture. So I then went to find a carpeted area where I could lie down and think about what to do to beat him. Basically, it came down to three things: 1) He often stuck a one person away team on the dual-icon missions - I should toast this person with Villagers, forcing him to put 3 people on the planet and split his forces, 2) Revolving Door his tent as<br>
soon as possible. He has an Ajur and a Boratus in there and his Obelisk of Masaka and Masaka . If his tent is closed, he will have to draw into his Ajur and Boratus. 3) Keep Amanda/Quinns around to nullify his SSMs. With these thoughts, I went into the final.<br>
<br>
Final confrontation versus John Corbett<br>
<br>
This time, I seed his dual-icon missions with 3 dilemmas and just stick an FLI/scow at 2 of his single missions, hoping he&#146;ll be too single-minded to go for them (plus one is Romulan, so he would have to use his Temporal Micro-Wormhole for R&#146;Mor) Luck is with me and I have a Revolving Door in my opening hand so I close his tent. I&#146;m not 100% optimistic because he has an STP and he might have an AU door in his deck, but he doesn&#146;t seem to be able to do anything about it. Because of this, he spends many turns drawing and playing people, and I have plenty of time to set up and be sure I get 60 points from CDV (though I lose my Horga&#146;hn again). By the time I finish CDV he has managed to draw Ajur (through Handshake-replacing his hand at least once).  He puts her to work and gets rid of my FLI/Scow. So first he tries to attempt with Ajur on the planet and I fry<br>
her. Then he wisens up and puts 3 people on the planet and reattempts. After hitting my brain teaser, he hits sptial rift with no real way to pass it and two of his personnel &quot;disappear&quot;. Meanwhile, I had drawn my second Revolving door. In one of my Schism plays, I decided to play it, and, debating between his Space-time Portal and Temporal Microwormhole, I put it on the TMW because I know<br>
he used it last time to grab R&#146;Mor. Also, I got style points on my last turn because I attempted Return Life-form, and hit Chandra/Friendly Fire. Only one Leadership and one SECURITY make it past chandra, but Penk is the SECURITY and I special download the Rock to give the people&#146;s elbow to the Friendly Fire. This means I win the next turn. Well, with him not being able to grab R&#146;Mor to get past the rift, he makes a last ditch attempt at the other dual, fails, and I win 100-10 (could have been 100-0<br>
if I wanted to grab Intermix, but differential doesn&#146;t matter at this point).<br>
<br>
This was a very fun tournament. I played against some great players and everyone was very sporting. Everyone seemed to be infatuated with the Delta Quadrant and for good reason: Delta Quadrant Spatial Schism and the Vidiians Rock. I also got some great ideas for decks for my next tournament. Meanwhile, I will post this deck. </span></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><A HREF="reportread.php3?report=46"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/read.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD><TD><A HREF="reportreview.php3?report=46"><IMG SRC="/stccg/global/images/review.gif" BORDER=0></A></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><a href="reports.php3"><img src="/stccg/global/images/back.gif" border="0" ></a></TD><TD></TD></TR></TABLE></span></td>
