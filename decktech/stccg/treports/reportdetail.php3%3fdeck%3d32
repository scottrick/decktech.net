I am actually WRITING something instead of just sitting around reading.  I know I owe sll you readers out there my Day 2 Worlds report, andit IS Coming, but I have been busy with school and stuff.  So in the meantime, heres a report of what went down yesterday in Mt. Vernon Ohio.  If you just care about the games, feel free to skip the pre-tourney stuff.<br>
<br>
[Pre Tourney Stuff]<br>
<br>
Well I am sitting at my comp a couple of weeks ago and I get an email from Jared Hoffman, one of the directors up in Mt. Vernon telling me I qualified for their league championship.  I think thats pretty wierd since I only played in 2 Tourneys, but I guess my 2 3-1, 3rd place finishes were good enough to make it in.  This championship had an interesting twist: it was 8 rounds: 4 rounds of warp speed, followed by 4 rounds of No such thing as luck.  For those of you who dont know, No such thing as luck is a scenario in which you play your opponent for 2 games in a row, switching decks between games.  I spend a week or so trying to get back into STCCG mode, as I have not played in a tournament since February.  After much Deliberation, I decide to go with a Johnfauno-style Hunt for DNA/Boratus/AMS with a twist: I seed a Terraforming Station at Hunt for DNA so when we switched decks my opponent would be locked out of Hunt for DNA.  I also included Runabout Search, Pegasus Search, and Wormhole Negotiations, so I could hopefully get some easy steals, as I conspicuously left out Defensive measures ;o).  So anyway, the tournament is scheduled to start at 9 up in Mt. Vernon, which is an hour away, but I got there in 45 minutes because there was NO traffic on the road at all that time of day.  The best thing was that the entry fee was $5 and it included Breakfast, Lunch, AND Prize Support/Sealed deck stuff!!!<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to the tourney:<br>
<br>
[Part 1. Warp Speed]<br>
<br>
We sit down and get our decks (SDII, 1 Pack Premiere, 2 random common dilemmas, and an STA) and proceed to build.  My mission selection ends up being Relief Mission (Geo OR Physics), Study Plasma Streamer (Astro + Youth) and Test Mission (Physics + Int&gt;28) I get a Romulan Outpost and Decide to park it at the planet and start redshirting as soon as I can get people down.  My personnel selection is very good for those missions, as I get about 3 or 4 of each of my mission skills, a good spread of classifications, and 4 Diplomacy to get around Q-Nets, not to mention a Q-Net myself.  So my draw deck ends up at 24 with NO Interrupts, just personnel, ships, and like 3 or 4 events.<br>
<br>
Game 1: My Scrubbish Pile vs. Jared Hoffman<br>
<br>
Man, of course I get paired up with the best player (and a teammate) there in the first round. Grrr... Anyway He has a self seed, so I figure he has a cool artifact, which sucks for me.  He goes first and just starts reporting people and I report and redshirt.  I strike first, solving relief Mission, and load up into my seeded K&#146;vort and head over to Plasma Streamer, but get stopped. He goes, clears his outpost planet, and he has a Horga&#146;hn!!! Well that pretty much pushes the auto-lose button and He uses his 2nd turn to fly over and blow through my crappy space dilemmas and wins.  FL by 40<br>
<br>
0(-40)<br>
<br>
Highs: Well. I did solve a mission.<br>
Lows: Horga&#146;hn is a beating in Sealed.  Not much I can do against that.<br>
<br>
Well, having gotten the 1st game shoved down my throat, I go take my place at the scrub table and hope I can rally.<br>
<br>
Game 2.  Me (scrub) vs. Andrew Behr<br>
<br>
I dont remember much about this game, other than I kept telling him to slow down because I wanted opportunities to take actions.  I solved Relief Mission in relatively short order and sit and build up and wait for another ship so I can Effectively redshirt Plasma Streamer.  Meanwhile He&#146;s digging for diplomacy because my Q-Net came out and locked him at his outpost.  I get my 2nd ship out and proceed to move over to Plasma Streamer.  He says &quot;As you start to move, i&#146;ll Rogue Borg You.&quot; I point out that RBM is NOT a valid response to Me starting to move and it will have to wait till I&#146;m done moving.  So He RBMs me (argh) and I have to just start redshirting with my other ship, and I clear a couple dilemmas and some random Jabrones die.  On his Turn he palors the RBM, so On my turn he plays it and I tell him I get first action of my turn and use it to attempt with my redshirt crew and clear the last dilemma, while getting blown up in the process (gotta love Cosmic String Fragment), he then RBMs my other ship.  His turn he Finally clears my Q-Net and clears my dilemmas, but left his Stellar Cartography back on the Outpost so they wouildnt die and my last dilemma was Menthar Booby Trap, which, while it didnt stop him, paralyzed his ship because he didnt have 2 Engineer and I take the first action of my next turn to attempt and Win<br>
<br>
FW by 20<br>
<br>
2(-20)<br>
<br>
Highs: I hear Winning is good<br>
Lows: Having to explain timing rules, winning because of his mistake<br>
<br>
So having Won, and also having all my cards there.  I claim the Scrub table as mine for the rest of the sealed Tourney.<br>
<br>
Game 3: Scrub King (me) vs. Dude (sorry man, forgot your name)<br>
<br>
Well this game was easy.  The guy had a 40-odd card draw deck.  I do my usual redshirt thing and Q-Net him on turn 1.  He redshirts his outpost mission and hits my Oops! (one of my 2 random dilemmas) so he starts digging for stuff to pass that.  After another 2 or 3 turns I solve Relief Mission, and he has only managed to find one [Stf] Icon dude and NO leadership... He is reporting Ships and Equipment cards left and right so I guess His people decided to have a party at the bottom of his draw deck.  Having him completely locked down, I leisurely complete Plasma Streamer for the Win.  FW by 50.<br>
<br>
4(+30)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning Big<br>
Lows: His deck messing him up.<br>
Play of the Game: He playing Incoming Message-Romulan on one of my ships stalling me for a turn.<br>
<br>
After the game I helped him go through his deck and eliminate non-essentials and cut his deck in half.<br>
<br>
Game 4: Me vs. Joel Gottke<br>
<br>
Well Having brought myself back to positive differential I am officially out of scrubsville, but I still gotta win.  We start out and I get the 1st turn net again (Q-Net rules!) I for some reason am not drawing any Romulans or Klingons so I just report Feds/NAs and not d omuch.  He solves his OP mission, I finally Mass attempt and get by the dilemmas there.  He is still Digging for Diplomacy, and I set up my redshirts in space.  He gets Riva down and busts through my net but gets stopped and I win on my next turn.<br>
<br>
FW by 20<br>
<br>
6(+50)<br>
<br>
So I end up 5th after the sealed due to my low differential and we break for lunch.  Pizza was good, but the sausage tasted funny, so I ate Ham instead.  Anyway, I make a last minute change swapping a Fed outpost in for my Romulan Outpost so i can seed my outpost at any of my missions.<br>
<br>
[Scenario Tournament]<br>
<br>
After lunch we pair according to the standings after the sealed, and I get paired with John Walchle, one of the MV directors.  But he pulls the scrub move of the day by Forgetting his scenario deck!!!  So he has to run home and get it.  So everyone else starts while i just wander around aimlessly for awhile, not wanting to be accused of scouting decks.  John FINALLY gets back about 40 minutes into the round and we start, with our own hour clock.<br>
<br>
Game 5 (Scenario game 1) <br>
My F/R Hunt for DNA vs. John Walchle&#146;s Pire for Hire<br>
<br>
Well the kooky Mt. Vernon Meta got me again.  Who plays armada nowadays?! I havent played against an armada since Worlds! I start out doing my thing getting guys out, but he sets up lightning quick and parks at DNA with about 30 weapons and starts beating on my terraforming station... I get my crew together and go hit the Barcays Sarjenka combl for a quick 15 then beam down everybody else and cloak the warbird.  His turn he comes down and piks a fight and kills some of my mission specialists.  I retreat to my outpost and try to get a solving crew together.  His turn he finishes off my Terraforming station, so there goes my tech.  I fly back, do the boratus discard thing.  He only has 1 card left while I have 2.  I attempt hit my Horga&#146;hn, my android Nightmares (with no android of course ;o) ) and his dilemma... Denevean Neural Parasites! Dang! so I lose 4 guys and the 3 scrubs I have left cant complete the mission.  We&#146;re starting to run low on time so he leaves my broken and battered crew and, after blowing up my outpost goes over to his part of the line to solve missions.  Well I am WAY behind at this point, but I do palor toff my outpost and rebuild it with Inge Eiger (What a champ!) but I cant report anyone fast enough to catch up.  He solves Relocate settlers for 30, plays the Phoenix, I play the Phoenix at my Continuing committeeso its 40-25.  I oof him for 5 but he solves Refuse Immigration and goes to blow up my phoenix but time ran out JUST (like 2 seconds, literally) before he initiated the battle so he wins 70-25<br>
<br>
FL by 45<br>
<br>
6(+5)<br>
<br>
Highs: um.... no<br>
Lows: Watching John play solitaire at my expense.<br>
<br>
Well the good news is I now get to turn the tables.  In addition I see that Runabout Search is ripe for the stealing so I seed that one lightly.  I give Hunt for DNA all kinds of fun stuff and Do the best I can at the space missions, hoping that it will hold him off.<br>
<br>
Game 6 (Scenario game 2) me playing Pire vs. John playing my scrubbish pile<br>
<br>
The only difference between this game and last is that he seeds his outpost at Pegasus which is right next to wormhole.  He only gives me 12 dilemmas to work with but I know he cant attempt romulus and I dont bother seeding dilemmas at the PNZ at the other end of the spaceline.  If he wants to go ALL the way across the spaceline for 10 points let him.  so I seed 3 at DnA,Wormhole, Pegasus, and Runabout Search.  I get to go first again and I build up the armada almost as fast as he did against me.  His Outpost makes a quick departure after about 7 or 8 turns.  He uses Continuing Committee to get people out.  It soon seems clear that we are both going for Runabout Search but i get my crew there first.  I get stopped by Scientific method.  His Turn he Ventures over, divides his crew evenly, and attampts.  He clears Scientific method but lacks the security for Ferengi Infestation.  I solve next turn for 40 and get the horga&#146;hn that he seeded there.  I then blow up his warbird stranding his 5 people on a planet.   I then proceed to spend my 2nd turn attempting Relocate settlers and getting stopped by Seismic Quake.  He tries to get something going at the Continuing Committee, and He devils my horga&#146;hn but is unable to get anything sicnificant going.  I get 2 Geo Out, clear Seismic Quake and then proceed to solve Relocate Settlers.  I attempt Verify Evidence and get stopped by That TwT dilemma that requires 2 Astro and Trans. Skill  So my next turn I attempt Refuse Immigration and get stopped by scientific method.  I guess thats a popular dilemma or something.  By this time he has built up a small crew but still not enough to go after a mission with and with literally 20 seconds remaining I win, having Downloaded Mardah for my 3rd Science.  FW 100-0<br>
<br>
8(+105)<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning in a big way.<br>
Lows: Man does my deck SUCK!<br>
<br>
So now I&#146;m in 4th place so I get to play the 3rd place guy.  Jared Hoffman and Tim CLaypoole are 1 and 2 right now and if they split their match and I win both of mine I can actually win the day!<br>
<br>
Game 7 (Scenario game 3)<br>
My crappy pile of cards vs. Andrew Behr&#146;s OS/TE funky deck<br>
<br>
We start seeding stuff and he seeds a tribble deck, a Q-Flash, a Tent, and AU door an 2 STPs.  Wow.  After the mission phase we have 2 quadrants and after the dilemma phase we have 2 Time Locations so I am thinking OS Speed that beats the crap out of me.  We start playing and he reports some univ [M] dude to Halkan Council.  He then uses ASP but much to his Chagrin the only Support personnel in his deck is the one he reported 1st turn so I get to see his deck, Tent, and hand.  His deck is nothing unexpected, a lot of cool OS guys, and 4 Lt. Grants! His tent has all the downloadable OS Equipment, another LT. Grant, and 3 Q Flashes.  I scratch my head at this and explain to him that this is illegal.  He gets mad and says he didnt know that all the Q&#146;s tent cards have to be different.  Well, I could get him DQed, but thats not my style.  I tell him to put 2 of them out of play and just keep playing.  My deck works just like it was designed to and I have everything set up on turn 4.  After spending a turn stopping for BPD/Sarjenka I boratus the stuff under Hunt for DNA and only get one of his cards, but it was the parasites :o).  I redshirt with Luither Sloan, and hit Ferengi Infestation, so I build up for a turn with Lovok, Scotty, and The Sisters via a bricklayer download.  I attempt with everybody but my mission specialists, and he swaps his 1 tent flash in for the infestation.. Scotty gets captured by a Bailiff, and Q&#146;s Planet comes out but I get through.  I then tent for a partiucle Fountain and solve with my AMS + Support crew for 100 after the fountain.  I get the Horga&#146;hn and start hiking toward Q&#146;s Planet. (After I tell him it HAS to go in the alpha quadrant.... as I WELL know :oP) He gets one more turn, but his people are too spread out and I clear Q&#146;s Planet the next Turn for the win.  FW 100-0<br>
<br>
10(+205)<br>
<br>
Highs: My deck Working Perfectly<br>
Lows: Beating on a Tournament newbie.  Even though hes a decent player he is unfamiliar with some of the rules changes that have been made.<br>
<br>
So after the game I redefne Hunt for DNA to be Barbering x3 + cantankerousness + FCA + Klingon Intelligence + Cunning &gt;40 :o)<br>
<br>
Game 8 (Scenario Game 4)<br>
<br>
Andrew&#146;s Fed Fun vs. My DNAless Hunt for DNA.<br>
<br>
Having seen his deck I am thinking STP-Drop.  We Get set up and I seed stuff at everything but DNA and Romulus since he cant attempt either.  I spent the first turns Setting up Process Ore at  Mirror Terok Nor and playing Kivases to draw cards.  He gets a crew over to Ag. Assesment and attempts, hitting BPD/Sarjenka.  With only one more card there I figure I&#146;d ttry it so I use the ISS Enterprise to d/l mirror Checkov and Wormhole over to Ag. Assesment and attempt... the seed card is... Horga&#146;hn! So I solve for 30 and use the double turn to draw mad cards... He cant do anything on his next turn and then I Drop USS Constitution with 4 Lt. Grants, Mirror Kirk, A few others who I forget.  Pick up Ensign O&#146;Brien and Lt. Bashir at my Fed OP and Attempt Wormhole... I seeded Lineup there, and I was playing the odds that Checkov wold get picked in the selection.  He did so I continued On, loP. pass, Common thief... Bye Bye Communicator... then, for the play of the Day, I solve Wormhole with FOUR LT. GRANTS!!! (That guy is SUCH a champ!!).  On the double turn I Move next door to pegasus, attempt, Vortex the Borg Ship there, then Clear the Maglock and Win.  FW 100-15<br>
<br>
12(+290)<br>
<br>
So I did my part but unfortunately Jared went 4-0 in the scenario and, having gone 3-1 in sealed, wins.  I finish 2nd.  Tim CLaypoole, who won the sealed, finishes 3rd.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Jared and the MV crew for a great day<br>
Lt. Grant for rocking<br>
The MVNC cafeteria for having AWESOME eggs and hash browns.<br>
All my opponents for a lotta good games<br>
Tim for beating Jared in sealed with a well placed Borg Ship<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
John for leaving his deck at home (Scrub move of the day there :oP)<br>
<br>
Jared for getting a Horga&#146;hn AND Sarek in the Sealed deck.<br>
Me for not being able to build a deck :oP<br>
The Town of Mt. Vernon for the confusing road plan<br>
<br>
Well if you made it this far I&#146;m amazed... congrats on having a higher patience level than most<br>
<br>
Later,<br>
