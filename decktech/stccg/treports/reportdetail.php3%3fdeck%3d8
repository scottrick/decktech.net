<br>
Well, my Mirror, Mirror boxes haven&#146;t arrived yet, so I wasn&#146;t planning on going to Saturday&#146;s tournament. However, for some reason or another I decided to attend anyway, so I was debating between various old decks that I thought would still work. I ended up going with the Federation/Romulan hologram/STP drop/speed deck I played back in November, based on Jason Drake&#146;s Worlds deck. The deck&#146;s virtually identical to the one then, so I won&#146;t repeat the decklist here (e-mail me if you want it). The basic idea? AMS/ASP/DH for four holograms (Dr. Leah, Newton, Einstein, and O&#146;Brien), Kivas for a turn or two, then STP-drop a ship laden with [AU] crew to start going through missions. One of the primary reasons I chose it was that I felt it would do quite well against the new attrition dilemmas, such as Denevan Neural Parasites or A Fast Ship Would Be Nice by giving plenty of hologram targets, or against DRAGS for similar reasons. The missions were chosen such that the four holos could complete any of them with the addition of just one Computer Skill. <br>
<br>
Turnout was excellent, with twenty-one players arriving. <br>
<br>
Anyway, here&#146;s what happened: <br>
<br>
Round 1: Eric Wood (1683 rating) <br>
<br>
Eric&#146;s a strong player who also goes to the University of Washington. He&#146;s played Borg a number of times, but today he was playing a Romulan Sheliak tripper deck. Sheliaks under all of your planets, Borg Ships under each of your space missions, hoping that you&#146;d use up your Temporal Vortices early on, either letting the Sheliaks nuke your planets to zero points or by saving your planets and hitting the Borg Ships in space. The concept actually worked great -- My Future Enterprise and all four holograms were destroyed on the second turn this way. He tripped a Sheliak, so I played the Temporal Vortex from my hand on it. My turn, I attempt a mission, and hit the Borg Ship. Oops. At this point, I knew I had essentially lost. I played a second ship and eventually solved that mission. Meanwhile, his Romulan/Dominion treaty crew went around menacing my Starship Enterprise with a Dominion Battleship until I drew and played The Traveler. I zipped over to the other end of the spaceline and solved a planet mission there. I was redshirting... a good thing, as he was using Garbage Scows as well. That mission was reduced by ten points as I solved it a few turns later. He was delayed by my Chula: the Chandra/Friendly Fire combo while I solved a third mission with a Ressikan Flute to take me to an 85-30 lead. Unfortunately, I made a major playing error and got snagged by an Edo Probe before I could solve that mission.. The turn after the Friendly Fire went away, he solved two Collect Samples (one where the Fire was, the other where he found a Dead End), which took him into a lead by five points. Time was called soon after. Modified loss, 90-85. Cumulative: 0 (-5) <br>
<br>
Ick. That&#146;s not a fun way to start your day, but I was impressed by how well the deck could solve missions even without the holograms. Of course, Eric&#146;s combos consisted mostly of Borg Ships, Sheliaks, Edo Probes, and FLI/RGS, so it wasn&#146;t really a true test of its mission-solving mettle. And I wasn&#146;t too happy about the whole Edo Probe thing... if you face an Edo, you&#146;d think I would at least check to make sure I could *solve* that mission. I&#146;m just not used to worrying about mission requirements in this deck, what with the holograms and all. It never crossed my mind that I was lacking both Newton *and* Einstein&#146;s Physics, especially since I have several others in the deck (one of whom was killed by a DRAGS, the other being in my hand). And those ten points cost me the game... :-( <br>
<br>
Game 2: vs. Patrick Dilley (?) (1431)<br>
<br>
I had played him with the same deck a few tournaments ago, winning 100-0 quickly. At first it appeared he was playing the same Cardassian/Romulan deck, as the first few missions were Intelligence Operation, Cloaked Mission, Orb Negotiations, and Alter Records. However, as soon as Espionage Mission and Expose Covert Supply came out, I knew he was playing Borg. Personally, I wouldn&#146;t risk going unbalanced as Borg (a 50-point deficit is just too much to make up). And even though I didn&#146;t have an Act or I Tried to Warn You, he ended up getting the short end of the stick by doing that. I only had one space-only dilemma -- a Cytherians, which in hindsight I should have self-seeded instead of misseeded -- while he was restricted to Assimilate Homeworlds or mission theft to scout objectives. It turned out he was playing an assimilation-based deck meant to be more fun than competitive, snatching a planet or two from the opponent before doing a homeworld for the win. <br>
<br>
I got off to a quick start, scoring fifty points from Explore Dyson Sphere, two mission specialists, and a Cosmic String Fragment. He seeded Undetected Beam-Ins and Borg Servos, but my holograms severely limited his choice of would-be drones. I ended up STP-ing the Future E back to my hand after emptying it of all my personnel, retrieving my assimilated Ian Andrew Troi while sending four drones to his hand. At this point, he flipped Add Distinctiveness and opened a pack of First Contact. He got a few drones (Dr. Royse and Inge Eiger, I believe) and a couple of other miscellaneous cards. He also kept playing Nightmares, which was annoying, but not very harmful. After the second-turn STP drop, my hand size was never more than three or four cards, meaning I was just a Tent away from nullifying his Nightmare. He played another, but it had little effect as well. I ended up going through the dilemmas at Cargo Rendezvous to win 100-4 (the points were from Add Distinctiveness for assimilated drones). 2 (+96), cumulative 2 (+91). Oh, and one other note: he was the first player to flip It&#146;s Only a Game on me, limiting my STP-drop to four personnel. Nobody else had, and it wasn&#146;t uncommon for me to drop eight or nine personnel at a time with the STP. But still, five free cards gives a huge advantage that&#146;s undoubtedly worth it. <br>
<br>
Game 3: vs. Toby Smith  (1512)<br>
<br>
I&#146;ve played Toby several times before, and each time he tried to get a Red Alert! to work. The first time I Examine Singularity-Deactivated it, and the second time my Dominion smackdown force killed all the RA personnel anyway. This time, however, I didn&#146;t have a counter. It&#146;s Only a Game would be counterproductive, and I didn&#146;t know if anybody would risk it still. I didn&#146;t stock a Spacedoor either, another standard anti-Red Alert! tactic. He didn&#146;t stock IOAG though, so I matched his five or six personnel and ships with a free ship and about seven personnel. His downfall was that he didn&#146;t start attempting missions right away. With the personnel he had out, he could have at least solved one mission. I, on the other hand, went after missions immediately, earning another quick win. 2 (+100), cumulative 4 (+191) <br>
<br>
Game 4: vs. Tigh Bradley (1616)<br>
<br>
Tigh&#146;s sense of humor goes along well with mine, so our games are always fun. I can&#146;t remember any specific jokes from this game, though. (It was nearly two weeks ago, after all). Anyway, he was playing a standard Bajoran Return Orb to Bajor deck. I out-seeded one of his Orbs, but he still got a few in under my nose. My deck worked as normal, Kivas-ing for two turns and STP-dropping the Future Enterprise. Tigh attempted Bajor and uncovered a Sheliak/Dead End combo... where his Deep Space 9 also happened to be. The Sheliak would have hit in two turns, but I won a turn earlier, suspending play with Q the Ref to download an Intermix Ratio to cancel his fifteen bonus points. 2 (+100), cumulative 6 (+291) <br>
<br>
I ended up in second, which has happened both times I&#146;ve played this deck, and both times it was a first-round loss that did me in. I&#146;m still kicking myself over that Edo Probe thing. Oh well. I couldn&#146;t ask for much more with a deck that&#146;s an expansion old. Carlin Jacobson ended up winning, with Jacob Edwards-King placing third. Carlin and Jacob were both playing Klingon AMS/STP-drop speed decks. Hmmm, that STP-drop speed thing seemed to work pretty well, taking (at least) the top three spots in a tournament of twenty-one. I suppose it just goes to show that speed still rules here in the Northwest, and that the game&#146;s still all about drawing cards, playing them, and attempting missions fast -- and there&#146;s hardly a better free-report mechanism than STP-dropping. Let&#146;s just say I&#146;m stocking It&#146;s Only a Game for the next tournament. <br>
