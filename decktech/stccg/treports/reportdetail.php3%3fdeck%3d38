This might seem quite a low number, but then again we&#146;ve only been holding tournaments since November last year, and it&#146;s only now that we&#146;re becoming at all regular about it. <br>
<br>
Our eighth player finally pitched at 10:30, and play began pretty much immediately. I hadn&#146;t had much time to build a deck, but I played a game against one of my friends the week before, and I just kept the deck that I used then. It was a Romulan mission solver, using Compromised Mission (50 with AMS), and Covert Installation (45 with AMS) to avoid The Big Picture. In my tent I had the Phoenix and a Colony, and if necessary, I could solve any of my other missions for a minimum of 40 points with AMS. For speed I had the usual dual-headquarters and STAs, plus Kivas Fajo - Collector for extra draws. I also seeded a Magic Carpet Ride OCD at Compromised Mission to use in case I was out of range, and I was using Senior Staff Meeting to make my life a bit easier at Compromised Mission.<br>
<br>
My rating, off just eight games prior to this, was 1590.<br>
<br>
Round One vs. Rethea Deetlefs (rating: 1469)<br>
I won the flip and got to go first. Rethea laid down an obviously Fed spaceline (Repair Mission, Sensitive Search, Explore Dyson Sphere etc.). I noticed her self seeding early on at a mission II with outpost, so I seeded my Dead End combo there.<br>
<br>
The deck worked pretty much perfectly - by turn three I had 10-12 personnel on the table and I solved Compromised Mission and Covert Installation in the same turn. I had a bit of difficulty drawing Q&#146;s Tents, however (I had Masaka&#146;ed two out of three to the bottom of my deck), so I went on to solve Cloaked Mission to win.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+100)<br>
Cumulative: 2 (+100)<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, I found out after the game that the artifact I had stopped Rethea from getting at her outpost mission was Tox Uthat - she was planning on unbalancing me and then hitting me with Balancing Act.<br>
<br>
Three people won their games 100-0, so I moved on up to table two for the next round.<br>
<br>
Round Two vs. Warren Cramer (rating: 1484)<br>
Warren&#146;s rating belies the fact that he has beaten me more than anyone else here. I&#146;m sure that it&#146;ll get higher as he plays more games. As we sit down, I&#146;m ready to see what surprise Warren has in store for me this time.<br>
<br>
Turns out he&#146;s playing a balanced PNZ deck. We duplicate the Romulan homeworld and Covert Installation. I know I have to get a quick start, so on turn two I attempt Compromised Mission. I remove Hippocratic Oath with SSM and then get caught by an Aphasia DeviceTarrelian Plague Ship combo. No matter, I can regenerate on the next turn, and I should be able to get my personnel out pretty fast again. On his turn he attempts one of his PNZs and loses ten to my Edo ProbeBorg Ship combo (not to mention all of his personnel). The next turn I tent for and play Regenerate. A couple of turns later, I manage to solve Compromised Mission for 50 and then steal his (now dilemma-less) PNZ for the win.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+100)<br>
Cumulative: 4 (+200)<br>
<br>
I&#146;m getting more confident now, as I know that the deck can recover from losing lots of personnel to dilemmas. I&#146;m now tied for first with Shaun Kennedy, who is also on 4 (+200). The next game is likely to determine the outcome of the tournament, as well as the winner of one of the tournament foils.<br>
<br>
Round Three vs. Shaun Kennedy (Rating: 1581)<br>
Shaun is the only person in the country who has been playing ST:CCG longer than me, and the competition between us has always been tight. No pressure ;-).<br>
<br>
He wins the flip and seeds first. His first mission is universal space. So is the next, and the next after that. I&#146;m getting a sneaking suspicion... yes - Diplomatic Conference hits the table not long after, and I know he&#146;s playing some or the other variant of Vorgon&#146;s Paradise. I seed Dead End under Diplomatic Conference and The Higher... the Fewer under his other planet mission, so that he won&#146;t have 50 points once he&#146;s solved it.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for him, he doesn&#146;t have enough self-seeds (only two for each mission) to use Ajur/Boratus, so he has to encounter both The Higher... The Fewer and Dead End. THTF takes him down to 37 off his first mission, and he has no other way to score points, so he&#146;s stuck. He tries stealing one of mine, but a quick QtR download of Fair Play puts a stop to that.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I&#146;ve solve Compromised Mission and Covert Installation, but Edo Probe and The Higher... the Fewer force me to solve Cloaked Mission. His dilemmas slow me down for a few turns, but I win on about turn 8.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+63)<br>
Cumulative: 6 (+263)<br>
<br>
I&#146;m now firmly in the lead, with Shaun next closest to me, and I won&#146;t be playing him again. I&#146;ll just have to keep it up against my next two opponents. That Q&#146;s Tent just keeps getting shinier ;-).<br>
<br>
Round Four vs. Craig Gainsborough-Waring (rating: 1500)<br>
Craig is playing one of my decks - this is his first tournament, but he&#146;s doing well so far. His only loss is to Shaun, which puts him in third place.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately he isn&#146;t confident enough to start attempting missions early, which was really his only hope of beating me. I gather it has something to do with the same dilemmas combos which damaged me in the last game. The deck works exactly as planned, although his Mission Debriefing slows me down a bit. I manage the full win on turn 9.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+100)<br>
Cumulative: 8 (+363)<br>
<br>
Shaun managed a 100-0 win in the last game, but even if he wins the next one 100-0 and I lose 100-0 my differential is still high enough for me to win.<br>
<br>
Round Five vs. Jarred Cramer (rating: 1436)<br>
Jarred is playing his second tournament today, although I know he has been playing against his brother (Warren Cramer - see round 2) for a number of years. My memory is hazy, but IIRC, he was playing a Klingon mission solver.<br>
<br>
I remember being slowed down by a rather large pile of dilemmas under Compromised Mission, but not much else. I think I lost points to Edo Probe and solved Compromised Mission, Covert Installation and Cloaked Mission. He didn&#146;t get past the Dead End combo at his outpost mission, so I won 100-0.<br>
<br>
Score: 2 (+100)<br>
Cumulative: 10 (+463)<br>
<br>
Complete score listings and deck breakdown:<br>
<br>
1. Fritz Meissner	10 (+463) - Romulan speed<br>
2. Shaun Kennedy	 8 (+337) - Vorgon&#146;s Paradise<br>
3. Craig Waring		 6 (+ 45) - Fed mission solver<br>
4. Warren Cramer	 5 (+ 45) - Romulan PNZ<br>
5. Rethea Deetlefs 	 4 (- 50) - Fed SupernovaBalancing Act<br>
6. Jarred Cramer	 3 (-120) - Klingon mission solver (I think)<br>
7. John van Rensburg	 2 (-220) - Klingon armada<br>
8. Terry Nicole		 0 (-500) - Bajoran mission solver<br>
<br>
Post-tournament ramblings: The standards of play are really rising here. Any of these decks could probably have won a few months ago. It was certainly a big surprise to see a PNZ deck only coming<br>
in at fourth - Shaun won our first tournament with an almost identical deck (perhaps even a bit slower) last year. <br>
<br>
I was also very surprised to see someone new like Craig doing so well - three full wins; his only losses were to Shaun and myself. He even knew what Rethea was trying to do with the Tox Uthat and uxed it before she could take him out of the game with Balancing Acts. <br>
<br>
I&#146;m really pleased with how the deck turned out - I haven&#146;t ever played with it seriously, since it was always too simple for my liking. This one may become my favourite now that my old BoylesDrake style holo-deck is out of action. One thing that interested me - not once was I troubled by Dead End at Compromised Mission. I think most people were seeding them at the homeworld - HQ: Secure Homeworld was always my first seed in the dilemma phase, just for that purpose. There are still a couple of things I need to test this deck out against, though - one is point denial; I&#146;d have to solve my missions before Hero goes off. Another weakness I have is battle - my only ships were a Decius and D&#146;Deridex Advanced, although I was seeding Engage Cloak, and I could always hide at my homeworld (plenty of HAs that I could pretend might be another DHW).<br>
<br>
I think that about wraps it up now. If you have any questions or comments, email me at meissn@mweb.co.za<br>
