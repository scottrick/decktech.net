I, being one of 5 SoCal representatives (and the only one from San Diego), had come seeking to surprise our NoCal neighbors, and collectively, SoCal ended up taking 3 of the top 5 places. But how did it end?? Read on, fellow Decktechers...<br>
<br>
Jeremy Commandeur (to whom I am most grateful for providing transportation for me) is an Ambassador serving the Bay Area; he was the tournament organizer for the State Championships. He ran a very fair, above-board tournament, and all the players were grateful for his services. Before he announced our initial pairings, he notified us that, as a World-Championship level event, all the newest regulations from that Tournament FAQ and Code of Conduct would be strictly enforced. We began with our initial pairings, and with my Star Wars CCG mascot in tow (Figrin D&#146;an of course), I sat down to face my first opponent...<br>
<br>
Round 1: Ray Liu (1429) Klingon Blood Oath/Great Hall<br>
<br>
Ray is a student at Berkeley, and recently spent his Spring Break in San Diego with his family; while visiting, he found the time to play in one of my local tournaments. After groaning about the prospect of playing me, Ray began counting out his seed cards, as did I, and we began.<br>
<br>
I brought my tried and true Council of Bloody Referees deck, but with a slight twist. I added Mining Survey to the mission lineup, and seeded Empok Nor there. I also added IKC Gr&#146;oth, which I used to download Kras. With an Acquisition personnel on the table (usually on the first turn), I would Tent for a 34th Rule of Acquisition, and proceed to take potshots at Empok. This would result in 2 free draws a turn (at least one of which I could convert with Blood Oath).<br>
<br>
I got off to a good start, drawing Koloth in my opening hand. The deck proceeded normally, and I saw that Ray was using a Q-Flash side deck. I briefly gave pause to the possibilities therein, and after getting a good-sized crew on the table, I commandeered Empok, scanned with SciLab, and attempted Mining Survey. After making it through a Flash with -4 points to a Mandarin Bailiff, and Quark Son of Keldar in the Penalty Box, I scored for 45 points (Kromm as an MS helping there). Ray struggled to get his people out quick, attacking my ships briefly. After I had commandeered Empok, I simply parked my ships there and figured he wouldn&#146;t come attack me. Ray ended up scoring a mission for 30 points, but my personnel were quicker, and cleaned up 2 more missions (plus a Cytherians and REM Fatigue) for the win. 2(+66)<br>
<br>
Props: <br>
Ray, for an excellent game and actually having FUN in the process!<br>
My deck, for actually cooperating for once!<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Poke kids, for making lots of noise next door during Pokemon League<br>
Colds, and me for having one at a championship event :P<br>
<br>
Round 2: David Young (1408) Premiere Feds (KFC x10, then Red Alert!)<br>
<br>
I could tell David hadn&#146;t played for quite some time, when he seeded 24(!) under my missions. No hidden agendas, no seeded Objectives/Incidents, just STP, Q-Flash, AU Door, Q&#146;s Tent, Fed Outpost and Spacedoor. As I downloaded carte blache, he simply played Trek from 5 years ago, play and draw. I went after missions quickly, running into a few snags from his Flash (another Bailff) while he tried to get out personnel, but overall, a simple match. 2(+100), cumulative 4(+166)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
David, for making me work through 3-dilemma combos + a Flash each time. Oy...<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Other players, for being really loud (&quot;C&#146;mon man, hurry up or else, I&#146;LL SEED FOR YOU!&quot;)<br>
<br>
Round 3: Dan Mochizuki (1768) Romulan Tal Shiar/Continuing Committee<br>
<br>
I had never played Dan before, and actually had put the name with the wrong face in the past. After sitting down and counting seed decks, we began. It quickly became clear that Dan was playing Romulans, and the battle was joined. The quintessential battle of Klingons/Romulans. <br>
<br>
Dan Kivased fairly early (which I Mirrored of course), and proceeded to get his crew set fairly quickly with Telak&#146;s help, plus a couple Soong-Type Androids (and Data and Picard). I matched his speed, but went for a more poetic approach, and waited for my Q&#146;s Tent to retreive the Council of Warriors. This turned out to be my downfall of the match. Dan played a Q&#146;s Tent on his turn to retreive John Doe, and I knew what was coming. <br>
<br>
He boarded his people on a D&#146;deridex Adv. and Full Planet Scanned Romulus. I did not respond with the usual Panel Overload/Scanner Interference, since John Doe would have saved whoever was killed. Alas, I did not have any Amandas in hand, so he got a sneak peek. He repeated this process at Covert Installation. After solving 2 missions, I knew I had better get my rear in gear, and sent the Klingons attempting Secret Salvage II with Council of Warriors present. I ended up scoring it, and after a 1 point loss from ANOTHER Bailiff, I had 24. His Terix had hit my Conundrum, and was on its way to face down IKC Gr&#146;oth. After some backup arrived, Terix was put down. 7 points for me (yay!). <br>
<br>
Dan then sent Telak to solve Q&#146;s Planet quickly (it had come out during the Flash), and Mission Debriefing was on the table, so Telak was stopped. This gave my beefy Klingons an opportunity for some more points.Telak was worth 9, bringing me to an even 40. On his next turn, Dan solved Investigate Anomaly II, which gave him enough points to win. 0(-60), cumulative 4(+106)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Dan, for being the best opponent I&#146;ve known with decent playing skills and not being a jerk!<br>
Tumek, for becoming an android (Q-type Android, which let me traverse Dan&#146;s Paxan &quot;Wormhole&quot;)<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, for playing sloppily and taking unecessary time and effort to get Council of Warriors out<br>
<br>
Round 4: Garrhet Noda (1501) Borg Pop 9 Billion<br>
<br>
Garrhet is one of my SoCal regulars, and the only other SoCal player I faced all day. Garrhet has an intimate knowledge of my deck (he&#146;s faced it at least 3 times before), and he was confident that his Borg would be safe from my marauding Klingons. Turns out he was right. Garrhet seeded Quash Conspiracy, which I thought odd for a Borg player, but it turned out that with a Cube parked there, I couldn&#146;t beam aboard! I resigned myself to solving missions, since I figured he would stay there for the entire match.<br>
<br>
I couldn&#146;t draw a Q&#146;s Tent in the early game, so I changed gears and commandeered Empok instead, benefitting from Promenade Shops and Guest Quarters. After scanning in the SciLab, I discovered a Borg Ship seeded first. I amassed the fleet (including IKC Negh&#146;var) at Empok, and after Ops downloading Martok, attempted Mining Survey. WEAPONS 56 plus Picard Maneuver as the Tactic was enough to score the 45 points. Garrhet had also seeded 2 universal Space missions, and Tented early for a Black Hole, which was chewing up the right side of the spaceline (Mining Survey was nearer to the left). I scanned again with SciLab, and discovered Cytherians as the last dilemma. I sent one damaged ship to face Cytherians, then solved to bring me to 85 points. <br>
<br>
Garrhet finally got to the last dilemma on Earth, after having targeted Locutus and Earth with Assimilate Homeworld. His drone flips the last dilemma, Q. This basically could have won me the game, since I got to arrange for my Cytherianed crew to arrive and score 15. Garrhet suspended play to download Oof! on me, since I had Amandaed an early Change of Plans. Grr. Only 95. The Cytherianed crew had happened to be at A Good Day to Live when the Q hit. On my next turn, they beamed down and attempted. After grinding through a few dilemmas (and a well-placed Distortion of Space/Time Continuum), I managed to score the 50 points with all 4 Blood Oath personnel present right before Jeremy called time. 2(+100), cumulative 6(+206)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Garrhet, for that great Quash hiding place!<br>
Science Lab, for giving a great advantage (and letting you know when to use SSM)<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Black Hole, for sucking. Oh wait, never mind...<br>
<br>
After this round, a 45-minute dinner break was called. My SoCal buddies and I headed to a local pizza parlor and discussed strategies I might use to defeat my next opponent...<br>
<br>
Round 5: Franklin Kenter (1820) Federation Q-Bypass<br>
<br>
Franklin is best known in the Bay Area for cultivating his cheesy decks. I knew I had the upper hand deckwise, seeding Hide and Seek, as well as having Mission Debriefing to be downloaded to table with Make It So. However, Franklin has played in a few more high-stakes tournaments than I, and as such, has mastered the art of psycholgical warfare against an opponent. I was not completely unprepared for this, but it turned out to be the weight that tipped the balance in our match.<br>
<br>
Franklin knew just how much time to &quot;ponder&quot; his plays in the seed phase. He seeded 3 Q&#146;s; as well as an additional seed under one, which I figured to be a Hor&#146;gahn, Flute, or perhaps a Tox Uthat. During the play phase, he also bordered on stalling more than once; I considered calling Jeremy to caution him, but instead, attempted to appeal to Franklin&#146;s good senses. A futile attempt, but I said something at least three times.<br>
<br>
Franklin breezed through his own Q, which I responded to with Hide and Seek. I saw the dilemmas that were seeded there by me were not in the order I had wanted. Whoops. I had accidently swapped the adjacent mission&#146;s final dilemma with this one&#146;s. He passed my stuff easily, and picked up his Magic Carpet Ride OCD. He relocated himself to my Good Day to Live, and did not have enough RANGE left to make it to Wormhole Negotiations (he had towed a Scow earlier). I had forgotten to use my Make It So to get out Mission Debriefing, which I did at the next available time.<br>
<br>
I started thinking to myself: what if I got to Wormhole Negotiations first? The only thing that could save him was HQ: Defensive Measures, but even so, I could at least try to get over there. I tried desperately to get a Tent in hand (cycled with Q the Ref, downloaded Obelisk to download Masaka), but to no avail. I didn&#146;t have enough RANGE to get over there either. I moved as far as I could, and on his next turn, he solved to make his score 80.<br>
<br>
I flew my ships over to destroy his Starship Enterprise; he returned it to hand with STP, which I then responded to by downloading Scorched Hand via QtR. He basically had to start over, and the match was mine for the taking. He has 1-2 dilemmas at each of my missions, so I started attempting. Ferengi Bugs everywhere. Dumb, but effective at stopping crews/ATs. I managed to only finish one mission before time was called. 0(-55), cumulative 6(+151)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Franklin, for teaching me about creative use of time to deny your opponent the chance to win<br>
Me, for being the only player to make Franklin time out for the win<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Me, for many mental errors that cost me the game<br>
Franklin, for thinking that Q-bypass would do well in States (and being right)<br>
<br>
Round 6: Dan Hamman (1659) Borg Pop 9 Billion<br>
<br>
Dan was another kind and courteous player from the Bay Area (I think), and we sat down for the final match of the day, excluding the final confrontation. I hadn&#146;t seen his deck in action, but had overheard him saying something in a previous match about &quot;all Federation cards in all decks are placed out of play&quot; and hearing only silence from his opponent.<br>
<br>
The match was fairly straightforward: I commandeered Empok, awaiting the Borg intruders, while busting through dilemma combos and solving 2 missions for 75 points; one of them was his Pegasus Search. Dan got Earth cleared, then suspended Assimilate Homeworld with Stop First Contact. After a bad probe, he successfully changed history (incidentally, the only human in my deck was Jodmos, who had died earlier). He tried to finish Establish Gateway on his Pegasus Search, but after a bad probe, I finished up another mission on the next turn for the win. 2(+60) cumulative 8(+211)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Dan, for being a true diplomat and gentleman<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
None!<br>
<br>
All in all, I scored 3rd place, with Franklin and Dan Mochizuki taking 1st and 2nd. Garrhet and Brian Schmitzer (another SoCal player), took 4th and 5th. After the final confrontation, Dan Mochizuki was pronounced the 2001 California State Champion. Thanks to Jeremy for a great tournament, and to all my opponents, especially Dan; I&#146;ll be seeing you Day 2 at DecipherCon.<br>
