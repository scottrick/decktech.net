<br>
Don’t go broke playing in a sealed deck event! Try out Magi-Nation Duel for free! Saturday morning at FreedomCon kick back and take a break to learn about Magi-Nation Duel. Magi-Nation Duel is a game about magical duels. Each player controls a group of three Magi. These Magi cast Spells, conjure up Dream Creatures, and use Relics to beat the other group of Magi. Defeat all of the Magi that oppose you, and you win!<br>
<br>
After the morning tournament take your free deck, trade some cards with a few friends, and compete in a constructed tournament that afternoon!  <br>
<br>
The people at Interactive Imagination have really come through to support FreedomCon. If Magi-Nation Duel is half as cool as the people at Interactive Imagination that helped to make FreedomCon a success then expect to have a blast! <br>

Thanks guys!<hr>Ronald Fonck said on Tue Nov 13 2001 <br>Magi-Nation is a cool game.  Be sure to try it when you go.  The game has some really good artwork and great game play.<hr>Hayes said on Tue Nov 13 2001 <br>it is a cool game, so be sure to support our sponsor!<hr>Dan Tibbles said on Tue Nov 13 2001 <br>I hope all of you enjoy learning and playing Magi-Nation. I have spent the last year and a half designing expansions for it as its Lead Designer.  Before that I was an avid Star Wars player (and I still am when I have the time). I was running Star Wars tournaments way back during A New Hope and I have run and played in many sanctioned events over the last six years. It is one of the most enjoyable CCGs ever, and these days I miss not having the time to play it more often. I hope all of you have a great time. Good luck to everyone, especially to all of my Northwest friends who will be attending. If you have the time, I hope you give our game a quick try; it'll only take you a couple of minutes. If you are one of the people who, like me, could not attend FreedomCon, I hope you have fun at one of your local Decipher weekends. I know I'll be having fun giving Lord of the Rings a try this Saturday. And thanks to the guys here at DeckTech.net for stepping up to the plate for all of the players out there.<hr>neal said on Tue Nov 13 2001 <br>thanks dan, you rule.
