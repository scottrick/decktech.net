<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>FreedomCon Sideboard Events for Star Wars posted by DeckTech on Fri Nov 9 2001 <br>Star Wars players, FreedomCon is a unique convention where you get to choose what tournaments you want. This is accomplished through the innovative FreedomCon Sideboard Gaming, which is continuous throughout the entire weekend.<br>
<br>
Each day players that want to volunteer to run a side event the next day can submit their idea for that side event, just pick up a side event application at the FreedomCon HQ and turn it back in before 9 PM that day. At 9:30 PM all the additional side events that are approved for the next day will be listed on the FreedomCon Sideboard with all the other regularly scheduled side events. The FreedomCon Sideboard is a white board with all the side event details located in the HQ area. Prizes will even be available for these side events!<br>
<br>
Any side event organizer who runs an approved successful side event (lasts more than an hour and more than 7 players participating excluding the director) will receive a commemorative FreedomCon t-shirt as a thank you for helping to make FreedomCon a blast!<br>
<br>
