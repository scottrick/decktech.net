<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>We Are On Our Way! posted by David on Tue Nov 13 2001 <br>Just a quick note to let people know we are heading out in a few hours to go to FreedomCon. <br>
<br>
For those of you who are coming I'll see you soon! Neal Razi will be posting FreedomCon updates througout the weekend so if anything news worthy pops up you will be able to read about it right here. <br>
<br>
Also, if your playing in the Star Wars Open on Friday, consider coming to the Deck Clinic on Thursday night. You will be able to get some one-on-one time with top players like Brian Hunter, Clint Hayes, Hayes Hunter, Steven Lewis, Bastian Winkelhaus, Scott Lingrell ond others. They can help tweak your decks into fine tuned machines. <br>
<br>
Just some quick tips, call to confirm your reservation before you start heading out, it's no fun having to wait in the lobby while they prepare a room for you. <br>
<br>
And don't forget to bring any Raw Deal or other card games you have, in case you want to try one of the alternate side events!<br>
<br>
See you there!<br>
<br>
