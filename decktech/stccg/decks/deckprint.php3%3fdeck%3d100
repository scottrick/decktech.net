I have the Hide and Seeks just in case of Q Bypass, i have the Thermal Deflectors in case of DRGS. I could add a QTR, but i dont know why i should, i mean what Ref cards are good for stopping abuse?<br>
<br>
As for another outpost, if an armada does blow up my outpost...I dont think stocking another Fed outpost is going to make a difference, they would just blow that upto. besides thats what the STP is for(An alternate way of bringing my people out, thats why there are 4 AU ships.)Also another way of getting Dr.Soong out that i might not have mentioned is through Establish relations...Where i can Dl him after i complete it.  I may add a Traveler for card drawing, i dont see the point of adding 2 or 3 Kivas&#146;s but i think that maybe if i did i would get the cards faster for the Drop, so i may actually do that.  I think the deck will move fast though, give it a chance before you rate bad. <br>

----------------------------------------------------------<br>
Well the strategy is basic at best. You try to solve missions! Ok besides that, you have the STP drops to get your AU people out of your deck (half your deck is consisted of AU characters.) <br>
<br>
I know the whole STP thing has been done to hell, but it is one thing the Federation can rely on. Make sure you protect Riva and Maxwell, as your AMS specialist they are going to give you an extra 10 points when completing missions such as Establish Relations and Study Hole in Space. <br>
<br>
Use the ASP to bring Sarek out from your Q-tent, this will give you 5 diplomacy first turn...Enough if you wish to try for Wormhole Negotiations. With 5 Q-Tents in your deck you have a 1/8 chance of getting one on your first turn, which you could either use to get the GTTT and bring out Admiral Riker to get out the Starship Enterprise to bring out Kirk to bring out Captains Log...Or you could get Dr.Soong down and start ploppin out 2 Soong Type Androids a turn. <br>
<br>
If you find your opponent moving to quick, (Though this deck should be moving pretty quick) You can always Tent for the Q-planet to slow your opponent down a bit...Now i put Q Gets the Point in my tent for a reason, you need two treachery or Mortal Q to get past (of course your opponent could always use a Q2) The thing is, if your opponent is Federation where are they going to get the treachery? That should slow them down for a turn or two to keep going for your own missions. <br>
<br>
There are tons of things you can do with this deck, especially with the Q-Flashes and such...Plus the fact with Voyager coming out the STP drops can be used to get you in the DQ. <br>
<br>
Thanks for reading<br>
