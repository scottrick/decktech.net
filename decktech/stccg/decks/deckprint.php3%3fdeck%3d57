<br>
How the seed deck works:<br>
<br>
First Turn<br>
<br>
Play any personnel who reports for free<br>
Use DH for Kira to Terok Nor<br>
Use AMS to DL Narik &amp; Dr. Farek<br>
Use Ops to DL Stolen Attack Ship<br>
Walk Kira to the Stolen Attack Ship<br>
Use Make it So to DL a Ready Room Door which will DL Captain&#146;s Log.<br>
Place the Ready Room Door atop your deck.<br>
<br>
Second turn<br>
<br>
Play any free people<br>
Use Spacedoor to DL a breen warship from your Q&#146;s tent<br>
Use ASP to DL Lam (from Tent)<br>
Start moving each ship toward opponent<br>
Draw the RRD at end of turn<br>
<br>
Third Turn<br>
<br>
Play any free people<br>
QIR for 10 &amp; 01 and play them<br>
Use 10 &amp; 01 to DL the Bynars Weapon Enhancement. <br>
Use the RRD for Thot Gor to the breen warship, and place the RRD on Captains Log<br>
Attack opponent&#146;s ship/outpost or continue moving closer.<br>
<br>
The way it all comes together is:<br>
<br>
Breen Warship 10 + Stolen Attack ship 8 + Captain&#146;s Log 6 + Bynars Weapon Enhancement 4 + Thot Gor Bonus 4 + Tactic Bonus 4 OR 5 = 36 (or 37 if Quantum torp)<br>
<br>
Ways to deal with Defend Homeworld:<br>
<br>
Most people assume armadas died with the introduction of Defend Homeworld. Not so true... With this deck, those two ships should be able to outgun most any ship, and you can&#146;t dock at a homeworld, so bye bye....<br>
<br>
Ways to beat a Speed Deck:<br>
<br>
Let them attempt a mission and hopefully be stopped. Move to the nearest mission they can attempt, so when they go there, you can outgun them before they attempt. Worked well against a klingon speed solver capturing 14 personnel on the IKC Fek&#146;Lhr (Zaphod&#146;s Deck)<br>
Also, use the Big Picture to make a deck focusing on one type, to have to do another mission.<br>
<br>
If you play a deck that is hiding in one quadrant, then just try and do missions faster.<br>
(Read my article on cardassians.)<br>
<br>
How this deck works against popular decks and armada magic bullet cards:<br>
<br>
Q-Net - Kevin Ux<br>
<br>
Regenerate - Kevin Ux<br>
<br>
Supernova - Kevin Ux<br>
<br>
Anti Time Anamoly - Kevin Ux<br>
<br>
Senior Staff Meeting - Mandy Rogers<br>
<br>
Going to the top - Mandy Rogers<br>
<br>
The Devil - Mandy Rogers and Turrel<br>
<br>
VCM/STP Drop - It&#146;s only a game<br>
<br>
Colony abuse - Wake of the Borg<br>
<br>
Cytherian shuffle/ Bonus pt. cheese - Intermix Ratio<br>
<br>
Q - Bypass - You should be able to tell if they&#146;re bypassing, so if they are, then seed Hide and Seek face down, and just the appearance of Guest Quarters and Quark&#146;s Bar will scare them.<br>
<br>
Temporal Rifts - AU Door and amanda<br>
<br>
Revolving Door - Kevin ux and AU Door<br>
<br>
Mission stealing - Fair Play<br>
<br>
Denevan Neural Parasites - The Disruptor Rifle and you shouldn&#146;t attempt with everyone.<br>
<br>
Battle decks - You should be quicker and stronger<br>
<br>
Wormhole vacation - Operate Wormhole Relays<br>
<br>
As for your dilemmas:<br>
<br>
Seed the dead ends at opposite ends of the spaceline.<br>
<br>
The cytherians work great since they;ll most likeley have to pass your territory and you can destroy them.<br>
<br>
The altonian brain teaser combo is great since it makes alot of decks have to go for that third or fourth mission, plus if MLI or ABT pick the right people, then the plague ship can be devastating. <br>
<br>
I played this deck at a tournament and went undefeated with 3 100-0 wins, 1 100 - 25 win, and 1 timed win of 60 - 35. So I finished <br>
9(+400) out of 5 rounds, not too shabby.<br>
<br>
Armadas will Survive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Cardassians will too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
