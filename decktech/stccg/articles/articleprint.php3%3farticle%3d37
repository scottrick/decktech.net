Its not entirely Decipher&#146;s fault, by creating the exclusive foils that infuriated collectors, the tons of new expansions at a time then one long hiatus, the lack of STCCG news on the website, getting banned from the BBS, way late release dates, late ratings updates, etc, etc. Sometimes its not the person&#146;s fault, its that they have family or work dedication, can&#146;t afford it, don&#146;t have time, no people to play with, no tournaments locally, too young, etc.etc. Here&#146;s the part that is the person&#146;s fault: <br>
<br>
Just because you can&#146;t acquire one stupid foil is no reason to quit this - if you REALLY need to get one, just buy it off of e-bay!<br>
<br>
Tournaments are too far away, would have to drive over an hour or two to get there - Make the time for the drive, spend some extra money on the gas. If you can&#146;t drive try to become friendly with a person/player who can and just go with them, not too hard. I get to all my tournies via another player, haven&#146;t drove to a single one, yet I&#146;ve played over 100 tourney games.<br>
<br>
Can&#146;t afford it - Drop another hobby or expense you have. If STCCG is the only thing occupying your money, you should be able to afford it.<br>
<br>
Too young to keep up - IMO, Age is entirely irrelevant in this game, especially. It may seem hard at first and very complex , but if you don&#146;t give up, you will grasp it eventually. You&#146;ll just have to devote some time to learning it. If you can&#146;t drive like most young people, you&#146;ll need to get a ride from a friend/ parent/ relative/ person who owes you. You can get there, trust me. I am only 13 years old, yet I am #1 in my region and #18 in the world. Once again, age is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Bad TD who ruled bad or is unfair and constantly screws me over, so I&#146;m quitting - Don&#146;t. Just play in tournaments with a different TD. Or if you really think you should, then report it to Decipher, and eventually, they&#146;ll take care of it. <br>
<br>
I stink, I&#146;m constantly losing, I can&#146;t play this game - Everyone does when they start playing. You can&#146;t expect to play in your first tournament and win it. YOU will get it and understand it eventually.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, for all the loyal ST:CCG players out there like myself, encourage more tourneys and gameplay and gaming and get togethers. <br>
<br>
Keep on trekking!<br>
