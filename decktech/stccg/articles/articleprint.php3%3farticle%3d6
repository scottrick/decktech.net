The first place to start is the concept that makes STCCG unique among CCGs; the art of the seed phase. From my humble beginnings in Star Trek, I thought the seed phase to be the most boring part of the game. But as I grew in maturity as a player, I discovered the little-known joys of strategic seeding. It suddenly became my favorite part of the game; setting up hoops for my opponent to have to jump through. Of course, the game is won by finding ways to circumvent these hoops, so the task becomes the quest of making dilemma combos foolproof. In this article, I hope to share some of my insights on the seed phase, focusing on dilemma combinations, from 3+ years of playing ST.<br>
<br>
My first question when preparing a dilemma combos set for any given deck is: Will the dilemmas be purely offensive (actively participating with the action in the draw phase, e.g. Scout Encounter/Sleeper Trap), purely defensive (more conventional usage, e.g. Common Thief/Berserk Changeling), or some combination of the two? Let&#146;s examine each of these possibilites.<br>
<br>
OFFENSIVE:<br>
These types of combos tend to work with whatever deck type you&#146;ve chosen. For example, if you&#146;re using a Klingon Blood Oath deck that relies on the 34th Rule as a card engine, you may use some dilemmas with more unusual requirements and less dire consequences for failure to pass it. Consider Palukoo. Anyone not using Spot, a Targ, Bajorans, Lal, Frame of Mind, or Reflection Therapy is going to have a hard time passing this dilemma. This will stop an Away Team (AT), which allows your Klingons, on your turn, to fly over and kick some tail, while drawing cards at the same time. You&#146;re killing two birds with one stone (three in some cases); you&#146;re slowing down your opponent, while drawing cards as a result. Another possibility is to use Council of Warriors for added effect, to actually score points for killing opposing personnel, which helps satisfy the ultimate and perhaps most important goal of Star Trek (short of having fun, of course): to win the game.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most effective offensive usage of dilemma combos is that of classification depletion. By this, I mean the systematic removal or death of personnel who share a classification, or possess it as a skill. Nearly every classification has a Tactic that specifically targets it on a hit result; used in combination with dilemmas requiring that classification to proceed can be devastating. Consider Kira and the Sisters of Duras. On two personnel cards, you have access to 5 different affiliations and a good majority of missions. Seeding DNA Clues under an opponent&#146;s mission can slow him down (especially if a Hippocratic Oath follows). With Kira/Sisters of Duras, you&#146;ve got a pretty good chance of being able to attempt your opponent&#146;s missions before he/she can, tripping the DNA Clues for them, and automatically increasing MED requirements by 2. Similarly, seeded Sheliaks at planet locations can be equally destructive, especially when playing with 1 or 2 Temporal Vortices (rare is the deck that will stock more than 3). Having done so, the opponent is forced to choose which planets he cares about saving. When used with multiple Borg Ships, the effect is only amplified.<br>
<br>
Other offensive combos exist; Sleeper Trap to kick-start a Cardassian deck, Ferengi Infestation, Scout Encounter, etc... these all have to do with downloading or otherwise bringing into play Personnel, Equipment and/or Ships for immediate use. Perhaps the most well known (and oldest) of these type of combos is the famed Scout Encounter/Extradition/Quantum Singularity Lifeforms combo. &quot;I&#146;ll download the Cha&#146;Joh with Selok and Krozh. I&#146;ll capture someone, and oh! Our ships are in stasis!&quot; A relatively low cost for you, and such a great return; dilemmas are at their best when hindering the opponent from proceeding on schedule.<br>
<br>
Some new and intriguing possibities for offensive combos have arrived in Mirror, Mirror. Quantum Singularity, when paired with Fast Ship and some Tactics targeting Astro/Physics personnel, can actually lock out a mission, provided you can get a ship to that location on your next turn. Quantum Singularity offers the same kind of blanket mission protection that Post Garrison has, but at half the price: only one staffed ship with 2 or more [Stf] icons. Having a few spare Asteroid Sanctuaries or Hails could lock down one location for the game&#146;s entirety. <br>
<br>
I hope I&#146;ve given you some ideas on offensive usage of dilemma combos. Next time: Dilemma Combos 102 - Defensive Usage of Dilemmas. Thanks for reading. Please Dmail me with any personal remarks or play requests; I&#146;m in the southern CA (Risa) area, and am always up for a game.<br>
