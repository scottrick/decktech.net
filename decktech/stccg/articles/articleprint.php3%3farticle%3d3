<br>
	When I started playing it was probably right before Alternate Universe came out. I had been a player of the Star Wars CCG for awhile, and losing on a constant bases against the same opponents at the tourneys didn’t really cut it for me anymore, so I decided to try my hand also out at the Star Trek CCG.  When I first saw the game, it didn’t really seem all that hard. It more or less seemed like math class to me…I mean having to add up all the numbers of your crew to see if your cunning was higher then a dilemma, didn’t really seem like too much work. Actually the thing I had hardest time was getting out my Federation / Klingon treaty without having to stock 5 or 6 different copy’s (though you pretty much had to anyway because your opponent was most likely stocking a bunch of Devil’s in there deck anyway.). I mean this was the time when you had a deck that had 70 or so cards in it, with multiples of the Traveler: Transcendence or Kivas-Fajo Collectors just to get to the cards you need. <br>
<br>
	This was the time before there were Q’s Tents or absolute cheese decks, but hey for most of us it was still fun! I mean it wasn’t a first turn win like it is nowadays, though the strategies weren’t the greatest back then-unless you count having 20 anti-time anomalies and Holograms a great Strategy…Then again there was also that Romulan Bynars-Enhancement deck that my uncle use to like to play. I just mean so what if they weren’t the most interesting of games, it was still a good pastime. Then next came Alternate Universe; I liked it…It brought another mechanic into the game.  The Alternate Universe Door was a whole new thing to add to your deck. By this time your decks could get even larger because around this time you weren’t thinking that maybe if you cut your deck down, you would get your cards out quicker…You were only thinking that you needed all those cards. It was still great to see new characters in people’s deck other then the same Data or Gowron. <br>
<br>
Though it probably didn’t get to the Q-Continuum that the real changes in Star Trek started happening, At first NO ONE had a clue how to use the Q’s Tent or the Q Flashes, but hell they were still nice to look at… A few weeks later of course we learned how to use them and wow! They really changed the mechanics of the game. Though there were still really silly stuff coming out of this set like the Parallax Arguers, I believe it was still a great set, unlike what some people say about it being almost the end to the CCG. <br>
<br>
Then came the real new step of the game, First Contact…This set I believe was the best, mostly because of the bringing of a whole new affiliation, not only that but one that the federation could openly attack! (Though it wasn’t that wise too, it was still worth seeing the Enterprise getting blown up by a Borg cube sometimes) The Borg were confusing at first to play with all the different rules they had to follow by, I think that Is one reason that I have never really played as them.  In my area they were rocking up the tourney scenes…It was a little upsetting at first to see a whole new affiliation start overpowering everyone else’s decks, though I guess it was needed to get more players interested in the game. Then of course it started advancing even more, next with the Cardie’s and Bajorans…Bringing more and more people into the fold. I never really like the Bajorans that much, mostly because of the whole orb and religious aspect…but I could get into the Cardie’s. Mostly because of watching the Deep Space Nine series, Dukat and Garak rocked, so for awhile there I was willing to play a Cardassian deck…Even though I felt like I was betraying the feds. (Not that I think of myself as an equivalent to the Marquis, but it still was a horrible crime to commit.)<br>
<br>
I stopped collecting for awhile; mostly I missed the Dominion, Blaze of Glory, and Rules of Acquisition sets. I still haven’t really gotten most of the main cards from those expansions, but hey it will all work out in the end. I got back right in time for the Trouble with Tribbles expansion, and I must say…FINALLY! It was about time that I could put Captain Kirk or McCoy in my deck…I mean, who isn’t terrified by seeing the Original Starfleet Crew going up and down the spaceline in there outdated starship? (I don’t even know if that was meant to be sarcasm or not!) Anyway, it was still a nice change to add more then either the Next Generation crew or Ds9 to my deck. Of course this leads us into the Mirror Mirror Universe, A great idea for a set….I really like it. Though I think that it is really spreading things thin, I mean having regions, AlphQuad, GamaQuad, Mirror Universe, and soon to be the Delta Quad. If your not using the STP drop you could have almost no battles. I don’t know, I am sure that it will work you already got people with there Terran decks, so I am sure that these meta-affiliations are going to be a cool thing to see in the future.  <br>
<br>
Well this is where I am going to end my article, hopefully I can make this into a weekly thing. Thanks for reading.<br>
