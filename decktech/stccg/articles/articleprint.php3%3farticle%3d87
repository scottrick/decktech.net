<br>
One of the Armada cards today:<br>
<br>
Chain Reaction Ricochet (Rare [TT], #23)<br>
Icons: Hidden Agenda<br>
Seeds or plays on table.  When your Chain Reaction Pulsar<br>
hits (but does not destroy) a ship, after applying damage<br>
it &quot;ricochets&quot; to other opposing ships present (except<br>
those already damaged this battle) in the order of your<br>
choice.  Second ship&#146;s damage = [Flip][Flip], third = [Flip][Flip][Flip],<br>
and so on, until one is destroyed.  Discard incident.<br>
<br>
<br>
This card was one of the more elaborate armada counters to be found in Tribbles, and as such it&#146;s rarely used.  It takes much more setup than, say, Defend Homeworld or a self-seeded Stellar Flare.  But, let&#146;s take a look at it and see how practical it would be if a player was willing to change a deck to stick it in.<br>
<br>
First, you&#146;ll need to use a Chain Reaction Pulsar to get it to go off.  The hard-to-find USS Jupiter downloads it for you, but you can always use Make It So if you don&#146;t have a Jupiter (or don&#146;t have it in play).  It&#146;s not a bad Tactic.  You need a big ship to make it work, but that&#146;s not too hard to do.  A D&#146;deridex, Vidiian Cruiser, or Kazon Warship are commonly-used ships that work just great.  You get a nice, hefty ATTACK bonus, and it doesn&#146;t have the DEFENSE reduction or low hull damage that are drawbacks to Maximum Firepower and Quantum Torpedo, other high-ATTACK tactics.  Damage isn&#146;t bad, either, except you don&#146;t get to flip more tactics.  A decent 35%, adequate attribute reductions, and a mild Scan counter.  But more on the Tactic when I get to it in the series (it&#146;ll be a while).  Suffice it to say that you won&#146;t be sacrificing that much by stocking it in your Battle Bridge if you only use one or two and use the Jupiter or Make It So to download it.<br>
<br>
Secondly, for the Ricochet to be of any use at all, there has to be more than one opposing ship at that location.  This isn&#146;t as easy to set up, and usually means that your opponent has an armada of three or more ships.  Rarely do I see two ships attacking: it&#146;s usually either a lone, marauding ship or a decent-sized fleet of 3+ ships.  But that&#146;s not bad.  Just don&#146;t download the Pulsar until you face a good-sized armada, since with only two ships it&#146;s still not that spectacular -- a slight improvement over normal damage, but not that much.  Once you see three ships, though, the Richocet really begins to shine.  Against three ships, you&#146;ll get to flip a total of six damage markers onto your opponent&#146;s ships, three times as many as a normal hit would have got you without it.  With more ships it just gets rosier and rosier.<br>
<br>
An important thing to notice is that after the first hit, the SHIELDS of your opponent&#146;s ships are irrelevant!  So, if your opponent is using a Romulan Launch Portal armada that carries, say, the Pi, Cha&#146;Joh, and Romulan Shuttle aboard the Decius, then launches them to attack, you don&#146;t have to be able to hit the beefed-up Decius (although with +5 ATTACK from the Pulsar and the need for a three-staffing-icon ship it might not be that tough).  Go for the Romulan Shuttle instead, then flip the Ricochet to hit the other ships, some of which (like a Captain&#146;s Logged Cha&#146;Joh and Decius with a DEFENSE bonus from tactics) you may not have been able to hit otherwise.  Just be sure your target has at least 35% HULL integrity, or you&#146;ll destroy the ship with the Pulsar, preventing you from using the Ricochet.<br>
<br>
When using this card against a large fleet, it&#146;s very important to keep track of what Tactics have been used.  I&#146;m not sure when you choose the order in which you damage opponent&#146;s ships, whether you have to declare upfront what order you&#146;ll damage them in, or whether you choose one, observe the damage, then choose another, observe that damage, choose the next, etc.<br>
<br>
Regardless, you need to know what Tactics are left in your Battle Bridge before deciding the order, since the effect ends when a ship has been destroyed.  If the Tactics in your BBSD have relatively low HULL damage (e.g., Maximum Firepower, Quantum Torpedo, Pulse Phaser Cannons) such that it takes five or more to destroy a ship, then you can hit more ships and you worry less about the effect ending unexpectedly.  If, however, you&#146;re using higher HULL damage Tactics, such as Crimson &quot;Forcefield&quot; where three of them will destroy a ship, you need to be very careful about which ships you hit.  Target a low-SHIELDS ship for the initial attack if you need to, then flip Ricochet and hit a more threatening ship next.  Go after the most threatening ship third, since that will probably be the ship you&#146;ll destroy.<br>
<br>
It&#146;s more complicated if your Battle Bridge includes both high and low HULL damage tactics.  In this case, you may need to do some quick mental math (approximating, of course) to figure the probability of destroying a ship with the next rebound.  Again, it *really* pays to know your deck in this case.  If you&#146;re using Ricochet, you should be able to recite the entire contents (including hull damage) of your Battle Bridge and be able to keep track of what&#146;s left as they come out.<br>
<br>
But then there&#146;s the sticky issue of getting this card into play.  It&#146;ll cost a card play if you play it, and if you seed it then you&#146;re taking away a seed slot from another dilemma, another Q the Ref, etc.  There&#146;s no real guarantee of using this card, and you can&#146;t easily cycle it through as if it were a [Ref] card.  Because of this, most players abandon it in favor of other anti-armada methods, and unfortunately this is a pretty strong argument.  It is a very devastating counter, though.  If you use Tactics that kill personnel, often you can decimate an armada by removing the leaders (and thus the battling capacity) from a couple ships and destroying the biggest ship.  So, what&#146;s my advice?  Check out the final verdict:<br>
<br>
The final verdict: The deciding factor is the threat of armadas in your metagame.  Because it&#146;s useless if your opponent isn&#146;t playing armada, and because there&#146;s no easy way to get rid of it, I wouldn&#146;t use a seed slot on it unless there were a lot of battling opponents in my local metagame.  However, if I was afraid of battle, I&#146;d be willing to use the setup cards for this (big ship plus Make It So and matching commander, and one or two copies of the Pulsar) because they&#146;ll be good cards to use regardless of the Ricochet.  This armada bullet requires a lot more support cards, but it will rip an armada apart.  Therefore, it only makes sense if you&#146;re playing in an armada-heavy environment.<br>
