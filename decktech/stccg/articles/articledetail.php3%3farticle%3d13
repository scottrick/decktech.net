<br>
My evolution of Star Trek came when the first set came out, premeiere, Kevin (now Bravo Leader for Decipher) and Kyle (now Rogue Squadron Leader for Decipher) started this game. At first I thought that it was stupid game, you pick out your lame dilemas, your missions and your people and then drop them down one at a time or if you were lucky enough to play a Red Alert and keep it on the table you&#146;d play them all at one time then attempt only the ground missions and move to the next and so on without fear of dying because of Genertronic Replicators. <br>
<br>
So hesitantly and with some persistance I purchased my boxes because Kevin kept telling me to and I played...the first deck that I made broke the boundaries for Star Trek in our area and noone wanted to play against my deck at that time. It was mainly 3 Telepathic Alien Kidnappers, 3 Alien Probes, Rogue Borg and the skeleton bridge crew to solve my missions, of course I had Kevins, Amandas and Q2s in abundance as well to stop people from trying to cancel my stuff. I would snag three cards a turn making my opponenets hand useless to him if he had one then one by one I would drop a character till they were all out and then just win the game. Man did I hate this game....it was stupid.<br>
<br>
As I played and made other decks...especialy to counter Kevins stupid Klingon Armada...of Hi, you had and outpost deck...I watched as the first &quot;expansion&quot; came out. Kevin, like a mad man went and bought a CASE of the cards so that he could get the big cards and have the better of the decks...which he did. He also bought me some packs for my birthday and told me tho that I had to trade him the Future Enterprise if I got one. I did and I traded it to him for stuff... I don&#146;t remember.<br>
<br>
The next set came out and that was Q I believe (it&#146;s been awhile) and I wasn&#146;t to happy with this set I sort of stopped playing around this time, I really got bored with the game because there was no interaction and Kevin was still getting cards....Occasionally we would play or a tournament would happen and we would go but still I didn&#146;t like the non-interaction of the game... Also around this time the next set started to rear it&#146;s ugly head... BORGIES!!! WOOHOO!!! I thought that would reignite the game... ~sigh~ I was disappointed.<br>
<br>
The Borg had to attack you only if they were attacked and they didn&#146;t battle unless they had the Objective...man what a pain...and I wouldn&#146;t play Borg till I got a Locutus, which I am happy to say I finally got one last year (&#146;00) Still the game didn&#146;t have that &#146;SPARK&#146; but also around this time Star Wars was out and I was heavily into that and Star Trek started dying to me and some of the other locals...a few more sets came and went and I still had no interest but Blaze Of Glory did ignite a &#146;spark&#146; of interest... Battle Bridges... Hmmmmmm FIGHT!!!!<br>
<br>
With them they did bring the bridges of battle, but it was still hard to do anything, most of the dilemas were still...pase...and could be passed in one turn and with the right cards you would complete your turn in one turn and lo, battling never happened. So I stopped again...<br>
<br>
Now I know things have come and gone, but I will get to them in time with this little rant so be patient.<br>
<br>
Finally I stopped Star Trek completely, the game died, and I was rather bored with it, however I kept my cards, but I was almost ready to dump them but, nahhhh! I watched as stuff came out and looked at it with a ~sigh~ of resentment for the game, cause I thought that it sucked...well that all changed... Ferengi!!!!<br>
<br>
I bought some of the Rules Of Aquisition cause I have liked the Ferengi Alliance on the TV and I was an avid watcher at this time of DS9 so I had to get some of it, and doing so I needed to get some DS9 cards cause whats Ferengi without Quarks Bar. Well that wasn&#146;t in that set, but the Deep Space Nine Space Station was and I needed that so I bought 2 boxes of the set and went about my merry way. Granted the Ferengi didn&#146;t have that battle that I wanted but it did have some fun, Dabo anyone, either way I enjoyed for a breif stint of time and a couple of the older players came out of the closet and started playing again...but they all died away like me again because there was no interaction...that was what this game was sorely lacking (in case I didn&#146;t mention that in the past). So I stopped but still had the Ferengi fun...<br>
<br>
Finally, while purusing Decipher.com I noticed that TWT was coming out. What was this, the original cast, ~yawn~ how lame...but, I was wrong that brought one great thing to the game BATTLE!!!!! Cpt. Kirk, oh yeah he can fight... So that sparked a new interest into the game, and some of the older players came back again...and now were still playing on our local night of Tuesday and have and average of 5 people on that night... YEAH!!! <br>
<br>
Finally and lastly for this report, MIRRORRORRIM came out and SPOCK w/Goatee.... EXCELLENT card mind you... and nasty dilemas that kill alot of people and that made them heitant about that one turn win, and what happens without weapons and what will the game be like now... Well now we see alot of Empok Nor downloading of weapons so that everyone has power of 60. Then mixed with the cards to stop them you get to go over and do what BATTLE!!!!! and now that game has that spark that I like and as do that other people in town and we are still going strong...thanks to battling...and Reflections or rather ReTrekTions...<br>
<br>
So in short, The game that started it all died in the middle, but if you stay with something long enough it&#146;ll get better... I&#146;m a belieiver cause Trek did just that.<br>
<br>
Thanks Decipher for making this game SO MUCH BETTER!!!<br>
