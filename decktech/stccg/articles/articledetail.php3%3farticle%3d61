Currently, too many games time out. As a result, Voyager introduces many new mechanics that helps players draw AND play cards faster...<br>
<br>
Delta Quadrant Spacial Scission<br>
<br>
This is by far the best card in Voyager. The first fucntion of the card allows you to have two copies of each unique Delta Quadrant personnel or ship in play. That is not that bad... two Janeways, two Neelixes, or two Voyagers in play at the same time. However, it’s the second fuction that really powerful. If you place out-of-play any copy of a Delta Quadrant, you get to draw and/or play up to two cards. This means either, two card draws for placing one card out-of-play, playing two free cards, or drawing one card then play one card (or vice verca). This is really powerful. If you have any Delta Quadrant personnel in your deck, you might not just want to consider putting Delta Quadrant Spatial Scission in your deck, you may actually want to put it in your deck.<br>
<br>
Drawing cards is always key to the game, so the ability to draw two cards by placing one card out-of-play is great. You get rid of one card you really do not need to get two fresh cards. The ability does not require a card play to use and there is no fine print. As long as you do not go over the limit (twelve cards for Scorched Hand), there is nothing wrong with drawing cards. And if you have any problem playing those cards, Delta Quadrant Spacial Scission card help you out there too.<br>
<br>
Now, the good stuff. Delta Quadrant Spacial Scission can also allow to play two cards for free. To some players that does not sound like a big deal, but it really is. Some players will think that they can already play enough cards for free that they would rather draw cards. However, Delta Quadrant Spacial Scission allows ANY two cards to play for free during the executing orders phase. Those two cards could be personnel, ships, incidents whatever you need that would normally cost you a normal card play.<br>
<br>
There are a couple combinations that can abuse this. Tox Uthat and Supernova. Before Voyager, very few players would play Supernova decks because it required two card plays (and therefore two turns) to pull it off. In the mean time, the opponent could prepare him- or herself to be novaed. Not anymore. Since Delta Quadrant Spatial Scission allows you to play two cards after executing orders, you can earn a Tox Uthat, play the Tox Uthat (one play) and Supernova (the second play) all in one turn. The opponent has no time to prepare... they are ready or they are not. The second combination is Revolving Door and Q’s Planet. This combination normally takes a long time to set up. After you Revolving Door the opponent’s Q’s Tent, the opponent will normally discard his or her Space-TIme Portal to download Alternate Universe Door to nullify the Revolving Door. As a result, you will have to play your Revolving Door again if you want to play Q’s Planet without any dilemmas. Delta Quadrant Spatial Scission solves this problem. If you place a personnel out-of-play in order to play two cards, the opponent does not receive an action between the two card plays (they are sub-actions are the Delta Quadrant Spatial Scission’s discard effect). Consequently, you can play Revolving Door on the opponent’s Q’s Tent, then Q’s Planet and the opponent can not do anything (discarding Space-Time Portal is not a vaild response to Revolving Door). Again, the opponent is ready for it, or he is not.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ancestral Vison<br>
<br>
This card is simple, if you have a personnel with Honor and INTEGRITY&gt;7 on the Delta Quadrant planet it is played on, you get an extra card (two if that personnel is Chakotay). The only catch is that you need a Delta Quadrant planet. But that can that can not be that hard to find. The Honor personnel also is not that hard to find. The Klingons can use Assign Mission Specialists to get Kahless or Korris. The Federation and Bajorans have Tabor who can be download with Defend Homeworld. Chakotay (who provides two draws instead of one) in available to anyone. Anyone can download Gem or Dr. Nydom to Nekrit Supply Depot (or a non-aligned ship with two or more staffing icons) using Assign Support Personnel. And the Kazon and Vidiian have at least one personnel for Ancestral Vision and can use any other personnel when using their respective “emblem” cards. Beware though, the opponent can kill off your Honor personnel or even nullify the Ancestral Vision.These problems can be solved. You can use Scanner Interference and Distortion Field and Atmospheric Ionization to block the opponent from attacking you. You can also use Cure Deadly Virus (with Ancestral Vision there), so if the opponent does venture after you, they are stuck. The opponent may not want to do that since it may take alot of resources to take card of your Ancestral Vison for good. You can also stock an extra Ancetral Vision in Q’s Tent just in case as well as some Quinns and Q2s to nullify the Quinns and Kevin Uxbridges that will go after your Ancestral Vision. Did I mention Ancestral Vison is seedable? With all the Honor personnel available to the Delta Quadrant, Ancestral Vision is a seedable The Traveler: Transcendence. There is no reason not to play (or even better, seed) Ancestral Vision if you are seeding a Delta Quadrant planet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Handshake<br>
<br>
Unlike Ancestral Vision, this card is complex. If you have not played a card, you can play Handshake (for free) if you have less cards in hand than opponent to either make the opponent must discard three cards from his or her hand OR allow you to draw three cards. This has a great effect; however, it is an unreliable card drawing engine. To play the card you have to have less cards in hand than the opponent. If you start playing alot of Handshakes, the opponent will start lower his or her hand size to block you from playing Handshake (to use the first function). The first function of Handshake is good to balance the game, but it is hard to rely on. The second function of the card is outright pointless. It allows you to either rearange the top five cards of any discard pile or any draw deck. Rearanging you discard pile has no point except for Mutation (Nanoprobe Resuscitation does not work because after you rearange the discard pile, Handshake plays right on top of the cards you just rearanged). And that is no reason to rearange your opponent’s discard pile, except to mess up his or her Mutation manipulation. Rearanging the top five cards in  any draw deck is almost as pointless. The only two reasons you would want to play Handshake (as normal card play) to rearrange your draw deck. The first is to maniplate probes and the second is to draw the card you want. Maniplating probes is understandable if you are playing Borg, for it will help you win. But if you are not playing Borg, there is no reason to bother manipulating probes. You play Handshake to rearrange your deck in order to get the card you need, but that is what downloading is for. When rearanging Also, with Handshake’s third fuction (and the many other card enginees) there is no need to change which of fives cards your are going to draw first because you are going to draw all five of the cards anyway. You can rearrange the opponent’s draw deck, but the opponent will probably draw all the cards within the next turn, or the opponent will download a card (thus shuffling his or her draw deck and Handshake was useless.The third function of Handshake is the best. If you have four or more cards in your hand (including Handshake), you can play Handshake to discard your hand in order to draw seven cards. This is a Maska Transformations that gives you extra card draws, but discards your hand (instead of cycling it). This means you can always get a new hand (if you have enough cards in your hand) in order to keep getting the cards you need. Although it costs you your card play, it is worth discarding a bad hand in order to get more fresh cards. The only downside to the third function is that is discards your hand. But if you stock extras of the cards you may discard, discarding your hand for new, better, and more cards is not that bad. Even though Handshake’s second fuction will be of rare use, Handshake is a must for every deck. It balances the game by somewhat equalizing the cards in theplayers’ hands or helps you keep a fresh hand thus allowing you to draw and play the cards you need. However, unlike cards like Kivas Fajo- Collector, no one can rely on Handshake in order to draw cards. Handshake is only useful to draw cards if you have less cards than the opponent in your hand and the opponent is willing to let you draw three cards or if you have at least four cards in our hand and you are willing to discard your hand. Handshake is a really great card... when you can use it.<br>
<br>
To all, Puzzle #5 will be coming out soon. I have been real sick lately and on &quot;business&quot; trips. In the mean time, Voyager has been released. The new puzzles should in include Voyager cards. Thanks for your patience.<br>
