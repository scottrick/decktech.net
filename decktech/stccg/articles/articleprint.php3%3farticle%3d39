<br>
Hello, I am selling quite a few of my cards cheap, as I can no longer support 3 CCGs, fortunately for you, it is ST:CCG since there are no longer tourneys in my area:<br>
 <br>
an easy to read table version of the list is avaliable at http://www.geocities.com/ggredv/treksale.html <br>
 <br>
Hello, and thanks for taking a moment for looking at my list, there is a minimum order of five dollars because otherwise it is expensive to send cards to get a buck or two. But, if you do really need just one card are something, I&#146;ll see what I can do. Please e-mail me at red5@san.rr.com (or reply to this message) with what you are interested in. <br>
<br>
I will sell them on a timed system, whichever one I get an e-mail from first, that is who I will sell to. If they are at the same time (which I highly doubt, we will see what we can work out...) <br>
<br>
Shipping will be 50 Cents per 4 cards, shipped in top loader individually sleeved inside the top loader. Insurance will be optional, I will send insured if requested at additional cost. 30 cents for each additional card group up to 4. If you would like them individually top loaded it will be an additional 30 cents per hard case because each one is about an ounce. International will be extra. <br>
