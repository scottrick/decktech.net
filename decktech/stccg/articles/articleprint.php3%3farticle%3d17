Welcome to the fourth and final introductory article on dilemma combos. I&#146;m assuming you&#146;ve read 101, 102, and 103, because I will be referring to terms defined in those article here. We&#146;ve covered filters, killers, and walls, but there are a few dilemmas that slip through the cracks when trying to define them with only these three terms. These &quot;other&quot; dilemmas I will classify as:<br>
<br>
HELPERS<br>
Helpers do exactly that; they help slow down your opponent. They don&#146;t filter or kill any personnel, and while sometimes having conditions that can stop a crew/Away Team(AT)/ship, the effects of the dilemma are similar to that of an Event being played to the table (although admittedly, most dilemmas, when in play, are significantly more powerful... you do have to spend a seed slot on it, after all). Helper dilemmas often score points (either positive or negative), if its conditions are met. Also, dilemmas that could be considered walls, were it not for their &quot;discard dilemma&quot; text, have been included in this category.<br>
<br>
Here is a complete list of helper dilemmas (in my estimation) as of the writing of this article:<br>
<br>
Planet:<br>
Duonetic Field Generator<br>
Lockbox<br>
Palukoo<br>
Royale Casino: Blackjack<br>
Royale Casino: Craps<br>
Royale Casino: Slots<br>
Sarjenka<br>
Worshiper<br>
<br>
Space/Planet:<br>
Balancing Act<br>
Computer Weapon/Hyper-Aging<br>
DNA Clues<br>
Edo Probe<br>
Ferengi Bug<br>
Interphasic Plasma Creatures<br>
Q<br>
Scout Encounter<br>
Sleeper Trap<br>
The Higher... The Fewer<br>
Undetected Beam-In<br>
Untrustworthy Associate<br>
Vendetta<br>
<br>
Space:<br>
Iconian Computer Weapon<br>
Isolinear Puzzle<br>
&quot;Pup&quot;<br>
Rascals<br>
&quot;Subspace Seaweed&quot;<br>
Temporal Causality Loop<br>
Tsiolkovsky Infection<br>
Vole Infestation<br>
<br>
Obviously, some of these helpers are more useful than others. But in most cases, a helper is at its best when being combined with another dilemma&#146;s effect to create a seriously nasty situation.<br>
<br>
EFFECTIVE COMBO STRATEGIES<br>
<br>
The best way to test combo effectiveness, in my opinion, is to try it out! Take a typical crew from a recent deck you&#146;ve made. Apply the effects of each of the dilemmas in sequence. If your entire simulated crew is destroyed/stopped/forcibly removed, congratulations! If not, here are some suggestions:<br>
<br>
1. Determine the goal of your combo.<br>
What do you want your combo to do? Kill as many personnel/ships as possible? Stop ATs indefinitely? Capture a large group of your opponent&#146;s personnel? All these are attainable goals that you must determine before constructing your combo.<br>
<br>
Sample combo:<br>
New Essentialists - Chula: The Chandra - Alien Parasites<br>
<br>
At first, the question is, why not replace NE with Ferengi Infestation? Wouldn&#146;t you get a bigger haul from Chandra/AP? Or, why not replace NE with Armus-SS and move it to the end of the combo? All these are completely valid points, and will work in various decks.<br>
<br>
This combo is intended to be 20% offensive and 80% defensive. On the off chance that my opponent plays Aid Fugitives, and sends my MED over as a result of Hippo Oath, I can attempt Aid Fugitives and return the MED to my deck. Also usable on a Love Interest victim who&#146;s too far away to rescue. And most of the other times, I&#146;m going to get control of my opponent&#146;s personnel. If they have the mission requirements, I&#146;ll go for the steal; because of Fair Play, I usually aim this combo at larger point value planet missions. The goal of this combo is to steal an opponent&#146;s mission (with the extra perk of saving personnel).<br>
<br>
2. Determine the type order you want for the combo.<br>
Filter/killer/wall? Wall/filter-killer/wall? Helper/killer/wall? It&#146;s all up to you; your local metagame should help decide this for you.<br>
<br>
Sample combo:<br>
Denevan Neural Parasites(Flying Pancakes)/Ferengi Infestation<br>
<br>
Usually, this combo is seen the other way around, with the FI in front. But if your area is big into mega-crews, try the Pancakes first, then followed by FI. Much harder. The trick is, if they red-shirt, you&#146;re left with only a decent wall, rather than 6-7 people dead AND a decent wall.<br>
<br>
3. Consider long-term effectiveness of the combo.<br>
Will the combo last for half the game? After all, dilemmas are meant to slow your opponent down, so effective usage is critical to the success of your seed deck.<br>
<br>
Sample combo:<br>
Edo Probe/Dead End<br>
<br>
Not especially effective against Borg, but against a non-Borg opponent, they&#146;re stopped until they score 50, and they&#146;ve basically made it 60 from the -10. This gives you time to either outscore your opponent, or to destroy outposts/ships to the point where scoring 50(60) points is not likely.<br>
<br>
Here are some of my personal favorites, chosen from space, space/planet, and planet, in each of the four categories.<br>
H=Helper, F=Filter, K=Killer, W=Wall.<br>
<br>
Top 10 Planet Dilemmas:<br>
Duonetic Field Generator(H). Who needs Distortion Fields? Just put a Make Us Go in front and they&#146;ll be sitting there a while.<br>
Armus - Sticky Situation(F/K). Great after a Alien Parasites where you&#146;ve taken control. Send &#146;em down one at a time to get slimed.<br>
Palukoo(F). Unless you&#146;re playing Bajorans, Klingons, or Spot, this is always going to stop an AT.<br>
Shot In the Back(F/K). Choose your target, unless they&#146;re playing droids, in which case, seed a Chinese Finger Puzzle before this.<br>
Q&#146;s Vicious Animal Things(K). After Founder Secret is a great place for this one. One of the few dilemmas that punishes mega-crews.<br>
The Sheliak(K). Regardless of QtR/TV, this dilemma remains strong, especially in decks with Borg Ship(s). How many TVs does your opponent have?<br>
Denevan Neural Parasites(K). The Flying Pancakes are becoming feared in the tournament scene. Phasers and disruptors are slowly sneaking into decks again.<br>
Alien Parasites(W). Snag your opponent&#146;s mission, send them off to their doom, make them battle their own forces... the possibilites are endless.<br>
Crisis(W). A planet dilemma that requires a ship in orbit? Sweet. Especially after all your opponent&#146;s personnel beamed down and hit your Duonetic Field Generator.<br>
New Essentialists(W). A decent wall, and alternately used to save your own personnel in tight squeezes.<br>
<br>
Top 10 Space/Planet Dilemmas:<br>
DNA Clues(H). Increase Hippocratic Oath to 3 MED, increase Scientific Method to 3 MED, increase Crystalline Entity to 3 MED (6 with Lore in play)... you get the idea.<br>
Cardassian Trap(F). Great in capture decks, almost guaranteed against anyone except Feds (although those NA Vulcans are starting to show up for Horta defense).<br>
Chula: The Chandra(F). With a leading FI, this usually splits an Away Team so that the remaining AT will bite it on the next dilemma (Alien Parasites, for instance).<br>
Chula: The Game(F). I only discovered this dilemma a couple days ago, and yikes! How many decks play with Greed on purpose? Stop an crew/AT for 2 turns? Sign me up!<br>
Dal&#146;Rok(K). Kill, kill, kill! This is a great dilemma to trip for your opponent with Kira/Sisters of Duras (see 101). Also effective on ATs trapped by Duonetic Fied Generator.<br>
No Loose Ends(K). Preceded by Ferengi Ingenuity and an Access Denied on the mission, all MED and ENG die. Ouch.<br>
Unscientific Method(K/W). Great before a Scientific Method. Has the potential to kill twice on reattempt, if your opponent is not paying attention.<br>
Ferengi Infestation(W). An Empok Nor dilemma, works best to force opponent to commit a large force to clearing this out. Denevan Neural Parasites afterwards has nasty effects.<br>
Hippocratic Oath(W/F). The genesis behind MED-deprivation <br>
decks, it remains a strong force in the tournament scene.<br>
Lack of Preparation(W). You know your opponent is attempting with at least enough to complete the mission after clearing this one.<br>
<br>
Top 10 Space Dilemmas:<br>
&quot;Pup&quot;(H). The best set-up for Abandon Ship! <br>
Abandon Ship!(F). Opponent loses all but at most 4, in most cases. Jump over there with your own ship to capture lots o&#146; personnel.<br>
Conundrum(F). A inferior Cytherians, as long as you keep the target running, so will the ship affected by Conundrum. Just make sure to slip a Chula: The Chandra in front.<br>
Cytherians(F). Destroy them on their way to the other side. Nuff said.<br>
Borg Ship(K). Best used in concert with Sheliak, it remains powerful even after QtR/TV. And how about Retask for all <br>
those Borg decks out there?<br>
Orion Syndicate Bomb(K). Transporter Skill has seen a decrease in usage after the Tribble craze died down, so this has a very good chance of damaging a ship. With a Battle Bridge side deck, this can kill a couple personnel, while hindering ship attributes.<br>
Strict Dress Code(K). If your opponent has no Diplomacy, choose your target.<br>
Gravimetric Distortion(W/K). It&#146;s a wall, and it damages ships that can&#146;t get past. Like Orion Syn. Bomb, it works best with a BBSD.<br>
Quantum Fissure(W). Like Duonetic Field Generator&#146;s similarity to Distortion Field, QF is basically a dilemma form of Post Garrison, except for the fact that only one ships is needed. Granted, it must have two or more staffing icons, but the ability to lock an opponent out of a mission is highly desirable. Wait to STP-drop during your opponent&#146;s turn after they travel to the mission, but before they attempt.<br>
Radioactive Garbage Scow(W). With Mission Debriefing, an automatic stop. Great for battle decks looking for targets.<br>
<br>
Only 10 out of these 30 are rare, and if you notice, all 5 dilemmas included in the OTSD are listed here as well. Newer players: if you don&#146;t own an OTSD, find one! The 20 cards are worth it, and plus, you now have a pretty box in which to put your killer deck of doom.<br>
<br>
I hope this series of articles has been helpful to you in your deck-building. Remember, dilemma combos are only as good as you make them (and occasionally better). If you feel like it, in your review, post a favorite combo of yours. Signing off for now,<br>
