<br>
My class load for the quarter&#146;s starting to get easier now (thankfully... 18 credits including three math classes was starting to wear me down), so I hope to be able to keep writing these semi-frequently.  Next up are the two Treaties from Tribbles.  Here&#146;s the first:<br>
<br>
Treaty: Cardassian/Bajoran (#20, C)<br>
Event<br>
Icons: Trouble with Tribbles<br>
In 2371, the Bajoran and Cardassian peoples finally began to<br>
put their long conflict behind them, with the signing of a peace<br>
treaty between Legate Turrel and the newly elected Kai Winn.<br>
Plays on table (for free if you have Bareil Antos, Kai Winn,<br>
or Turrel in play).  Your Cardassian and Bajoran affiliations<br>
recognize this treaty.  They can now mix and cooperate.<br>
<br>
The general format I&#146;ll be taking when reviewing the Treaty is to first analyze how well the two affiliations work together, as I think that is the most important factor in determining how useful a Treaty is.  Then I&#146;ll review the mechanics of the Treaty itself, discussing the ease of getting it into play and keeping it there.<br>
<br>
So, we have the two major Deep Space 9 affiliations together on one Treaty card.  Do they work together well?  I think that the answer is that they work together surprisingly well.<br>
<br>
The first thing that comes to mind is mission selection.  A number of Bajoran players seed Orb Negotiations as the lone mission outside of the Bajor region.  After all, it&#146;s very easy to complete as a Bajoran player with a very good point-to-personnel ratio (35 points for a mission that so many good Bajoran personnel can complete alone!?).  <br>
<br>
So, if you&#146;re playing Cardassian as well, you gain the ability to seed Central Command and get some free card plays, too.  You also gain the added option of solving Orb  Negotiations with HQ: Secure Homeworld, giving you more flexibility.  For the truly flashy player, you can even use For Cardassia! to make HQ: Secure Homeworld more appealing.  That&#146;s a very appealing choice: if you need a quick 35 points, you can solve it the standard Bajoran way very early in the game, especially if you start redshirting with your free Guls and Legates early in the game to clear out dilemmas.  Or, you can opt to wait and grab extra personnel or points with Secure Homeworld and For Cardassia!<br>
<br>
Bajoran decks are also infamous for doing Cargo Runs, either as a dedicated strategy or just for some quick card draws.  Cardassians give you the flexibility to use the Bok&#146;Nor and run some hand weapons as well, such as Neela&#146;s special download of a Bajoran Phaser, or a hand weapon downloaded to The Intendant with The Art of Diplomacy.  The extra card draws will also help feed your extra free plays at Central Command, and hand weapons will do you nicely should you favor Kressari Rendezvous.<br>
<br>
Another big thing is the possibilities in deck manipulation.  Bajorans conduct services, Cardassians process ore.  Unfortunately, you can&#146;t do both at the same Nor (you can only use the Bajoran Shrine on Deep Space 9, which means Deep Space 9 is either under Federation or Bajoran control, so you can&#146;t Process Ore there), but there&#146;s no reason why you can&#146;t use more than one Nor.  Stick DS9 at a Bajor Region location, put a generic Nor at Kressari Rendezvous, and put a docking site and Cargo Bay on each.  Put a Shrine at DS9 and an Ore Procesing Unit at the Nor.  You can Cargo Run for some bulk draws while using the Shrine and OPU for some recycling and extra draws.  The easiest way to get this all set up IMO?  Seed Crossover, Defend Homeworld for Overseer Odo to Central Command, Hidden Fighter a Bajoran Interceptor to him, and get him to the generic Nor where he downloads Proces Ore.  Ditch Assign Support Personnel to get Vedek Sorad to the Shrine and use Cargo Bay to download another Bajoran, such as Razka Karn or Lupaza.  At the start of the next turn, you can start some wicked drawing and recycling.<br>
<br>
This could get even better if, instead of using a Cargo Bay download, you play an Orb icon personnel from your hand, followed by a free HQ: Return Orb to Bajor thanks to the Chamber of Ministers.  Grab an Orb of Wisdom for free card plays, or an Orb of Prophecy and Change for even more manipulation potential.  Sure, this strategy takes plenty of resources, but after the first turn you&#146;re drawing 3-4 cards a turn plus Cargo Runs while still leaving your card play free.  With both Headquarters out, you can play a lot of personnel quickly, too.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Overseer Odo, this Treaty is a very nice card in a KCA deck, too.  You can use this to allow your Bajorans and Cardassians from this universe to cooperate with all of your KCA Bajorans and Cardassians as well.  Normally, this is impossible, because your regular Bajorans, while compatible with your Mirror Bajorans, won&#146;t work together with the Mirror Cardies because the Emblem only allows the Mirror personnel to work together.<br>
<br>
The two affiliations&#146; skill sets complement each other well, too.  Bajorans are well suited for planet missions with ample Geology, Mora Pol for Exobiology, Resistance for Palukoo, and Odo for Founder Secret.  Their personnel are well suited for Colonies as well, with lots of CIVILIANs and special skills to keep Bajorans on top of most others in personnel battle as well (Shakaar Edon, Keeve Falor, and Orta in particular).<br>
<br>
The Cardassians, on the other hand, have plenty of Astrophysics and Stellar Cartography, and oodles of OFFICERs for Maglocks, making them better suited (in general) to space missions.  <br>
<br>
Combining the two lets you dodge The Big Picture with greater ease, plus there is plenty of cross-use that can help, too: Surmak Ren&#146;s nullification of Aphasia Device is very chic, and there are more than enough Legates to go around in case Executive Authorization rears its ugly head.<br>
<br>
You also get all the traditional benefits of going with multiple affiliations: a much tighter mission/personnel selection in general, since you&#146;ve almost doubled your pool of missions and personnel to choose from.  You also tend to play with multiple facilities, so there&#146;s a smaller risk to Sheliaks and battle decks.<br>
<br>
You also give yourself added protection against most battle, since you&#146;re playing with two affiliations.  You can&#146;t be attacked by either a Bajoran or Cardassian opponent unless they&#146;re willing to use HQ: Defensive Measures on it (and this often takes extra time to get all the Obsidian Order necessary).  Against Bajoran opponent&#146;s it&#146;s even better.  They have to play a Bajoran Civil War for this effect, which is almost never found outside of Pire for Hire armadas, in which case you still bought yourself some extra time since that&#146;s one less Civil War that could be used for Rinnak Pires.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, that means that random battle is tougher with Treaty decks, since your attack options will be limited against a Cardassian or Bajoran opponent.  You also have to be more careful with your ratios between each affiliation, since Treaties don&#146;t override the requirement that a ship have a *matching* personnel aboard to staff it.<br>
<br>
Now, onto how easy it is to get this Treaty out.  You can do the old school thing and simply play it from your hand or seed it with Open Diplomatic Relations (Man, I can remember when OTSDs first came out, and there I am talking about it being &quot;old schol&quot;), but Treaties have grown more sophisticated over the expansions.  The Cardassian/Bajoran one has the nice advantage that Kai Winn can download it and Turrel can protect it.  It certainly doesn&#146;t hurt that both of the aforementioned personnel allow it to play for free. <br>
<br>
You may wonder why it helps that Kai Winn lets you play the Treaty for free when she can simply download it.  There are a few reasons: if she uses her download for it, but the Treaty is nullified later, you can Palor and play it without using a card play.  Also, you may want to use her download for a different treaty if you&#146;re going for a three-way deck, such as seeding Treaty: Romulan/Cardassian, downloading Treaty: Romulan/Bajoran with the good Kai, and playing Treaty: Bajoran/Cardassian for free.<br>
<br>
But when it all comes down to it, I think the old method of seeding it with ODR is best.  You get an &quot;auto-Palor&quot; for the Treaty, so after you get Turrel into play, you can retrieve it, drop it for free (for good, since you already have Turrel in play), recycle those two discarded cards back into your deck next turn with your Process Ore/Bajran Shrine, and keep going without losing too much steam.<br>
<br>
Any Cardassian treaty has the advantage of being protected by Turrel.  Combine that with his Legate status for Executive Authorization, free reporting at Central Command, Going to the Top, and For Cardassia!, and to me he&#146;s an automatic inclusion in any Cardassian Treaty deck.<br>
<br>
The final verdict: So, I&#146;ve concluded that two affiliations work together well.  Big whoop, right?  I mean, you can&#146;t really make a deck worse by expanding its personnel, ship, and mission selection, can you?   Well, the question comes down to whether those benefits are worth the two seed slots ODR provides (since IMO that&#146;s the superior way of getting it into play).  Many of the above strategies (such as the double manipulation) can be done by just splashing one affiliation in instead of playing both fully.  This is especially true for the Cardies.  If the above strategy is modified slightly, you can use Overseer Odo to Process while you build up your Bajorans.  Then, if you need him, you can switch Odo to Bajoran mode and simply retrieve him (he has Computer Skill, so docking at the Nor is no problem).  Since I&#146;m always tight on seed slots,  I tend to set my standards very high, so Treaties have to be downright vital to my deck for it to be included.  As a result, I probably won&#146;t be using this one anytime soon.  Of course, it doesn&#146;t help that I&#146;ve never played either affiliation much at all. :-)  But there are some big plusses to using them together.  And if you&#146;re the type of player who always seems to have extra seeds, definitely considering going with a Treaty.  Amongst Treaty decks, the Cardassian/Bajoran one is definitely strong.<br>
