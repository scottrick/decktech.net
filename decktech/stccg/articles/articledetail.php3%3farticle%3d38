Be prepared for some unusual ideas, as I strive to be an unusual player.<br>
<br>
KNOW THE CARDS<br>
This may seem basic, but this is the MOST important step to tournament preparation. If you don&#146;t know every card in STCCG, then how do you know your deck is taking full advantage of the possibilities granted it? Card knowledge is a priority for those players looking for the extra edge in tight games against familiar opponents. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
When I first played in a STCCG tourney, I wasn&#146;t sure what kind of decks I would encounter. I was somewhat intimidated by the fact that I had NO tournament experience at all. I built a PNZ x6 deck right after First Contact came out; I also included Isabellas. Of course, this is standard procedure in the current tournament scene. But at the time (Feb &#146;97), no one in my area (AFAIK) had played PNZ. I won 4 of 5 games that day, losing only to a player who had superior card knowledge (he used 6 Balancing Acts, and knew about the Isabella trick). It was then that I started my quest to be as knowledgeable as possible about the cards of STCCG.<br>
<br>
The most basic way to gain card knowledge is.... to read the cards! Go over each card&#146;s text, and think about applications of the card for decks that you&#146;ve played, or seen played. Imagine abusive strategies for the card; this sometimes yields a breakthrough strategy (see above). Think of outrageous, card-intensive uses for the card; this usually uncovers a less-than-obvious use for the card. For multi-function cards (such as I&#146;m a Doctor, Not a Bricklayer), consider ALL options the card makes available to you.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
I included Temporal Vortex in most of my decks after First Contact&#146;s release, simply because of the fact that I hated Borg Ship and the Sheliak. However, the usage of said dilemmas waxed and waned with the ever-changing tournament scene; the primary use for TV was only sometimes useful. In one game, my opponent was speeding through dilemmas with his AT, and he was stopped by a Dead End. He played a Distortion of Space/Time Continuum to move again, and I realized I had no Amandas in my hand. But I did have a Temporal Vortex. This was also before we found out Doorways could only be played on your turn. I responded by playing the TV to cancel the Distortion. My opponent&#146;s jaw dropped; he had no idea that card could do that.<br>
<br>
The best way, IMHO, to expand your STCCG card knowledge, is to download, and then read, the .pdf spoiler lists found on Decipher&#146;s website. For most of the more recent expansions, the spoiler list is a great way to quickly familiarize yourself with the cards in the set. Unfortunately, the older sets do not have these .pdf files... but you can download Unimatrix Zero One&#146;s Comprehensive Spoiler List, which is current through Tribbles. This lists every card&#146;s text and special icons. http://www.milligan.edu/bible/rcheard/stccg/<br>
<br>
Gaining card knowledge is a time-consuming endeavor. Pace yourself by reading through one expansion at a time, or if using the Comprehensive Spoiler, one card type at a time. Through slow and carful consideration of each card&#146;s potential, your offensive and defensive strategies will grow stronger, as you begin to expect certain combos. One of the most unnerving things to do to an opponent is to psychologically out-play them. By guessing and actually saying out loud what you think they&#146;re going to play, they become nervous; their carefully thought-out strategy is now being picked apart by their opponent. Confidence is lost, and you&#146;re that much closer to winning. With this in mind, unless you&#146;re in a high-stakes tournament (Regionals or higher), don&#146;t focus on winning. STCCG is more about having fun with your opponent, in a contest of Star Trek-related strategies. If you&#146;re not having fun, then some re-examination of your involvement in STCCG on your part could be warranted.<br>
<br>
KNOW THE RULES<br>
Rules knowledge is also vital to playing STCCG. A superior rules-oriented player may not always win, but they may find a rules glitch to exploit. I&#146;m always looking for any advantage I can get in higher level tournaments; rules is but one among many.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
I was playing against a Borg player before the release of DS9. He was playing an early version of the Scout Swarm, when he hit his own Dead End. I was satisfied that he wasn&#146;t going to be able to pass it before I was, unless he somehow scored 50 points before I did. On his next turn, he continued scouting. I objected, and the TD explained to me that since the Borg don&#146;t attempt missions, the second half of the text did not apply to them. I protested, saying that the second half was not in dispute, but the first half: &quot;Unless you have at least 50 points, cannot get past;&quot;, he then explained that after the dilemma was placed on the mission, only the second half applied. I was upset, and subsequently lost the game, both psychologically and literally, because of an inferior rules knowledge (keep in mind the Borg were relatively new at the time).<br>
<br>
Rules knowledge is gained by reading through the Glossary, the Rulebook, and the CRD (Current Rulings Document), all of which are available on Decipher&#146;s website. Again, as with reading card text, the rules can be quite overwhelming when taken all at once. Break the Glossary down by reading 2, 3, or 4 pages in one sitting; you&#146;ll be finished with the whole thing after about 25 readings. Rules knowledge can also be picked up from other players with more experience (and sometimes less). A rules glitch you hadn&#146;t thought of could be used against you in a match and catch you off-guard by a less-experienced player.<br>
<br>
KNOW YOUR DECK<br>
This stems from knowing the cards, but the specific harmonies of card combos in your deck are important to know before you go into the pressured setting of a tournament. Knowing your deck really well cuts down on response time when reacting to expected strategies used by your opponent. Deck knowledge also gives you superior position when encountering unforeseen card interactions. Recovery after a setback by an opponent is vital to consistent success.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
My Council of Bloody Referees deck was a result of an outrageous scheme. By using Anti-Time Anomaly, and reversing it with Persistance of Memory, I could have unlimited copies of the same unique personnel in play. (No really! Read the Glossary entry on PoM.) My plan was to use A Good Day to Live as my prime target, and score 100+ points from it alone. I used Deep Space 9, and downloaded 3 Bajorans first turn. With this set-up, I was now able to play Renewal Scrolls (and Remodulation) in order to discard multiple copies of [BO] personnel while drawing more. When I had 3 or 4 copies of each in the discard pile, I headed over to Q&#146;s Planet with the Bajorans to pick up PoM. I then played ATA, which in most cases, alarmed my opponents (in one case, my opponent actually got everyone aboard a ship and returned it to his hand via Space-Time Portal). On the last turn of ATA, I reversed it using PoM. All copies of the [BO] crew would show up at Good Day, and on my next turn, I would typically score at least 100 points from having 14 [Nem, R, Red] personnel there. Needless to say, it was completely unefficient, taking 15 turns or mre to set up. And with the current ruling on cumulativity, the deck wouldn&#146;t work. But, from this, I learned the power of Blood Oath, and started looking for way to exploit the massive power of downloading to [BO] in place of card draws. I used Kivas Fajo, The Traveler: Transcendence, Mirror Image, and Q the Referee, after it was released with Tribbles.<br>
<br>
The best way to gain experience and knowledge with your deck is to play it! Most world-championship caliber decks go through 10, 15, even 20 revisions before the players are comfortable with the draw engine, personnel selection, and general consistency of the deck. Find people to play. If none are available, make time for an online game. These usually take longer, but it works as a substitute for live play. A great place to find an online game is Kedanya.org, where many experienced players meet and play either in chat rooms or through messenger services such as AIM.<br>
<br>
This wraps up the first section of my playbook; future articles will look at the seed phase, the draw phase, and the game as a whole. Hope I&#146;ve been able to provide you with some small bit of advice to improve your game.<br>
