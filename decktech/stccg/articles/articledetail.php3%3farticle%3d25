However, surely enough, many of them can.  While the statements in this article do not apply to all winning decks, successfully mastering them will allow you to win a good portion of the games you play.<br>
<br>
What are the three points?  I&#146;ll list them here before describing them in more detail later: draw lots of cards, play cards quickly, and start attempting missions quickly.<br>
<br>
One of the great things about these rules is their generality -- with each of these there is a great deal of flexibility in choosing exactly how you want to accomplish each goal.  Another bonus is their simplicity: none of them are hard to understand.  Successfully balancing all three in a deck is a different matter, however.<br>
<br>
So, without further ado, I&#146;ll dive into the three points.<br>
<br>
1. Draw lots of cards.  <br>
<br>
This principle is familiar to any player of CCGs.  Cards like Kivas Fajo -- Collector and The Traveler: Transcendence have been seen in abundance ever since the game&#146;s inception.  Why?  Hopefully, every card in your deck has a purpose.  Perhaps it&#146;s offensive (Bynars Weapon Enhancement or Red Alert!).  Maybe it&#146;s defensive (Kevin Uxbridge, Goddess of Empathy).  Perhaps it&#146;s both.  Regardless, there is a reason for each card to be in a deck.<br>
<br>
Drawing more cards than your opponent allows you to access more of these resources.  The more cards you&#146;ve drawn, the better the probability of having the Amanda in your hand when you need it, and so on.  <br>
<br>
There are lots of ways to draw cards in the modern game.  Cargo running and Ooby Dooby are potentially huge drawing engines if played correctly, although they usually require enough resources that the deck title often has the card drawing engine in the title (for example, Devidian Dooby -- in contrast, how many decks do you see called Kivas Fajo?).  Using a Nor or Deep Space 9 also has great deck manipulation potential, not just in drawing cards, but also in controlling what you draw.  Guest Quarters, for instance, essentially lets you pick the better of your next two draws.  Promenade Shops, and Ore Processing Unit (or Bajoran Shrine) also allow extra cards.  The latter two also allow recycling of discarded cards.  Sticking Morn at Quark&#146;s Bar will grab you an extra card each turn as well.  Trickier players can play the 34th Rule of Acquisition (or better yet, download it with Hanok or Grand Nagus Gint) and attack an uncontrolled Empok Nor for an extra two cards each turn without fear of retaliation.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are always the old standbys, Kivas Fajo -- Collector and The Traveler: Transcendence, along with newer mechanisms like Renewal Scroll, Dabo, and The Guardian of Forever.<br>
<br>
Whatever it is, make sure your deck has some way of drawing cards quickly.  Just as you have a better chance of countering your opponent&#146;s strategy if you&#146;ve drawn more cards, your opponent has a better chance of countering your strategy if you&#146;ve drawn fewer cards.  In fact, the whole stasis deck archetype is based around overwhelming the opponent with drawn cards.  Such decks usually employ a Nor to draw many cards each turn (sometimes five or six each turn once fully up and running) while simultaneously attempting to lock down your hand with discard cards like Static Warp Bubble.  Cards like Kevin Uxbridge, Amanda Rogers, or Anti-Time Anomaly attempt to stop any of your drawing mechanisms.  These decks are very powerful if built and played correctly.<br>
<br>
Of course, with Scorched Hand around, you can&#146;t be too overzealous about drawing cards.  Following the next principle, however, allows you to draw many more cards than otherwise possible...<br>
<br>
2. Play lots of cards<br>
<br>
If you&#146;re looking for a fast win, simply having twenty cards in your hand simply isn&#146;t going to cut it.  Another key to winning is to get as much as possible onto the table as fast as possible.  Any regular tournament player has run across opponents who drop several personnel each turn and try to dash through missions, and many have tried it themselves.  Headquarters are one way to do this, although they tend to work better for some affiliations (such as Romulans or the Dominion) than others (such as the Federation [not the Terrans]).  The time locations Sherman&#146;s Peak and Halkan Council are also great in this respect.<br>
<br>
Other common free-reporting mechanisms include Cybernetics with androids, Going to the Top, Ready Room Door, using Space-Time Portal to report an [AU] ship with crew, and using personnel with special downloads of other personnel, like using Anya to get Salia.<br>
<br>
It&#146;s also important not to forget that you can report ships and equipment for free as well.  Hidden Fighter is an excellent card, as is Admiral Riker.  Personnel who download equipment -- especially a special download, which suspends play so you can download it when facing a dilemma that the equipment card lets you overcome -- are quite useful.<br>
<br>
Note that this principle complements the first one well: all the free-reporting methods in the world won&#146;t do you any good if you don&#146;t draw any more than the one card per turn normally allowed.  You&#146;ll exhaust the cards in your hand within a few turns, then be stuck without any cards to report for free.  <br>
<br>
Imagine the power if you combine the two, though.  Drawing a number of cards each turn not only feeds your free reports, but also gives you greater choice over what you report.  For instance, if you&#146;re using the Continuing Committee as a free-reporting method and you only have Senator Vreenak in your hand, then you play him.  No complaints, really -- after all, a free card is a free card.  But what if you have Senator Vreenak, Koval, and Parthok in your hand?  You can play whichever one will help you most right away.  <br>
<br>
Playing cards quickly is the best way to take advantage of drawing cards quickly.  Not only do you get more personnel, ships, equipment, events, etc. into play, but you also reduce your hand size, allowing you to use even more drawing mechanisms without running afoul of Scorched Hand, which in turn allows you to play more cards for free, etc.  Of course, there are practical limits to this cycle.  At a point it no longer becomes cost-effective to use card plays to set up more drawing or playing mechanisms.  At this point it&#146;s better to use those resources to use your existing mechanisms to play more cards.  There&#146;s no definitive cut-off, and only through experience do you find where to strike this balance.<br>
<br>
Of course, having a lot of cards on the table doesn&#146;t help you win if you don&#146;t do anything with them, which leads me to point three...<br>
<br>
3. Attempt missions quickly.<br>
<br>
...and by quickly, I mean *quickly.*  Especially with the &quot;jump-start&quot; cards -- Assign Mission Specialists (AMS), Assign Support Personnel (ASP), and Defend Homeworld (DH) -- you can overcome a variety of dilemmas within the first few turns of the game.  <br>
<br>
Concerning the jump-start cards, there are two basic philosophies.  One is to use them immediately, giving yourself a solid crew from which you can play Senior Staff Meetings on the first turn (e.g., AMS for Palteth and Takket, ASP for Tomalak, and DH for Tallera) or to attempt planet missions with certain key skills.  For example, using AMS for Takket and R&#146;Mal, ASP for Thei, and DH for Koval gives you 2 Exobiology and Geology.  You also have most of the major classifications plus Treachery and Archaeology, which many Romulan planet missions require.<br>
<br>
The other school of thought is to start attempting with your mission specialists downloaded during the seed phase and maybe a few personnel reported early in the game.  If you run into a dilemma you can&#146;t get past -- like Odo&#146;s &quot;Cousin&quot; -- then you use the jump-start cards to get specifically what you need.<br>
<br>
I tend to find the first method is stronger at space missions, because the Senior Staff Meeting gets you past one dilemma almost guaranteed.  At planets, however, the second strategy is superior, because you can get exactly what you need when you need it.  There&#146;s no risk of downloading, say, Koval with DH when you really needed Telak.  <br>
<br>
The important thing to remember -- and this may be hard for some players to get accustomed to -- is that most of your personnel are expendable if your deck successfully takes advantage of the first two principles.  It took me several months to get used to this idea after playing for years in a megateam-dominated game.  As long as you can consistently draw and play cards to replace ones killed off by attrition dilemmas, you can afford to be much less cautious with your personnel than earlier in the game&#146;s history.  Especially if you have a way to get killed personnel back, such as with Process Ore or Regenerate, don&#146;t have any regrets about sending personnel to their doom at mission attempts.<br>
<br>
Obviously, you can&#146;t just throw personnel blindly at a mission.  If you only have one Physics personnel in play, and you need Physics for several of your missions, protect that personnel.  Use common sense and your best judgment here.<br>
<br>
Another advantage of attempting missions early is that countdown-type dilemmas start to tick down earlier.  You can clear out dilemmas like Friendly Fire and Cytherians within the first turns of the game, making it easy for you to solve them later on when you&#146;ve reported more personnel.<br>
<br>
Also, when you run into walls, you have time to get what you need.  If you dally too long and you and your opponent are racing at missions at the same time, losing a turn or two because of walls could cost you the game.  If you had revealed the walls earlier, you would have a better idea of whom you would have to retrieve from your Q&#146;s Tent, whom you could risk at missions, and know what missions you can and can&#146;t solve if it comes down to a race at the end.<br>
<br>
I also tend not to attempt missions with more than four to six personnel at a time.  That&#146;s usually enough for mission requirements and a couple personnel to pass whatever wall came up.  It also limits the risk of dilemmas like The Higher... the Fewer, Denevan Neural Parasites, Aphasia Device, and Radioactive Garbage Scow/Destroy Radioactive Garbage Scow.<br>
<br>
Scans are also good to help speed your mission attempting, because you know when you can safely attempt.  Beware of anti-Scan cards, though, and don&#146;t rely on using them -- unless, of course, you draw one in your opening hand and are going first.  In that case you have the first action, so you can play a Scan before your opponent flips Q the Referee.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Now that I&#146;ve summarized what I think are the three keys to winning with a speed deck, I&#146;ll say that there is no cut-and-dry recipe you can follow for instant deck success.  It takes a good deal of skill and experience to successfully balance the three.  Using too many resources to draw and play cards, for instance, may take crucial turns to set up that slow down your mission attempting.  An overemphasis on playing cards leads to hand exhaustion, while an overemphasis on drawing cards leads to Scorched Hand vulnerability.  Attempting missions early without having a good way to replace lost personnel is another move that&#146;s likely to cause problems.<br>
<br>
If you can synthesize all three, though, you&#146;re in very good shape.  Take for instance the hologram/STP-drop speed deck I&#146;ve mentioned in some of my other posts.  You can find a decklist on this website in the decks section, under &quot;I Blatantly Ripped this Most Excellent Deck off of Jason Drake.&quot; (BTW I&#146;ve received several comments about stealing that deck from Jason, and I&#146;d like to clarify the situation.  I meant for this title to be more humorous than serious.  In reality I helped him with the deck for the 2000 World Championships.  The concept and deck skeleton were his, but we worked together to iron out some problems.  Sorry for any misunderstandings.)  The deck uses Kivas Fajo -- Collectors to draw cards, the jump-start cards and a Space-Time Portal drop to play cards quickly.  It takes advantage of the difficulty in killing holograms to start attempting quickly without worrying about mission requirements.<br>
<br>
Another example was the Dominion deck Brian Sykes played at the 2000 World Championships.  The deck drew cards quickly with Deyos and Kivas Fajo -- Collector, played quickly using The Great Link and a Jem&#146;Hadar Birthing Chamber.  Extraordinary Methods allowed him to start attempting earlier because he didn&#146;t have to worry as much about losing personnel to dilemmas.<br>
<br>
Yet another example is the now-infamous Cargo Run deck first brought into the spotlight by Ian Taylor at a Regional last year.  Multiple cargo runs each turn (using Distortion of Space/Time Continuum and Transwarp Conduit to good effect) allowed the deck to draw a huge number of cards each turn, while tons of Devidian Doors in the draw deck allowed the deck to play cards almost as fast as they were drawn.  Attempting missions early was no problem because of the sheer number of personnel on the table within the first turns of the game.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are exceptions.  Mike Harrington&#146;s 1999 World Championship deck used its speed for battle instead of mission-solving, for instance.  However, I think that a majority of top-placing decks employs the above tactics, whether the player is aware of it or just does it subconsciously.<br>
<br>
It takes practice and skill to master these concepts.  But it&#146;s an endeavor well worth your time and effort.  A deck that successfully uses them will win a number of games, perhaps even tournaments.  It&#146;s also important to know these even if you prefer a different type of deck, such as battle.  Many of your opponents will use these three points, so it&#146;s well worth knowing them, and planning how to counter them.<br>
<br>
I hope this was helpful.  Good luck,<br>
