<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>MND news on DT posted by DeckTech on Mon Nov 25 2002 <br>Just a quick update for you <b>Magi Nation Duel</b> fans.<br>
<br>
One: Everyone's favorite DT admin <b>Law</b> is going to be running a special DPC event in <b>Huntsville, AL</b> to celebrate the new <b>Voice of the Storms</b> release.  Huntsville is known for their outstanding players and gaming scene, and many cutting edge decks like <b>Aikido</b> and <b>Pure Energy</b> were developed there.  Yes, they'll be a <b>cash prize</b> to bring out the best too.  Formal date is not yet set, look for December date though, once everyone has all the cards.<br>
<br>
Also, <b>Ed Bolme</b>, formerly of 2i, has hooked up with <b>Lone Wolf Development</b> and is proud to announce their newest product <b>Card Vault</b>.  Card Vault is a deck maker program that supports multiple games (perfect for our DTers here).  Now what does this mean to you, other than a powerful program?<br>
<br>
It means contest!  Yep, contests and with prizes, no less!  Prizes from Lone Wolf, prizes from DT, and possibly prizes from 2i (and Decipher even for lord of the rings fans).  We're calling it the DT Christmas Blow out, so get those Voice cards ready to rumble.<br>
<br>
So thanks to Law and Ed Bolme.  Oh, and look for a review of Card Vault by everyone's favorite and outspoken DT co-creator <b>David "the founder" Akers</b>.<br>

We're looking for at least ONE MORE place to have a DPC cash tourney for that weekend!!  If you are interested in running one, and think you can pull down 15-20 people to welcome in VOTS, please CONTACT ME!<hr>Matthew Jensen said on Mon Nov 25 2002 <br>Sent you an email already. Salt Lake City is ready to host a DPC and could easily get 20+ people for a major event like this!<hr>Richard Riley said on Mon Nov 25 2002 <br>"that weekend", eh?  Not very specific there, Neal... :) With a bit more warning, I'm sure we could have pulled something together for the midwest, we've been aching to do something regional for awhile now but I don't know that Thanksgiving is the best time to try. :)<br>

<br>
My homeboy law is handling some of the organization, and ideas.  He really is a HUGE asset to the MND community and to DT.<hr>Gordon Kane said on Tue Nov 26 2002 <br>The weather should be fine in Texas (but a tourney on 12/21 conflicts with our Storyline event).  But considering that only the Dallas / Fort Worth area has any sustained sanctioned play (Austin and Lubbock did in 2001) - and no one in the surrounding states (OK, MN, or AR) play -- and the players in Louisiana are as young as my Fort Worth players (very few drive).<br>
Utah seems like a strong choice (but is that only when school is in session?) and the IL, IN, OH area seems to be quite vibrant.<br>

<hr>shivam bhatt said on Tue Nov 26 2002 <br>Hmm.  out here in northern california, i could get that many people out for a storyline tourny.  But with christmas break, it might be hard.  Shame you can't move one to january..<br>
However, if it does become possible to do this on a weekend in january, please let me know, and i will prep the community out here for it =)<hr>Richard Riley said on Fri Nov 29 2002 <br>Well, y'all in the midwest are welcome to show up to the Monarch Hyren story tourney on December 15, 1pm at Be A Gamer: 741 South 8th Street (Rte 31), West Dundee, IL. 847-844-7499 for directions and info.<br>
