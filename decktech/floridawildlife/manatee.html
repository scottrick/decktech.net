<p><font size=+2 face="arial" color="teal">Manatee</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  These creatures are truly Gentle Giants.
They are one of the most easy going animals you'll ever meet, they love to just hang out with 
their friends and family and play, take it easy and eat. Note that they are NOT dumb, they are very smart.

<p align="justify">The best 
place to see them are at power plants in the winter.  The power plants pump out water that's kind of 
warm, so being smart fellers the manatees gather there to hang out and warm up.  I recommend Big Bend
in Apollo beach if you are in Tampa, or a little further north is Crystal River, which is where I took
these pictures.

<p align="justify">Why so many Manatees are hit:<BR>
Unfortunately, as you may or may not know, many manatees in Florida 
each year are killed by these assinine power boats.  The manatees are smart, they hear the boat
at a good distance about 100 feet and start 
to submerge, but they are big and it takes a couple seconds.  Well, of course, these
retards in their macho boats are usually going like 60-100mph (literally) and they
just run right over the poor
manatees, and chop them up with their propellers. Animals just cannot move as fast as machines.

It is really rough stuff, could make a grown man cry.<BR><BR>
And all these manufacturers would have to do would be to put propeller guards or slow down these 
monstrous boats (I hate these things and their owners as you can tell)  Well, of course, then
the boat owners 
would complain, it would cost an extra few hundred dollars to put a propeller guard, my god, and 
these boats only costs 10's and 100's of thousands of $$$.  It's rare to see a
manatee that doesn't have propeller marks. Here's my first update to these pages in 6 years: Turns 
out the above mentioned manufacturors of power boats are trying to get manatees taken off 
the endangered species list. Cant have living beings getting the way of boat sales, now can we?

Hello!  Checking out visitors at Homosassa Springs.  The park rangers there will feed them, and lecture 
about manatees.  Homosassa is a GREAT place, I REALLY recommend it to nature lovers.

Manatees are vegetarians (like yours truly) and are very fond of carrots.

Yet another picture of a manatee swimming.  Sometimes for fun, they just do barrel rolls to show
they are happy.  They are excellent swimmers, and are actually graceful despite their large size.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
