<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Ibis are quickly identifiable by
their long curved beaks.  These are used for picking bugs such as grubs out of grass, and this
is where you'll most frequently find an Ibis.  Or should I say "some" Ibises.  They rarely are seen
alone, they seem to live with an extended family, and you'll see the whole group rummaging through a 
lawn picking here and picking there every few seconds.  There long beak makes it pretty easy for them, 
they barely even have to bend down!   When the birds are young they are brown, but slowly molt, 
becoming the full white you see below.  Despite their awkward appearance, they are good fliers, and 
with their wings extended they are much more colorful.

This was from a group of about 8 Ibises.  Check out that beak.  They are pretty nervous birds.
Ever see the movie The Dark Crystal?  They resemble the good wizards.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
