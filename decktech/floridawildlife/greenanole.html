<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Green Anole is
the very rare cousin to the ubiquitous Brown Anole.  These lizards at one time
lived all throughout Florida.  However, they have been outcompeted by the stronger,
faster Brown Anole, and there are relatively few left.  They move much slower than
their brown counterparts, depending more on camouflage, and a limited color change than
on speed.  They are much calmer, and seem to me to be more intelligent and friendly, also.
Rather than scurrying at the approach of a human, they often will study the onlooker.
Unfortunately, perhaps this helps explain their dwindling.</font></P>

This bloke changed color to brown within about a minute of this picture.  They are 
pretty rare.

<p><font size=-1>I apologize for the quality of the pictures,
 but until such time as I get better, and who 
knows when that will be, these are better than none.

Studying this strange picture taker.  If you look closely you'll see his head cocked in an 
inquisitive look.  He kept rotating his head to look at the giant from all angles.

This is a better picture.  Just like a Brown Lizard except slighter, and a beautiful shade of 
leaf green.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
