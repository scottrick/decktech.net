<p><font size=+2 face="arial" color="teal">A little info about me!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hello, all!  I'm Neal Razi, and
most of you visiting this page have probably met me in person.  Many of you I know from
playing Star Wars: CCG, and you'll notice the nod to the game in the layout of this site.
Others I probably have met throughout my travels in the wilderness.</font></P>

<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyhow, a little background may be
in order.  I have a Bachelor of Arts in History and
 a Associate of Science in Computer Programming (many years apart).  I have been designing
 Web Pages professionally for a number of years, both free-lance and for various companies
 (including the now defunct Virtual Technology).  If you need a web page, let me know!
 </font></P>

<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I am a vegetarian, and of course, animal friend.
I have about a million hobbies including diverse and bizarely
unrelated interests such as political theory, 
film, competition cards, nature, video games and working out.  I am quite a left-wing person politically,
not unexpectedly.  
I guess I stand out to a lot of people due to my Dreadlocks, which i've had for years.  If there is 
one thing I'd like to pass on to any of you reading this, especially if you are a teenager,
it's that it's ok to be different.  Don't worry about conforming, or not fitting in, just go 
with how ever you feel happy.  I've done it all my life, sometimes it's a little hard, but it's worth it 
in the long run.  Ok, so that is a little corny, but hey...
 </font></P>
 
 <p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it's a pleasure to know you all, 
 and I hope you enjoy this page.
 </font></P>

<font size=-1>This is the most current picture of me.  That's my great buddy, chewie, we spend 
unbelievable amounts of time together.  She is both amazingly intelligent, and incredibly athletic.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

</ul>
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.
<ul>
<li><a href="alligator.html">Alligator</a>
<li><a href="turtle.html">Turtle</a>

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.
<ul>
<li><a href="greenanole.html">Green Anole (lizard)</a>
<li>Osprey (a fishing hawk)

<li>Vultures

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
