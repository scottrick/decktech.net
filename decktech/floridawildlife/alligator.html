<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Most people outside of Florida
can't believe we have wild alligators running around.  These guys live in every part
of the state, as long as they can get some kind of swamp, and get
into all kinds of messes.  Generally afraid of humans, you have to look for them, as they
are masters at hiding.  A relic of the past, they don't need to evolve.  They are
almost perfectly suited to do what they do.  They are armor plated up top, have sharp teeth,
are very strong, and possess one mean tail.  One last thing.
 <blink><b><u>DO NOT FEED ALLIGATORS</u></b></blink>, this makes them
 unafraid of humans and as benign as they generally are, they are natural killers, and could
 easily kill a person if desired.</font></P>

Ridged armored back.  I've touched Alligator backs, you can NOT believe how tough these things are!

In all his glory.  Here I risk life and limb to get a picture of a full grown adult.  He was about
12-14 feet, and I'm guessing 1500 pounds.  Make sure you look at the back and that armor.  Believe 
it or not, the stories about an Alligator's speed are true.  They can "explode" at a moment's notice 
into a short burst of probably 30+ mph.  <a href="alligator4large2.jpg" target="snakewindow">Get the 
full picture!</a>.  Why would I risk becoming lunch to get a picture of this alligator?  I promised 
my buddy Alex I'd get him one!

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

</ul>
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

<li><a href="greenanole.html">Green Anole (lizard)</a>
<li>Osprey (a fishing hawk)

<li>Vultures

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
