<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Snakes are the stuff of legend.
Totally undeserving of their evil reputation, snakes are very sensitive and secretive
animals.  A marvel of nature, they move silently and can climb trees all without hands or
legs.  Bristling with muscle, quick as lightning, and with large fangs(some with poison),
snakes nevertheless are shy, and
almost immediately retire from humans, seeking to avoid trouble.  </font></P>

This fellow was about four feet and scared the heck out of me by jumping away in a huge spring.  
See him raising up.  This guy was very scared and was trying to warn me of that.  After I got this 
picture, he took off.

A beaut of a snake, about 5 feet long, and just 
happened to wander out in front of me.  It had been cold, and it was the first sunny day
 in awhile.  Snakes, being 
reptiles are cold blooded, and need to warm themselves to stay active.

The legendary forked tongue.  It is actually used similar to a nose to kind of "taste"
 the surroundings.  This means the snake is checking you out.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
