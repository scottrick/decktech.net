<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The ladybug is, of course,
not necessarily a lady.  They actually are predators, eating other insects.  The thing
about them that always surprises me is their ability to fly!  They look just like any ordinary bug,
as a matter of fact, their wings are curved to look like a shell.  Then they stop, and pop them out, and
as you stand there in surprise, hover away!</font></P>

We all know the ladybug, right?  Here he/she is looking like a crawling beetle.  This one 
performed the oh so familiar ritual for me.  He stopped, seemingly sprouted wings, stretched and
buzzed off!

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

</ul>
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
