<p><font size=+2 face="arial" color="teal">Turtle</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  These unique reptiles
(they are NOT amphibians) are well known for their ability to hide in their shells.  Most
can pull their whole arms, tails, and heads inside to hide from predators.  However, the
soft shell variety, pictured later, can only pull it's head in part way.  The reason for
this is their unusually long neck(fully extended it is quite humorous).  They need this long
neck since they are aquatic turtles, and enjoy laying on the bottom and stretching their
head and neck up to breathe.  Finally, if you hear a turtle "hiss" at you when they hide from
you, they are not actually hissing.  The hissing sound is caused by a rapid expulsion of air
from their lungs to make room for their head!</font></P>

Softshell Turtle.  These are very large, and you can see the webbed feet.  The shell is like
 leather.

Head on view.  Notice the long nose, and two nostrils.  A very cute animal, to me at least.

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

</ul>
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
