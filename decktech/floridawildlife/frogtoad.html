<p align="justify"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Frogs and Toads inhabit much of the world
and are extrememly common in Florida.  Florida even boasts many non-native species such as the
huge BUFO toad, an enormous variety that is actually poisonous!  Frogs and Toads are
very important environmental indicators as there populations are so sensitive to
environmental change, weather change, and polution, and are widely studied.  As a matter of fact,
it's very easy to sign up for volunteer classes where you listen to the number of different "croaks"
per hour and chart what species live near you.  Finally, these animals are EXTEMELY beneficial to man
as they eat all manner of obnoxious insects such as mosquitoes.</font></P>

<font size=-1>A rural toad.  Toads, while secretive, hop away at any nearby movement and thus are easy to spot.
They also can burrow very well and flatten themselves at a sign of danger!

<font size=-1>You can get an idea of this toad's size from the surrounding boxes.  Let's look closer.

<font size=-1>This toad took up an unusual residence in my garage.  Notice the peaceful almost
smiling face.  I moved him to the patio.</font>

<p align="center"><u><font face="arial" size=+2 color="green">Commonality list</font></u>
<p> This is my list of the likelihood of seeing various creatures based on my experiences.  Of course, 
you have to be in the right habitat, the odds of seeing a Dolphin in the forest are not very good.
 Also, these are based a lot on my local area of Hillsborough County (Tampa).  A 
hyperlink means some kind of info and probably some photos are available.
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="Red">Common</font></u>
<p>If you are in the appropriate habitat, you should run into one of these.  In many cases, you 
can't avoid them.

</ul>
<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="blue">Uncommon</font></u>
<p>These are harder to find.  You'll have to spend some time outdoors and probably look a little 
for these.  However, odds are you'll find one after a little effort.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="darkblue">Rare</font></u>
<p>Difficult to find.  Usually, it's just luck to find one, or you'll have to look very hard.  
You'll probably only see one every six months.

</ul>

<p align="center"> <u><font face="arial" size=+1 color="purple">Ultra Rare</font></u>
<p>Very difficult to find.  Most people, even people who spend a
fair amount of time outdoors, like me, never see one.  Consider
 yourself truely priviledged if you do catch a glimpse of one in the wild.
