Wow.  This is Mike French&#39;s build, with my strategy notes explaining our card choices for PCLA.<br />
<br />
Everyone should know how to play this deck by now.  Do not mulligan if you have any of the following cards in your hand: Boliver, Bastion, or Hounds + good cards.<br />
<br />
Only use S+D or Flame Trap on your opponent&#39;s initiative.  The exception is vs GLEEvil, play them once you stun Fixer.  The other exception is if you have NUTZ and aren&#39;t sure what to call.  I wanted a 4th S+D but couldn&#39;t fit it in.<br />
<br />
4x NUTZ because it is a solid card when you know what you&#39;re playing against.  Calling the proper card won me several games.  vs GLEEvil, call Cover Fire on your init so you can stun Fixer and play Flame Trap.  vs Tbolts, call Team Tactics on their init so you don&#39;t lose.  vs mirror, call Finishing Move on 6 if it&#39;s their init so you don&#39;t lose Bastion.  vs Avengers, call Heroes in Reserve on your init so you don&#39;t get stunned back.  vs Squadron, call Panacea Potion on your init so they don&#39;t recover.  this card will win you games when you know what you are doing.<br />
<br />
no finishing moves?  we wanted odds with the deck, felt the mirror was the most difficult matchup, and felt it was better to be able to NUTZ finishing move if we got it or NUTZ nasty surprise if we didn&#39;t.  NUTZ > finishing move.  plus good playing and getting your stuns > finishing move 4 times out of 5.<br />
<br />
only 3 genoshas?  in today&#39;s rush environment, we felt it was more important to play cards that helped us reach 7 than a card that basically only works on 7.  we experimented with 3 mags and 4 genoshas, but missing mags was not worth it.<br />
<br />
only 2 hounds?  i know mark slack was advocating a version of CS that concentrated more on the hounds lock, but we felt the hounds lock was very disruptable via no man escapes, s+d, flame trap, hawkeye, natasha romanoff...so with that many options it doesn&#39;t make sense to focus on it.  we felt that the real strength of CS is in the later turns, 5-7, so focusing on the early turns, except to make sure you survive them, just doesn&#39;t matter as much.  of course, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that slack beat me in round 5...but that was entirely due to my unbelievably bad draw, not his hounds lock.<br />
<br />
the deck put me in day 2, which is all i needed it to do.  i&#39;m not posting it to be original, just for my own archive. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
