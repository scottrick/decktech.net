<br />
this is a revision of the frenchs&#39; Seaciety deck that mike posted a while back.  with Infinite Crisis almost street legal, this takes some of their cooler cards and throws them into the society as a dominant splash.<br />
<br />
this deck is all about control.  not in a Doom way or a making attacks fail way, just in a general way it controls the action of the game and lets you make a thousand decisions about how to dismember your opponent.  and if you make it to 8, Ultrahumanite + Divided We Fall is absolutely ridiculous.  stun and KO my 8 drop to take control of your 7 and 8 drops?  deal.<br />
<br />
you should prolly stop now and go read <a href=&quot;http://www.decktech.net/vs/decks/decks.php?deck=35421&quot;>the strat on this deck</a> to make sure you know the basic gist of the Seaciety deck.  the interaction between Straight to the Grave and Sorcerer&#39;s Treasure.  why Aquaman is good.  how Gorilla Grodd is Jack Bauer of 6 drops.  etc.<br />
<br />
the obvious improvements to the deck include the new Mr Mxyiohfasdnaskptlk, who jumps back into your hand from your KO pile every turn.  him + slaughter swamp or science spire means you draw an extra card every turn.  your hand keeps getting bigger.  that&#39;s sweet.<br />
<br />
steel + quadromobile is hot like fire.  play quadro on 3 or 4 to get the atk bonus, discard it to get a location back (maybe one you STTG&#39;d for), then play steel and bring it back from KO to make him a 10/11.  that&#39;s pretty good for a 5 drop.<br />
<br />
kelex helps you get locations.  simple as that.  it&#39;s doubly sweet when you have steel in your hand when you recruit him, so you can actually ditch just 1 card to get that location you so desperately need.<br />
<br />
what does Villains United add to the deck?<br />
5 drop Talia is amazing, especially in a deck that plays a lot of Slaughter Swamp, a Science Spire, and Sorcerer&#39;s Treasure.  she will put a guy into play almost every turn after she comes into play.<br />
<br />
Dr. Psycho beats out the boomerang guy in my book.  mostly because he can work off init as well.  and 4 atk ain&#39;t bad, with a kick/no man he takes out most 4 drops.<br />
<br />
the VU Dr Light is arguably better than the EE one....except for the teamstamp thing.  you don&#39;t have to get the guys into your KO pile where they&#39;re susceptible to Phantom Zone or screwed over by Absolute Domination.  and it can really mess up an opponent who wasn&#39;t paying attention.<br />
<br />
Science Spire is frimbazeling amazing, and provides the real synergy between the two teams.  it is super card advantage, especially since it works on stunned characters so you&#39;re not really losing a guy to use it.  and it fills your KO pile at the same time, setting off deadshot and blockbuster.  it also works as a way to fizzle character-stealing like Grodd.  and of course the first card you discard with it is a 2 drop that Talia throws into play.<br />
<br />
Coercion obviously makes it all work....thus the calculator to pull it and two of it just in case you need to team with Lex&#39;s Revenge Squad to get Bizarro World and LexCorp online.  because Revenge Squad is super-awesome (except for all their sucky characters).<br />
<br />
Fatality is ridic.  she&#39;s just crazy.<br />
<br />
and Arms Deal provides you with a way to recruit 11 points of guys on turn 6.  that&#39;s crazy.  all you have to do is discard your hand to do it, which is also cool because you play out of your KO pile so much anyway.  with mr mxypwpahehhksdkslk jumping back into hand and science spire and stuff working all game long, it&#39;s not such a huge cost to pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
cards i wanted to add but couldn&#39;t:<br />
<br />
phantom zone<br />
transubstantiation (ok i can&#39;t remember the name of it, it says pay 3 to replace target location or ongoing)<br />
professor zoom (just because he&#39;s totally sweet)<br />
project liberator for Grodd on Grodd action<br />
another bizarro world (it&#39;s crazy busted this time)<br />
the new nasty surprise, whatever it&#39;s called, the +3 and +3 more one<br />
speedy<br />
another mikado (not mosha though, she sucks)<br />
another revenge squad guy, maybe bizarro (VU/RS)<br />
some other stuff i can&#39;t remember right now.<br />
