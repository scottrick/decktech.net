the key to this deck is bouncing attacks so you go late game and allow your incredible 1-2 punch of Magneto + Phoenix clean up. even without the common doom elements, this deck has a lot of control over the game thanks to emma and jean grey.<br />
<br />
mulligan for a 2 drop. either bouncing a character with boomerang or drawing extra cards all game long with sage is good. hitting doom is next on the agenda, as he allows you to go get the plot twist you need for the matchup. Crisis Doom - have a blast. TNB - system failure. quickfate - flame trap. Frankie Raye engine/Teen Titans/voltage - Political Pressure.<br />
<br />
i dropped the archangels from the original Mastsumi Ibamoto decklist and upped it to 4 sages because the archangels just weren&#39;t doing anything for me. they hit far too inconsistently, and after turn 1 they were just blank cards with the wrong team affiliation for enemy of my enemy. so i just added cerebro, so i have 2 rather than 4 cards dedicated to cycling my characters out in anticipation of jean grey resetting my row. meltdown&#39;s real function is right there, improving the jean grey drawing engine, but it can also help you beat quickfate and moloids. eye of the storm is in for the moloids and high voltage (also helps vs TNB) matchups, where you can turn it down every turn with emma.  although vs moloids you want to search out sunfire, as he can stun zazzala before the combat phase.<br />
<br />
prefered play on turn 7 is of course Magneto. Exodus is still in x2 because 1-he&#39;s reservist in case you row&#39;d him with jean grey, 2-he replaces characters you row&#39;d with jean grey, saving you endurance by doing so, 3-he&#39;s mental so you can discard him for sage, emma, or jean grey, and helps Phoenix lock if you lost your other characters. i&#39;ve almost completely decided to take out Mysterium because games *never* go to 9, but i&#39;m wondering if i shouldn&#39;t just replace him with galactus. because i usually have evens, that means my opponent would play Galactus first, then i would follow with my own Galactus, gaining back all that endurance and virtually assuring (thanks to my superior card drawing, plus my ability to bounce attacks) the win vs this hypothetical galactus deck. but really i think i&#39;d just rather play another savage beatdown or avalon or m&m.<br />
<br />
forcing the system failures to work is the real purpose of the two beatdowns, but they can also help you close out a tight game with some breakthrough in a pinch, esp if you get to turn one down with emma.  nobody expects that.<br />

PS Sorry i posted this again so fast after the first post, but i feel the deck is waaaay better in this build than it was before.  there were some real bad card choices before. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
