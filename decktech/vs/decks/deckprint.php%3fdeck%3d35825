There is no-one in the world who likes playing Vs. more than Adam Prosak. The man from Phoenix, Arizona is always smiling while playing the game—and he’s also pretty good at it. Before this Top 8, he made the final day at Pro Circuit Amsterdam and the elimination rounds of eight $10Ks (with two wins). But the thing he likes doing most is playing The Big Deck format, a format of his own devising that forces players to play only one copy of any card, as well as a 100-card deck.<br />
<br />
Adam is part of a relatively new team called Team Mxyback, who came up with an innovative Doom/Devil’s Due control deck that abuses interactions between Frankie Raye &#9674; Nova, Optimistic Youth and The Phantom Stranger, Wandering Hero to gain massive amounts of card advantage whilst piling on counters on Dr. Doom, Diabolic Genius.<br />
<br />
Adam is paired against Loren Nolen’s X-Heralds stall deck tomorrow, and had this to say about his chances: “I helped Loren tweak it, so I think I have a good shot. Even though I didn’t play against the TDC stall deck, I think our team never lost to it during the rounds.”<br />

this is one of the more complicated decks you&#39;ll likely see for VS.  the deck revolves around the best drawing engine to date: Frankie Raye + Phantom Stranger.  discard a card to recruit Frankie for free (or tap dr light to bring her into play from your KO pile).  as a response to her coming into play ability, tap her and one other character (usually poison ivy or haywire) to return Phantom Stranger to your hand from your KO pile, then discard him to Frankie&#39;s come into play power to draw two cards.  thus every time you recruit frankie, you are discarding one card (and putting one into play from your hand) to draw 2.  combined with Secret Sanctuary, which basically says &quot;activate--> take haywire into hand from KO pile&quot;, Mr Mxy (who returns to your hand at the start of every recruit step), and avalon space station discarding scarlet witch to get two cards back, gives you massive card advantage.  also, every time you play reign of terror, you can also return your exhausted haywire to your hand and re-recruit him, so you can go get phantom stranger more efficiently.<br />
<br />
using this drawing engine, you set up dr doom on turn 4 with devil&#39;s due to get huge amounts of +1/+1 counters by KO&#39;ing all those haywires and frankie rayes you are recruiting every turn.  you also use poison ivy to set up your resource row with the locations you need.  and against cards that target you the player directly, you can KO all characters except Doom to Devil&#39;s Due and flip up Mutant of the Year to negate those cards.  you use reign of terror + deadshot + speedy + robot destroyer to wreck your opponent&#39;s board.  eventually you recruit Mephisto, revealing Asmodeus from hand to gain +1 atk for every card in your and your opponent&#39;s KO&#39;d piles, and atk for HUGE amounts of breakthrough to win the game.<br />
<br />
the deck is really weak to resource disruption in the early turns, so that&#39;s one of the best ways to derail it...with that in mind, some improvements to the decklist could prolly be made.  overall, however, this deck went 8-2 day one, and won the event on day three, so it&#39;s pretty strong. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
