                              <br>
                              First things first, passive mode usually means you 
                              have either never submitted any decks, articles 
                              or tournament reports or it has been more than 3 
                              weeks since your last submission. </font></font></font></font></p>
                            <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                              get out of Passive mode simply go to the submission 
                              wizard and submit something. Your membership will 
                              automatically be upgraded to Active and your submission 
                              added to the datashare.<br>
                              <br>
                              Keep in mind only Active Members have access to 
                              the DataShare. If you let your account slide into 
                              passive mode you will only be able to view submissions 
                              that are older than 3 weeks. That means you will 
                              be getting everything 3 weeks later than the Active 
                              members. It pays to be an Active member. </font><font size="5"><br>

                              Why can't I just type anything as my submission?<br>
                              <br>

                              you just type anything into your submission without 
                              putting any care or work into it, the Active Members 
                              might rate you into passive membership. Lets say 
                              you add a deck with 1 location and 59 Omni Boxes 
                              your tech rating could fall so low that you would 
                              be kicked back into passive mode. When this happens 
                              you have been pacified.<br>
                              <br>
                              Here is the deal with Tech Ratings, everyone starts 
                              with 1500 when you submit each member can choose 
                              to review and rate your submission. If it is OK 
                              or better you get points added if it's bad you get 
                              points subtracted. Go below 1300 and your account 
                              gets put into passive mode for 4 weeks! OUCH!</font></font></font></font></p>

                              you submit obviously 'corrupt' data into the datashare 
                              or your Tech Rating falls below 1300 you become 
                              Pacified. While pacified you can not access the 
                              member only Archive. <br>

                              Points are added or subtracted from your tech Rating 
                              based on the average rating you receive for each 
                              submission. Each time someone reviews one of your 
                              submissions your tech rating is adjusted. Here is 
                              an example.<br>
                              <br>
                              You submit your &quot;Eloms Cheese&quot; deck. Your 
                              friend, Bill &quot;Vaderless&quot; Smith, reviews 
                              your deck and says, &quot;I give this deck a perfect 
                              rating ‘cause it always beats me&quot;. <br>
                              <br>
                              Your rating jumps up 100 points! Perfect ratings 
                              always are worth +100 to your Tech Rating. The next 
                              person who reviews your deck does not share your 
                              friend’s enthusiasm, and gives your deck a rating 
                              of 6. What happens? We subtract 100 from your Tech 
                              Rating and add the new points (40) back to balance 
                              out your rating. <br>
