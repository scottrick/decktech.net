<br>
Want to earn a spot on your national team for The Lord of the Rings TCG? Now is the time, and now is your chance! Decipher announces a new tournament program this year, the World Cup of Lord of the Rings TCG! What is the World Cup, you ask? It's an International Team Championship, where the best players from each country form a team to play the very best players from other countries around the world. The individual World Championship is separate and will take place at DecipherCon 2002 as scheduled (the location and date for DecipherCon 2002 will be announced on decipher.com soon). <br>
<br>
This October, teams from all over the globe will descend on Europe for a no-holds-barred championship to determine the best national team on the planet! The event will be held the week of October 16-18. The second and third day of competition will be at the Spiel convention in Essen, Germany. Stay tuned to decipher.com for details on the venue for the first day of competition. <br>
<br>
Each member from the team that wins the World Cup will receive a paid trip and accommodations to New Zealand, where The Lord of the Rings trilogy was filmed. They will also be treated to a special tour of the WETA Workshops for a behind the scenes look at how the costumes, props, and special effects for the movie were made! The second place team members will receive $1000 each, third place team members will receive $500 each, and the fourth place team members will receive $250 each. <br>
<br>
<B>How to qualify for your National Team:</B> <br>
<br>
On August 5th, we will compile the results from all sanctioned tournaments scheduled before that date to determine lifetime tournament ratings for The Lord of the Rings TCG (next year, year-to-date ratings will determine the national team members). All tournaments run after August 4th will not count towards the tally for World Cup team membership. <br>
<br>
&#8226; By August 19th, we will announce the top three lifetime rated players from each country in constructed deck one-versus-one tournaments, who will be awarded a spot on the national team representing their country. <br>
<br>
&#8226; If a player on a team is unable to make the event, their spot on the national team will be given to the next highest lifetime rated player from that country. <br>
<br>
&#8226; Players who qualify for their National Team will have three days from the date they are selected to accept/decline the invitation to the World Cup tournament. If no acceptance is given within that time period, their spot will be given to the next highest lifetime rated player from that country. <br>
<br>
&#8226; Players will need to pay for their own accommodations and trip to the World Cup. (Decipher will have more information at a later date on team sponsorships through various companies). <br>
<br>
Rules of the tournament: <br>
<br>
&#8226; The National Teams from around the world will compete in a double elimination style tournament. If your team loses two *matches, they will be eliminated from the tournament. <br>
<br>
&#8226; The tournament will use a normal double elimination bracket system to determine which teams play against each other. <br>
<br>
&#8226; Teams will be *seeded based on the team's average cumulative rating, with the highest being ranked #1. <br>
<br>
&#8226; Each member of a team will be paired with an opponent on the opposite team. The higher seeded team in a match will first select a member of their team and a player on the opponent's team to play. Then, the lower seeded team will select one of their players that has not already been selected, and a player on the opponent's team that has not already been selected to play. The final pairing in a match will be the remaining players on each team that had not already been selected. <br>
<br>
&#8226; For a player to win their pairing, they will need to beat their opponent in two out of three games. <br>
<br>
&#8226; Two out of three players on a team will need to win their pairings for the team to win the match and move on to the next round. <br>
<br>
&#8226; The team that wins the World Cup are the Team World Champions! The Team World Champions and the World Champion (a single player to be determined at DecipherCon 2002) are separate titles. <br>
<br>
You have just over six months to start playing in your local events and work on your rating. Let the games begin! <br>

Good job guys.<hr>Mark Balderston said on Sun Feb 10 2002 <br>everyone . . . please push for regional teams for america.  it is NOT right that america has only one team.  there are more lotr players in america than all other countries COMBINED.  so email decipher, post on the messageboards, whatever.<br>
<br>
Mark<hr>Erick Butzlaff said on Sun Feb 10 2002 <br>I agree with this, though I don't agree with regions.  South, North, East, and West would be one thing, but having around 8 different regions for all the parts of the United States is absurd; despite the fact that the US is alot bigger in player base than any other country it is one country, I can understand where that is coming from.  If you don't have a chance in the first place, which is indicated by this whining, then why are you worried about it anyways?<hr>Bastian Winkelhaus said on Mon Feb 11 2002 <br>I totally agree with Mark. And while your at it, tell Decipher to move the location to the USA.<br>
It is NOT right, that those poor americans would have to pay that flight over the pond :-)<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

<hr>Erick Butzlaff said on Mon Feb 11 2002 <br>You damn German, so nationally-biased :)  Lol.<hr>Yannick Lapointe said on Mon Feb 11 2002 <br>i think i will have to restart playing lotr, cant wait to see team québec dominate:P <hr>jason baretta said on Tue Feb 12 2002 <br>don't expect to see many of us Aussies at World Cup. it would cost close to $1800 to fly to Germany to compete. to get to New Zealand would be about $350. <br>
oh well<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Tue Feb 12 2002 <br>The US will dominate. Europeans are to into Pipeweed and Canadians are ...well...canadian.<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Tue Feb 12 2002 <br>Im just kidding of course. It should be really cool. <br>
<br>
Its to bad they use the rankings to pick players but I dont know how else you could do it.<hr>Keya Saleh said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>We only get one team in the US for Oylmipic events so why should this be different?<hr>Michael Dalton said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>Uh, maybe cause the US players prolly contribute a large portion of the money to put on this event (through buying cards).  Why should they not get to benefit at an equivalent proportion?<hr>Mark Balderston said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>umm in the Olympics teams like america and russia still send more athletes than other countries do . . . of course I'd still want to go to Germany . . . just because it would be neat (and virginia is boring).<hr>tyng-yann yen said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>who would have thought that a competition could be held based on merit?<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>mark, that's not a very good anology...every country CAN send as many players as the next...they just don't have the ability to do it. though i do agree that the US should have more than one team.<hr>John Arendt said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>Edmund - Mark's right.<br>
<br>
For most sports, each country gets a reserved spot for an athlete.  And then the proficient countries get to send additional athletes, usually based on previous world competitions and rankings.  Ex:  US only had 2 distance speed skaters qualified whereas the Netherlands had like 4.<hr>edmund gray said on Wed Feb 13 2002 <br>oh, ok.<hr>Owen Burke said on Thu Feb 14 2002 <br>Will your combined scores from tournaments in different countries be taken into account in this? Some europeans travel a bit to play and have had results in  more than one place. My results in Ireland shouldn't be discarded because I start playing in France etc etc. Anyone know anything about this?<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Thu Feb 14 2002 <br>It will be Decipher rankings I believe. Doesnt matter where you play...it matters where you live permanently Im sure.<hr>Dominik Jastrzebski said on Mon Feb 18 2002 <br>It's a great idea...Can't wait to kick american asses :-) lol
