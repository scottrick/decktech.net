It should be a lot of fun<hr>Paul Myers said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>Dido, this is gonna be a blast.<hr>David Jones said on Wed Mar 27 2002 <br>Any Idea when we can get a confirmed DPC Vegas schedule?<hr>Tim Guzman said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>At least one more week, before the event schedule for Vegas is Final.<hr>Adam Drake said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>This DPC is almost beginning to feel like a mini convention. I only wish I could find people to run other games, possibly on Friday OR Saturday night. We would definitely like to find someone to do a Raw Deal tournament for us. Also, the War Room is holding a Junior Super Series tournament for Magic on Saturday, so there will be plenty of MTG booster drafts and other side events, for thise who like that kind of thing. Personally, I think this event makes an excellent jump off point for the convention season, as the decks that you see played for all games will be those that will be competitive for the next few months. By the way, Vegas sounds like it is shaping up to be an excellent event as well, and I would love to go, but the only card game I allow myself to play in Vegas is Blackjack... hehe.<hr>Rich Dailey said on Thu Mar 28 2002 <br>What?  No Trek?<hr>Jim Colson said on Fri Mar 29 2002 <br>Rich,<br>

It's not my show, that's Adam Drake's call, BUT...<br>
<br>
If you get over to Dr. NO's there in Atlanta/Marietta and find out if that group is interested or not, if you can drum up 6-8 core local players, I'm sure that there will be other Trek Players there to also participate, I believe that the Lacey Brothers will be participating in the LOTR tournament on Sat, And I KNOW they would participate in a STCCG event.  I would be willing to run a STCCG one AFTER the LOTR one on Sat eve say around 8pm?   BTW, I did pass my level 2 Judge test for STCCG.  My first CCG.  :)<br>
<br>
Let us know!<br>

P.S. On Chris O'Faga - Never argue with an idiot. People might not know the difference.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Apr 2 2002 <br>good to have you back, big guy!<hr>Joshua Grancell said on Tue Apr 2 2002 <br>Ive got a question that really isnt relavent to this topic at all, but this seems like the best place to put it, so i will anyways. Ive got a pretty good STCCG collection, but most of the decks that i find online contain rather rare cards, such as GTTT, and large quantites of them. Is there any place where i can find good decks that i can make, or do they just plainly dont exist?<hr>Jim Colson said on Tue Apr 2 2002 <br>The best sites are:<br>

<br>
http://www.wnohgb.com/   -- Where no one has gone before<br>
http://www.gameplayersnetwork.com/  -- GPN has a bunch of STCCG decks as well<br>
http://www.kedanya.org/  -- Kedanya Station.<br>
http://www.milligan.edu/bible/rcheard/stccg/index.htm  -- Unimatrix Zero One<br>
<br>
The first one, WNOHGB, has a 'WEB-RING' Link, there are 81 STCCG related web sites on that Web Ring.  This should be plenty to get you started.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps<br>

<hr>Adam Drake said on Tue Apr 2 2002 <br>The return of the Diplomat, Gabe Alonso  to Atlanta... Hey Gabe, while you are in town we should visit New Wave... Oh wait, they went out of business. Something about losing all their good employees. I'll alert the crew. I am sure Rudy and Matt will want to stop by and say hello. Just one question, though. Will the student have become the master?? Can't wait to catch up.
