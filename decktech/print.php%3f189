<hr><b>comments</b><hr>Neal Razi said on Fri May 17 2002 <br>sparkz - you've outdone yourself!  Now this is a spoiler.  This guy is actually good in running decks<hr>Matthew Ley said on Fri May 17 2002 <br>Wow, that would be a very good card.  The other site 6's cost the same and have a limited ability?  Still an archer too?  Wow.<hr>Grzesiek Paterka said on Fri May 17 2002 <br>Yeah, he did *amazing* job - go and check www.decipher.com if you want to see the pic too ;)<br>
BTW - there are two more spoilers mentioned in todays RFD.<hr>Kyle Szklenski said on Sat May 18 2002 <br>Just thought I'd mention that it's actually Calaglin, with that L in there. Here are the spoilers from RFD:<br>
Might of Numenor - Gondor event - 1 twilight cost - Tale. Maneuver: Spot a Gondor companion to reveal a card at random from opponent's hand, heal X companions where X is the twilight cost of the card revealed. Common<br>
<br>
Isengard Axe - Possession hand weapon - 0 twilight cost - +2 strength - Bearer must be Isengard ORC. When you play this weapon, add 1 twilight. Common.<br>
<br>
There ya go.<hr>Noah Moscovitch said on Sat May 18 2002 <br>Calaglin isn't as good as he looks. For those who didn't notice, his action is a REGROUP not an archery. The Isengard Axe though ;). That's cool.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sat May 18 2002 <br>regroup action = good for decks that want to double move. Plus he's another site 6 archer ally, thats never a bad thing :)<hr>Matt Townend said on Mon May 20 2002 <br>This card is AWESOME.  It's like a Gondor's Vengence that stays in play if you use it in conjuction with Galadriel and/or Celeborn!  What's not to like about this card?  Double move, here I come!<br>
<br>
And the BEST thing is you get to do it BEFORE they reconcile their hand!  So, against Nazgul with All Blades Perish, they probably won't block the wounds!  OWNAGE!<hr>Wes Simpson said on Mon May 20 2002 <br>Pretty cool. Also, on the image of the card on Decipher, the "Elf of Lórien" subtitle is off a little...<hr>Geoff Snider said on Mon May 20 2002 <br>you guys are so behind on the spoilers these days.
