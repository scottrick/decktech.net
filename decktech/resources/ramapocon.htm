      Lingrell, the mastermind behind last year's RamapoCon event, is back again 
      this year with the bigger and better RamapoCon II, scheduled for May 5-7. 
      Ramapo College in Mahwah, NJ will be hosting the event, and hotel information, 
      directions, and ongoing updates are available at the official website- <a href="http://orion.ramapo.edu/%7Eslingrel">http://orion.ramapo.edu/~slingrel</a><br>
      <BR>
      The prizes to be given out are even more impressive than the schedule, if 
      such a thing is possible. In addition to the trophy, the winner of the individual 
      championship will take home a Darth Vader foil, and the individual who places 
      highest in the team championship will receive a complete set of Endor foils. 
      Other prizes for various events include Ben and Luke foils, a complete set 
      of unlimited premiere, custom-designed RamapoCon t-shirts, and hundreds 
      of rares, foils, and signed cards. The prize list is growing weekly as more 
      donations and funding become available (with uncut sheets rumored to be 
      a possibility), so expect even more by the time May rolls around.<br>
      <BR>
      Last but not least, who will you see when you come to RamapoCon? Last year's 
      defending Champion Jonathan Chu, of course. Who else? Former world finalists 
      TJ Holman, Ray Bordier, Clint Hays, Steve Brentson, and Matt Sokol, who 
      also doubles as one of the two attending grand slam winners, joined by Charlie 
      Herren. Other Masters in attendance include Chris and Brian Terwilliger, 
      and Wojiech Jankowski. Rumor has it His Majesty himself, Juz Pakes, may 
      attend. Team Albany will be bringing their trademark enthusiasm, with most 
      of the Ghetto Squadron and the Philly Crew there as well. Ghetto Leader 
      Greg Hodur will be overseeing Ghetto War with a dewrag, a golden spork, 
      and a pack of Phillies blunts for the winner (and woe betide the unfortunate 
      individual who comes in second... Just ask Chris Talbot...)<br>
      <BR>
      Last year's attendance number of 48 is expected to be left in the dust as 
      more and more pre-registrations keep coming in. Scott Lingrell is accepting 
      any questions, as well as pre-registrations through May 1st, so send your 
      command card info to <a href="mailto:slingrel@ramapo.edu">slingrel@ramapo.edu</a> 
      or <a href="mailto:crngwell@aol.com">crngwell@aol.com</a>. <br>
      Admission for the entire weekend of events is just $7 if pre-registered 
      by May 1st. Registration at the door costs $10 and will include all events. 
      Everyone one will receive tons of prizes and special "storyline prizes" 
      will also be given out all weekend. All serious SW players from the East 
      coast and beyond will be there, so don't miss out on one of the best opportunities 
      to rub elbows with some of the best and brightest there are! <br>
