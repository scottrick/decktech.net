                          That's right, he's here and as angry as ever with an 
                          axe to grind that could lop off a head. You, and we 
                          here at Decktech, NEVER know what he'll say next. You 
                          might be ecsatic , you might be furious, you might want 
                          to lynch someone. Well, guess what! <b>You get to have 
                          your say</b>. That's right, after reading the OzyRant 
                          you'll be able to comment on the current editorial. 
                          And if you are really, really, lucky, The Wizard of 
                          Oz himself may grace you by responding to your comment. 
                          Only one thing here will be sure. Some heads are gonna 
                          roll, 'cause when Ozymandias winds up, it's a fastball 
                          right at your head. We can't control him, so we are 
                          just going to let him speak his mind. If that bothers 
                          you DO NOT click the "I Agree" Button, please leave. 
                          If there is one thing we believe in here at Decktech, 
                          it's that idea interchange is never bad, even if it 
                          is something you hate. As someone great once said, who 
                          i can't remember now, "I may disagree with what you 
                          say, but I'll defend your right to say it to the death". 
                          If you do click "I Agree", check your mind and your 
                          respect at the door. Of course, after reading the disclaimer 
                          you know that what goes on here is strictly free speech, 
                          and you acknowledge that your dainty little feelings 
                          will not be hurt, this is for the hard-core. If you 
                          disagree, you will not go weeping to the listserve or 
                          BBS crying, "Ozy hurt my feelings, Ozy shattered my 
                          world", No, you will take it like a man (or a woman) 
                          , you'll fight back your tears, and you'll give as good 
                          as you got, in the response area. Now on to the contract.
