		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=4 face='times'>W</font>ell, I suppose everyone is 
		  curious to know how the <b>Florida Grand Slam</b> went off.  I'm up after just dropping off
		  <b>Matt Lush</b> at the airport and driving most of the night, so here's a real unofficial(fun)
		  tournament report.
		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me start off by
		  saying the amount of talent at this tournament was huge.  I mean huge.  The best
		  example I can give is that I played all 6 games against players who were either  just under or squarely in the 1900's and
		  one 2000!  Decktech regulars and
		  swccg masters <b>Matt 'Old Skooler' Lush</b> and <b>John 'Crash Beedo' Arendt</b>
		  had flown in
		  to hang out with David and I and compete.  <b>Clint 'Gamemaster' Hays</b> was there all the way from Tennessee.
		  <b>Gabe 'The Diplomat' Alonso</b> was ready for his anticipated big comeback .
		  <b>Charlie 'CommieBoy' Herren</b> had BUSED all the way down from Georgia.  All the really good Florida regulars including 
		  <b>Mike Bellefatto, Walter Cowart, David Irvine, Alfonso Martinez, Ozymandias, David Akers,
		  Mike Fitzgerald, Lee Edwards, Nick Mayer</b>(notable exception: Jason Burrows), and many others who I am probably forgetting due to lack of sleep. 
		  Really great level of play (and people).  So after a really wild, off the wall, and dirty joke 
		  filled 2 and a half hour trip from Tampa in my 130,000 mile car jammed full with me(<b>Neal 'dredlox' Razi</b>), John, Matt, and
		  <b>Leonard 'Master Yoda' Mitchell</b>, we were all ready.
		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let me cut to the chase.  CommieBoy was on fire.
		  It was, as John put it, "CommieBoy's day of destiny".  He could do no wrong.  With four games down, 
		  the only undefeateds were Charlie, John, and me.  So it was going to be ugly.  John and Charlie ended up
		  squaring off, meaning they'd play each other twice, and I got 'lucky' (yeah right) and got to play 'only' Matt 
		  Lush and David Irvine (losing to both).  Charlie actually took John down twice, a very difficult feat 
		  and ended up as the only undefeated (with a monster differencial).  It was an amazing 
		  display of Star Wars: ccg by not only Charlie but nearly everyone.
		  
		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a few quick notes about the people involved.  Let me start with the TD's.
		  <b>Chuck Lund</b> and <b>Mitch Velasco</b> were great, funny, relaxed, and did an absolutely flawless job
		  of running the tournament.  Gabe was in hilarious form, as usual, he is a true entertainer(as well as
		  a great player).  After actually 
		  getting to talk to Clint, for those of you who don't know him but dislike him, he is really great 
		  guy.  Ozy was a blast as usual.  Matt's display of rapid fire, raunchy jokes impressed even me.  John 
		  kept us all light with one liners.  I actually really want to thank John and Matt for
		  spending the big cash on airline tickets and coming down.  And David of course is the ultimate straight man.
		  I got to meet Leonard Mitchell, and <b>'Elminster'</b> both really, really cool.  Lee was another
		  who just had me in tears with the comedy.  Mike Bellefatto and I had an amazing game just BEATING each other down in space, and 
		  yucking it up all the way (battle damage spillovers three times and tallon rolls it was wild).  
		  And of course, good old
		  Sorsceror, a great kid.  Hell, even the store owner was cool!  I could go on like this for hours, but I'll just stop with the people 
		  I most missed were <b>Queen Jawa</b> and <b>Jason Burrows</b>.  I was really looking forward to 
		  seeing Jason again, he is a fantastic player, and a really cool guy.  
		  
		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I want to end with Props to Commieboy.  From 
		  what I could see he played incredibly.  He was laughing, he was totally magnanimous in his wins, 
		  he even poked fun at himself.  This is after busing all night from Georgia, meeting up with David 
		  in a strange downtown, and getting crammed into my afore mentioned 1986 Mirage Hatchback (a truely 
		  unsung hero to me, affectionately called the <i>Falcon</i> by all who know 
		  and love her), with <b>SIX</b> guys for a one hour trip to Brandon!  So I think karmically, 
		  Charlie deserverd it.  But don't let this victory go to your head, Charlie!!!
		  
		  <p align="justify">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that's it for now, Lee and I did take some 
		  pictures, as soon as they are ready, I'll put some up here.  So what was the point of this little
		  report?  Where were the decklists?  Believe me, they'll be all coming with plenty of reports.  My 
		  point here is for those newer or upcoming players to seriously think about traveling out to 
		  a couple major tournaments.  As Gabe said, it's the only way to get good.  And not only will 
		  your game improve immensely, you'll probably have a really difficult, but really fun trip, and 
		  walk away with some good friends.  Thanks for reading.<br>
