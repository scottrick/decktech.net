<br>
I just wanted to drop a quick note because there has been some concern of the power and rarity of the Promo Darth Vader.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, not enough of this card has been released to the general public and though we feel that the card is not overpowered we want to ensure that every one feels they have a fair chance of winning the Champs.  Because of this we will be giving 1 Promo Darth Vader to everyone who participates in the 2002 Champs at GenCon.<br>
<br>
Players will receive 1 Vader when they hand in their deck registration form and register for the tournament. If you are planning to play with it make sure you include it on the form.<br>
<br>
We are sorry about any inconvenience. <br>
<br>
See you there! <br>

On the other hand, it means that if I go, I will have 4!  <hr>Michael Girard said on Fri Aug 2 2002 <br>Whoa...that premium vader?  I didn't know they were legal.  I have two.  If anyone is looking to pick them up, drop me an email.  <hr>Neal Razi said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>That's a pretty nice thing to do of WOTC if you ask me.<hr>Andrew Howard said on Sat Aug 3 2002 <br>Yeah, it'll be rough giving away 8 more of those cards :P
