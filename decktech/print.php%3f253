<br />
The recent Seattle DPC was a huge hit! Cardhaus games<br />
thanks all of you for coming! We hope to see those of<br />
you that could not come next time. <br />
<br />
For those of you that were in the team challenge we<br />
regret that alot of our paper work has gone missing.<br />
We would still love to send the winning team the Which<br />
King's Sword! We are asking all those team members to<br />
send a list of their team members to<br />
<a href="mailto:THATGUY1138@YAHOO.COM">James</a><br />
<br />
Also for your trouble you can each name a card and you<br />
will recieve that card or a few packs if we do not<br />
have that card in your mail if you give us your<br />
mailing address!<br />
<br />
We would dearly love to make sure everything gets<br />
taken care of so help us out a little.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
James Canova, Tournament Organizer<hr><b>comments</b><hr>neal said on Tue Oct 15 2002 <br>Guys, i know there has been a bit of irritation at cardhaus over this.  My advice: be nice<hr>Casey Barson said on Tue Oct 15 2002 <br>Nice as nice can be.  Can't hold a grudge over something we haven't won yet.  I'm just glad that they're doing something about it and not just saying "tough luck"  Thanks for getting on top of this Neal.  We players do appreciate it.<hr>Alan Sagan said on Tue Oct 15 2002 <br>my predictions:<br />
<br />
the guys from Utah get the sword, with my team being 2nd. <br />
<br />
It's possible i'm wrong though, two of our players played in all 6 tournements, and did decent in .. 5 of them?  <br />
Aj and I hardly count, he only played in two and I played in 3.<hr>James Canvoa said on Sat Oct 19 2002 <br>Well guys we are still missing one team to report. Don't forget EVERYONE get's something if they send us your mailing address. So far unless the missing team does realy well Utah is leading and walks away with the sword!<br />
<br />
Also Don't forget about the Battle of Helm's Deep on Nov 9th! Lots of prizes and $500 in cash!<hr>James Canvoa said on Tue Oct 22 2002 <br>The Resluts are in! <br />
