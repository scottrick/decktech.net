<br />
with State and Provincial Championships!<br />
<br />
Yes, State and Provincial Championships are right around the corner, and you can host a world qualifier in your own back yard. Well, not really your back yard since all events must take place at a public venue, but you get the point.<br />
<br />
State and Provincial Championships give one person - and one person only - the chance to bypass Day 1 entirely, and rest easy knowing that they will be competing in Day 2 of Worlds.<br />
<br />
So how do you host a State or Provincial Championship tournament?<br />
<br />
It's simple - fill out the form at<br />
http://www.swccgpc.com/Resources/Championship_App_Form.doc and then send it to nick.kolnik@gmail.com AND mbc9457@yahoo.com.<br />
<br />
Within a few days you should hear back from the PC approving or disapproving your request for a State or Provincial Championship event.<br />
<br />
Remember - there is only one State or Provincial Championship per state or province. Get your applications in early!<br />
<br />
Thanks to all and let's make this one of the greatest championship seasons ever!<br />
<br />
SPECIAL NOTICE TO ALL TOURNAMENT DIRECTORS RUNNING QUALIFIERS FOR WORLDS 2005:<br />
<br />
As part of the continuing attempt to improve the tournament environment for all players, the Advocates are in the process of putting together a brand new Star Wars Tournament Guide. Most of the rules in the Tournament Guide can wait until it is officially issued. There is, however, one rule we would like to make apparent right away.<br />
Tournament Directors CANNOT play in their own qualifier, no matter the number of players or if it will avert a bye. Please make note of this for any qualifier you run.<br />
<br />
In addition, we are going to be testing out a new policy starting in April. At championship level events, we are leaving it up to the Tournament Director whether they will allow clear sleeves at their championship circuit tournaments. If a Tournament Director decides that they do not want clear sleeves at their championship tournament,<br />
this must be advertised in advance in any tournament announcement made. If they do make enforce this rule, the Tournament Director must hold the tournament at a venue where opaque sleeves are available for purchase or be ready to provide them for those who do come with clear sleeves. The only card for which a clear sleeve will be legal will be an objective. All other cards MUST be in the same color sleeves as the rest of your deck.<br />
<br />
Additionally, a player must be sure to bring extra sleeves for cards they may happen to 'steal' from their opponent during play. Any 'insert' cards must also be sleeved to match the deck to which they are inserted and that sleeve should be marked in the middle of its back in order to recognize the insert when it reaches the top of the deck.<br />
