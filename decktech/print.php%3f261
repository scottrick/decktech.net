---------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
In an effort to make our goals more clear and our information (i.e. Virtual<br>
Cards, Championship events) easier to find, the Star Wars CCG Player's<br>
Committee is pleased to announce the opening of its Official site:<br>
<br>
http://www.swccgpc.com<br>
<br>
At our website viewers can expect to get the latest news updates, Current<br>
Rulings documents, Virtual Card sets, listings of Championships and major<br>
tournament events, official PC promotions, and much, much more. The Star<br>
Wars gaming community will also be able to talk to and get in direct contact<br>
with each of the seven PC Player Advocates--all of whom will be able to be<br>
located daily on the site's bulletin boards (though not all at once ;-)<br>
Players are welcome to register on our boards and discuss whatever it is<br>
that may be on their minds. (be nice!)<br>
<br>
So, come on in ... join us... and then get out there and PLAY!<br>
