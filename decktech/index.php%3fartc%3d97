<tr><td colspan=2><font color=#FFFFFF face="arial" size="2">Thank you for writing to express your feelings about our Star Wars CCG decision.  That decision was my responsibility, and I would like you to have a better understanding of how the decision was made.<br>
 <br>
I have worked for Lucasfilm for 21 years.  For the last 16 years, I have been in charge of all of our merchandising.  I have stayed with the company this long because I love Star Wars, and I know that millions of people throughout the world share that love.  Not every decision I have made has been right, but I can tell you that every product decision is motivated<br>
 first and foremost by whether it will result in a better experience for the fans of Star Wars.<br>
 <br>
Two years ago we began a painstaking process of figuring out what to do with the Star Wars CCG when the Decipher license expired at the end of 2001.  We<br>
 heard extensive presentations from Decipher and Wizards of the Coast, and we talked to many, many players and retailers.  We faced a very difficult decision because Decipher had done a great job with the Star Wars CCG and is a terrific company with many wonderful and talented people.  Wizards is also a great company and holds a very special position as the originator of the CCG format and the creator of Magic: The Gathering.  We were honored that they were interested in Star Wars and listened very carefully to what they as well as Decipher and the fans had to say.  After nine months of an exhaustive process, we came to the conclusion that Wizards had a better vision for the long-term future of Star Wars. That vision encompassed an<br>
 improved game that could broaden the player base by offering a multi-layered experience within a single game (as opposed to multiple games for different<br>
 audiences) and would be designed by Richard Garfield himself, and an<br>
 improved organized play system that would support players better than ever before.  <br>
 <br>
This was a very difficult decision given the strengths of both companies, our long history with Decipher, and the considerable investment that many players had already made in the existing games.  In the end, we felt we had<br>
 to do what was right for the fans in the long run, knowing that our decision would not be well received by everyone.  Sometimes change is hard to accept, but our experience has been that change can be a good thing, and a way of<br>
 encouraging greater creativity and innovation. <br>
 <br>
Wizards has been working diligently for more than a year to produce what we all hope will be a worthy successor to the original Star Wars CCG.  I am truly sorry that you are upset with this decision. All that I can ask at<br>
 this point is that you reserve final judgment until you have a chance to see the product when it launches in April. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, while Decipher will not be producing any new Star Wars products, we expect their existing games to go on, and Decipher themselves have committed to do everything in their power to continue these games for as long as the player community wants to play them. <br>

I know Garfield is supposedly "the man" when it comes to games, just try to interact with the top level SW:CCG players and make sure that this game is a worthwhile replacement. Making a Star Wars card game that has longetivity AND brilliant gameplay is difficult, but if you spent enough time in the intial investment, and PAY ATTENTION to what the consumers of said product say, then you may just have a worthwhile replacement.</font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:maatt@hotmail.com">Matt Lush</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Wed Jan 9 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Makes good sense to me.

Yanking the plug on a sucessful and viable game wreaks of suspicion.  You admit to a sucessful run with Decipher, but fail to point out exactly what this vision is that WotC had over Decipher...  Also, what players were spoken to about this decision?    10 year-old Pokemon snots?!?!?  C'mon.  Admit it; you wanted to have Lucas Licensing hold all the cards (literally and figuratively) under one Meglo-company...  Like Mr. Lush said, Lucas Lic. has some GIGANTIC shoes to fill with this dice rolling, Pokemon induced card game!

<br>
I like the idea of Decipher releasing a game that uses the SWCCG mechanics on a non-licensed (or alternately licensed) property.  I heard a couple of ideas below... Final Fantasy was a good idea; the Matrix might be a good seller.  Or just release a game called 'space blasto' or something and the SWCCG community can keep buying cards to expand the environment of the current game.<br>
<br>
The new game may not fail, but I would put money on a wager that it won't succeed spectacularly, either.  The CCG market IS at a saturation point, or past it, and anyone who wants to play a Star Wars card game is already playing one, in many cases after investing thousands of dollars in it.  George Lucas is giving N Sync a cameo in Episode II to draw teenage females to see the movie; does WOTC plan to put naked pornstars on their card-backs to get players for their game?<br>

I think it is pretty clear that WotC flat out doesn't want the old mechanic. Apparently they want to try something new and like it or not, we have to accept that. I myself am very disheartened by this, but it's as they say a done deal. I now many say to boycott the new game and if that is what you want to do, thats fine. I'm not buying the new game because I can only afford one game at a time and I play LotR now. For all those thinking of not buying the new game, because it will break WotC and bring back the old game... get real! With WotC's marketing strength and the popularity of the classic and up coming Star Wars movies, WotC will have plenty of buyers. Quite frankly they don't really need us. God, that sucks so much to say, but come on, its true. What do you think those ageing Pokemon players are going to be playing as soon as the switch in their head that says kiddie shows are cool, flips to the action and sci-fi shows are cool side. Jeez, I'm starting to depress myself. In my humble opinion I think we should all turn our attention from writing protest letters to WotC, to instead writing letters to Decipher to start a new game based (though maybe not entirely) on the Star Wars mechanic. The Matrix and Final Fantasy have been mentioned. I'm sure Squaresoft and whoever owns the Matrix would be willing to cut a licensing deal. Heck with Final Fantasy you could also put out an RPG. That would give WotC competition for both its key products. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike WotC. In fact I love AD&D and Star Wars RPG, but I also loved Star Wars CCG... partially because of the mechanic and I would like to at least see that live on.

Yes, it was about money, but that is business.  And about the Magic 'levels of gameplay,' I believe that is good.  Unlike Star Wars, Magic had a greater audience (and a better company backing it, no offense to Decipher).  These levels allowed someone of a lower intelligence, or just plain younger to learn the game quickly.  I would get dissapointed if I couldn't learn the game in a reasonalbly short period of time, and a beginner product allows for this.  I almost didn't want to play Star Wars because of it, but I liked the Star Wars movies so much, I stuck with it.  This is where Magic always has had the advantage.  And to that guy who doesn't like base sets, those are needed.  They keep key cards in the environment that have been around since 1993 in Alpha.  Some cards are not reprinted, and some new ones are.  This keeps the environment from losing cards it needs.<br>

I'm really sorry about this licence lose. I 'm one of the collectors that were never yet played the game. I just collect cards for fun. Ofcourse I still have plans to learn play but I can't find time for it. As a collector my opinion is that it would be better for decipher if they would stay with episodes 4,5,6. That was some close content and doing episode 1 provided some mess to the game... (once again I'll mention that I have never played it and it is only my opinion). <br>
But it would be nice move from lucasfilm if they would allow just to reprint the cards which was already released - just to keep support for players and to not waste their money already spent for the game.<br>
I don't know if some petition could help, lucasfilm seems to me as a very uncompromisable company, but maybe it could help.<br>
Anyway it was very bad decision - unpolite for Decipher, unrespectable for customers. It is worth of decisions other monopolists (M$ & others).<br>
I'm very disapointed.<br>
BTW Decipher on their page said that they plain to put in one pdf all the cards which are already prepared to release and werent yet published so the work on them will not be wasted. Every player will be able to print them at home. They will be acceptable on tournaments. <br>
My idea is that just before April Decipher could do the same (pdfing) with every primary and expansion set.

True, but there's a pretty good reason to this: the game wasn't going anywhere! Look at how difficult it would be for a new player to get in. No Vaders, no Mauls, no Emperors, no Lukes, no Qui-Gons, no nothing! If you wanted a good deck you'd have to invest a truck-load of money to even get started. Of course it would be possible to get a playable deck by buying a box of Theed Palace, but in order to have any chance to beat a player who has played the game for even a year you would have to buy lots and lots of more cards. While the same applies to just about every CCG around, I think in SWCCG it had gone too far. Even if you had an extra 300-400 dollars to spare it would be awfully timeconsuming to even grasp the basic concepts of the game. Don't get me wrong, I hate the idea of WoTC making a new and simple Magic-kind-of game out of SW. It's impossible for them to create a gamemachanism as great and versatile as Decipher's CCG. On the bright side, a game of WoTC's SW isn't going to take an hour to, play, you can just play a first turn Super Vader, boost him up with The Power of The Emperor's Ego and kill your opponent on your first turn!! <br>

The game is doomed when it comes to recruiting new players.  The invent of Defensive Shields destroyed any chance of effectively building a "Commons" deck.  Recruiting new players is almost impossible because they won't be willing to start a game to find out that they need to spend a few HUNDRED dollars just to begin to play competitively.  And with so many players worried about ratings and squashing the other players at a tourny (read most articles and decks and reviews on Decktech), it is difficult to get people to "play for fun".<br>
<br>
Next, the fact that Lucasfilm fairly obviously was planning on selling rights to a card game to Wizards of the Coast (and probably forgoing rights to Decipher) brings no shame to Lucasfilm.  After all, the point that was made was that two companies COMPETED for the rights from another company.  Wizards, in some way, earned the rights by making a more promising offer to Lucasfilm.  Was the decision based on solely money?  We won't know.  Maybe they felt that Wizards WOULD do a better job.  Maybe they didn't like where Decipher was going with the game.  Even I must admit that some of the things that Warren Holland (Decipher's CEO) said they suggested to Lucasfilm were lousy ideas that I believe would hurt the game more than help it.<br>
But, I also do not feel, after reading the writings of both representitives for Decipher and Lucasfilm, that Lucasfilm did anything malicious to the players of Decipher's game.  Many people have responded to the Lucasfilm statement above with anger at Lucasfilm.  I believe that some of that is misdirected.  Who did not come forward and tell the players that the loss of the lisence was coming?  Who produced product with an implied promise that it might continue?  Which company did everything they could to hide the possible change in lisencing?  I do not believe that of the companies involved, Lucasfilm is the guilty party.  Neither is Wizards of the Coast who fairly competed for the rights to Star Wars using whatever free market abilities it had.<br>
<br>
Finally, I wanted to mention that of the things that I have read, Decipher wrote with scorn and malice.  Lucasfilm did not once speak poorly of the two companies competing for rights to Star Wars.  Decipher implied poor creativity and vision on the part of Wizards and Lucasfilm.  Lucasfilm attested above to the talent of Decipher's employees.  Decipher, as the producer of the game, supplied no information to the consumers until last minute.  Lucasfilm, not being the marketer of the game or any card game , released information upon the first web site update of the new year when Wizards first had legal rights to begin production of any type of product.<br>

Do you honestly think that the best decks in the new WotC game won't require lots of rares?  Back when I played Magic competitively (long before Type II which herded me out) my deck was very nearly all rare.  A friend of mine still plays competitively, and it's changed very little...other than that now, every year or so those rares you had to chase to build a good deck are no longer legal for play and you have to repeat the process again.<br>To think that Wizard's game won't have you chasing a ton of rares....that's ludicrous.  No card game company will let that happen...except oddly for Decipher, whose Lord of the Rings can be played decently WITHOUT rares (although you are better off with some, they are NOT a necessity.

I just simply could not keep up with the expansions as they came out.  It seemed to me at the time that the market was being flooded with expansions.  Now that I know that the game was in its death throes, it makes sense that so many new cards came out in so short a time.<br>
<br>
I personally am very curious to see the new game.  I don't know if I will play it, just because of monetary reasons.

Star Wars will always be there, but it's been dwindeling in recent years because of too much merchandising and too much special effects, not enough story, character development, and people.

Here in the region where I play my SW tournaments, many of the SW players are changing or have changed to LOTR already. To be honest, this is happening all over the world !! I mail a lot with people abroad and this tendency seems to happen worldwide. So this raises me the following question : as LOTR is becoming the most popular game worldwide and attracting many SW players, why would these people start getting their hands on a second NEW cardgame in only a couple of months time ?? Many players are investing in LOTR as it is a very good game, most of them like the game very much, they spend money on a game which is guaranteed a 3 year future, having MAX 3 expansions a year and not more, which is not always the case with Magic expansions, isn't it ? So does this NEW SW game will have also that many expansions yearly ?? It will become a costly game like Magic nowadays is. Sorry WOTC, I heard even rumors that in your Magic expansions, it would be not certain to even find a Rare card in a booster !! You will have many negative comments worldwide, but I think the release of your new SW game is badly planned and we don't even know how expensive your new creation will be !! Here in my playing region, the devoted SW gamers are against your new game and refuse even to try or look at your new product. The majority ( if not all of them ) prefer buying cards of the new LOTR expansion in March, than spending money on a game which still has to proof itself !!        </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:gwen.engels@skynet.be">Jabba</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Thu Jan 10 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>FYI...<br>

Business is evil when it hurts the environment, and people economicly. To my Knowledge none of these companies are hurting anything.

W/the dicontinuatuion of a game with far too many mechanics, erratas, rulings, rule changes, no way to bring new people into the game, and the impossibilty of a anikin character card into the seniro, lucas's team decided to go a different direction. Will the SW game be a flop like MLB? Not as likely, there aren't a lot of baseball geeks who like theese card games and conversely not a lot of ccg players into baseball.  I'm glad not to see reflections 12. A bad star wars player can beat a good SW player, but a good SW player can't beat a really good sw player. SW was a game of very little luck. there is stradgy from your starting stuff to end game counting.  Its way too hard to stay a SW player. the cards didn't hold any value a card that books for $30 was maybe worth $7. And two sets later you can't even give the card away because it was useless.Seriously is your collection worth less becauuse they discontinued the game? well of course it is but not by much.

<br><br>
I'd like to say something too, it's become quite a long story, so if you don't want to read it ... you better stop right here.<br><br>
<br><br>
Back in the days I started playing Magic right after legends. I loved it. That is until 4th Edition and Homelands came along. Then I quit. I also couldn't keep up anymore with all the expansions. <br><br>
<br><br>
Than I turned to SW:CCG and loved that even more.  I didn't really feel motivated to collect enitire sets of Magic, I did have that motivation with Star Wars (mainly because I like SW since I was a kid). So I was playing and collecting and I was able to do so financially, because only one or two expansions came out every year.<br><br>
<br><br>
Now that the game is coming to it's end I'm feeling sad, but I'm also hopeful.<br><br>
<br><br>
I'm sad to see a good game die. And be frank, how many of you will be playing this for years to come. I'll sure try, but without new expansions ... ? Many players will drop the game entirely and go look for something else. Hopefully it won't happen, though. I still hope Decipher or any other company is going to find a way to add new cards to the game without violating any copyrights.<br><br>
I'm also sad as a collector, because it would have been nice to have a collection of cards ranging from Episode 1 to Episode 6. I still don't think it was a waste of money. So what if your Vader isn't worth anything anymore this time next year. I never bought any cards to sell them again. I bought them for my collection. And my collection of cards remains long after april 2002.<br><br>
<br>  <br>
I'm hopefull though that the new card game will be very good as well. The dice thing may scare people of in the beginning, but you can't track the roll of the dice... We'll just have to see how it turns out. I just hope that WotC isn't going to eventually kill this game as they did Magic with to many expansions, banned and restricted lists and simplifying the game (because some people might not understand the meaning of the word "Tap"). <br><br>
<br><br>
I will probably buy a starter of the new game to check it out. I hope it has photos on the cards instead of drawn pictures, such as with Jedi Knights. Note: You won't hurt WotC by not buying their new Star Wars game. You may even deprive yourself of a great game ... who knows? I do hope that it will attract a lot of people, so there are a lot of people to play against. In my Magic days it wasn't hard to find a group of Magic players. But I do not know very many SW:CCG players in my city.<br><br>
<br><br>
Don't get me wrong here. I'm not trying to put SW:CCG down. I love the game and even now I'm still trying to come up with new deck ideas. Even if I'm going to play the new game, I'll be taking out my old SW:CCG decks once in a while just for fun. It's a great game and a great game doesn't die. People will still play the game, maybe just not at the level it is played these days. Let's just hope the new game is worth it. I hope it's a successor worthy of the name Star Wars followed by the letters C(ard)G(ame).<br><br>
<br><br>
See ya,<br>

He's shareholder of Hasbro, Hasbro owns WotC, WotC just had to get SWCCG. <br>
<br>
I've played Magic, but after Exodus it just become too crappy, with coountless clarifications of even basic rules. Not to mention worst move ever in any game - to ban something. Other fact that irritated lot of the best M:TG players in may region (Croatia) was constant change of the play environment for the tournaments.<br>
<br>
Then SW:CCG came. I immediately switched (was in fact with a friend first player there), and in last 6 years seen slow but steady grow of player community. For a time I even played few different CCGs - M:TG, Jyhad - V:TES, Spellfire, Alien vs. Predator, X-files just to name few. But lost interest in all of them (except Spellfire - it's just plain fun and sometimes hillarious) because of unique approach that Decipher offered with SW:CCG. It was freom the start more versatile, and metagaming was harder than for the M:TG. you still needed to invest a lot, but you just didn't needed most expensive cards to be able to play competitively.<br>
<br>
We won't change anything regarding new WotC SWCCG, but at the same time my oppinion is that it will downgrade whole SW community. Despite all his influence and previous results Richard Garfield isn't world's greates game designer - what the heck - he isn't even good one. WotC destroyed some of the finest licences in gaming like Battletech and Dune. They even failed to cash in temporary popularity of the licences of  Hercules and Xena. They sold V:TES to White Wolf, and suddenly it started flourishing, and what I heard is that L5R is out of the WotC umbrella. I just hope it will progress. <br>
<br>
Decipher made a lots of mistakes, but it cannot be compared to just plain stupidity that WotC tried to force upon players with semi finished products over last 10 years. </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF><a href="mailto:kradanov@rocketmail.com">Grand Moff Maleus</a></font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Fri Jan 18 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>HAH his post is a whole load of BS!

Man, I miss ICE.  I'm shocked Wotc didn't throw all the money they had at Lord of the Rings to boot.  Give them time...I'm sure they didn't expect the movie to be as great and successful as it is.  If this happens, you will once again consider them the enemy as they bid for the rights to the game...and create a new one, where Gandalf gets to roll four dice against the Balrog, only to have the Balrog "Evade" by spending resources/ flipping a coin/ using Bulbasaur blast power or whatever.<br><br>

  Just because WotC took the license from Decipher doesnt mean the game is going to die. Once LucasArts sees that WotC mess up with Star Wars, they are gonna be hard pressed to find another company to make the cards. With WotC gone, Decipher will be the most worthy cantidate. Star Wars will survive, even if no new expansions come off the press anytime soom, so what? You know the inevetable, Decipher will get the licence back, and we just have to bide our time till they do. Besides, this will give the newer players a chance to catch up with the more experienced players, collection wise. This card game wont die intil we abandon it. That is why im proposing a Pro Tour for SWCCG for all players in the state of New Jersey. Join my group, MrQuestor's SWCCG NJ Pro Tourney. Anyone from NJ (or surrounding areas) are welcome, new players and experienced players alike. If i can find a sponsor, i think i can scrounge up some prize support and trophies for winners. This tour will be a continuing, 5-7 week tour, where, at the end, the players with the highest combined score will win cards of their choice (most likely, no guarantees yet) and trophies(if i can get a sponsor). There is only one problem. Im 14, and Im not sure if anyone wants to play with a 14 year old Tournament Director. If ya wanna join, join my group, and start having fun. If you dont wanna join and your in my area, remember, its not just your loss, its also Deciphers and SWCCGs loss.<br>

I got into the SWCCG back in January of 1996. I played off and on in tournaments from the beginning of 1996 to the spring of 2000. I stopped playing in tournaments because they're weren't fun anymore. Once in a while, I could play a decent match. Most of the time, I got beaten down like a schoolgirl. But I kept on collecting. At last count, I had well over 20,000 cards sitting in storage. The problem wasn't with tournaments.<br>
<br>
The problem was that I couldn't find anyone who wanted to play after 1998. The game grew too complicated and expensive for most casual gamers to jump into. One look at the novel that is the rules glossary and people would back away from it. I like the game and I always have. However, I think its time is up. <br>
<br>
It was a good run and I had a great time playing and collecting. However, I can't play it anymore because I can't find anyone who wants to try it. Let the new game emerge. Give it a chance before declaring it the spawn of all that is unholy. <br>
<br>
I didn't pick the game up in the first place because it was made by Decipher. I picked it up because it was Star Wars. When the new game comes out, I won't give much thought about who makes it as I will about how it plays. </font></td></tr><tr><td><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Psion</font><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF> - Sat Jan 26 2002  </font></td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td><HR><font face=arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>I was thinking of putting a black band on my arm to mourn the recent events. But after reading all of your comments, I have had time to think a little bit. And instead I feel very happy! I am actually quite happy that the game is OVER. There will be no more expansions and I think it is GREAT! Now I can focus on getting my collection complete and also I KNOW what cards will be there - these cards will last FOREVER and live ETERNALLY! Great! I know there are plenty of people who has a really big collections out there, and sure, some people may want to throw them all away - for me that is fine as well because that will only make the surviving cards rarer and more worth. And just think of it, I have like 10 albums full of cards in my bookshelf and I LOVE just looking at them, I love reading the info on them. The value will never diminish. I think I have won in either way.<br>
<br>
Also, I really hated the Episode I cards and I would never have bought Theed Palace, for instance. I was tired of getting all those foil cards in the reflections sets as well, but I think it was a cool idea nevertheless. Especially I liked getting to see the personifications of Mara Jade, Guri, Dash Rendar, Talon Karrde, Thrawn, Mirax Terrik (WHAT A BABE!) - for me these are the only persons who will ever be these personas 'in the flesh'. I just wish I knew their names!<br>
<br>
So, don't think this was bad. Think of it like the bird Phoenix. It will arise! I for one will not use much time, energy and money on anything else when I have invested so much into this game. I will continue to do so. And so will others.<br>

I am happy that WotC owns it now because SWCCG is a dying breed, there are no players in my area and that is solely based on the fact that it is so increadably difficult to learn.  On top of that, there is no fun for experianced players playing newbies, its like hitting the bowl there is no difficulty.
