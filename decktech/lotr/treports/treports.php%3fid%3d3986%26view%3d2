Some of our locals have already left for school, but there are a few of us left, and my friend Steve is coming up from Santa Clara to give us some competition, so it should be fun despite not being an Enduro (which, for anyone who is interested, has been tentatively rescheduled for December in Santa Clara).  I wanted to play a Ranger/Moria deck, but didnt have time to build it until late Friday night, and wasnt able to playtest it enough to use it, so I decided to just go with my Horn/Uruk deck from last week, even though I dont like to play the same thing two weeks in a row.  So, tournament time rolls around, were missing a lot of players, but we still have 8, just barely sanctioned.  I call the pairings for round 1, and were off.<br>
<br>
GAME 1:  Me vs. Johns Big Fellowship/Uruks<br>
Not much interesting here, he kept putting out companions and I kept killing them, but I got tired of that pretty quickly, so I just double-moved like crazy without much trouble, between Aragorns Bow, Greenleaf, Orophin, Celeborn and Galadriel healing Orophin, and several other site 6 archer allies ready to be Horned in, nothing survived the archery phase after about site 5, and anything that did had to deal with strength-14 Aragorn and strength-13 Boromir.<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Highs:<br>
-Running through Uruks like they were nothing<br>
Lows:<br>
-Man, he had a lot of companions, he played them almost as fast as I could kill them<br>
<br>
GAME 2:  Me vs. Bens Archery/Uruks<br>
In case you havent read my other recent TRs, Ben and I have played each other in pretty much every tournament in the last month or so, usually in the matchup of undefeated players in round 3 or 4, and I have absolutely destroyed him every time, even overwhelming Frodo at site 4 once.  Still, hes a very good player, and he is one of the people I met with on Tuesday to do some deck-building, and I rebuilt his fellowship with him to be much faster, tighter, and more durable.  In hindsight, I think I may have made it a little too goodBasically, I beat his fellowship down most of the game, he stopped at site 6 with an exhausted Aragorn, exhausted Boromir, exhausted Legolas, and exhausted Arwen.  I was at 5 but knew I had to put the pressure on him, so I doubled into 7 knowing that it was Anduin Confluence, and ended up with no damage except 1 wound on Boromir and the loss of my allies (although I was still waiting on the key one, Orophin).  So, I reconcile, he heals and moves, I get down Lurtz and a Lieutenant, and am holding 3 Savageries, stuff is gonna die.  Well, not as much as youd think.  Had he just tossed Lurtzs archery shot on Frodo like youd expect, he made a great play and killed his still-exhausted Legolas with it, taking him down to 4 companions, then just took 2 wounds from Lurtz and 1 from the Lieutenant (stupid armor).  On my turn, I moved, drew into some crap (great, now I have Athelas, that helps), and moved.  He got down a few Uruks, I shot 2 down with Aragorn and Legolas, then the surviving Troop went on Boromir and he dumped a fistful of pumps to overwhelm him.  So, Ive got a Troop with 2 wounds trailing, exhausted Legolas, Aragorn with two wounds, and naked Frodo.  Basically, 2 more Uruks and I lose, and with the Slopes as site 9 I just cant afford to do that, Im drawing lots of new cards and Ive seen all but a few fellowship cards in my deck, so I should reconcile into enough minions to stop him.  So, I stop at 8 (as it turns out, he had some more pumps, but no minions left).  I reconclile, and draw into Enquea, a Berserker, and a Lieutenant my 3rd and 4th Sarumans Ambitions, a couple Savageries, and Orophin (where were you, man?).  He moves, I drop all 3 minions and the Ambitions (leaving 1 twilight, so it looks like Ive got more stuff to play).  Boromir with Blade and Brand beats down Enquea, the Berserker does a wound to Aragorn, and the Lieutenant exhausts Arwen (I dumped the Savageries and Ambitions to get her overwhelmed, but Gwemegil and 4 extra cards in his hand took care of that).  He looks at his hand, says he has no minions, and moves again.  I discard Orophin and draw eight new cards, theres a ton in the pool (I have two copies of Tower of Orthanc on the table and Arwen is exhausted)and I draw 1 Shadow card, Saruman.  So, Aragorn and Boromir each take a pair of wounds, game over.  I then looked at my deck, and it was like 90 percent minions, including an Uruk Captain, the top card of my deck.  All I needed was the Captain or 2 other minions and I had it, he had 2 PATHS but Saruman was there, so it didnt matter.  Oh well, despite getting deck-screwed at the end there, it was a great game, Ben deserves to win after all those horrible beatings.<br>
FL +1/+4<br>
Highs:<br>
-Seeing that my redesign of Bens already-solid deck worked<br>
-Beating his fellowship down hard for most of the game<br>
Lows:<br>
-Getting deck-screwed, but hey, what can you do?<br>
<br>
GAME 3:  Me vs. Matts Hobbits/Nazgul<br>
We both bid zero, but he wins the coin toss and makes me go first so he gets the Ford.  Ok, fine by me.  Aragorn shows up at site 1, I move and get Enquea, Aragorn takes a pair, I play Pathfinder (I love that card) to avoid the Ford, and move again, he doesnt have enough twilight to play another Nazgul, so Boromir takes a pair.  On his turn he drops The Gaffer and a couple of Party Guests as well as Bill the Pony, an O Elbereth! and a Mithril-coat, giving me 10 at site 2.  Sweet.  I drop Tower Assassin and Uruk Raider, the Gaffer gets gunned down, he has to stealth both of the regular fights, then Pippin dies in the fierce fight.  My Aragorn and Boromir quickly get tanked out with swords, brands, and Last Alliances, so I double to 5 and single to 6, hes moving along 1 site at a time trying to get set up, singles into the Bridge, giving me 8 twilight, I drop a Raider and Captain from my hand and use the Captain to pull another Raider, Frodo uses pumps and a Bounder to survive my Raider with multiple Ambitions and Savageries, Sam stealths, Merry dies, and in the fierce I have more pumps to kill Frodo and Sam is overwhelmed as well.<br>
FW +3/+7<br>
Highs:<br>
-The Gaffer meets a Tower Assassin at site 2; brutal when Im packing 4 Raiders.<br>
-Aragorn and Boromir are walking, talking, Nazgul beatsticks<br>
Lows:<br>
-Stupid Mithril-coat makes my Uruks very unhappy<br>
<br>
Well, Steve is now sitting at 3-0 after just barely overwhelming Bens Frodo at site 9 with some very careful use of his Goblin Armories, and since Frank and I are the only 2-1 players who havent faced him yet, one of us will play him.  It ends up being Frank, so as much as I wanted to have a shot to try and take some of Steves many rating points, I ended up playing Mason, a fitting opponent for my last game here for quite some time, since hes been my main rival fro the whole time Ive been playing Rings.<br>
<br>
GAME 4:  Me vs. Masons Horn/Uruks<br>
We bid, he goes first, we look at each others starts and kind of chuckle, knowing that were playing the exact same decktypes, and since we tend to both build very similar decks within each decktype, its going to come down to one of us outplaying the other.  Early off it becomes clear that Im going to need to overwhelm Frodo, as Im sitting at site 3 and hes about to double into 6 with tanked-out Aragorn, Merry FTS with Hobbit Sword, Boromir with Blade, and No Strangers on both men.  I think back to a recent game against Frank where pretty much the same thing happened as far as his fellowship being set up too solidly for me to do much damage to, and decide to try the same tactic: set up a killer shadow hand and try to bluff him into double-moving into a beatdown.  Sadly, Im so far behind that my fellowship cant pressure him into double-moving, and he knows that my deck is too solid to be so short on minions that I cant play anything, so I just single-move, clearing my hand of as much fellowship as possible and trying to clog his hand with useless shadow cards.  So, he singles to 7 and then singles to 8, Im choking him so bad that hes still got a fair portion of his deck left, including Orophin and the Horn, but he knows hell be OK, he moves into site 9 wound-free, giving me 11 twilight, enough for probably 3 Uruks, one gets shot down by Aragorn, the other two die to the tanked-out men, right?  Nope, sorry Mason, my hand is crazy now.  Ive got 4 Ambitions on the table, so pumps arent going to be a problem, its just a question of getting enough minions down.  Raider for 1, Raider for 1, Lieutenant for 2, Lieutenant for 2, Captain for 2, 3 leftand down comes the Old Man for 3.  At this point Masons in shock, he gave me 11 twilight an I dropped Saruman and 5 Uruks.  Hehe.  End result, 2 guys are on Frodo, Sarumans sitting there ready to soak up wounds, and Frodo gets severely overwhelmed.<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
Highs:<br>
-Turning a clear losing effort into a win<br>
-The look on Masons face when 11 twilight turned into a huge Uruk swarm<br>
Lows:<br>
-Getting so far behind that I had to rely on my shadow to win<br>
<br>
Well, Im disappointed that I didnt close with a 4-0 performance, but whatever, I ended up in a 4-way tie for first place with Steve, Ben, and Frank (I took second to Steve after tiebreakers), so it wasnt a complete loss.  Its been a great summer, all told I ran something like 10 tourneys between the beginning of July and this last one, so that was lots of fun, I took my rating from 1554 going into the NorCal Territorials at the end of June to a respectable 1818 with 7-1 not yet entered, not a bad 2-months worth, in my opinion.  Im looking forward to hopefully meeting some new players at UC Davis, but I cant wait until I get back; nothing can replace the traditional post-tourney multi-player brawl (speaking of which, we had it before the tourney today while we waited for everbody to get there, and I beat down; triple-moving to 9 is the way to go).  I guess now theres only one thing left<br>
<br>
PROPS:<br>
-Mason, Frank, and Nick- the rest of Team Krispy Kreme, you know what Im talking about<br>
-The rest of the Santa Rosa gang for putting up with our craziness all summer<br>
-Clarks Trading, for providing a great place to play<br>
-All the other great players I met along the way; Steve, Mike, Lisa, feel free to come up to Davis anytime; I hear theres a new freshman whos a halfway-decent LotR player ;)<br>
-The Slopes of Amon Hen, for being straight broken (any Decipher employees, please ignore that last comment)<br>
SLOPS:<br>
-There are probably quite a few, but Im in a good mood, so whatever, Im done<br>
