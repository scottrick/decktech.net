A couple days before I left, the area&#39;s Product Champion, Chris Schoenthal, told me there would be a tournament on Saturday, and wanted me to come.  So we went down to the store on Saturday morning, I gave him the cards he needed for the deck I had designed for him (he was in a big slump, and needed a little boost to get back on the winning track), dismantling my own deck to do so since I had no intention of playing.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the game and all, but I hadn&#39;t even touched my cards for almost a month (I&#39;d left them in Rohnert Park when I went to Davis since tourneys have not yet started up again in Davis), and Chris wanted to play the deck I designed for him, so I gave him the backbone of my Horn/Uruk deck (4 Savageries, some Lieutenants and Troops, stuff like that).  Everything was looking good, 8 people showed up (not counting me), and then we got a call from Alfred Dong saying he was on his way, which would make an odd number and force me to play, so I threw together a choke-archery/Moria deck (I&#39;m not going to post it, but it&#39;s very similar to Steve Daniel&#39;s &quot;Choking Hail of Arrows&quot; deck, pretty solid).  Then we got another call from Ben Kantor, one of our locals who is down at Cal Poly San Louis Obispo, but was in the area for a family function, so now we had 10 and I didn&#39;t have to play.  Then one of the 10 bailed, saying he had planned on calling in sick to work that day but decided he couldn&#39;t afford to, so once again the number was odd, and I had to play (and without my good deck, too!).  So, everybody got there, and we started.<br>
<br>
GAME 1:  me vs Benjamin Kantor (1752; archery-choke/Uruks)<br>
If you&#39;ve read my other TRs you know that Ben and I tend to play each other every tournament, and while I usually manage to beat him down, last time he got me in a close game at the end, so it was my turn again.  We both doubled to 3, then when he moved to 4 I got down 4 strength-8 orcs (2 scavengers, 2 scouts with scimitars) to his 4 companions (Greanleaf, Daughter of Elrond, and Heir to the White City with Reluctant Frodo at 4 strength), he tried to shoot down a scavenger with Greenleaf, I dumped an Armory, he had to do it again, so the scavenger died, but it exhausted Legolas in the process, so he died to the second scavenger.  I Stung him, seeing 2 PATHS, then doubled to 5 without much trouble. He played Boromir and moved to 5, I got down a couple orcs and the Balrog to his 4 companions (none with Armor, and Aragorn with two wounds).  He sent 4 archery at me with a Gondor Bowmen and the 2 archery from bows, hoping I&#39;d give it to the Balrog, but instead I gave 2 to the Balrog (leaving 3 vitality so he couldn&#39;t PATHS it) and killed off a runner, with the scout soaking up the last wound.  End result, the Balrog took out Boromir and Arwen.  I singled to 6, he did the same, but with all of his companions dead except wounded Aragorn and Frodo, he soon got overwhelmed.<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Highs:<br>
-Beating Ben after his recent 5-0 in Fresno<br>
-Killing 2 good companions with the Balrog; that just doesn&#39;t happen much anymore<br>
Lows:<br>
-None, good game<br>
<br>
First-round winners were me, Matt Carey, Chris, Mason Gilligan, and of course Alfred Dong.<br>
<br>
GAME 2:  me vs Matt Carey (1585; Aragorn-Promise/Nazgul)<br>
Matt usually uses one of my decks or borrows cards from Ben and I to fill out whatever he&#39;s built, but since I didn&#39;t have any extra decks, he used Frank Pinkela&#39;s deck (Frank had left for work), which is very strong as has done well in the past.  The early game was pretty uneventful, I set up my shadow conditions and went sprinting ahead of him, moving 1-3 3-5, so I was at the Bridge when he moved from 4 (already with 3 or 4 copies of A Promise), facing the Balrog and a couple Orcs.  Aragorn (without armor) took the Balrog once, Sam and Frodo killed their Orcs, and then Sam stealthed the Balrog.  So, no twilight in the pool, nothing on swarms, no minions following, and my fellowship was smashing his Nazgul.  He decided to move again, giving me 4 twilight at Dimrill Dale, I dropped a Goblin Flankers with Moria Axe, a couple scavengers with scimitars , a Guard Commander, and some runners with scimitars, and had 11 leftover pool.  End result, the flanker kills Aragorn, Sam gets overwhelmed, and I&#39;m 1 twilight short of getting Frodo with a scimitared scavenger (needed to make him +8 strength, could only get +6 with the commander).  No worries, I doubled to 7 just in case he got more companions or 4 PATHS or something, then he got severely overwhelmed at 7.<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Highs:<br>
-Almost killing every companion he had at one site with 4 pool<br>
-Smacking down his Nazgul<br>
Lows:<br>
-Being 1 twilight short of getting Frodo at 6<br>
<br>
The 3 undefeated players are now me, Chris, and Alfred, with Chris getting a big upset win over Mason (who was at that point rated almost 250 points higher than Chris).<br>
<br>
GAME 3:  me vs Alfred Dong (1932; superfellowship/Nazgul)<br>
I&#39;ve never gotten a chance to play Alfred before, but I saw him at the NorCal Territorial in June and know he&#39;s a very good player (#1 in California for most of the last couple months), so right about now I&#39;m really wishing I had my Uruks, because as good as Moria can be, it&#39;s just not the same.  So, we get started, he wins the bid to go first, doubles to 3.  I drop Aragorn (Heir to the White City) to join Greenleaf and Daughter of Elrond, play the Shards of Narsil with Blade of Gondor on it, move to 2, and he gets down Nelya with a Gates (switches site to Bree Streets), and Attea.  Legolas shoots down Nelya, Arwen takes a pair (big mistake, I should have given 1 to Aragorn), I move again (the site is Council Courtyard, not the Ford), giving him 4 twilight, he plays a Nazgul Sword on Attea, giving him a potential strength of 17, meaning anyone but Arwen would be overwhelmed, and since I gave her two wounds at site 2, she&#39;ll die too.  So, we both laugh at my stupidity, and the WonderTwins die.  His turn, he plays some companions/allies/equipment, moves to 4 and faces the Troll and some orcs, uses Albert Dreary to kill my 2 Armories, takes 4 wounds from the Troll, and takes wounds from one or two of the orcs, killing the rest, then decides to stop.  My turn, I play Boromir LoG and Galadriel, she exerts to play Elrond, who draws some cards, I get Aragorn&#39;s Bow and the Blade of Gondor down, remove 4 and move into a big Nazgul (I think another Attea), give each man a wound, and stop.  He plays some stuff and moves to 5, leaving me 1 twilight short of playing the Balrog and Cave Troll with the runner I&#39;m holding, instead I can just get down the runner, troll, and some other orcs.  He shoots down the Troll, takes some wounds from the bigger orcs, and moves again.  I can just manage more orcs and a couple conditions (They Are Coming, Relics of Moria), and do some wounds.  My turn, I get Ranger&#39;s Sword and Last Alliance on Aragorn and Flaming Brands on both men, move to 5, kill both Nazgul he plays (although Cantea steals Aragorn&#39;s Brand before he dies), move again, and kill the Nazgul that comes down.  His turn, he moves to 7, I don&#39;t have a Troll or anything to really stop him, and I want to save my orcs for a stop at 8 if he decides I&#39;m bluffing, but instead he moves again, I get down a huge horde of Orcs and Enquea, but between his directed archery and 5 companions, he&#39;s fine, just takes some wounds and puts some orcs on the swarms that I finally got out (by the way, at this point I&#39;ve only seen 1 of my 4 scimitars and 2 of my armories, and needed 2 more twilight to get down the Flankers I drew with the 1 scimitar I did have, which would have been very helpful; wouldn&#39;t have killed him, just would have been more damaging).  I transferred the other Brand to Aragorn, moved to 7, killed the Witch-King, and stopped to keep him from getting more fellowship cards.  He Stings my hand, sees no Enquea, drops Boromir SoD and Arwen to go to 7 companions, and moves.  I draw some cards for his burdens, including my last 2 armories and 3 scimitars, get down about 8 or 9 orcs thanks to the scimitars and Ulaire Nertea, who I drew with a scimitar and used to pull back 2 orcs and Enquea, but couldn&#39;t find the Cave Troll I was looking for (there was a ton of twilight left over from 4 runners and 4 scimitars), not that it probably would have mattered.  So, in maneuver I use Enquea to wound Boromir to keep him from pumping Frodo and kill Legolas to stop his directed archery, he uses Sentinels to dump my Armories, then uses Aragorn to shoot down most of my Scavengers, end result is that everybody fights but I can&#39;t quite overwhelm Frodo.<br>
FL +1/+7<br>
Highs:<br>
-Aragorn and Boromir beating down every minion he had<br>
-Having a competitive game without my main deck against probably the best player around<br>
Lows:<br>
-Being stupid and losing Arwen and Legolas at Council Courtyard<br>
-Not drawing my scimitars or Armories<br>
-Watching my Armories get discarded as soon as they were played<br>
<br>
Chris won again, so he plays Alfred for 1st Place, and I get paired up with Mason.<br>
<br>
GAME 4:  me vs Mason Gilligan (1838; Rangers/Uruks)<br>
Mason is the second-best local player here (although Ben Kantor are getting very good very quickly, and Frank Pinkela has a tendency to beat high-rated players and only lose to me or Ben), but it&#39;s been months since he beat me, and even without my main deck I&#39;m confident I can take him (although with his recent 4-0 win in a tournament with 3 of California&#39;s top 5 in attendance, he&#39;s definitely a threat).  Basically, I get some early stops with the Troll and my fellowship runs through him.  I match his 1-3 double, but pass him going to 5 companions at 3, gunning down a Troop and Lieutenant at 4 with a Gondor Bowmen and 3 regular archery plus an Orophin exertion, then move again to 6, taking out the Troop that showed up with my 4 undirected archery (although the Troop did take out 2 No Strangers and Aragorn&#39;s Saga and Last Alliance with a Saruman&#39;s Power).  He then doubled to 6, getting very beat up in doing so.  I move to 7, kill everything, Sting and see no minions, move again because I can, and he gets the best possible draw; he drew 3 new cards, Captain, Lieutenant, Saruman, used Captain to get a Troop.  So, I used directed archery from Legolas, Aragorn, and Orophin to crack Saruman&#39;s exertion abilities and take out the captain and Lieutenant, then Boromir with Armor took on the Savageried Troop twice.  His turn, he moves to 7 and faces a bunch of orcs which I think killed another companion or two, and stops because he can&#39;t catch me.  I heal up Orophin and discard copies of Aragorn and Boromir, then move to 9 and face nothing because he can&#39;t get enough down to even survive archery, let alone kill 4 strong companions and Frodo.<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
<br>
Alfred won the game against Chris at site 2, as Chris started Gandalf, played Aragorn HttWC, and then made the mistake of playing Elrond to draw some cards.  He moved to site 2, down came Nelya and Attea with Black Steed and Nazgul Sword.  First skirmish, Nelya does a wound and Attea overwhelms someone, fierce fight Attea overwhelms the other companion and Nelya takes out Frodo.  We had a good time harassing Chris for that, causing him to throw some dice at me from across the room.  However, Chris asked me to include a description of his second game against Alfred, which they played to kill time while everybody else finished.  Apparently, Chris managed not to kill himself at site 2 this time, and Alfred played his own Elrond at site 1 just to mess with Chris a little bit, but Chris ended up getting his revenge by getting down a big Uruk swarm at the Bridge and overwhelming Frodo (Saruman with Ravagers and Lieutenants is very dirty).  So, Alfred won the tourney, I took second by strength of schedule, and Chris got 3rd.  I got a bunch of fellowship packs with my prize money and got junk, except for a foil or two, but got some good cards in trades.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Alfred, for being a beast and going 4-0<br>
-Chris, for beating Alfred eventually<br>
-John, for trading me some nice foils<br>
-Me, for being a nice guy and dismantling my deck so Chris could play what he wanted to<br>
-Frank, for leaving and making me play<br>
Slops<br>
-Chris, for losing at site 2<br>
-Me, for having to play Archery/Moria when I should have been running my Uruks<br>
-Frank, for leaving and making me play<br>
<br>
The next day I went back up to the store to meet up with some friends who were playing in a Warlord CCG tournament before I headed back up to Davis.  OK, now for my history with Warlord CCG; my games always have been and always have been Star Wars CCG and LotR CCG, but Warlord is very popular in the Rohnert Park/Santa Rosa area, and since a bunch of my friends play it I learned how to play just so I could join  in if they needed me to.  I borrowed someone&#39;s extra deck for my first tourney, back at the beginning of the summer, and went undefeated to win, then barely lost (due to inexperience) to the intentionally broken Abyssal deck (if you&#39;re a Warlord player, you know what I&#39;m talking about, if not let&#39;s just say that the Abyssal deck doesn&#39;t abide by the regular deck construction rules, starts with extra characters in play, and all of the characters in the deck are incredibly strong, making it an incredibly difficult matchup that is rarely won).  I then spent 15 bucks on a starter and a few singles, making my own cheap version of the deck I played, and took 2nd place in the next tourney I played in.  I got there on Sunday and they needed another player, so I borrowed a current version of the deck I&#39;d played in the first tournament (Uthanak rules), and proceeded to go 6-0 for another win.  So my performances in Warlord are 1st place, 2nd place, 1st place.  Sweet.  I spent the prize money on 5 LotR packs (of course), and got some good pulls (Aragorn RotN and Legolas Greenleaf), so it was a good day.  Also, Frank made it down there to play some Rings with me and Chris (who was in the Warlord tournament), and traded me some good foils (A Promise and Gandalf The Grey Pilgrim).  All in all it was a great weekend, I didn&#39;t intend to play at all but ended up playing in 2 tournaments of 2 different games.  OK, enough rambling, I&#39;m done.  Look for my first TR from Davis whenever tourneys get started up here. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=4034&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
