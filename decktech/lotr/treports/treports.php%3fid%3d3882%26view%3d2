Bleh. This time, however, my 2nd deck has been completed. Gondor Bowmen Archery for Free Peoples and for shadow, some very strange Nazgûl/Isengard concoction, and I desire to enter with this deck, if just to surprise people lying in the dark, waiting to trap my old boring deck.<br>
I play a casual game before the tournament with the 2nd deck, and the shadow does amazingly well. Think Frodo with 5 burdens, and Berserkers, Enquea and Overseers taking turns to batter the fellowship, with 3 Towers of Orthanc out! He died, violently.<br>
I still have reservations about the shadow though, and thus I dig out my 1st deck and with just minutes before the tournament, switch Uruks and lame shadow around. Kit, who was too bored to enter with his own deck, seized the opportunity to risk his reputation (and rating points) by offering to use that deck. Thus I enter with Bowmen Archery/Uruks and he with Men-Hobbit/lame shadow.<br>
A nice turnout of 21, higher than usual. The last one had 10. The peak was still in that January-March period where attendance tittered at the 30-mark.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
vs Benjamin Lin<br>
Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith/Merry, Friend to Sam start<br>
Elven Archery-Horn of Boromir/Isengard Orcs<br>
<br>
I bid 1 and get to go first. I get the Pony out and get a satisfactory hand. There&#39;s Nenya, but no Galadriel, not too good. I move, find out his shadow, and am pretty relaxed. Archery screws those Orcs up pretty bad.<br>
He played Galadriel and Mirror on Site 3, Mirrored twice, and I tried hard to stifle my smile when you moved. Down came Tower Assassin at exactly the right time to punish her. How nice, you finally get the combo set up to annoy your opponent for the rest of the adventure path and your opponent slaps you in the face with it, rendering useless all your Site 6 allies, Nenyas, Mirrors etc. at just Site 4. Dang, I&#39;m evil.<br>
This guy has one very big problem. He never dares to double-move. He can whip my Uruks around with big-brother Boromir and 13-strength Celeborn every turn, leaving no minions around, yet he never even entertained the notion of double-moving. He did attempt one after we had a casual game and was panting in relief when I didn&#39;t kill him. Bleh, no risk no gain.<br>
Needless to say, I was way ahead on the adventure path. On his Free Peoples, he jumps into the Bridge and I play 2 Uruks with Saruman, Keeper of Isengard. During maneuver phase, he does not think twice before passing: he figured he did not need the Horn to survive this turn. So Merry and Boromir step up. One of the Uruks kills Merry and the other...he passed on his skirmish action and said Damage +1 would kill the Uruk. Don&#39;t think so. His eyes widened in horror as I prevented a wound with Saruman, meaning both Uruks came back for the fierce skirmish. Frodo had to fight. He tried to PATHS out, and Saruman laughed in his face.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Props:<br>
-Finished the game way ahead of anybody else<br>
-Mirror? No problem<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-His phobia of double-moves<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
vs Loh Mun Kit<br>
Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith/Merry, Friend to Sam start<br>
Men-Hobbit Denial/Lame Shadow<br>
<br>
How nice, me and him meet. After his first game, he commented that the shadow was doing horribly for him, and that he had hung on with his Fellowship. The Free Peoples was definitely strong: I had started a reign of terror with it, but the Shadow...one of the mechanisms it uses is surprise, and against me, who knows every intricacy of the deck (Twilight Witch-King + Isengard Warrior, Can You Protect Me From Yourself? + Orthanc Berserker + Enquea + Orc Overseer + Tower of Orthanc, Cantea + Isengard Smith), he would lose perhaps his only advantage.<br>
He got to go first and immediately made the double to 3. I too follow closely on his heels, getting quite a good Free Peoples hand. He is stopped at 4 by non-roaming Uruks at Hollin and I double into 5 without any problem at all, archery taking care of the minions which emerged. His Fellowship was a little burdened with wounds at this point, and so he checked my hand for Savagery and found none, before dropping Pippin, Hobbit of Some Intelligence as a 5th companion. He moved into 5, where Pippin died and he took more wounds. On my side, I moved into 6 without any wounds when a Can You Protect hit me. That was his disadvantage: he could not know fully how to play the deck. I was already on the key 3 burdens, just 2 away from the magic 5, and I could now happily exhaust Aragorn at the sanctuary.<br>
By this time, he acknowledged to himself that his shadow would be toothless to stop me. I had set up lots of toys already including Mirror, multiple Bowmen, Splendor and such. He made an extremely ill-advised double into 7 against Uruks, but miraculously emerged largely unscathed, except for the death of Boromir. I had Gift of Boats ready for the triple for he was trying to race me to the end. I faced no minions at 7 but pressed on even though I knew he was saving the minions. 5 minions came out: Overseer, 2 Isengard Smiths, Retainer and Toldea (he could spot 4 burdens). Not good. I killed Toldea off during archery but by the time the dust was settled. 3 Isengard Orcs were still on the table, and though they were all exhausted, the problem was if I made the last jump to 9, he only needed a SINGLE ISENGARD WARRIOR to win me! That was a chance I could not take, and I had to finally let it go. It turned out that he had no minions in hand actually, but well...<br>
Having achieved the first part of his objective, he played as many toys as he could including Sam, Proper Poet and moved. I was a little worried. That deck of mine ran 3 PATHS, and those could almost guarantee a safe passage to 9. The turn before when I Mirrored, I had pulled a PATHS but had discarded a minion instead of it as I had planned on the triple-move. He still had 3 cards left in hand...shrug.<br>
I used the generous dosage of twilight to get Lurtz, Troop and Tower Assassin down (I noticed with a sinking feeling that I had run out of Sarumans early on and thus could only rely on high-vitality minions). His allies out were Filibert and Bounder. On my maneuver, I wounded, and only wounded, Bounder. Killing him would have no other effect than to get himself shot by near-exhausted Aragorn. Then, during the archery phase, he made something of a mistake. He took Lurtz&#39;s archery wound on Isildur&#39;s Bane, racking up a total of 7 burdens (but then really, he had no other choice). All his companions died off except Aragorn and Frodo, but he charged for 9, knowing full well my Free Peoples could deal with whatever he played.<br>
I drew 3 more Uruks including another Troop so they too came out. 5 Uruks went on Frodo. He did have 3 PATHS, but he was on 7 burdens. On hindsight, even if he had taken the archery wound on Aragorn, I would have won too as my Troop of Uruk-Hai would then still be at 4-vitality, and could overwhelm Frodo as Bounder had been wounded.<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Props:<br>
-Won again with shadow<br>
-Pretty close at the end<br>
-Both my decks rock!<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-None. Great game.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
vs Gene Wong<br>
Aragorn, Ranger of the North start<br>
2-Companion Choke/Isengard Orcs<br>
<br>
He bid 2 to my 1 and let me go first. He revealed his starting fellowship and I knew immediately what to expect, and what to do: dump all minions....FAST.<br>
I ran to 3 without any problem, though I sighed when I saw his shadow. My 3rd Isengard Orcs opponent that day. As for his Free Peoples, it was bloody mean. Moria can laugh at his deck, and Nazgul can get a key minion or two down early to knock the fellowship out but my Uruks were getting downright screwed. He gave me 2-3 twilight every turn (I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll appreciate me revealing how he choked me, so I won&#39;t), and my hand stayed around 5/8 shadow. At least I knew how to deal with this type of deck though, which abnormality was why I suppose my previous 2 predecessors against him had lost.<br>
The Fellowship took its time to set up: that had to be expected from Choke, and thus I found myself regularly losing skirmishes against those Orcs. Then at 4, I contemplated a long while before dropping Galadriel, Boromir and Blade together, giving him a generous 17 twilight, whereupon 5 minions came out against my 5 companions. Frodo had to fight, and the guy with the lowest strength was Servant, with 7. That would not be enough...I hoped.<br>
I used White Arrows once to ensure he did not have skirmish events, and left him with 1 card. I thought about using Arrows again but decided not to, as he would cause me more than 6 wounds in the regroup phase, and I needed every able body. The minions were assigned, Aragorn with Ranger&#39;s Sword was chopping Isengard Servant up when suddenly he dropped the last card in his hand. Servants to Saruman. PHEW! I took the wound and thanked the gods. Frodo did not die, but the turn did end with me taking 6 wounds, ending with me having a fully exhausted fellowship and 4-burden Frodo. D&#39;oh!<br>
I dropped my 1st minion at the Bridge. Woohoo! And it came with a Saruman&#39;s Power. Woohoo! But then, the game never progressed far enough for my shadow to do anything. The stage was clear: my Free Peoples against his Shadow.<br>
I managed to take 2 wounds off with Aragorn signet and Galadriel, and I laid off playing Mirror, because I figured the +2 would spell the doom of 1 or 2 companions. I moved, giving him an extra 3 twilight from Tower, and thankfully, he played only Isengard Smith and Nelya, none of them wounding minions, and I took care of them promptly.<br>
I took 7 wounds off at the sanctuary and set up Mirror business. I moved into Anduin Wilderland and sensed trouble when he only played Isengard Warrior. LoL, nobody plays Isengard Warrior at Anduin Wilderland unless...I was happy to take it slow though, as he was. No point risking it like I did at 5.<br>
So, a single to 8 saw a single minion too. Then I used Sting at 8 during my fellowship phase, and saw he only had 2 minions, and a bunch of regroup events which would not work at Site 9. Didn&#39;t get to Mirror any of the 2 minions away, but who cares? After those 2 exerted themselves to cause wounds at Wastes of Emyn Muil, Aragorn and Legolas blew them into oblivion.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Props:<br>
-Frodo didn&#39;t die. He later said he figured I would Stealth or something at 5.<br>
-Nenya says &quot;HAH&quot; to hand-choke.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-3rd opponent running Isengard Orcs? Huh??<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
vs Yeo Leck Koon<br>
Arwen, Daughter of Elrond/Legolas, Son of Thranduil start<br>
Shoulder Fire/Moria Swarm<br>
Hmm...I must say Moria will be a stroll in the park with my large archery total. There is the threat of Anduin Wilderland but I am pretty sure he, playing Shoulder Fire himself, will not be so stupid as to do that to himself. As for Free Peoples, he hates facing Uruks. Damage +1 can net heavy dents in the companions early and there&#39;s the God himself, Saruman, Keeper of Isengard and most importantly, his POWER.<br>
This match will be interesting. Both of us are running big Free Peoples Archery, though two rather diverse kinds. It will be a shooting contest to the end.<br>
<br>
He wins the bid and goes first. He is stopped at 2 after I give him his nightmare Saruman and an Uruk. I double into 3, shooting down some worthless Moria junk. He contemplates a while before giving me a load of twilight, hitting the Rule of 4 at Trollshaw and playing Elrond, enough for Lurtz and an Uruk, but he had The Choice of Luthien out, which was enough for Lurtz to die to Aragorn&#39;s Bow and the other Uruk to die to normal archery after he had Council of Elrond-ed a Splendor of Their Banners. He stops though with his large amount of woods.<br>
His combo was setting up really quickly, and this wasn&#39;t too good for me. I moved into 4, shot down a single Moria Scout. Minion-screwed, hmm? But the luxury of Moria is that they can don&#39;t play a minion at Site 4 yet intimidate you into stopping because of the Balrog&#39;s recursive ability, and knowing him, he had to have saved a minion to get the Balrog out. I stopped. He too stopped at 4, because of Saruman.<br>
I took my wounds against the Balrog and shot down his helper and moved again, to Dimrill Dale. Again, more shooting saved the day.<br>
I got the Mirror set up first and started to dump his minions. Amusingly, I Mirrored away his only Mirror, so he never had it set up. He moved to 5, and Saruman notwithstanding, actually survived a double to 6, shooting off every minion! The combos were really in full effect for both of us. Our shadows were failing now, it was a race between the Free Peoples, and I wryly noted to myself that I was out of Sarumans.<br>
I moved to 7...Silverlode Banks (hah, knew it), and faced 2 1-vitality Orcs and a Troll. I wasn&#39;t worried. I shot the Troll with the Bow twice, before Legolas exerted himself twice for 4 archery total against his combined 4 vitality. Horrible mistake! I forgot that wounds were put on separately, and he put 1 wound on an Orc, saved it with Armory, before taking the remaining 3 wounds, leaving the Cave Troll still standing! Boromir had not been healed completely and Aragorn was caught with his pants down after not shooting the Troll cleanly. A horrendous mistake, and Arwen died, and I paid the price of not being able to double-move. One more exertion from Bow and I would make an easy move to 8, one less and Arwen died and I still had a Troll to contend with on the next site if I dared to move again (though I still had that last exertion to kill the Troll off).<br>
He made an easy double to 8, but got hit by my Saruman&#39;s Power. My Sting however revealed that he had already drawn into replacement conditions. I had to move into 9, with 4 very wounded companions.<br>
I dumped 2 minions with Mirror and thus only faced 3 Orcs, even after he pitched his whole hand to They are Coming. They were all shot or hacked down. It was risky...4 companions with limited archery shots...<br>
Then he reconciled his hand and muttered &quot;just nice.&quot; I looked and noticed he had drawn out his deck. Hmm? He had 2 Rangers on the table but only 1 No Stranger. He only got out 1 Armory the whole game. Yes, I was very sure that 4 cards out of his 8-card hand were useless. He had no draw deck for Goblin Scimitar or Summit of Amon Hen to draw into. He had no They Are Coming after I had Sentinel-ed it earlier on. There was no bloody way he would kill me.<br>
I moved again and he conceded, with only 2 minions in his hand.<br>
<br>
