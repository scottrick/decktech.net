And he said: &quot;Play the best song in the world, or I&#39;ll eat your soul.&quot; Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other, and we each said... &quot;Okay.&quot; And we played the first thing that came to our heads, just so happened to be, the Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World. <br>

-- Tenacious D <br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------- <br>
<br>
FORWARD: I am trying to write this TR and watch David Lynch&#39;s Muholland Dr. This is a very difficult skill to partake in so please bear with me. If I start talking backwards there a good chance I&#39;ve been replaced by an Italian Midgit, in that case someone please tell my friends that the Italian Midgit is really me. <br>
<br>
PROLOGUE: There&#39;s not much to say. There was a pre-release for the new set that we had been eagerly anticipating since Team Grand Slam had a distaste for the Mines of Moria aka &quot;Balrog Style.&quot; So we were ready to roll up onto Denver from Ft. Collins to get some Elven Sauce. Tim &quot;The Hair&quot; Kefalas picked me up from my homestead at like 9:30 in the AM. We needed a map from Yahoo to locate Attactixs in Aurora. After some severe doughnut eating Tim began the &quot;long haul&quot; which involved a sleeping Keen, interupted by the radio playing some Tenacious D. (You gotta beleive me, I wish you were there!) We got to Attactix at 10:30 in the AM and went inside to see the pregame. The tournamanet wouldn&#39;t start until NOON on the dot, so I just drooled over half of the Gaming Store because it was a REAL gaming store. We were allowed to pay our 25 sheckels and got to chew on some Krispy Kremes (Oh Ya Baby) Then the Arrival of our next member of Team Grand Slam, Sean Gilfoyle brought us to the totale of three for this event. All three of us had never played in a limited format of LotR before, but we were certain that it was going to be terrible. We just had to try to play good cause we wanted some extra packs, which is always good. <br>
<br>
I saw some familiar Colorado Faces (out of 47 people) as usual: Kyle &quot;Explicitly Deleted&quot; Craft, Tim &quot;Micky T&quot; McKnight, Matt &quot;My Kung-Fu is bettah than yours&quot; Reicks, William Dieniega, Chris &quot;I&#39;m in all of Jason&#39;s slop sections&quot; Fanchi, Tony Fanchi, Thomas McGee etc etc. Oh and lets not forget the #8 Ranked Sealed Deck player in the World William Springer (1673). Scott &quot;The Man&quot; Gatea was running the show as usual, and we get our gear at about 12:00 sharp. <br>
<br>
THE PILE: Ah yes, I sat on the side of the table that gave out LEGOLAS decks. That was me and Sean, Tim sat on the BOROMIR side. I open my action and I find to my Suprise one Two useful rares, ELROND and the Elven Citadel. I got like 3 more minions in my packs, which was not good because I felt that it would take good minions to win these games. However I got a fellowship draw apparently. So I slapped my pile together and it was time to get it on! <br>
<br>
GAME 1 Darren Jost (1500) BOROMIR <br>
This was the beginging. I started with Haldir and Legolas, and I tried to go first, but I was out bid. Well I used my fellowship to survive against his orcish hoardes. My Elven allies nad bonus cards were able to keep my chumps alaive versus the onslaught. I just tried to draw out minion cards from my deck to drop a bomb on Darren at the Bridge. I just waited him out and then he moved to 5 and got some Ewoks (you know, those 3 wound Uruk-Hai&#39;s that look like Ewoks?) and got like 10 strenght stacked against Fro-Dawgs 4 strength. I really wish I could remember more about this game but I really don&#39;t and this is what I beleive characterized most games that were played by Legolas vs. Boromir. Suffice it to say these games are exquisitly boring. Either way, I won, and a Win is a Win. <br>
Full Win +3 <br>
3 points <br>
<br>
Highs: I won my first ever sealed deck game!!!!!! WOO-HOO! <br>
Lows: I played in my first ever sealed deck game!!!!! WOO-HOO! <br>
<br>
GAME 2 Jason Shapiro (1500) LEGOLAS <br>
We bid, I lose and go second. My plan for this game is to win a fellowship victory with my Five Man Fellowship and Uber Allies. I figured this would be more entertaining than obliterating Fellowships on the Bridge. So I get Elrond out, and Salbereth and Godalalala, with my Citadel in effect I could double move. I get to rumbling and am ablr to avoif losing members of the fellowship. Jason was able to get some good moves on me cause my Minions at the core are horrendous. So I was never able to slow him down. I did like three double moves throughout the game, learning how these Elven Allies functioned in the regroup phase and I was able to realize the &quot;Supah-Dupah Elven Power.&quot; However, my Evil Ewoks were not strong enough to surpass Jason&#39;s Fellowship. He moves to my site Nine, the tracker site. Low and behold there is ONE tracker in my discard and no minions in my hand. After the game I checked my last EIGHT cards in my deck, 7 of them were minions. Pretty interesting I believe. I lost. <br>
Full Loss +1 <br>
4 points <br>
<br>
Highs: I learned about D&#39;s new &quot;Supah-Dupah Elven Power&quot;!!! <br>
Lows: I did not use the Power according to my Stature? Wait a second! <br>
<br>
MIDDLE ROUND DISCUSSION: Sean is 2-0, I&#39;m 1-1, and Tim is 0-2. Sean comes out and proposes a theory about &quot;Companions +1&quot;. Prettly solid theory I beleive. All you need to do to go 6-0 in RotEL Sealed deck is to get a minion for every companion they have in play, plus one more, play them on the bridge and BAM! victory, &quot;Emeril Style!&quot; Tim feels that he can apply this to the BOROMIR decks, mainly because he will be playing against children in the lower brackets. Sigh, I must do without hope as the Third round begins. <br>
<br>
GAME 3: Ian Cole (1500) LEGOLAS <br>
This kid had a Pink Floyd, Dark Side of ths Moon t-shirt on, I thought that was Money. We set up, I bid about Tree-Fity and go first. I begin to apply Sean&#39;s &quot;Companions +1&quot; theory this game, and I just hand hold all of me Evil Ewoks until they fall out of my hand on the Bridge. I play all my Elven Jank just to get the Ewok Sauce prepared &quot;Emeril Style&quot; and I turn it up a notch with a Bred for Battle and then BAM! auto-win on the Bridge. Unsatisfying but important for my record. <br>
Full Win +3 <br>
7 points <br>
<br>
Highs: Sooooo, So I wish you were here. Is that even on Dark Side? Sigh . . . <br>
Lows: Hold on, let me check that out on the internet, this is very important . . . excuse me. Hum, apparently if you go to Amazon.com and type Pink Floyd the first thing that comes up is Pink&#39;s newest Album Mizundastood. However Wish You Were Here is its own album, that was my bad Floyd Fans. <br>
Hum Muholland Drive is pulling a fast one on me hold up a sec guys. <br>
<br>
- hum Lesbians. <br>
<br>
GAME 4: Derek Belloni (1500) BOROMIR <br>
My Belloni has a first name it D-E-R-E-K. ALRIGHT, I&#39;ll stop it. I made a vow at the Taco Bell between Games 3-4 that &quot;Companions +1&quot; its totally lame and &quot;Supah-Dupah Elven Power&quot; is well; Supah-Dupah. So my goal against Derek was to win, Fellowship Style. I start of bidding like 6 to start the sprint. I set up my solid Fellowship (Frodo w/ Pan, Boromir, Legolas, and Haldir) and I play my Trifecta of allies. I begin to rol on down the site path, using my Allies to gain the uper hand, using Elrond to heal my allies and Boromir whenever I could. I was using my Evil Ewoks to slow down Derek&#39;s terrible Boromir Fellowship. His minions aren&#39;t able to do too much to me. Elven Bonuses and Elven Allies is almost like playing a Gandalf Control deck, without the good Gandalf Sauce. Without going into more detail on this horrendous game, Ewoks and all I amke it to Site Nine and I get there squeaky clean. <br>
Full Win +3 <br>
10 points <br>
<br>
Highs: Woot, a Fellowship Victory. I defy you &quot;Companions +1&quot; theory! <br>
Lows: Hum, I had no lows then, but I think Muholland Drive is over, uh no wait. It continues. Oh wait it ended. Hum, I have no idea what just happened, in fact I have a headache. I own 400+ DVDs and to not know what happened in a movie is downright disgraceful. <br>
Hum, okay. Aspirin is definatly in order. <br>
<br>
Game 5 Matt Reicks (1614) BOROMIR <br>
Matt tells me that he is getting married sometime this fall so I have to throw a shout out to Matt for that. Matt is the only person I play against that I actually know, so this should be interesting. Again I decide to play my Fellowship in the Supah-Dupah fashion and bid high to go first. Again, I just draw to set up my fellowship with Elven Allies and Fellowship members for a couple double moves, preferably sites 1-3, 4-6, and 7-8. I this game, I get my wishes as Elrond pimps out advise for my Fellowship. I use Godlalalal to control the table against the Orcs, and I use my Frying Pan to take care of the Orcish Weapon Guy (who can pump to a SIXTEEN, dear lord) and I get my solid double moves. He cannot handle my Evil Ewoks so well however. I am able to use them surgically to keep him bend me on the site path, enabling an easy walking victory. I move into sit Nine, a little torn and am able to maage so that Matt&#39;s Minions can kill everyone BUT Frodo, and I get the Full Win in a long game. <br>
Full Win +3 <br>
13 points <br>
<br>
Highs: Wow, 4-1 in a a HUGE tournament, its looking good, and Sean just beat Kyle Craft to become 5-0, so the presence of Team Grand Slam is being felt in Attactix today. Ching, my brother bought me a soda! <br>
Lows: None really, I&#39;m having a blast winning Fellowship Victories with a terrible, terrible Fellowship Deck, and of course defying Mr. 5-0&#39;s theory about Minion-only wins. <br>
<br>
GAME 6 (Finally) Ben Bonadore (1500) LEGOLAS <br>
So if I win this I will get some good prize support I imagine. Again I bid high and try to play this as a Fellowship Power deck. I set up the same was I did in the last three games, using my Allies to take control. Oh, I should not forget the importance of Foul Creation in these games. I have learned the impotance of this card in this Sealed event. It was a surgical tool in winning this game against Ben, he had an amazing amount of good Uruk-Hai Minions (Rare Saruman, Orc Commander, Orc Retainer) but Foul Creation sucsessfully picked them out of play. Much of the Time I had to deal with his Evil Ewoks, but he never got an uber swarm on me. Things got tricky towards the end of the game . I moved to his site 7 of course, and we ALL know what site 7 in the Legolas site deck is! Silverlode Banks of course, for some awful reason. I just got done with healing and then had to exert again, how silly is that? anyways I deal with his Ewoks and hold up to draw more healing. On my next turn I draw, Boromir, Haldir, and Legolas for the classic 3 heal turn, along with my heal from Elrond last turn. I move to the no maneuver 8 site, and I properly fend off one or two minions with my Archery and Lothlorien Woods Citadel. I move to his site nine, which is TolBrandi, he plays six guys on my, and it seems that I am in trouble, afterall this is the &quot;Companion +1&quot; theory in effect. However, I continue to defy the theory and he drops two guys on my Fro-Dawg w/ Frying Pan. He stacks a 6 and a 5 against Frodo. Frodo&#39;s future i nthe Trilogy is looking bleak, Oh Wait! I exert Boromir to make him a 8, and then I exert him again to make him an 11, and then I exert SaelBerth to subtract two from from some ewok, so Fro-dawg actually wins the Skirmish, interesting that huh? Big Win for me! <br>
<br>
Full Win +3 <br>
16 points <br>
Highs: 5-1 has to be a top place in this tournament. So I am highly happy because I got 5-1. Oh also Sean won his sixth game, so he went 6-0 with the &quot;Companions +1&quot; Theory. Well, as Anakin Skywalker would say . . . if it works. <br>
Lows: I feel Sorry for tim cause He had to play a Boromir deck, and he did so poorly with it. <br>
<br>
CONCLUSION: Sean gets 10 packs for first place. Kyle Craft, and Micky T get 2nd and 3rd, and I get 5 packs for 4th place. Tim gets one for going 3-3. After we get our spoils we head to the Armadillo where we have spanish food, Emeril Style! <br>
<br>
PROPS: <br>
Decipher: For having a pre-release and giving out free jack. <br>
Team Grand Slam: for getting 1st and 4th, I think thats awesome considering we have never played in a Limited LotR format tournament before. <br>
Scott Gatea: Of course for running it and giving out free Krispy Kremes. <br>
The people I played: For being great opponents. <br>
Tim: For not dropping and driving me back and forth. <br>
My Mother: For getting me doughnuts for Breakfeast. Solid. <br>
Armadillo and Taco Bell: Fake Mexican Food is part of the Classical Sauce. <br>
Tenacious D: Heh, I got nothing else to say. <br>
Supah-Dupah Elven Power: For being money on this day! <br>
&quot;Companions +1&quot;: Well I guess it brought Sean to a 6-0 finishimmer has to be valid, eh? <br>
Frying Pan: Heh, that card is serious comedy. <br>
Team USA (World Cup Style): USA, USA, USA, USA! <br>
<br>
SLOPS: <br>
Decipher: for not actually playtesting either of these decks. I mean honestly Silver Lode Banks in a NON Ranger Deck? It&#39;s just so, so, so rediculous! <br>
Kyle Craft: For giving my friend sean some guff after your game with him. I know your not an a** Kyle, its just your style! <br>
BOROMIR decks: For being complete and utter piles of cards. I mean honestly, out TOP TEN was Legolas Decks. I guess thats what he deserves for betraying the Fellowship though. <br>
Osprey History Books: For being way too overpriced! <br>
That Woman who started the Fire in Colorado: I mean seriously, this is like the worst example of littering of all times. I mean she threw out the paper, it was on fire, and it destroyed peoples lives. I mean thats a pretty bad thing to do, throw away a fiery piece of paper into our dry desert woods. I guess all I&#39;m saying if if your going to get angry and burn your ex-husband&#39;s letter of betrayl of fire and you get super pissed, be sesible, THROW IT IN THE TRAshimmerhats why the trash was created, just for those certain momments when you get super angry and you want to throw a fiery piece of paper into the forest. Our advanced civilization was able to afford such delicacies, let us embrace that fact! <br>
Joel Schumaker: I Hope he makes a movie about the Colorado Fires. That would be awesome. Like he could take a perfectly bad idea, and make it even WORSE! Only Joel Schumaker could possibly do that. <br>
Chris Fanchi: And can you believe it, he told me he STILL plays Star Wars! <br>
