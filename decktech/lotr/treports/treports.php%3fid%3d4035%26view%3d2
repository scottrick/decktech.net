So, consider yourself warned, the details might be thin, and you are NOT reading a report from a Top-4 finisher.  P.S. - When I say &quot;SWCCG&quot;, I&#39;m not talking the open on Sunday.  I&#39;m talking something much better.  Secret Squirrel on Saturday night.  That format is money....<br>
<br>
O.K., so Freedom-Con 2 was on October 4/5/6, SUPPOSEDLY in Philadelphia, since it started out as &quot;DPC Philly&quot;.  Let me go on record right off the bat as saying it was a solid HOUR outside of Philly out into Amish down.  Probably not a big deal for most, but for anybody coming out of town (VA for me), it was just one more frigin&#39; hour in the car trying to get around those slow-poke Lansdale Amish and their gosh darnit horse-and-buggies.  I thought the tractors on the road down here in VA were annoying.  Geez.  Still though, the location of the store couldn&#39;t have been better (except for Cedar Grove NJ, nothing beats the sandwiches up there).  Within walking distance of the store, there was a pizza joint, a Subway, a Wendy&#39;s, a chinese restaurant, and a Bagel Shop.  Normally, I&#39;m not the bagel shop type, but since the place was staying open specifically for F-Con folks (and letting us play half the tourney in there) I felt obligated to patronize them.  They made a friggin&#39; BLT on an everything bagel that was f*ckin&#39; phenomenal.  And on top of that, the counter chicks were cute *and* willing to talk to gamers.  How often do you see that combination?  Really?  Matt Lush is about the only gamer I&#39;ve ever met that routinely has hot chicks coming up to him.<br>
<br>
So I have to leave VA Friday afternoon, which means I need a deck built by Thursday night.  As is typical for me, I say &quot;why bother, Rings is so luck heavy, I&#39;ll just throw any 66 cards together&quot; and so I did.  The Shadow side was Uruks, since they&#39;re the only thing less original than Moria, and the Fellowship side was just a big pile of wounding crap.  Small Fellowship with No Stranger/Bill the Pony to keep down the twilight, and Gondor Bowmen, Double Shots, PATHS, Frying Pan, Blade of Gondor, etc. to try to kill whatever made it through.  It starts Legolas/Sam and the Pony bidding four.  In theory, the Freeples card should have flowed through my hand, but I found my Shadow side clogging me up quite often.  Sons a tookes.<br>
<br>
So I drive five hours to Jersey, get measured for a tux, and go to the Olive Garden.  In case you haven&#39;t noticed, all my stuff somehow comes back to food, which is probably why I&#39;ve gained 40 pounds over the last 4 years.  Anyway, I head over to the WotC store to meet Greg &quot;Ghetto Leader&quot; Hodur and see what&#39;s going on.  Apparently all that&#39;s going on is telling me how gay I am for playing Lord of the Rings, and a lot of nodding from the Magic players.  So then I drive another friggin&#39; hour up to John &quot;The Bookie&quot; Lolli&#39;s house, since I&#39;m crashing on his floor and hoping to get one game in to test this pile of crap I call a deck.  But by the time I get there, it&#39;s bedtime at the old folks home, so I pretty much just brush my teeth and go to bed.  We were supposed to have a major basketball game with the Kashyyyk guys at 8AM Saturday, but Kim told us it was drizzling at 4PM Friday, so everybody half-a$sed it and it fell through.  Next day we roll out to Bumblef*ck, I mean, &quot;Lansdale&quot;, sign in, eat, and off we go.  BTW, my scrub-rating coming in is 1665....<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 1  My pile of 66 stupid cards vs. Daniel Curran&#39;s (1822) Horn/Archery deck.<br>
<br>
I win the bid and go first, and make the double move into the Sanctuary pretty easily.  He drops most of his allies early, so I get some twilight to drop some Uruks and slow him at 2.  I watched him discard Such A Little thing during my jump to 3, so I figure I&#39;ll put Boromir down now to take advantage of the Heir/Courtyard twilight removal.  Doesn&#39;t really matter, when I move to site 4, he drops that first archer and A Little Thing&#39;s Boromir while I don&#39;t even have two possessions.  That sucked.  From there are on, we&#39;re both really only moving one site per turn, my uruks are chewing up all his allies, his archery is handing out enough wounds to keep me from exerting for things like Bowmen and Directed.  We hit my site 7 (he must&#39;ve doubled somewhere between Sanctuaries), and discard all allies.  Next turn when he moves to 8, he&#39;s like &quot;Oops, I forgot something, do you mind if I go back?&quot;  I tell him sure, because let&#39;s face it, I&#39;m not winning anyway, so why bother being a pipeweed to the guy.  Of course &quot;something&quot;, was deploying Galadriel and exerting her to drop another Elf free, so he had just enough fodder to not let Frodo die too.  On my turn, I probably could have waited to kill Frodo with my Shadow, but I decided to double-move instead.  So kill what I can at 8, go to nine where I have to let just about everybody die AND put on the Ring to take archery wounds, but the end result is that after a double-PATHS, I have Frodo alone, exhausted, and with 8 burdens.  But I win.<br>
FW 3 (3)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 2 My crap vs. Neal Razi&#39;s (1934) Trust Me/Uruk Worry deck.<br>
<br>
Neal wins the bid and goes first, and that&#39;s when I find the first problem with throwing 66 cards together, lack of foreplanning.  It never occurred to me while deck building half-asleep, that somebody might outbid me and start the Green Dragon Inn.  I don&#39;t have another 2-twilight guy to start with Legolas.  So it&#39;s start Lego/Sam and waste the Inn&#39;s text to have them die while fishing for Aragorn, or start Aragorn, pull Sam, and have Double Shots clogging my hand.  Of course Arwen is in my deck now, but at the time, I had to start Lego/Sam.  He started Ghetto Legolas (+3 against Naz) and Gimli SOG, so you know what he&#39;s playing.  I of course get handclogged early with crap like Ranger Sword, but he also gets Gandalf screwed.  So the first couple of sites move slow while we try to undo the crap in our hands, Neal having the slight advantage by virtue of finding all his Saruman&#39;s Ambitions to put out into play.  We go site-by-site, and eventually he gets Gandalf/Trust and is handling my Uruks O.K.  I on the other hand, have people dying left and right, and don&#39;t manage to get to an Aragorn until site 6.  At which point he drops one Uruk, and chucks all the Ambitions to put Aragorn immediately back out of my misery.  Finally at the next site, another pair of Uruks come down and eat Frodo&#39;s soul, who was already exhausted from Worry.<br>
FL 1 (4)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 3 My junk vs. Michael Patton&#39;s (1682) Ranger/Nazgul deck.<br>
<br>
This game was pretty uneventful, we both bid 4, but he won the die-roll.  He started Arwen/Sam to my Legolas/Sam, moved one site and stopped at 2.  I followed suit, but drew mostly Shadow crap and had to stop at 2 as well.  He Pathfinder&#39;ed the Ford, and got him self set up with No Stranger, Ranger Sword, etc.  The game went back and forth for a while without much exciting.  He&#39;s doing the Blade Tip/Black Breath thing, I&#39;m just throwing anything I can at him as I am always a site behind.  Finally, he moves to 9 and I have one chance for my shadow to make up for the shortcomings of my Fellowship, and instead, I draw I big pile of FP cards.  So I think I get to put out something like two Uruks and no Saruman at the &quot;hand minions cost -1&quot; site, and lose.<br>
FL 1 (5)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 4 My rancid garbage vs. Bill Kafer&#39;s Nazgul Corruption.<br>
<br>
I know Bill from my Wars days in Jersey, so naturally we have a good time this game.  Rings can almost be entertaining as long as neither player is taking it at all seriously, so it was cool.  He started Legolas and Gimli DotMR, and I went first.  Bill was playing Twilight Nazgul Corruption, and didn&#39;t have much luck with early minions.  He did add the burdens here and there, but I healed Sam at site 3 and had him take off a couple more before I fed him off to the &#39;Rog.  Basically I stopped Bill when I could with my Uruks, and whenever he did get Naz down on me, just threw a bunch of archery at him.  The one possible turning point of the game happened at site 4.  Twilight Nelya came down, and I tried to throw three archery in him, but he All Blades Perish&#39;ed one of them.  So I figured what the hell, let&#39;s put him on unarmed Frodo and see if he&#39;s holding a second Blades.  If he is, I lose, no big deal.  I PATH&#39;ed, he didn&#39;t have a second All Blades, and I pretty much ran to the end.<br>
FW 3 (8)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 5 My dog vomit vs. Mike Bianco&#39;s (1578) Horn/Uruks deck.<br>
<br>
I knew Mike from R-Con3, we had played Billy Gunn vs. Chyna in the play-offs of a Raw Deal tourney.  Mike&#39;s a good guy, and really sharp considering he&#39;s newer to Rings than a lot of people.  Anyway, we&#39;re both playing Uruks, except he&#39;s throwing allies in front of mine, so he keeps a perpetual edge on me after the first time I fail to double-jump.  But you know how Uruks work, I did manage to meat-grind away almost everybody by the time he reached site 8.  I thought I had a snowball&#39;s chance of double-jumping if he stopped, but realizing we were both playing the same site anyway, he moved on and watched me draw 1 additional minion.  Yay me.<br>
FL 1 (9)<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 6  My toe-jam vs. Michael Chen&#39;s (1500) Allies/Uruks deck.<br>
<br>
Now at this point, we all should have dropped and gone and played that game of basketball.  But John and Chris both were clinging to that mathematical possibility of sneaking into the playoffs (kinda like Tampa Bay does every year), so we all stayed in.  I get a guy with no rating who starts the Arwen Lady Umendel, so I think alright, play a casual game with a newbie and get back to .500.  Heh, I should have been so lucky.  Michael was actually playing all that site 3 Ally crap that you look at and say &quot;I guess it could work if you could get all the cards out&quot;, with Arwen, multiple Home 3 guys, Saelbeth, etc.  So with old-school Elrond healing all those idiots every turn, my Uruks were actually very rarely winning a skirmish.  Even the Troops were going down to Arwen who was a six herself, but brought them down to five with Stalebreath.  It was ridiculous.  So with no ability to do damage, I tried to run on him.  But I was at 8 when he pulled out of 6, and I couldn&#39;t find my Saruman&#39;s Power the site before he triggered Gift of Boats, so he sailed right past me.  I might have a chance even losing skirmishes just based on volume of guys after three sites of moving, but as he sailed into Site 9, I drew the 4 FP cards that would have secured my win if he had no Boats.  Stupid Game.<br>
FL 1 (10)<br>
<br>
COMMENTARY: This is what makes this game so shimmerty.  If I constantly draw Events/Conditions/Weapons and no minions, fine.  That&#39;s because I&#39;m a bad deck builder.  But with FP and Shadow sides being required to be the same size, there is no other excuse for always drawing the exact opposite of what I need other than luck.  I make sure my decks have half-decent through-put, I discard appropriately, play cards when I can, etc. to make sure I don&#39;t get hand-clogged.  But that is the best I can do as a player.  To continually draw into a random clump of FP cards at site 9 is completely beyond my control.  There&#39;s not much else you can do other than give yourself the chance to draw 5 or 6 cards as he moves into your last site.  But yet you can lose a game simply because of what order your cards decided to take as they stacked into your deck.  No skill can save you, and while the new mulligan rule does help early, it doesn&#39;t do shimmer late.  And this is why this game sucks.  You can maintain minion ratios and through-put all you want, and be leading the majority of the game.  But come crunch-time, win or lose is right up there with rolling dice.  Being the World Champ of Lord of the Rings is like being the World&#39;s Greatest Coin-Flip Guesser.<br>
<br>
<br>
That being said, I would still stay in at 2-4 just because I never think quitting is the answer, but then Mike Carr explains &quot;Secret Squirrel&quot; to us.  It&#39;s a wierd SWCCG format where you get some type of sealed deck, an EPP, and a few packs, and you just play all the cards.  Everything, light and dark mashed together.  Characters are table-unique, but locations get deployed however you like them.  For a $15 donation to the UMDF, you got a OTSD + packs first round, SE Starter Deck + packs second round, Death Star 2 deck + random packs for the third round, and Jabba&#39;s Palace + packs for the final round.  Plus every round gave you an additional EPP.  I couldn&#39;t pass that up, since I am the self procliamed &quot;Greatest Sealed Deck Player of All Time&quot;.  Seriously.  If we both sit down with a equal pile of random SWCCG cards, I will beat you.<br>
<br>
The main reason I mention this, is that A) It was a shimmerload of fun, I highly recommend anyone looking to unwind at D-Con give it a try and B) I was told the prize support was provided by the Player&#39;s Committee.  Say what you want about the Player&#39;s Committee, but for going 4-0 in Secret Squirrel, I was given every Ref3 DS Foil (except the URs).  That&#39;s was something like 45 foils slapped into my hand for doing nothing but having the most fun I&#39;ve had a cards in a year.  So we gave some foils to local SWCCG scrubs that were still around, took what I needed to finish my set, and the rest will now become prize support for a few local tourneys.  On top of that, it was so much gosh darnit fun, Bill Kafer and Greg Shaw stayed around to run a late-night Secret Squirrel too.  I didn&#39;t win that one, Greg Shaw snapped my streak and sent me out 2-1.  I did however beat John Dansbury with a deck where my only characters were Rebel Pilot, Incom Engineer, Shistavanen Wolfman, Tusken Raider, Harc Seff, a Jawa, and Beru Lars.  You try doing 75+ cards worth of drains and damage with that as your army.  Thank God for the EPP Luke, he ended up working triple time for me thanks to First Strike and Kintan Strider.  You can&#39;t teach tech like this, you can only learn it while playing Secret Squirrel....<br>

<br>
Props:<br>
Mike Carr and Kim Caton for running a really smooth tourney.<br>
Neal Razi for providing me with one of the more enjoyable games of Lord of the C0ckRings I&#39;ve ever had.<br>
Bill Kafer for the monster-tech of Darth Vader DLOTs equipped with Imperial Blaster, Stormtrooper Utility Belt, and Solomahal.  You drain, he reacts over and kicks the crap out of you.<br>
John Lolli for giving me somewhere to sleep other than my car.<br>
Greg Shaw for ending my reign of tyranny over Secret Squirrel by kicking my hiney with a LS D*2 deck.<br>
Chris Gogolen for being 3CG.<br>
Chris Praskac for coming out of hiding, I haven&#39;t seen that SoB in a year.<br>
The bagel place for staying open for us.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Lord of the Rings for being the game that involved the second-least skill to play, behind only Yahtzee.<br>
Decipher for thinking playing with mini Light and Dark decks smooshed together into one pile of crap played over a 5 turn game was &quot;a great idea&quot;.<br>
Lansdale for NOT being &quot;Philly&quot;.<br>
Me for thinking &quot;random box of LotR cards meant I&#39;d get a box of boosters but couldn&#39;t pick which set.  In reality, it wasn&#39;t a &quot;random box of cards&quot;, but rather a &quot;box of random cards&quot;, and I was the only one who didn&#39;t know it. So I spent $10 on a box of commons and uncommons.  Oh well, at least the moeny went to charity, and now I have something to cover Warren Holland&#39;s car in come D-Con...<br>
