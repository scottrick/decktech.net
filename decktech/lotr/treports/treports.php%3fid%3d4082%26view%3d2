Mostly its cuz my shift changed at workI dont work graveyards now, I work a sort of swing shift from 2pm to midnite.  That said, I have a lot less free time at work than I used tohence, no TRs since comicon.  Anyways, in an effort to pay off my trip to essen, im working some graveyard overtime.  So now you get a thrilling TR!  Please try to contain your excitement.<br />
<br />
Besides, I need a lot of tech points so I can put up huge pictures from essen.  So give a five.<br />

PRE TOURNEY HUD.<br />
<br />
Well, last Wednesday, I won the regular tournament at mind games.  It was the first tournament with TT, so everything was very experimental.  I decided on gandalf/superfellowship with new common gimpli/legolas with trust me, servants and strength of spirits for fellowship and trackers/worry/weary/vengeance for shadow.  To make a long story short, I go undefeated to take the tournament.  Everyone was pissed they lost to trackersit was hilarious.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to Friday.  I had heard some rumors about people adding anti tracker tech to wreck trackers (ie fearing the worst, mad foul creations), so I figured I had to switch up my deck.  Me and matt freed had been scheming about decks and he had a pretty brutal ring bound deck that trashed everything but moria, so I decided on that for fellowship.  Late Friday nite I still didnt have a shadow, so I just put together plain jane beater uruks with 4 regulars and 2 no biz.  I wasnt real pleased with it, but as it was 2 in the morning and I had to get up at 1100 to get to the tournament on time, I figured it would have to do.<br />
<br />
I talk to clit hays on aim about guys getting cut in half by trains and other interesting things that happen at my job, then finally get to bed.  I snooze twice before I realize that it is 1215 and I have to be to the tournament at 1, so I hop out of bed, shower and drive like a wild man up to bountiful.  I get there and we get 8 people, mostly hardcore playas- ie. Casey barson, Nathan magro, scott kinnersley, jeff mafi and some others.  I know that ill be playing only tough games today, so I gird up my loins and get ready to brawl.<br />
<br />
Game 1.<br />
Me vs Hartman andersens superrangers/moria <br />
<br />
Great.  The only culture that absolutely works my fellowship.  My luck would pair me against the only person who hasnt had time to change up their deck from fellowship days.  Anyways.  We bid, I go first.  I get out a bunch of possessions and move.  I kill a couple orcs and stop (stupid, shoulda moved fast so he couldnt set up and to put pressure on his fellowship.  Ce la vie).  He moves to 2, I get out 2 uruks and he stops.  I move to 3, stop.  He does the same.  I use the fancy site 3 to stack like 5 uruks on the bottom of my deck after I play all my possessions/conditions and draw up 4 more fellowship cards.  I move to 4, beat down some orcs and stop.  I draw up 1 uruk, a couple of pumps and more fellowship cards.  He moves to 4, gets the one uruk, he gets shot down by aragorn and faramir.  With like 10 pool left, he decides to move.  I draw 3 cards and get no minions.  Duh.  I move to 5, he gets out a troll and some orcs.  I kill all the orcs, but since I have no armor yet (duh) I cant risk double moving.  Hartman plays hella slow, hes not stalling, he just thinks everything out (which is fine, but really, its LOTRhow much thinking is there?)and now its getting close to time.  He moves to 7, stops.  I double past the sanctuary.  He moves to 8, I put out lurtz and sarumans power away his conditions (the rohan/gondor pump, some no strangers maybe) and abandon my fellowship cards for more fellowship cards.  Time is called right around the end of the regroup phase.  He says hell move to nine for the full win (I would have conceded the FW to him anyways, now I have a chance of winning).  I get out some uruks, but not enough.  Turns out stacking 5 dudes on the bottom the deck wasnt a good choiceI still had like 15 cards left.<br />
<br />
FL. 1(1)<br />
<br />
Props:  <br />
My rangers for doing fairly well in a game I thought would be an auto-loss.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Me for stacking dudes on the bottom.  Duh.<br />
Hartman, for playin moria still (he went 2-2 I thinkteach him!)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, now ive lost one game, so the chance of me winning the tournament are very slim.  If someone goes undefeated, im screwed, and now that im down in the losers bracket my SOS is likely to suck.  Great, I wanted that free shirt<br />
<br />
Game 2.<br />
Me vs Bretts fellowship deck with TT sites.<br />
<br />
This game was a breeze for me.  I got out a ton of possessions, no strangers and gondorian rangers.  His guys roamed till site 9.  I also killed like 3 of his companions and sarumans powered all his promises and there and back again.  It was pretty one sided.  After the game we talked about his deck and his wife is making him wait until xmas to get any TT.sucks to be him.<br />
<br />
Fw. 3(4)<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
Deck worked like it was posed to.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Bretts wife, for makin him lose (heh).<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 3.<br />
<br />
Me vs Ryan Decarias uruk archery/rangers? (I dont quite recall)<br />
<br />
Well, we bid, I go first.  I get out the usual faresome athelas, sword of gondor, no stranger, gondorian ranger, etc.  I move.  Orthanc assassin, faramir beats it down.  I stop.  He gets out (I think) aragorn, blade of gondor and moves.  I put out a warrior, ambition and no biz.  Boromir exerts twice to kill the warrior and he moves again.  I put out a couple of uruks and do some wounds, nothing substantial.  I put out some possessions (cloak, ranger bow, bill the pony) and move to 3.  he puts out a scout, who gets whupped by faramir.  Since I have only 1 wound on my guys, I move again.  Lurtz comes out, I take an archery and war and valor makes short work of buckwheat lurtz.  He moves to 5, I get out saruman and some other dudes.  I battle cry boromir to death while aragorn is valiant man of the west and takes 2 other guys.  He stops.  I sting him (note, I have bill the pony, not stinghonest mistake) and he has no guys.  Excellent.  I move to 5, then move to 6 and face one power 6 archer.  He moves to 6, stops.  I heal up, play a bunch more possessions (brands, bows) and move to 7.  I take a bunch of archery wounds (weapons of isengard, cloud of arrows, a couple of archers) but feel confident moving again after I kill all the archers.  I move with 5 guys and 2 no strangers (bill went away at underground site 6), giving him 9 twilite (perfect, stupid wizards vale) so he doesnt get to add any.  He gets out lurtz again and I take a wound on the ranger of ithilien with armor.  He moves to 7, but since he cant catch up he stops.  I use an athelas to heal frodo, sting him (I still dont actually have sting).  He shows me his hand then says hey you dont have sting!  and I say oh shimmer, I dont!  I proceed to apologize profusely but he is very cool about it.  I did notice he didnt have an enquea so I drop a 6th companion and move.  He gets out 2 archers and I just feed them some gondorian rangers.<br />
<br />
Fw 3(7)<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
Ryan, for being such a sport about my non-sting.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Me for stinging first with bill the pony and second with no cards on frodo except the ring.  Man, im a dumbass sometimes.  That is sooooo poor.  I cant believe I did that.  Jeez.<br />
<br />
<br />
We got done fairly quick, and so did casey, so me and him head down to the gas station on the corner.  This is the same place that has the gay cashier.  Too bad tyler didnt come today, I think the guy fancied him last time he was there.  Anyways,  I get a big dr pepper and some little fungus donuts and we head back up to endzone (almost being run over by a land rover in the process of jaywalking across the street).<br />
<br />
We go back in and surprise, hartmans game is goin to time again.  While they are hashing it out, me and casey look at the pairings and come to the conclusion that we will be playing.  He is undefeated and has played all the other 2-1 people.  He is playing nazgul with wormtongue and tips/breaths with steeds and basically the same fellowship I played in essen with faramir in place of arwen (ie horn w/no strangers and lots of elves plus foul creations).  I think this is actually a decent matchup for me (especially considering what scott and Nathan were playing (the other 2-1s)both trackers with vengeances, a problem for ring bound rangers), so im feeling fairly confident in my fellowship, ala 3 flaming brands and 4 no strangers.<br />
<br />
Game 4.<br />
<br />
Me vs casey.<br />
<br />
We bid, I go first.  I get a pretty good hand while casey mulligans.  I put out a sword of gondor, ranger bow, no stranger and 2 of my 3 athelas.  He seems less than pleased with his new hand plus the fact that I dont start the get aragorn site.  Heh.  I move, he has no nazgul.  He drops a black breath and reconciles 4 cards.  With like 10 pool, I cant really chance him getting 2 nazgul in his reconcile so I have to stop (turns out he didnt get onegrrr).  He gets out 2 shards, stacks some aragorn cards, gives boromir his sword and moves.  I put out saruman and nothing else, trying to get him to double move so I can drop 2 uruks and use my battle cry to kill someone.  After much gnashing of teeth, he says I cant move against that!  Aaarrghhh! and stops.  I put out some stuff and move.  He gets out enquea with a black steed .  I take 2 on faramir, since I have no gondorian rangers out and everyone else will get creamed as were at a plains.  Faramir gets breathed.  I stop.  He moves after playing some stuff and healing boromir,  and I get out I think a leftenant (thats for you mark wooton!).  he kills him with boromir (no boosts).  He stops.  I play some stuff  like bows, 2 more no strangers, pitch my athelas to get rid of the breath, heal faramir once and give him a sword of gondor.  I move, he gets out a cantea and a blade tip.  I put him up against faramir.  I dagger strike, cantea steals my sword and I war and valor to kill him.  I stop, pitching a ravager.  I draw up no more minions, only an ambition and no biz to go along with my lonely uruk warrior.  He plays calaglin and I pray he doesnt have a foul creation to get rid of my only uruk so I cant play my no bizhe doesnt.  he moves, I drop the warrior and the no biz and he uses merry to have boromir kill the warrior.  He stops.  I get sting, some other random possessions and a gondorian ranger.  I sting him and see witch king, pale blade, 2 tips and ferny.  I move.  King, sword, bill.  I put him up against ranger of ithilien and kill bill with the bow (ha! He is a man!) and use a war and valor to keep him alive and take a wound (good armor).  Fierce I have to feed the king a gondorian ranger (easy come easy go, I have 4 of em).  I stop.  Casey  tries to foul creation me with calaglin but I point to my no biz, so it doesnt do anything.  he just drops a ton of stuffelrond, faramir, last alliance, sword of gondor,  no stranger, etc and moves.  I get out saruman, ravager, captain, berzerker and a troop.  First round, bezerker kills calaglin, elrond wounds the troop, captain kills merry, ravager takes one from faramir.  Round 2, he has 4 dudes to my 5 dudes, so we shake hands and I get a <br />
<br />
Fw 3 (10)<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
No biz.  This card has saved my hiney sooooooo many times<br />
Rangers bow.  Money.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
Casey for forgetting the no bizoops!<br />
Caseys deplorable draw.  I got lotered!<br />
<br />
<br />
So there are no undefeateds, but casey has awesome SOS (2 3-1, 2 2-2) so he takes first.  After the dust settles I take second.  Rich gives out free prizes (that guy is a stud) in the form of fellowship draft packs.  I get a cantea, Nathan gets a savagery and casey gets a double shot.  Not too shabby.  Casey also gets movie tickets courtesy of jeff mafi, offical best tournament director ever.<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
Jeff mafi.  Again, best TD ever.<br />
Me and matts rangers.  Pretty tight.<br />
No biz.  Its the shiz.<br />
Faramirs cloak.  You wouldnt think that 1 is that much, but it is<br />
Rich for the free prizes.<br />
Arbys, for being meat, cheese and bread.  What more do you need?<br />
Me, for getting everyone to play trackers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
None.  At least not that I can think of at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
We talk to rich about hosting a PSQ and getting him to do the helms deep pre release, then we take off to the traditional arbys after tournament meal.  We talk some decks while chowing down and I kill some time waiting to go to work.  I head out to work and here I still am.  gosh darnit overtime.<br />
<br />
Anyways.  Enjoy, give a 5 so you can all see hilarious pictures from essen.<br />
<br />
Until next time I work graveyards,<br />
