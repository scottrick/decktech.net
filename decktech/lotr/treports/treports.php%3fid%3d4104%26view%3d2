First one being a day before which I lost miserably using a ranger/dunland deck which had really nothing much to report about.<br />
<br />
Pre-touny:<br />
Okay, the ranger/dunland deck I was using didn&#39;t work both during playtest & the tourny a day before so I had to come up with something new (or old) to give me a better chance of winning that dang t-shirt. Decided to go with my old Gandalf deck but made some changes to it. Went for the common Faramir & pump-Merry with Escape and Gandalf back-up with Treebeard :) Shadow side - Easterling burdening + Enquea<br />
<br />
Round 1<br />
vs Eric Tee with old school Sauron orcs. Crap, the only thing that could have taken out my Faramir were Hates and I gotta meet Eric in my 1st round.<br />
<br />
I bidded 2 to his 0 and started Faramir + Merry. Got Gandalf & A Wizard Is Never Late so pulled out Treebeard for extra site 2 help, also played Aragorn. Went to site 2 and he got 2 Under the Watching Eyes and 1 Orc Bowmen out. Treebeard bashed his lone Orc and I doubled to 3. He got another Orc Bowmen out. This don&#39;t look good and I made the mistake of assigning 1 of the archery wounds to Faramir. I stopped. He started Lego and Arwen (old school) and played some stuff on Arwen + another companion (can&#39;t remember clearly as I was still worrying about his shadow conditions) and went to 2. I played 2 easterling, he shot the one that adds burden and Arwen with Gwemegil killed the other one as I didn&#39;t have any pumps. I reconciled badly & he doubled to 3 with not much problems. I played some stuff on Aragorn and Gandalf, stung his hand and saw 2 orcs with 3 Hates!!!! Farmair succumbed to a double hate and everyone else got injured badly by his conditions. I stopped at 4 and told myself if sleep don&#39;t come, I&#39;m dead. He went to 4 and again I couldn&#39;t do much with his legolas shooting my easterlings that could add burdens. He stopped. I reconciled 2 sleep caradhras and smiled :) Got rid of his conditions, healed Gandalf by discarding another copy of him and played Narya, Aragorn had only 1 wound on him so I knew even if he drew another Hate so I doubled to 6 keeping the other sleep for later usage. He doubled to 6 and I think I killed one of his companions. I healed my fighters and doubled to 8 coz he only got 1 orc bowmen out at site 7 and I figured I can easily sleep anything else he got out at site 8 and move to 9 instead of stopping at 7, sleep and double to 9. Good choice on my part coz he got out another nder The Watching Eye at 8. He went to 7 and stopped and I knew I could make the easy one to 9 and I did.<br />
<br />
+3/3<br />
<br />
Props: Gandalf-rush still works! But he was playing sauron and with sleep, Gandalf rules.<br />
<br />
Slops: My untouchable Faramir died :( God, I hate Hates.<br />
<br />
Round 2<br />
vs Christopher Chew with new Lego/Gimli/Trust Me deck.<br />
<br />
I bidded 1 to his 1 but won the dice roll and moved first.<br />
I gave him too much twilight at site 2 and he got out 3 uruks! By now I was really missing my Greenleaf but took the wounds like a man. However, my guys were wounded and 2 uruks were still there on the table so I didn&#39;t dare a double move.<br />
<br />
He got his usual &#39;god&#39; hand and played Aragorn + Sword and Boromir + Armor but no Gandalf! He stung my hand and saw only 2 Easterlings and 2 pumps and moved to 2. I played both of them, pumped both of them but still lost and like the player Christopher was he moved again even with some twilight left. However, I reconciled 4 cards and got an Easterling Captain, another Easterling (add burden if assigned to unbound characters) and the event which adds 1 burden during skirmish with ring bound companions (Gathering to the Summons I think). What luck! I knew I had a chance when I played the 2 Easterlings leaving behind 5 twilight. And true enough, Chris didn&#39;t want the extra burden so he assigned the add burden guy to Frodo thinking he could survive easily when Frodo was at strength 6 and since I already played both my pumps, he figured I wasn&#39;t lucky enough to get 2 more pumps. Well, I added his burden to 2 with Summons and used Captain&#39;s ability to pump the guy to 13 *lol* Frodo died!<br />
<br />
+3/6<br />
<br />
Props: Now who says easterling sucks??? Site 3 kill man!<br />
<br />
Slops: None showed up coz the game was over too quickly.<br />
<br />
Round 3<br />
vs Manveen Singh with his Old School Ranger/Horn/No Strangers + Uruk trackers which I lost to miserably on Saturday. Man, Vengeance is too gosh darnit broken!<br />
<br />
I really can&#39;t remember much of the details but this is what I can say. His trackers came out too quickly too many (thanks to regular), his Vengeance picked my guys lke there were all naked hobbits and his search cards did their stuff as well. I didn&#39;t even mention his Fierce trackers *sigh* Here&#39;s what happened, I started but stopped at site 2 coz he got Ugluk + another 2 trackers out. He doubled to 3. I went to 3 and stopped. He went to 4 and stopped. I went to 4 and 2 guys died (I think Faramir & Merry), I stopped. He doubled to 6 (all the time giving me too few twilight to do any damage and horned Elrond/Celeborn to skirmish those fellas who could have added twilight). I went to 5 and Aragorn died. (This was like deja-vu all over again). He went to 7 and I couln&#39;t do a thing and he doubled to 8!!! I went to 6 left with Gandalf & Frodo and was lucky I didn&#39;t get killed. He went to 9 with only 1 burden and I couldn&#39;t stop him at all with 4 easterlings. Game.<br />
<br />
+1/7<br />
<br />
Props: Trackers rock! Maybe I should go back to uruks.<br />
<br />
Slops: Maybe I should go back to lego/arwen and foul creations too *lol*<br />
<br />
Round 4<br />
vs Suresh with his old school moria and at this point Chris, Suresh and myself were at 7 points and Manveen was at 9. So if Chris beats Manveen and I beat Suresh I had a chance at the t-shirt :)<br />
<br />
I bidded 1 to his 2 and he started arwen/lego with Riddermark. He took out Aragorn and doubled to 3 and I piled some burdens on him (yay, finally the easterlings are doing their job) Saw his moria and knew I won&#39;t have much problem with it and I too doubled to 3. He played some stuff and put lots of orcs at the bottom of his deck and drew 4 and played some more stuff. He went to 4 and I got another burden on him :) now at 6 I think and I can&#39;t wait for my Enquea. I reconciled 2 sleeps (hmm, do they always come in pairs even how I shuffled?) and decided not to use the site 3&#39;s text of putting hand below deck and draw 4. I went to 4 and stopped. He doubled to 6 and I didn&#39;t get Enquea or added anymore burdens so he stayed at 6 burdens but I managed to kill Arwen due to some assignment mistakes he made. I stayed close and doubled to 6 coz his orcs were not giving me much resistance but was worried now and then if my Enquea don&#39;t show up soon. He healed and went to 7 but I managed to kill his Eomer and he was left with Aragorn, Lego and Frodo. He stopped. At 6 I sleep him and moved to 7 and stopped baiting him to go to 8 and stop if I can&#39;t kill him at 8. He went to 8 and I still don&#39;t have Enquea but managed to pill his burden to 8 and kill Legolas leaving him Aragorn exhausted & Frodo exhausted. Now comes the interesting part. <br />
<br />
I reconciled and finally got Enquea + 3 more easterlings and was very comfortable of killing his Frodo at site 9 if he doubled. So I asked him &quot;Wanna move again?&quot; He knew he could not stop my fellowship of 5 without a single condition on the table and none of my companions were injured so he answered &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll move again&quot; I knew that was game and was about to take out my site when he casually asked me &quot;Hey, is that the site where you can take out minions by removing burdens?&quot; I said &quot;Of course&quot; He said &quot;Then I dun wanna move again&quot; By that time I could not contain myself anymore and was lmao but like the &#39;nice&#39; player I was, I didn&#39;t insist and went on to win the game with a double to 9.<br />
<br />
+3/10<br />
<br />
Props: I love my Gandalf.... and guess what? Chris beat Manveen so I was tied with Chris for number 1 with equal opponent total and Manveen got less opponent total even when he was at 10 too. I offered Chris my rare foil in exchange for the t-shirt coz he already won one last week and he agreed instead of rolling a dice to see who wins. Yay!!! Got my t-shirt!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Slops: None, as my easterlings did their job this time.<br />
<br />
Post-Tourny:<br />
- Manveen, great job for a 1st time director and thanks for helping me out with the sunday tournaments.<br />
- Chris, thanks for giving up the t-shirt. You rock!<br />
- Back to the drawing boards, either it&#39;s the way I play or the decks I build, my easterlings and dunlanders are not stopping my opponents as well as my uruks did :( Trackers, maybe? :) <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=4104&view=1&PHPSESSID=7663b839460bc7bb13372884f976eece'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?PHPSESSID=7663b839460bc7bb13372884f976eece'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=7663b839460bc7bb13372884f976eece'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
