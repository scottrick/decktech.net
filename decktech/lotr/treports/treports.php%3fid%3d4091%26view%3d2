Due to my initially limited card pool, I tuned up my archery/Uruk deck, dwarf/Moria, & Trust/Nazgul decks.  Then I made a Gandalf/Aragorn deck just using them & Frodo, & all their pumps (the new defender +1 aragorn).  But then talking with T.J. McCarthy I decide to use a ringbound ranger deck.  But THEN talking with Steve & Jeff I decide that people will be countering for them because everyone was playing (or said they would play) the rangers on Wednesday, the first Open tourney.<br />
<br />
So, long story short, I decide on my archery deck at the last minute, starting Greenleaf & good old Arwen.  Tired Traveler is my Frodo (Faramir is the only ringbound companion, but I&#39;d rather remove a burden since I play PATHS rather than save 1 twilight from Sting, which HTTWC will probably remove anyway).  I normally bid low, from 0-3, maybe even up to 4 in some cases.  But I play PATHS, so I don&#39;t bid too high.  The deck is simple, 4 Aragorns (HTTWC), 3 Faramirs (common), a bow for everyone, a No Stranger for everyone (Bill for Frodo), 4 Bowmen, PATHS (all you can do against dunland is hope they don&#39;t get hides 1st turn, & use PATHS, cuz they take no archery), Double shots, Splendor.  No weapons, armor, nothing like that.  Just archery stuff, have to stay at 60 cards.  Oh wait, Sting is in there too, because people seem to like to hold minions against archery decks & wait for you to double move, so you need Sting to see if you really can double.  Site 1 is where ringbound people must exert (hoping to kill some ringbound men with dmg +1 uruks).<br />
<br />
The Uruk side is all about site control.  I found out during the tourney that site control really sucks, for me at least.  I was using too many of the older uruks, I need to use many more of the newer ones that get benefits from the site control.  I don&#39;t know what I was thinking there.  Yes I was using some of them, but like I said I should have put in more, probably at LEAST half of your minions should benefit from site control, IMHO.  Maybe even more.  The dilemma is that the old Uruks are still good; ravagers, captains, lieutenants, etc.  To control sites I used Attack on Helm&#39;s Deep & Down to the Last Child.  Not hard to control sites with those at all.  But with as many skirmishes as I won, it would have been better if I played Worry rather than those cards.  So I don&#39;t know about site control.  After this tourney, I don&#39;t think its worth it.  I mean, I was looking at how many tokens I had on DttLC, & I was thinking, &quot;man, those could all be burdens &/or exertions on Frodo!&quot;  Uruk Camp hurts when you play Uruks there, but its great for site control because you get that 1st battleground early.<br />
<br />
So my comrade Jeff Grein (the TD) picks me up at Pac Bell Park in San Francisco & we head down to Superstars in Cupertino, which is in the south bay.  We talk about his (& Mike Roberts&#39;) good times at Deciphercon, & how it sucks that I missed it.  So we get there, & not too many show up, just 8 of us (not the 20 or so that showed on Wednesday).  But Jeff wants to play, & Paul Green is doing his logic homework while his brothers are playing in the tourney.  He says he&#39;d play, but he doesn&#39;t have a deck.  So I offer him my Trust/Nazgul deck, & Jeff offers him another deck.  Paul looks through & chooses mine, because it has less TT stuff in there, so he will understand it better.  So now Jeff can play, which is cool.  We pay the $5, & start the 1st of 5 games.<br />
<br />
Game 1 v Tim Green&#39;s Easterlings/Elves<br />
We go way back to SWCCG days, & we&#39;ve NEVER played LOTR yet, unbelievable!  He starts Greenleaf & Arwen.  He bids zero, I go first.  He gets mad at his hand & takes a mulligan, I don&#39;t.  He&#39;s still mad.  I play Aragorn & No Stranger, move to 2, he plays a Easterling that is shot by Greenleaf & he&#39;s not happy.  I ask him &quot;Do you expect to kill one of my guys at site 2 or something?&quot;  Man, it&#39;s the start of the game.  I&#39;m not supposed to lose at site 2 or 3!  I move to 3.  Anyways, he also moves to site 3 without hassle.  He plays Gwemegil & bow, a Naith guy & kills my uruks with the new elf pumps, which work quite well.  Props for that man.  Those elves are WARRIORS.  I then play a bow on Arwen & No Stranger on Arwen, move.  He&#39;s not roaming, but he only has 5 twilight, so his guy gets shot down, & I move again only to see 2 more men.  So I double shot then PATHS to kill both men.<br />
<br />
Tim drops another Naith guy & moves, unfortunately I have 2 savageries, so he loses an elf & I get some tokens stacked on my DttLC condition (& Attack on Helm&#39;s Deep too).  He stops, I play Faramir w/bow & Bill the Pony.  Move to 6 & stop when he plays nothing.  No Sting, so I can&#39;t risk a double move, but Tim is mad.  I thought it was because I wasn&#39;t giving him pool, but it was because he wasn&#39;t drawing minions, as I found out later.  He had several small minions in the deck, one of the great things that raiders can do to choke decks.  So he moves into 5, where he works all my uruks.  All his elves have hand weapons, so his guys are huge to my uruks (its his site 5), so I don&#39;t bother with saruman, just uruks.  I take control of 2 sites as well, then take another one during regroup by discarding one of my 2 uruks left.  He stops though.  I move to 7, he plays 2 minions, who die to archery (4 bows out now), & I move again, he gets +4 pool from his site because everyone except Legolas has No Stranger or Bill.  Just missing my Bowmen & Splendor.  Anyways, a minion of his survives but gets PATHS anyway.  He then makes the meaningless move into 6, I take control of site 4, & he stops.  I move into 9, playing 2 bowmen & only giving 10 twilight.  He plays 4 minions, but the archery is more than enough; about 9 archery b/c of Double Shot.  Win (3 points).<br />
<br />
Best: Starting off with a win is always nice.  Playing Tim LOTR for the 1st time.<br />
Worst: He took it pretty hard, he didn&#39;t like his draws the whole game.  The bottom 15 cards of his deck were FULL of minions though, maybe 13 minions.<br />
<br />
Game 2 v Steve Daniel&#39;s Gandalf/Uruks<br />
Of all my games, this is the one where site control came in the most handy for me.  He starts rare Eomer/common Eowyn.  Steve bids and goes first, plays Aragorn ROTN, moves to my Uruk camp, where I play DttLC and an Uruk who wounds Eomer twice.  He stops.  I play Aragorn and move, shooting his Uruk & moving again to site 3 without trouble.  Steve moves to 3 without hassle.  He&#39;s not happy that he hasn&#39;t found Gandalf yet.  I play a No Stranger, Bill, then Aragorn&#39;s bow, move and shoot his uruks at 4.  He likewise moves into 4, where Saruman and an Uruk Veteran appear (stack on sites I control).  I take site 1, play Pillage of Rohan on it (Free player can&#39;t play skirmish events or abilities while Uruk stacked here).  He had Filibert out too, so that will come in handy later on.  So the veteran wounds Eowyn & Eomer twice & he stacks on the site so now Pillage kicks in.  I play Faramir, move to 5 without much incident, I have bowmen and double shots, but I stop because he does get a lot of guys out at the Fords of Bruinen for Uruk-hai.  Steve finally gets Gandalf (not that Servants do anything now), and moves, where I drop some guys (2 more veterans from hand, I have to keep the 1 veteran stacked on Pillage though) & only Gandalf and Frodo survive; when its over I have control of sites 1-3, with a veteran stacked on each site, just to look cool.<br />
<br />
I move to 6, maybe playing a bow on Arwen, and I stop.  Steve plays Greenleaf & Boromir with Armor, thats pretty wrong right there.  He moves into site 6, I play a veteran and saruman, & I take control of site 4 and 5, stack the 4th veteran.  Gandalf could beat the veteran, but if I had a savagery he&#39;d be dead, & the veteran is gonna stack no matter what with saruman protecting him.  Anyways, he&#39;s gonna heal so he just let&#39;s Boromir take 2.  I move to 7 and stop, I make a mistake and put a Troop on Arwen (gasp, he made it through archery!  lol), but I forgot about his Ambitions so Arwen dies.  However, I can feel the Uruks closing in on Steve.  He moves with 4 guys, I take site 6, then play a captain, who gets a horde for free for 6 sites controlled, then I play 3 veterans from my sites, each at 1, leaving one on Pillage of course.  So that&#39;s 5 guys to his 4, Greenleaf shoots one down, but Frodo is using the old ring and is unarmed, so he&#39;s dead.  Of course, even if he was using the new ring he&#39;d be overwhelmed thanks to Pillage.  Win (6 points).<br />
<br />
Best:  Site control came together in this one.<br />
Worst: Steve got LOTR&#39;d, he&#39;s got 4 Gandalfs and a WiNL, would have been big to get him and his servants early, that way he could&#39;ve prevented some of my early site control.  The main way I take sites is by winning battles and getting tokens on DttLC.<br />
<br />
Game 3 v Franklin Kenter&#39;s Uruks/Gandalf<br />
Wow, just a couple weeks ago he was just Franklin to me, but now he&#39;s the Trek World Champion!  Should I be impressed?  Heck yeah!  I ask him if we&#39;re friends, he says yeah, then I ask if he gets to take a friend to Paramount studios with him.  He says yeah, then just dead silence.  Haha.  Anyways, he starts Gimli, Unbidden guest & Greenleaf.  He bids 4 & goes first, takes a mulligan, I don&#39;t.  He plays Sting & Aragorn ROTN with bow.  He moves to my Uruk Camp, I just play Down to the Last Child (DttLC) & Attack On Helm&#39;s Deep, then he moves again to my Golden Hall & loses Sting & the Bow.  I play an Uruk & get some tokens on my conditions.  I just play Aragorn & No Strangers & move to 3.  He then plays Gandalf & the dwarf tale that lets you stack 6 cards on it from your draw deck.  Well, Glamdring is one of the cards, so he discards the top card of his deck to take it into hand, but he discards his 2nd Aragorn&#39;s bow to do so; obviously he&#39;s not happy about that.  So he moves, & I play 2 good uruks with 2 savageries in hand, so he takes lots of wounds & Gimli dies, I get 4 more tokens on DttLC.  I play Faramir w/No Stranger, Aragorn&#39;s bow, Sting, & move.  He drops an Uruk (or 2), but they die to archery.  I stop, he plays new Sword on Aragorn, moves to my Courtyard.  I take control of 2 more sites (3 total), play Saruman & some Uruks, but only kill Legolas because Aragorn & Gandalf are strong.<br />
<br />
I move to 5, he plays Saruman & Uruks, but I bust out all kinds of archery, so Saruman gets exhausted & all but 1 uruk dies, so Frodo just PATHS it away.  I move again, giving him only 5 pool for site 6, but he plays an uruk & Power, killing my No Strangers.  Then he dies to archery (saruman is exhausted).  He moves to 6 with no trouble, I take control of sites 4 & 5.  I play Bill & 2 Bowmen, move to his archery site for companions over 3, but Frodo & Faramir don&#39;t count so I take no archery.  He plays Saruman & 2 Uruks (all I have is Bill, no more No Stangers).  But everyone except Frodo has a bow, & I pitch a Bowmen & play a Double Shot to make 7 archery.  He lets the 2 Uruks die, so I have to stop with his fresh Saruman out there still.  He moves to 7 with just his 3 companions, but he has Servants to save Frodo, & I take control of site 6 during regroup.  I play 2 more bowmen, move to 8, facing some uruks & Saruman AGAIN, using bowmen to kill his uruks, he leaves Saruman fully healed.  I stop, he moves to 8 & all I have is an Uruk captain & Saruman.  I use the Captain to play a Horde for free since I control 7 sites now.  Gandalf dies, he stops.  I move into 9, he plays Saruman at 2 & some Uruks, but with my Bowmen, Double Shot, PATHS, Splendor, & directed archery all combined, he isn&#39;t even close to getting to Frodo.  Let&#39;s see, its about 12 archery all combined (counting PATHS as archery), with only 12 twilight to use.  Win (9 points).<br />
<br />
Best: Playing Franklin, I haven&#39;t played him since before Mines of Moria came out.<br />
Worst: None, he really liked my deck to tell you the truth.<br />
<br />
Game 4 v Alfred Dong&#39;s Nazgul/Rohan<br />
Starts rare Eomer & rare Eowyn.  Bids 4 to make me go first.  I play Faramir, Elven bow & Splendor on Arwen, move to his Wold of Rohan.  Down comes King, Blade, 2 Tips, & Breath.  Arwen exerts twice to make 4 archery, King dies.  Move again to 3, face a Nazgul, but 2 archery & PATHS take it down.  He plays White wizard, Glamdring, & another weapon, moves.  I play Saruman & a fairly big uruk, maybe the Advance Uruk Patrol (power 10).  So he stops at 2.  I still don&#39;t have Aragorn, just play No Stranger on Faramir, then I just move & exert Frodo & Faramir to his &quot;exert theoden&quot; site, then exert Arwen to kill the Nazgul he plays with 3 archery.  He moves to site 3 & stops to heal.  I discard Faramir to heal him, then move to site 5, which is the +1 archery for me, but adds 8 pool.  So he plays 2 Nazgul & Breath thanks to Gates, & I completely forget about the +1 archery from the site.  So I&#39;m trying to see if I can kill both Nazis, but I can&#39;t.  Instead, I just let him take 2 archery & Arwen fights Attea, gets Tip/Breath, Faramir takes Cantea, takes Tip, but he&#39;s immune to Breath.  Arwen then dies to Attea, Legolas takes Cantea & Breath.<br />
<br />
Then Alfred plays Theoden & some of his gear, Simbelwyne for Firefoot, & moves.  I drop a couple Uruks, Down to the Last Child to start controlling some sites & I have some savageries, so I get some tokens stacked; but more importantly he stops at 4.  I finally play Aragorn & Gondor Bowmen, so I move to 6 & use the Bowmen to kill his 1 Nazgul.  He moves to 5 & I play Saruman & some Uruks, then take control of 2 sites with my condition, but I only have 1 Savagery & he&#39;s got Servants & Honorable Charges so most of my Uruks die except 2 of them, one of which I discard to take control of another site because I had Attack on Helm&#39;s Deep out.  But apparently he was out of pumps because he stopped at 5, with Saruman & an Uruk still out.  So I heal, play Gondor Bowmen, heal tipped Faramir with a copy, play Faramir&#39;s Bow & Bill Pony, move, & it&#39;s the site where Aragorn & Legolas must exert.  So Legolas is exhausted now with Breath.  He&#39;s got 8 pool, plays a nazgul, which I kill with double shot.  I stop, he moves to 6 & stops, I can&#39;t do much except take another 2 sites with my conditions.  Then I play Aragorn&#39;s bow & move to 8, he gets to add another 4 pool because I choked too much, but I just use a Gondor bowmen so he takes 5 archery, then I PATHS to kill the 2nd Nazgul.  I stop, he moves to 7, I just try to dump all my shadow, & he stops.  I play 2 more Gondor Bowmen & No Strangers, so he gets 12 pool at site 9 & like 7 archery, so that kills anything he plays.  Win (12 points).<br />
<br />
Best: Splendor + Bow at site 1 saved me from certain death.  He didn&#39;t even need the Blade, the King overwhelms Faramir and Legolas anyway.<br />
Worst: Forgetting the site 5 text.  I don&#39;t mind the extra pool, if I can remember to add the freakin&#39; archery.<br />
<br />
Game 5 v Jeff Grein&#39;s Uruk Trackers/Gondor<br />
Well, we both know each other&#39;s decks, so let&#39;s just get it over with.  Starts rare Eomer, common Eowyn.  Bids 2 to go first.  Starts Riddermark & gets Aragorn HTTWC, moves, I play a pwr 9 Uruk (exerts at my Camp), he has a pump to kill it, moves again to my 3, he has no weapons to lose, darn.  Here I have Elven bow & Splendor in hand, so I have to hold them so I don&#39;t lose them at my own site.  I just fetch Aragorn, play Bill, No Stranger on Aragorn, & move, he plays Weary on Aragorn, reconciles.  So I move again, he drops Mauhur & a Plains Runner.  I shoot Mauhur once with Legolas (remember he exerted to get Aragorn), Arwen fights Mauhur, Runner fights Frodo.  I pass on Frodo, he plays Vengence to overwhelm Frodo, so I PATHS the Runner.  Mauhur wounds Arwen, then wounds Aragorn (exerts to Weary).  It&#39;s good I did that b/c he had 2 Vengences, so he could have overwhelmed Aragorn on the fierce if he didn&#39;t burn a Vengence on Frodo.  Jeff plays Boromir & Blade (he had stacked it & other stuff like athelas on Shards), moves to 4, I play Attack on Helm&#39;s Deep & some Uruks, but he kills all of them.  He considers the move into 5, but stops.  I play Faramir w/No Stranger, then Bow & Splendor go on Arwen, & Gondor Bowmen.  Move to 4, he plays 2 trackers who die to archery thanks to Double shot, so I move again to his site 5, he plays Ugluk with broadbladed sword, so I can&#39;t shoot him down.  But then he exerts Ugluk to play Worry, so I just PATHS Ugluk.  Its funny, he even says out loud &quot;I bet you have PATHS in handoh well, I&#39;ll play Worry anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
He moves to 5 & faces Saruman & some Uruks; I kill Eomer & Eowyn, but only 1 Uruk survives to regroup, & I discard it to take control of site 1 with my condition.  He considers the move to 6 for a while, but he stays put with Saruman out & his guys have some wounds, so it&#39;d be risky.  I move to 6 no problem, giving only 5 twilight.  He moves to 6 with no problem either, I play Pillage of Rohan on site 1, but I need to stack someone there to make it work, then my Uruks will be rockin&#39;.  I move to 7, everyone but Faramir & Frodo exert, but it really doesn&#39;t matter much cuz he only has 8 twilight, he uses 7 of it to play guys who die to archery, so I move again, knowing that now he won&#39;t get the +4 pool from Wizards Vale since there is 9 twilight in there now (if I stopped & moved, he&#39;d get 8+4 twilight).  He busts out another guy with broadbladed sword (he plays FOUR!  But he&#39;s got a huge deck so he has only seen 2 of them.).  So Aragorn takes him first then Faramir takes 2 on the fierce.  Then he does the meaningless move to 7, exerts his guys as well since his Rohan guys are dead, I take control of site 2 finally, & then I move into site 9, giving him like 10 pool & 6-7 archery, shooting anything down.  Win (15 points).<br />
<br />
Best: 1st place is always nice, & 5-0 to boot!  It has been a while since that happened to me.<br />
Worst: I hate beating the person who gives me rides.<br />
<br />
Steve ends up playing Alfred (both 3-1), & Steve beats him, to finish 4-1 & 2nd place.  Steve gets 4 packs, I get 6, pulling nothing at all, but luckily Jeff needed most of it for his playset so that worked out well for him (& me).  Unfortunately Paul goes 0-5 with my Trust/Nazgul deck, but he pulls rare FOIL Grima in his 1 pack!  Good for him.  Thanks for reading.<br />
<br />
Props to:<br />
Jeff for so much: the rides, running the tourney, trades, putting up with me in general.<br />
Steve for the trades, & for getting LOTR&#39;d, heheh.  If you&#39;re gonna get LOTR&#39;d it should be against me.<br />
Dave for the trades, & playing Moria/Elves.  Awesome deck.<br />
TheouhhI mean T.J., for helping me with deck ideas & strategies.<br />
Paul for putting off his logic homework & playing LOTR with us.<br />
Alfred & the Green brothers just because its them.<br />
Everyone who read this, & liked it.<br />
Mike for knowing all the easter eggs in the new FotR DVD.<br />
Decipher for having their &quot;fierce&quot; tournament month.<br />
<br />
Slops to:<br />
TheouhhI mean T.J. (why do I keep doing that?), going 2-2 at the Wars tourney in Davis.<br />
Tim for getting a little TOO hyper in our game.  Kick back man, you have a good deck.<br />
Me for giving Paul a deck that went 0-5.  Although I played it afterwards in a pick-up game & beat a dunland/gondor deck, so I think Paul just wasn&#39;t used to my deck style.<br />
