<br>
On Tuesday before Comicon, I got an IM from my good buddy David Chafin. Hed just gotten back from a month long trip to Alaska. I started bugging him to come with Ted Tschopp and I to Comicon, but he really didnt want to because he hadnt played in any Realms tournaments since he was in Alaska when the set came out. I invited him and Ted over on Wednesday to get some play-testing in, and together Ted and I convinced David to go. And a lucky thing we didread on!<br>
<br>
I took the day off work on Friday so we could leave Thursday evening. Ted and Dave came to my place and we headed down to SD. I blasted the radio most of the way, listening to a certain CD I burned (but of course messed up). My CD burner just doesnt like me I guess. Anyways, we ended up getting to SD around 10:30. The hotel was fine, pretty close to the Convention Center. We played some more and I was routinely beating David down. Scott Orlando called us up around 11 something and he crashed at our hotel as well. I think he and David and Ted played some, but I dont know who won.<br>
<br>
Day 1<br>
<br>
I was feeling really confident with my Horn deck because Id beaten both Ted and David with it repeatedly. I think they both won only one against me. LOL. Go me. Anyways, we get up at the crack of dawn on Friday and head over to Comicon to get in line. We ended up running into Randy Simon, who joined us in line. It was extremely crowded--Ted was right about the line. I think we were only 20 or so from the front. That line ended up going all the way into the parking lot. We traded some and talked about some of the things we expected to see in the tournament. Once we got in, we paid our $50 for the weekend pass and then headed down to Deciphers booth to pay for the tournament. Down there we ran into Michael Mendoza and Garrhet Noda, who were already busy doing demos. When we got there, Ted decided he wasnt going to play. What a nerd!<br>
<br>
After a little chatting, David, and I headed upstairs. We were super early (really, they were running late), so I pulled out my Moria deck to play a quick game with Chafin. I smacked him down *really* bad. It was just pathetic! David looked quite worried. Hed already turned in his deck list, so there was no way he could change his deck. Even if hed tried to, they started announcing the pairings. Im sorry for the lack of detail, but I waited too long to write this.<br>
<br>
Round 1 vs. Jimmy Lafferty (1630)<br>
<br>
Okay, well I dont know if he goes by Jimmy, but Im a chick so Im gonna just call him that because I think Jimmy is a cute name. Plus from what I hear hes a big, bad, Wars player, so I figure some of you might find it funny. Anyways, this game was full of mistakes. I ended up making one too many, and Jimmy took advantage. Moronic me didnt notice the old man was out, and I tried to use Blade of Gondor on a Lieutenant (strength 10 with the other guys out)so Jimmy takes one on the Lieutenant and one on Saruman. Doh. Boromir eats it, dragging his Horn down with him. That sucked I deserved to lose after that. The worst part about this game was that Jimmy kept reminding me that he had only played LOTR for 3 weeks. If either of us played like wed only just learned the game Jim, it was me. ;) To make matters worse, after the game a girl who will remain nameless came up to me and told me she new why I lostbecause Jimmy is so hot, I couldnt concentrate on the game. Rightthats it :) Whatever!<br>
<br>
FL +1/1<br>
<br>
Round 2 vs. Greg Fuller (1726)<br>
<br>
Okay, so Ive only played Greg once before, and it was just for fun. I beat him with my silly hobbit deck against his silly discard deck. It was pretty fun. He discarded all three copies of Aragorn that I had in that deck. Fun stuff! But anyway, this game he had all day. I didnt draw up Sarumans Power until it was way too late, and his buff Gandalf signet men kicked the crap out of my weak-ass Uruks. He won at site 9. It was cool I could cheer him up after his first game (he had a horrible draw apparently), but I put myself in a pretty crappy mood by losing two straight. No good.<br>
<br>
FL +1/2<br>
<br>
Round 3 vs. Paul Green (1611)<br>
<br>
Id never played Paul before, so I didnt know what to expect. Turns out he had some bizarre Sauron deck. I was completely petrified he was going to play Enduring Evil or Hate, so I had to keep healing Boromir and give him lots of pool since I didnt draw up Sting, but it turned out okay. I beat him to Site 9 and that was that. It was a rough game, but I finally got on the board.<br>
<br>
FW +3/5<br>
<br>
Round 4 vs. ??? (Not rated)<br>
<br>
Okay, I forgot his name. I feel so guilty when I do thatbygones. It was his first tournament, so I didnt know really what to expect. I helped him out most of the game, taught him as much as I could, but then I had to beat him down at site 6. Unloaded my Uruks and he couldnt keep little Frodo out of the way. Thanks to some pumps he was done. <br>
<br>
FW +3/8<br>
<br>
After that game I was so tired, I dropped. I know, I knowyou mess other peoples strength of schedule when you drop. But I couldnt stay awake. I felt bad doing it, but I just didnt have the energy to keep playing. And I had good company when I droppedScott Orlando and Cat Ceder both dropped at 2-2 as well. So please, if you must lecture me, make sure to lecture both of them as well. I headed down to the Decipher booth and learned how to do demos. That was kinda cool. The rest of the day is a blur. We all went to the Old Spaghetti Factory for dinnerPatch, Matt Berta, Ted Tschopp, David Chafin, Tom Mascari, David Trudeau, Mark Evans, and quiet Derrick (I cant remember your last nameIm pretty sure it starts with R though). It was good food, and even better alcohol. I threw back a couple G &Ts, and I was feeling quite content. We went by Ralphs for some beers, then everyone came over to our hotel. Poor David was trying to figure out what to play in the morning, while we were drinking and chatting. I think he finally gave up and started playing Austin Powersbut hey, he still beat down Day 2. Mad props for that David! Anyways, all I remember is that I had two very strong Red Bull and vodkas (its *the* drink) and that I got a really nice massage from Tom. Tom, youre the man! :)<br>
<br>
Day 2<br>
<br>
Saturday morning I woke up early so I could get the shower first. Once I got out, Chafin was up making some last minute mods to his deck. I challenged him to a game, and he accepted, no doubt eager to beat me down after the last few games Id played against him. We played, and I smacked him down easily. Tee hee. But it was too late for him to switch anything else in his deck, because hed already finished the deck list and was too zonked to redo it. Oh well. Ted, David, and I then headed over to the Con and we dropped Dave off since he had to be there at 10 for Day 2. Lucky bastard <br>
<br>
I decided I wasnt going to play in the constructed tournament and just cruised around the Con a bit. Ran into several Playboy models (whats up with that, there were dozens of them, and they all seemed to go out of their way to get in my way. LOL.). Once I got bored, I went upstairs to see how things were going, and saw Melissa was outside, just hanging out. Turns out she isnt allowed to be in the tournament hall while Casey was playing. I chatted with her a bit, and we started playing a game. Midway though, Michael Mendoza comes out and sees us and proceeds to recruit us to join Team L.A. for the team tournament he was running since they were two players short. I figured it might be fun, so what the heyForgive me--details are hazy, too much alcohol and too little sleep. <br>
<br>
Round 1 vs. Erik Cabanero (1887)<br>
<br>
Erik recently posted this deck on DeckTech, and I highly recommend you check it out: http://www.decktech.net/lotr/decks/decks.php?deck=25024<br>
(Give him a 5he deserves it, believe me!)<br>
Poor Lisa. Erik got out five Moria geeks with weapons on site four to my four companionslets just put it this way: Frodo was done. I didnt have anything that could have saved me. Especially with those 3 armories he had out. This was the quickest game Ive ever lost, so Erik, you get major props. Thanks for rejuvenating my faith in Moria. I thought it wasnt so good anymore, but you proved it still is. You definitely schooled me.<br>
<br>
Highs: Getting schooled by a good player.<br>
Lows: Getting schooled.<br>
<br>
FL +1/1<br>
<br>
So I lost my first game in under 10 minutes. Woo hoo. I gave Mike the scorecards and asked him what hed gotten me into. He just shrugged (and I think he laughed at me tootypical)<br>
<br>
Round 2 vs. Wayne Waitman (1619)<br>
<br>
Good ol Wayne. He beat me down *really* bad in the So Cal Territorials, when I got an incredibly crappy draw. It was a little funny how excited he was to play me. Anyhow, I got my revenge this time. He drew up like 3 Nazis the whole game, so I just jogged along 2 sites every turn. Haha. It was even cooler that Aragorn was strength 16 against Nazgul and Boromir was a 15. I double-exerted Merry so that Aragorn could beat down the Witch-King. Fun stuff! Bad draws happen to the best of us Wayne. But Im glad I could repay the favor. ;) Im not the pushover I was the last time we played, thanks to learning from the best (Patchell and Michael, you guys get huge props. Thanks for helping me get better at this game. I dont tell you enough how grateful I am.).<br>
<br>
Highs: Schooling someone whod beaten me down before.<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
FW +3/4<br>
<br>
Round 3 vs. Mason Gilligan (1745)<br>
<br>
Well whats this about, me playing all these guys who beat me down horribly in previous tournaments? Ill never forget Mason, because at the No Cal Territorials he killed poor Gandalf at Ettenmoors with his Troop and pumps. Luckily that was not the case this game. I was able to skip past him and stay ahead most of the game. He managed to kill Aragorn, but Horny Boromir, Calagin, Orophin, and Frodo managed to squeak past him at site 9. Yay! Little Frodo even took on the big, bad Beserker by himself and won the game! I was ecstatic. Mason wasnt. I think he was kinda mad. Oh wellI admit that if he had one more pump, I would have lost, but he didnt. So there we have it. Another win for lucky Lisa.<br>
<br>
Highs: Schooling someone whod beaten me down before; Little Frodo laughing at the Beserker.<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
FW +3/7<br>
<br>
Our team wasnt doing so hot, but I was doing pretty darn good. Melissa and I chatted briefly and then Mike announced the pairings It definitely got interesting.<br>
<br>
Round 4 vs. Casey Barson (1993)<br>
<br>
Turns out that Casey and some other ringers who were eliminated in the first round from Day 2 joined the team tournament late<br>
<br>
Okay Casey, I asked Melissa for her permission to beat you. She laughed, so I took that as a yes. I went first with Green Dragon and stayed ahead the whole game. Maybe it was a miracle, or maybe it was just because Melissa was in the same room as us. Somebody was on my side though because I beat one of Utahsheck, the Worldsbest...yeah, Casey is currently ranked #14 in the world. Not bad if I do say so myself. ;) When I gave Mike the scorecard, I think he thought I filled it out wrong. LOL.<br>
<br>
Highs: Beating such a great player.<br>
Lows: None.<br>
<br>
FW +3/10<br>
<br>
Round 5 vs. Charlie Herren (1904)<br>
<br>
I dont even recall what Charlie was playing (Nazgul perhaps???), but the whole game he was telling me how much he sucked. This is of course while hes beating me down<br>
<br>
Highs: NoneI cant remember this game for the life of me. Its all a blur.<br>
Lows: Charlie pretending he was a scrub.<br>
<br>
FL +1/11<br>
<br>
So there we have it. I helped Team L.A. finishdead last! Woo hoo! We had a great time though. Prize support was pretty cool too. I was ecstatic to pull an Aragorn HttWC since Chafin is still borrowing two of mine. I think thats pretty much all I got thoughbut no worries. I had fun. Thank you Mike for convincing me to play!<br>
<br>
After the tournament ended, Ted, David, Tom, Wendy, and I went out to grab some dinner. We pitched in to treat David, who ended up taking second in the whole thing. ManI really do need to collect that commission, dont I Mr. Chafin? You at least need to write a tournament report or something so you can give me mad props for convincing you to come. ;)<br>
<br>
After dinner, David, Ted, and I went to meet up with Patchell and crew. We headed on over to Toms place to chill. I helped Gabe out with his foil set and scored a rare Saruman foil, then traded Mike some cards and got a foil Troll. I was going to go chill on the porch with Tom, but Mike started bragging about what a great chess player he washe beat down six of the guys at Toms (including Dunya who is surprisingly good at chess). I couldnt let his ego get over-inflated by letting him beat Chafin again, so I made Chafin get up and let me play. It was a well-fought game, but lets just say that Michael can no longer claim to being undefeated. :) <br>
<br>
Overall Props:<br>
-David Chafin for going almost all the way. You showed that So Cal deserves a lot more respect than we get!<br>
-Ted Tschopp and David Chafin for being good traveling companions.<br>
-Garrhet Noda for living in Culver Citynow I have someone who lives nearby that I can play-test with!<br>
-Red Bull and Vodka.<br>
-Tom Mascari for the wonderful massageyou rule Tom!<br>
-Melissa for jinxing Casey when I played him. ;)<br>
-Patchell, Trudeau, Chafin, Tschopp, Evans, Mascari, Berta, Derrick, et. al. for being fun to hang with on Friday night.<br>
-Gabe Alonso and Michael Mendoza for the sweet trades.<br>
<br>
Overall Slops:<br>
-Me for dropping when I was 2-2 on Day 1. I should have hung in there.<br>
-Me for drinking a tad too much and acting perhaps a bit too flirtatious (wait, is that possible???).<br>
-Gabe and Mike for not coming with us Friday because they had to perfect Gabes deck for Saturday. Dude Gabe, take a lesson from Chafinpartying makes you play better. Who needs sleep! ;)<br>
-Jimmy Lafferty and Charlie Herren for both trying to convince me they really suck at LOTR. You guys are both full of crap! :)<br>
-Ted Tschopp for not playing in any of the tournaments. You nerd! :)<br>
<br>
Well thats that! I didnt play on Sunday, so Im just gonna end here. Its a bit long-winded as it is, so I hope you were able to make it through. It was a great weekend, and I got to meet some really cool people and as well as see some others I hadnt seen in a while. Cant wait until next year!<br>
<br>
Peace,<br>
