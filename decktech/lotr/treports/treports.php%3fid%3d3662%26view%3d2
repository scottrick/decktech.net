Trip there<br>
At the airport while waiting for the plane to load, there was a very attractive young woman who was getting onto the flight to Las Vegas, but her only problem is that she was dressed as if she were from the 70s.  She wore a strange looking hat and had on some sort of bell bottom pants.  She was both nice and strange to look upon.  Consulting with Eric and Cortney we mocked her clothing and nicknamed her Disco Girl.  After getting on the plane, what did we find, but disco girl sitting across from the aisle.  Heres the interesting part.  She had her shirt buttoned down quite a bit and I was able to see quite a bit of side swell action.  I tried to keep from not looking but my more I looked, the more convinced I was that she wasnt wearing a bra.  I didnt know for sure until she had to rearrange her shirt and I saw enough to convince me that she was in fact not wearing a bra.  Lets just say it was a lot harder to not look across the aisle.  Alas, the flight was short and we had to bid farewell to Disco Girl.<br>
<br>
We took the aiport shuttle to our hotel and stumbled upon the Annoying Bus Driver.  This guy felt it was his duty to chastise us if we didnt call his company to get a shuttle bus back to the airport from the hotel, he also had to chastise other peoples driving and make jokes about various billboards and pedestrians.  He was annoying and he was a bus driver.  Unlike Disco Girl I wanted this guy to go away as quick as possible, unfortunately we were the second to last hotel on his trip and had to put up with him for too long.<br>

	Pre-Tournament Thoughts:<br>
	<br>
From talking with Cortney I was concerned about playing a lot of Galadriel mirror decks.  The one card that will take care of the mirror is the uruk-hai card No Business of  Ours, and I already had an uruk-hai deck that I was trying to tune that was using snows to skip the skirmish phase and then other minions to take care of weapons.  I figured that I could throw in No Business into my uruk-hai deck and be ok.  On my fellowship side, I had started with Gandalf and was running the large fellowship, with last alliance, brands, and servants.  I decided to change this deck up by getting rid of my elves, start with boromir and merry and stick in a few cards that would go and get gandalf.  Because of the preponderance of the deck with lots of elves and elf conditions, I wanted to screw people over for taking goblin scrabblers and goblin scouts and I figured I could handle anything else with buff boromir, buff aragorn, and buff gandalf.<br>
	<br>
Arrived late, missed first round<br>
	Round 2 - Played a mirror/sauron deck.  Got crushed. Joe from Washington<br>
	Round 3  Played some guy,  I cant remember<br>
Round 4  Played Dave from Las Vegas.  Aragorn/Moria deck.  Got schooled at site 5<br>
<br>
Thoughts before The Big Day:<br>
<br>
Well I only saw one mirror deck, maybe two I cant remember what I played in my third round, but the majority of people were not playing with the mirror.  So my whole uruk-hai theme was shot to hell.  My fellowship was also getting crushed, so my whole fellowship idea was shot to hell as well. I ended up going 0-3, things were seriously wrong.  After looking at my record and how everyone else was running their decks, it was obvious I needed to make some changes.  The biggest thing was the fact that people liked to bid high burdens, go first and get Sam with the Green Dragon Inn.  My own personal experience has shown that this is a good method of beginning the game, unless someone outbids you in burdens, then youre screwed.  I wanted to screw people, and the only fellowship deck that you can count on outbidding someone who bids 6 are the hobbits.  You can bid high with confidence because you start with Sam, and then going first allows you to play Bag End which you can then go ahead and use to get the Gaffer which is used to heal Sam, who can then go and remove another burden.  I had played the hobbits before this tournament and while I didnt have a hobbit deck, I knew what it took to put together one that works.  So, staying in a hotel in Las Vegas on a Friday night, what did I decide to do.  I didnt go out and have a good time, I didnt go out and gamble.  I stayed in my hotel room and put together a hobbit deck.  When youre putting together a hobbit deck there are a few things to remember.  First, they have low strength but lots of wounds, so you have to put cards that bump up the strength so that they dont get overwhelmed, and then take their one wound.  Hobbits also have the ability to heal themselves up more than any other fellowship.  Using the Gaffer, Farmer Maggot and a few hobbit party guests its like the hobbits have a sanctuary at every site.  Complimenting the hobbits for the shadow side are the nazghul.  When you play hobbits you should be able to go first and you can survive going site to site, but you can get into trouble when you try to move more than one site a turn.  The nazghul come out at the early sites and convince your opponent that they dont want to move more than one site at a time.  So your hobbits can go first, move one site at a time, and your opponent is right behind you moving one site at a time, and if they want to win the game they are going to have to move two sites at a time at least once a game.  The nazghul are also the minion type that will take full advantage of having a lot of burdens.  So when you are bidding 7, going first and having the other person have 5 burdens on Frodo while you are playing nazghul seemed like the best plan for screwing people over.<br>

DPC Las Vegas May 11th The Big Day<br>
<br>
	Round 1  Aaron from Oregon Moria<br>
		Game highlights:<br>
Aaron played his tower assassin at site 2, killed my gaffer and a hobbit party guest.  I was crushing his fellowship with my nazghul.  While playing Aaron it was obvious he was a less experience player than I was, I would move two sites a turn and he would pay full cost for Goblin flankers(they are normally 5 tokens, but put 3 back if the fellowship has moved more than one site).  He had a strange moria orcs that you dont see in decks from people who play moria decks.  Aaron was also taking his time with his turns.  I would ask if he was finished with a particular phase at the site, he would look at his cards, then his hand a couple of times and then say he was finished.  This is important because I had just moved to site 8(while he was at site 7) and 5 minutes were called.  He had a cave troll, and an orc left from site 8, I had sam and frodo left.  I looked at the tie breakers for a timed win.  We both had the same amount of burdens (4, curse the tower assassin at site 2), I had more companions in the dead pile, but at the beginning of his turn boromir would die due to a blade tipe so that would even it out.  The next tie breaker would the number of wounds and I would probably be out of luck.  Frodo and Sam both had 3 wounds, he only had Aragorn and Frodo left and they both had one wound.  I knew that Aaron wasnt too experienced with playing the game and he probably would discount Sam, Frodo would die and pass the ring to Sam and I would win the game.  So I moved on to site 9.  He got a ton of guys out, as expected.  What wasnt expected was that he played an enquea.  I put one guy on Sam, hoping he would put everyone else on Frodo.  He did exactly that, I had Frodo lose, toss the ring to Sam, he had one more wound to give (because of the ring), and took the wound.  Then the fierce Cave Troll and Enquea came back.  If it werent for Enquea I was fine, Sam was strength 6 and I had a bounder.  He puts on the one ring, takes four burdens and I win the game.  But with Enquea, Sam was overwhelmed.  This game was the hardest for me to lose because I came close and I felt I was the better player than Aaron and had the better deck, he just got a little lucky with his tower assassin at site 2 and had another fierce minion at site 9 to crush Sam, when he should have crushed Sam and Frodo at once.  Oh well, heartbreaking but now officially in the history books.  I shouldnt have moved on, I should have stayed at site 8, put out a nazghul to convince him to stop moving (and finish his turn quickly)  and then move onto site 9 for the win.<br>
Round 2  Dave from Las Vegas (I played him the previous day) Aragorn/Uruk-hai<br>
	Game Highlights:<br>
I played Dave the previous day and hes a really decent guy.  This game was quick.  He couldnt get out Aragorn and I crushed his fellowship at site 5 with the Witch King.  Because it was over so quickly we were able to play two other games before the round ended.  Dave won both of those games, so in reality he probably should have won the tournament game, but he was unlucky and I took advantage of it.  I felt lucky to be 1-1 so far at the tournament.<br>
	Round 3  Brad from somewhere  Uruk-hai/not easily defined fellowship<br>
		Game Highlights:<br>
Brad was playing a strange fellowship.  He had a fair amount of guys with ARVs.  He was also playing with Release the Angry Flood.  Which seems like a smart choice for him when playing my nazghul, but I was one of the few nazghul at this tournament, the majority of the decks that did well were moria or uruk-hai.  So I have two nazghul at site 3, he plays ARV and kills the two nazghul (because Im playing the Ford of Bruinen of course).  I get to site 8 before he does.  I have two Thrors Map in my deck and I havent gotten it yet in this game.  Sam dies at site 8 and Frodo is left with 4 wounds.  Im getting killed in this game.  He moves to site 8 with his 5 companions.  Im able to place one nazghul out, I have one more in my hand.  I figure the jig is up, the game is over.  The one nazghul I have out sticks around.  I figure that he looks at the situation, he sees me with Frodo, and then fact that there is one nazghul out and I can get one or two more out if he moves (in all reality I could only get out one more nazghul, not nearly enough for me to crush him).  He decided to stay at site 8, he should have moved on.  When I draw up my hand for the final push into site 9, I draw up a There and Back Again and a Hobbit Stealth, chances are good that Im going to win.  I move into site 9 giving 11 tokens, 9 for his site (gosh darnit the lack of a map), one for the There and Back Again, and one for frodo moving.  He plays out three uruk-hai for a total strength of 27, he plays savagery to bump up the strength to 29.  Frodo tosses the There and Back Again and has sting for a strength of 8.  I play the hobbit stealth and bounded, so he needed a strength of 30 to win the game.  Frodo, bruised and burdened moves on to victory.  Afterward, Brad beat himself up because there were two tokens left and he could have played Sarumans Snows or a Troop to crush Frodo.  In actuality he only had one token and then I put one in the pool when I played the Hobbit Stealth.  Brad, if youre reading this dont beat yourself up, the only thing you could have done to win the game was move onto site 9.  In the end though, I felt extremely lucky to be 2-1 so far in the tournament.  I won two games I should have lost and lost a game I should have won.  Typical for a tournament.<br>
	Round 4  Matt from Las Vegas big fellowship/Uruk-hai<br>
		Game Highlights:<br>
Now we get to the meat of the tournament.  My record was good enough that I would start to run into people doing the 5 burdens and go and get same trick.  Matt was one of these players.  I bid 7 burdens, he bid 5 and was amazed that I bid so many burdens.  He confessed that he had never been outbid before, ever.  Welcome to Hobbit love Matt.  To take advantage of the 5 burden bid I had put in enquea with Not so Easily Destroyed.  Not So Easily Destroyed removes 3 token in the maneuver phase or skirmish phase to heal a nazghul.  So basically Enquea acts as a machine gun, he exerts to wound a companion, you remove three to heal him, wash, rinse, and repeat until you have dead companions.  It was a neat trick, but unfortunately Matt got pretty lucky and played his Sam at site 2, before I could play the enquea trick.  I was not so lucky, I didnt get any hobbit party guests, or any maps.  Matt walked into site 9 to win the game.  Matt was a little serious about phases, he wasnt a jerk, you just had to make sure you knew what you wanted to do because he wasnt going to let you take back moves.  I was able to get the Not So Easily Destroyed/Enquea trick to about to work because he had 6 companions.  First off, he got rid of my condition with secret sentinels and then I messed up and killed Sam first, reducing the number of companions below 6, he wasnt going to let me place my two other wounds.  I might have killed one more companion because of that, but in reality he was probably going to win the game either way.  Oh well, in this kind of tournament there are going to be a few more serious types of players.<br>
<br>
	Round 5  Scott from Provo Utah(I play him in Utah) ArchersARV/Nazghul<br>
		Game Highlights:<br>
So I was now 2-2 and I found out I had to play Scott.  Scott and I have played before in tournaments around Utah and we were both a little disappointed to go to Las Vegas and play someone you would play in a tournament in Utah.  But it was a relaxed game.  Scott messed up at site 3, he played ARV to exhaust my two nazghul.  I used Not Easily Destroyed, to heal each nazghul once.  He had two archery, which was supposed to finish off the nazghul, but the Not So Easily Destroyed prevented that trick and  he lost Boromir at site 3.  Scott never got Aragorn out and only had Legolas and Frodo left at site 5 to get crushed by the nazghul.  We had enough time to play another game and I ended up winning that one as well, so I feel I deserved that win.  Scott was a good player and had some interesting tricks with his fellowship archery.  I wasnt surprised that he was 2-2 at this point in the tournament.<br>
<br>
	Round 6  Avery from California big fellowship/Sauron<br>
		Game Highlights:<br>
Avery was from California, he was a really nice guy to play a game with.  He had a large fellowship and his sauron orcs with their Tower Assasins and Hates can jack me up if Im not careful.  I was able to stay one step ahead of him.  Again, I didnt get my maps out and had to use his sites when I decided to push from site 7 to 9.  I slept at site 7 and pushed on to site 8.  He was only able to get out two orcs, he needed five to prevent me from moving on, and I had decided to move on to site 9.  He got out a ton of different sauron orcs.  I think it was about 10 all told.  I exerted Aragorn to make him defender +2, and then Avery hated him to death.  I had expected this.  I knew he had hates, and if it were a big deal I would have not exhausted Aragorn, but in a way I was toying with Avery, giving him some hope of winning the game.  I placed two orcs, one on Frodo, one on Sam.  Avery had seen the trick of tossing the ring to Sam, in fact he told me he used that to win one of his previous games, and made sure that Sam was going to get overwhelmed and then placed all the rest of the minions on Frodo.  I played two PATHs and killed all of the minions on Frodo to win the game.  Later I found out that he was really aggravated about me doing this to him, but I had the PATHs by site 7 and knew the game was over when he couldnt prevent me from moving to site 9.  Avery, if youre reading this I didnt mean to aggravate you, I thought it was a well played game and you were a relaxed easy going player.<br>
<br>
	Round 7  Ryan from Tucson big fellowship/Moria<br>
Game Highlights:<br>
Ryan had to be the strangest guy I met on the tournament, but he was pretty excited to be in Vegas.  However, he was a nice guy, and relaxed about most things.  The only exception is that he wanted wounds to be red tokens and burdens and shadows tokens to be using black tokens.  I can understand having a difference on the ring bearer to avoid confusion, but insisting on using red tokens for wounds and black tokens for everthing else is a little excessive.  Ive seen other players insist on doing this, and I shrug and do what they want to make things easier on them.  Ryan had a huge fellowship and moria orcs.  He bid 5 burdens and was outbid by my 7.  I moved on to site 2 and he played the twilight Neyla that can spot two wounds or two burdens to make him damage + 1 and fierce.  That messed up my fellowship a bit, but not too bad.  The bad thing is that he played the same guy at site 3.  He only had two versions of that guy in his deck and he came out in the first two turns of the game.  Not so good.  I wanted to mess him up some by doing the Not So Easily Destroyed and Enquea trick, I had the cards in my hand waiting for him to do his fellowship.  He played the rare Pippin to remove a burden reducing the total burdens to 4 that very turn, argh!!!  I went into site 5 to face down the balrog and the cave troll with various orcs with just Sam and Frodo and somehow Sam was able to walk away from it still alive.  I then moved into site 6 and got crushed.  Ryan was lucky, but he in all reality I would have been crushed Im sure.  I didnt feel bad about this game at all.  I got beat fair and square<br>
<br>
	Round 8  some kid from CA small fellowship/Moria<br>
Game Highlights:<br>
When I sat down and saw that the opponent across from the table was a young kid around 14-15 I knew that this was going to be an easy round.  Not to be ageist or anything.  Ive played some younger kids that have some pretty well put together decks and there are some that do well in tournaments.  What Ive found though is that they arent able to see two or three turns ahead.  The younger kids concentrate on the current turn so if you bluff they wont move on, but the big thing is if you move on they wont know how to handle it very well and you can race on.  His fellowship was interesting though.  He played aragorn and frodo, with Sam the Defender coming out later, he then tooled up these guys and handled pretty much everything I threw at them.  I was able to get a blade tip on Frodo and the magic number of 4 burdens came up.  This is important because 4 burdens is the number needed where you can assign Toldea to a skirmish.  Aragorn was buffed up enough that the only minions that could fight him were Cantea, The Witch King or maybe Attea, so I needed two minions to have any hope of putting wounds on guys.  If I could get out one the above minions plus Toldea then I had a chance of overwhelming Aragorn, but he wasnt giving me much shadow so he had to move two sites for me to do this strategy.  He knew I had minions and wouldnt move two sites a turn.  Which was perfectly fine with me.  Understand that the deck I had was designed to make you move one site at a time and if the threat of minions makes you only move site at a time then by all means do so.  In addition it ties up the hand of the other person by denying them the opportunity to play their fellowship maneuver and skirmish cards.  In the end it didnt matter, I moved twice in two turns.  Got my maps and exerted for my sites 6,7,8,9 and pretty much walked into site 9<br>
<br>
Post tournament notes:<br>
<br>
I liked playing in this tournament.  I did well and if it werent for a few missteps along the way I might have gotten one more win and taken the prize money for the best record for someone with a rating below 1700.  Games 4 and 7 I ended up losing to people who placed in the top 4 so I felt good about my performance.  But, the one big thing that I learned when going to a big tournament such as this one is to find the most popular deck on decktech and side board against it.  If I had known this before the tournament I would have still run hobbits and nazghul but would have put a few more cards on the nazghul side to take advantage of having 2-5 burdens instead of relying on Enquea and Not So Easily Destroyed to mess up the players.  So if I were to go back and create a deck that would mess up people I would do the following.  I would punish people for attempting to bid high.  I would punish people for taking uruk-hai.  Finally, I would punish people for taking a big fellowship.  I think the first two will probably change, bidding high is risky and not everyone takes uruk-hai, other minions can be just as dangerous.  What I dont think will change is people taking smaller fellowships.  Large fellowships are dangerous, they can take an incredible amount of damage and if guys die you have more to replace them and most people dont like to play cards that punish large fellowships because you cant use them against someone who runs a small fellowship or before the large fellowship gets created, so they have a large potential to be wasted cards.<br>
<br>
One of the people I traveled to the tournament with, Eric, won the raffle and took possession of the sword Sting.  Cortney, the other guy I went to the tournament with, won a Gimli foil, which is one of the cards he needed for his foil set.  Me, I had to be content of having the best record among the three of us.  Although Eric also went 5-3, he lost his first 2 games and Im sure that I had better opposition.  I think Id rather have won the raffles than to win the games.<br>
