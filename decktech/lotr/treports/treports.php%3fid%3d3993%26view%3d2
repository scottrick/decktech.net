Gondor Bowmen archery on Free Peoples and Ringwraiths on shadow. The shadow is my pride. I have tailored it so that my Nazgul never lose skirmishes, and when they win...oh you know what comes. I was worried about Free Peoples though. Sure, once I had 4 Bowmen and every other stinking archery tool out, my opponent will shoot nasty glances at me as I proceed to just move and shoot down everything with barely an exertion. Two problems though. It gets molested by Relentless Charges and cloberd by Saruman, Keeper of Isengard and sodomised by Saruman&#39;s...oh well, Power. And Uruks and Nazgul are definitely the 2 most definitive and popular shadow cultures here, though less are playing the latter nowadays. All the better for me. <br>
<br>
So into 3 a.m. the previous night, I had a long discussion with Carlos Trujillo over the net. He suggested some improvements and I took those which I could accept or conform to, and they did help me tremendously. One thing was sure after the talk. My absolutely lame Bilbo Red Book tech might be cool and fun and cheese my opponent off, but for tournament play, I would go with a more consistent version with Galadriel and some other tools.<br>
<br>
Got up at 12 the next day, hurriedly gathered my stuff and thought I was going to be late...turned out it only started nearly 2 hours after I got there. 12 attended.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
vs Joachim Chua<br>
Arwen, DoE/Legolas, G start<br>
Gondor Bowmen Archery/Uruks<br>
<br>
Hmm...Uruks on my first game? Less intimidating though when I considered that he doesn&#39;t play Saruman rare (he thinks Lurtz and Uruk-Hai Rampages are better, sigh) and no Power due to his conditions.<br>
<br>
He bid 1 to my 0. Thought I was playing Uruks as usual so he went first and started the Pony. Played some stuff including his first Bowmen and moved to my Trollshaw. I had nothing except Witch-King and Lemenya. Shrug, Lemenya would be a joke, just taking 2 archery up his, so I played the boss and he exerted Legolas twice and used his Bowmen up early. He immediately requested to move again and I stared at him with feigned surprise as I drew up to 8. &quot;Whoa, right into the Ford?&quot;<br>
<br>
That gave him something to think of and he eventually decided not to. Excellent, I still only had Lemenya, though a Blade Tip now, but still, a disgrace at Ford. And he wasted a Bowmen there.<br>
<br>
I pulled Aragorn and got the Bow out. 2 Gondor Bowmen too. I drew up Boromir but opted not to give him the 5th. Moved to 2 and stopped.<br>
<br>
By the time he really entered Ford, I got a good force out. Won skirmishes and conditions went flying.<br>
<br>
Details are sketchy here, as my memory is not good with uneventful games. Basically ate him up whole while he was in Moria, leaving him with just exhausted Aragorn and Frodo, and killed his Elves off just as he drew into his Elven toys. On my side, I killed Arwen off in a double to 6 after I was caught with my pants down against Durin&#39;s Bane, in time for Boromir to make his grand entrance. He limped to 6 one turn later, and stopped.<br>
<br>
So I was in control here. Boromir came out with Last Alliance, Armor and Blade. Aragorn had an Alliance with Sword and Armor. Contemplated for a while before Pathfinding Silverlode Banks. He looked a potential candidate for Confluence. Gave out a lot of twilight but shot everything down and used Elrond to heal Boromir up for another move to 8. Diced an Orc Overseer and took 2 against a Troop.<br>
<br>
On his side, he made two easy moves utilising Gondor Bowmen with Aragorn&#39;s own Bow. I didn&#39;t care giving him small-vitality minions though, as I was trying to clear my hand. On my turn, I moved to 9 with still 1 or 2 Bowmen out and Legolas and Aragorn full-health to exert for Splendor and Bow.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Props:<br>
-My Nazgul never lost a skirmish.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Oh come on, Uruks without Saruman or Power? Not even Spies?<br>
-He picked up my Relentless Charge asking what it was after it killed Legolas<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
vs Benjamin Lin<br>
Gimli, DotMR/Legolas G start<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Twilight Ringwraiths<br>
<br>
I had been sitting beside my friend, who lost to him unexpectedly. But then, basically, once you lose to Twilight Ringwraiths once, you gain immunity and never lose to them again. I already paid my dues in a dastardly loss some time back :_(<br>
<br>
We both bid 0. I won the dice-roll. We definitely both ran Ford so there was no difference in going 1st or 2nd, but he had Weathertop and Eregion Hills for sure, so I let him go first.<br>
<br>
He started the Pony and played quite some stuff before moving. Got out a Tip or Breath and a Nazgul and said BOO to Bounder (Fear). Turned out to be game-breaking. He shot the guy down and stopped.<br>
<br>
I pulled Aragorn and got 2 Bowmen out, his own Bow out and some other stuff before moving. He played Otsea and his jaw dropped as I dealt him 3 normal archery, thanks to Legolas spotting the forest. So he just wasted 6 twilight. I thought for a while and thought why not before moving, right before I realised I would enter Eregion Hills now. Twilight Witch-King and Enquea met me. Took wounds, nothing I couldn&#39;t heal, but Arwen bit a Black Breath.<br>
<br>
He stopped at 3, after I Black Breathed somebody. Gimli, I think. Might have Tipped him too. Anyway, I moved to 4 and added a burden to 2. Nelya + 2 It Wants To Be Found got it to 4. Getting dangerous. Shot him down.<br>
<br>
He stopped at 4, starting to get in serious trouble after he was still unable to win any skirmish. Relentless Charge did some wounds, and he, like his friend above, picked it up to see the text, asking what it was.<br>
<br>
I moved to 5 for Toldea and somebody else. NO way I could let that guy survive archery. Promptly shot him down. Contemplated Pathfinding 6 but decided not to and just moved. Shot everything down again and Pathfinder for Silverlode.<br>
<br>
He moved into 5 and Legolas and Gimli both died off. I made a quick move to 7 and saw another It Wants To Be Found, putting me at the magic 5. I stopped, as his fellowship was bleeding. He moved to 6 and Aragorn too died, leaving him now with just a naked Frodo shivering in his breeches.<br>
<br>
I moved to 8 and faced Enquea, who pinged Legolas off. Didn&#39;t mind as my companions were all full-health and pinging me meant me pinging you too. I stopped, not wanting him to draw 5 for Summit until I was ready.<br>
<br>
He moved to 7 with just Frodo then. I was just about to play Nelya and Cantea when I remembered in time my Sting from the previous turn. He had 3 PATHS in hand. All right then, The Witch-King instead. 14-4<br>
<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Props:<br>
-My Nazgul never lost a skirmish.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-He picked up my Relentless Charge asking what it was after it killed Legolas<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
vs Ong Yunnshing<br>
Gandalf, the Grey Pilgrim start<br>
Gandalf-Men/Moria Archery<br>
<br>
This was it. If I don&#39;t win this guy here and now, he&#39;s going to overtake me as top dog in the ratings. Crunch time.<br>
<br>
He bid 3 to my 0 and went first, then saw my starting fellowship and groaned when he saw I wasn&#39;t playing my usual deck.<br>
<br>
He played Aragorn and grabbed Gandalf&#39;s Cart from the Lookout Point. He moved to Trollshaw and my true colours were revealed as I Gates-ed an Attea. He contemplated before Aragorn and Gandalf both took wounds, with my Black Breath going on Aragorn.<br>
<br>
I didn&#39;t get Aragorn but got Boromir. Legolas&#39; 2 shots were enough to see off the 2 Moria Orcs at 2. Then he played Sam and Legolas and moved to the Ford and I got 2 Nazgul out. I burned off a copy of Too Great and Terrible. Aragorn took his 2nd wound under the Breath.<br>
<br>
I went to 3 without any problem. Wondered whether to save my Pathfinder up to 7 or 8 against Anduin Confluence and Brown Lands, and decided not to as I brought Moria Stairway out and stopped. Also Sentinel-ed his Goblin Domain and They are Coming.<br>
<br>
He moved there and I brought out the greatest living nightmare: Morgul Gates + Witch-King + The Pale Blade. Stairway meant that he was a 17-strength, Damage +2 son oeasterlingun, capable of overwhelming anybody except Gandalf. Sam died on the 1st skirmish and Gandalf took 3 wounds and a Black Breath, Narya meaning he was 2 wounds away from the inevitable. Now where&#39;s my 2nd Too Great and Terrible...<br>
<br>
I played Galadriel and moved to 4, archery still managing to bail me out. Then he went to 5 and was subjected to even more hurt as Legolas was overwhelmed, but that was the only minion I had.<br>
<br>
I drew Aragorn up but wondered whether to give him that much twilight for 5. Used Sting and found a 2nd Goblin Domain hiding in his hand so that wasn&#39;t much of a choice. Played him with Bow, got Armor out on Boromir in preparation for &#39;Rog. Moved to 5. Balrog and some friends came out, but not that many due to his TaC being crippled. I could shoot the &#39;Rog down but that would be a waste of effort. I took 2 against him, killed everybody else, and doubled to Dimrill Dale with my bows rearing to shoot, and he shook his head before playing nothing.<br>
<br>
He played Boromir with Flaming Brand, and Ranger&#39;s Sword and Flaming Brand on Aragorn. Tsk, just when he had the ability to stand up to my Nazgul, Lemenya and a Nazgul brought him back down to earth. Aragorn needed a Servant to bail him out of his skirmish, others took wounds, and Boromir bit a Tip and Breath. His Fellowship was really smelly now with everybody except Frodo having Black Breath and multitudes of wounds. Excellent timing there, as he wouldn&#39;t get to use the toilets at the sanctuary.<br>
<br>
I played Nenya and set up my Men with Last Alliances and Swords before moving to 7, Confluence. Argh, my Elrond + Vilya and Galadriel + Nenya. I was planning for them to repair the damage which would befall at Brown Lands. And as I discarded them, I stared blankly at the Sentinels in my hand and his 2 Armories and TaC. Bleurgh.<br>
<br>
Archer Commander, Archer Troop and other small Orcs came out. Everybody but the Commander and Troop were shot down as he discarded an Armory. Plainly, he was going to try and scare me from entering Brown Lands. I assigned them respectively to Aragorn and Troop. Resolved Aragorn first and in a mis-identification of my real target, he sacked his last Armory to save the Commander, which left room for Boromir to swish the Troop with his Blade and Damage +1. I took a breath and charged into Brown Lands.<br>
<br>
When the dust cleared, I was staring at 10 archery: 2 Archer Troops, Archer Commander and Goblin Bowman. 2 shots from Aragorn&#39;s Bow brought it down to 6. Then I took the 6 wounds, exhausting everybody, and opting not to put any on Isildur&#39;s Bane for him to draw at 9. Aragorn and Boromir took care of skirmishing once again.<br>
<br>
He moved to 7 with exhausted Boromir, exhausted Aragorn and 1-from-exhaustion Gandalf. He had discarded his Sleeps and other Fellowship to TaC in a frantic last-ditch attempt to hurt me at Brown Lands and would never again be free of my bad breath. Aragorn and Boromir died.<br>
<br>
At this point, he only had 2 cards left in his draw deck, so yeah, you can figure. I went to Site 9 and shot a Runner and Marksman down.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Props:<br>
-Very smooth game. Drew everything at the correct time.<br>
-My Nazgul never lost a skirmish, except when up against Servant of the Secret Fire<br>
-Won the game I needed to win<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-10 archery at Brown Lands<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
vs Ryan Seah<br>
Arwen, DoE/Legolas G start<br>
Large Fellowship/Uruks<br>
<br>
I was the only 3-0 and was so paired down. This match-up seriously wasn&#39;t good. This guy plays Uruks, 4 Sarumans and 2 Saruman&#39;s Power. He had also been watching almost every game I played. <br>
<br>
We both bid 0. I won the dice-roll and let him go first. He started the Pony and played some stuff and moved to 2, where I was only able to bring out Lemenya and Black Breath. Arwen took the wound and the Breath. Then he used Pathfinder for Council Courtyard. Bleurgh! Totally defeated the purpose of Nazgul. Couldn&#39;t bring anything out, and I looked in dismay at my own Pathfinder, the means by which I could go to 2 THEN go to my 3 and leave him behind. Oh well, if you let an opponent go first and can&#39;t stop him for the first 2 if you&#39;re Nazgul, that&#39;s bad.<br>
<br>
I pulled Aragorn, got Bowmen out and used Council of Elrond for The Splendor of Their Banners. Shot everything down at 2, shot everything down at 3.<br>
<br>
He moved to Stairway and I only got Cantea and somebody out. He killed Arwen off.<br>
<br>
I too stopped at 4 after he played Saruman alone. Bluff or no, I just don&#39;t like him, not when I didn&#39;t have the ability to shoot PAST him. He moved to 5 and Aragorn took 2 under the Breath.<br>
<br>
I went to 5 and faced Saruman and Troop. Aragorn took both skirmishes with the help of Saga to keep him alive. Just Saruman and Troop at 5? Yeah, you see the discrepancy. I healed Aragorn up with Elrond and charged into 6, where he played another Uruk. I could shoot a max of 7 with 1 Bowmen, Bow and 2 Legolas exertions at a forest, and 7 was the exact number I needed in order to shoot through everything, Saruman included.<br>
<br>
He moved to 6 where I made the game-defining mistake. With his Aragorn now equipped with Last Alliance and Flaming Brand, I was focused on him as I brought out Attea with a Sword, spending all the twilight, and bang, he was backstabbed by cowardly Site 6 archer allies. So, there was nothing in the pool, and he had no wounds except for those he could not heal under Black Breath. He had nothing to lose and moved again, where I couldn&#39;t muster something big enough to beat &#39;Gorn.<br>
<br>
He did that rashly because he knew he could no longer stop me. I, knowing he intended to run, finally dropped Boromir, Blade and Armor in hand to give him the 5th after saving him all the while to clear space in my hand. I moved to 7, survived easily and cleared out my Fellowship for the ultimate showdown.<br>
<br>
He got a 2nd Brand out on Aragorn, making him a bloody 17-strength monster. He played his 5th companion (Gimli) and contemplated playing his 6th and 7th (I had used Sting) but after a while decided not to. Dang, I would&#39;ve won if he did as I just topdecked Enquea and had Relentless Charge in hand to seriously abuse the maneuver phase.<br>
<br>
I played Cantea and Lemenya and said BOO to Calaglin. Legolas made sure Cantea couldn&#39;t try any funny tricks with Aragorn and both Nazgul died. Not very good there. I reconciled as he moved again, and a glimmer of hope appeared. The day was not lost yet!<br>
<br>
Witch-King and Enquea made their entrance. Maneuver, I Relentless Charged Legolas to death and Charged again to Aragorn&#39;s death, leaving him with 3 companions against 2 Fierce Nazgul, of which none could stand up to a 16-strength Witch-King.<br>
<br>
Oh wait, he only added a 4th wound on Aragorn when I Charged instead of dumping him. Huh? NOOOOOOO, The Saga of Elendil!<br>
<br>
So yeah, 17-strength &#39;Gorn chopped the Witch-King up.<br>
<br>
FL +1/+10<br>
Props<br>
-Did fantastic against Uruks, Saruman or no.<br>
-He played a flawless game to beat me<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-Saga of Elendil, not getting Pale Blade<br>
-The blunder at Site 6. Only mistake made by either and cost me the game.<br>
-My Nazgul lost a lot of skirmishes to a bloody, very fierce Free Peoples Balrog (17-strength, 5 vitality)<br>
<br>
Results<br>
1st: Ryan Seah +10 (30)<br>
2nd: Loh Mun Kit +10 (28) (14)<br>
3rd: Me +10 (28) (9) <br>
<br>
Yeah, I tied with Kit so we sat down at a table and settled 2nd and 3rd in the most mature and adult way possible. We rolled dice, which explains the 3rd number you see. <br>
<br>
Props<br>
-Carlos for some inspired suggestions<br>
-My first Participation Certificate.<br>
-My Nazgul never lost any skirmish except against...well<br>
-There was prize support this time. FotR starter for winner, 1 MoM pack each for 2nd and 3rd. Oh well, better than nothing. Yep, The Balrog&#39;s Sword is also better than nothing. MoM packs here now go for $2 by the way, compared to the $5 for FotR and RotEL.<br>
