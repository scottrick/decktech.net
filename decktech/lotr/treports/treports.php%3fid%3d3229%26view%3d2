The winner would be named 2001 Store Champion and have free entrance to all LOTR events through 2002.  Besides that, Collectormania always gives away great prizes.  My girlfriend Jackie was all set to go with a deck I had built for her, but she got called into work to file some reports at the last minute, so she would not get a chance to play in her first tournament.  Several people from the Colorado Springs area decided to go up for this event, and fellow Rider of Rohan Brian Montez was one of them.  He met me at my house early Saturday for some trading, which completed my set.  It took me somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 boxes to get there, but it was worth it.  After trading, we played a few test games with both decks I had made, one for me and one for Jackie.  The Fellowships were essentially the same, using Legolas and Arwen to start, pulling Aragorn, and using all of the powerful Ranger cards to keep them alive.  My deck used Nazgul for the Shadow, and Jackie&#8217;s Shadow was a solid Uruk-Hai.  After a couple games, all of which I won, I decided to stick with the Nazgul, because I was more comfortable with them.  Brian was running a small Fellowship centered around Aragorn, with nasty Sauron Orcs for Shadow.  <br>
We arrived at Collectormania about a half-hour early.  Other Springs players in attendance were Joe Schlagheck, Dan Hummel, Will Prather, Mike Minillo and the dreaded Ian Monteith.  William Diniega, the top rated player at the time of the event was also in attendance, along with a host of great players. I go into today with a rating of 1532, definitely in need of some improvement.  When the tournament started we had 34 players in attendance, all ready to play some LOTR.<br>
<br>
GAME ONE<br>
<br>
vs.  Ian Monteith  (      )   Legolas / Nazgul<br>
<br>
Ian&#8217;s deck is a beast, and he is a really good player.  Today he is running a huge deck, somewhere over 80 cards.  I bid to start, and pull Aragorn with the Prancing Pony.  I play a bunch of cool toys, like Aragorn&#8217;s bow, and The Tale of Gil-Galad on Legolas.  When I move, he plays Weatherhills.  Great.  He has enough Twilight for two Nazgul, and he plays a couple copies of Relentless Charge, wounding my Archers before they can even nock an arrow.  After the Skirmish, Aragorn is dead.  I of course decide to stay put.  On his turn, he pulls Aragorn as well, then moves up.  I can only play one Nazgul, which he easily handles.  He stays.  Then I move on up to the hated Fords of Bruinen, and he plays the Witch King and Ulaire Attea.  Great.  He plays ANOTHER copy of Relentless Charge, and Legolas bites it.  This leaves Arwen and a trembling Frodo.  Frodo wets his little Hobbit pants and promptly dies.<br>
FL +1/+1<br>
<br>
Okay, I&#8217;m off to a wonderful start.  Ian and I discussed the size of his deck.  I wondered how he could ever get what he needed with so many cards to dig through.  He said the size of his deck was due to having 4 copies of nearly everything he wanted, so everything he draws would be of some use, no matter what.  As we will see, his oversized deck would not slow him down at all.<br>
<br>
GAME TWO <br>
<br>
vs.  Dan McKee ( 1547 ) Elves and Mirrors / Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
Dan bids to go first, and to my surprise, he pulls the Prancing Pony as his Site 1!  Imagine that.  He has Legolas ( uncommon ) and Arwen to start, and gets Aragorn right away.  He then plays Galadriel and one of the Elf Archer allies.  He moves, and I play Weatherhills.  I have enough Twilight for two Nazgul.  His companions take a load of damage and have to stop.  On my turn I grab Aragorn and play a few toys.  I stop at Site 2 after killing everything he played with Archery.  I stopped because I wanted to play my Fords.  Dan plays Celeborn to his support area, and I&#8217;m starting to get suspicious.  I had never played against a mirror deck before, so I didn&#8217;t even recognize the threat at first.  Dan moves and has to face a couple Ringwraiths again.  I play Fear and kill of Celeborn, stopping his healing engine, for now.  After the Skirmish phase, Arwen was toast.  He stopped again.  It went on like this for the next few turns, with his Companions getting killed every step of the way. Dan plays another Celeborn and the Mirror, and starts dropping my cards at site 5.  He tries to heal his Allies at site 6, but Sanctuary only works on Companions. He then moves on to Site 7, which is the Anduin Confluence.  Bye-bye Allies.  After that his Frodo gets overwhelmed.<br>
FW +3/+4<br>
<br>
Better, but still not back in the mix, and things will only get harder if I keep winning.  Dan and I discussed whether or not he can play another Celeborn if he is killed, and based on the rules he cannot.  However, Fear simply says discard an Ally, so Celeborn was legal for a second play.  It was good to clear that up, because Fear may not be the best card against the Mirror, as I had thought.   But it sure is nice against Bounders and Gaffers.  <br>
<br>
GAME THREE <br>
<br>
Vs.  David Fonken  ( 1588 )  Rangers and Nazgul <br>
<br>
David had come down to the Springs for a tourney, and he was one of the top players that day, so I know I have my work cut out for me.  I start, and pull Aragorn with the Pony.  My opening hand had just about everything I could want.  I play Aragorns Bow, The Saga of Elendil, and a No Stranger to the Shadows.  I move, Dave plays Weatherhills, but he has nothing in hand to play.  I stop, in case of the bluff.  He pulls out his Aragorn as well, along with Elrond and a couple weapons.  Again, I get enough Twilight for two Nazgul, and a Blade Tip.  Arwen and Aragorn step up, and Arwen gets the tip.  David stops.  I add a couple conditions like Last Alliance and play an Elven Bow on Arwen.  I move up to, you guessed it, the Fords.  David can only play one Nazgul, which again I promptly fill with arrows.  David cannot draw any good cards to save his life, and his deck is only around 64 cards.  I pull ahead after taking no damage at Site 4.  By the time David catches up, Frodo is buck-naked at the Bridge of Khazad-dum.  I play a beefy Nazgul, and Frodo once again bites the dust.  <br>
FW +3/+7<br>
<br>
It really sucked to see David not be able to draw a single card he needed from the get go, even with Elrond out.  I know that if the cards had fallen better for him, we would have fought tooth and nail to site 9, and it could have been anyone&#8217;s game.<br>
<br>
GAME FOUR <br>
<br>
vs.  Joe Schlagheck ( 1500 ) Hobbits and Uruk-Hai.  <br>
<br>
Joe is a decent player from the Springs.  He has played in my Star Wars tournaments for over a year, and was a quick learner when LOTR came out.  I am confident I will beat him, and I talk a little friendly trash to him.  But I know he is a good player and I do not want to underestimate him.   He starts off this time, but I draw an Aragorn in my opening hand, so all is well.  He plays the Gaffer and a load of Hobbit Drunks, and starts removing burdens like a madman.  He giggles, thinking he has a god draw.  Then he moves to Weatherhills and faces two Nazgul.  Oops.  Now the Hobbits don&#8217;t seem so cool.  I keep moving ahead, while Joe keeps getting stalled by my Black Riders.  Joe loses a few Companions, and at site 7, all of his Allies go away.  The last of his Companions are gone, and Joe decides to make a run for it.  Frodo is all alone at Site 8, and dies a horrible death at the hands of two Fierce Nazgul. <br>
FW +3/+10  <br>
<br>
Okay, so far Joe had given me the hardest win, and for that I give him props.  Now things were going to get tough.  Ian and William &#8220; the Dianoga &#8220; Diniega were paired off, both undefeated.  I was pushing for Ian to win, sorry William, but I have to keep the love for my Springs players.  I was on my up, but my next game would be the hardest, or so I thought.<br>
<br>
GAME FIVE <br>
<br>
vs.  Adam Begin ( 1618 ) Gandalf / Mixed minions<br>
<br>
Adam was another player who had come down to the Springs and made a good showing.  For that event he played a nasty Sauron deck that nearly killed all of Josh Bader&#8217;s Fellowship in a single turn!  I asked him right away if he was playing the same thing, and to my surprise he said he was trying something new.  Okay by me.  He starts and plays a ton of Companions and Allies and support cards.  When he moves to Weatherhills, he does not look happy, because he had given me over 20 Twilight to work with.  I played three Nazgul, including Ulaire Cantea.  He assigns Cantea to Uncommon Gimli with an axe.  Cantea discards his weapon and overwhelms the stubby guy.  The other Nazgul do some serious damage as well, being Fierce and all.  Adam is forced to stop.  On my turn I once again have luckily pulled an Aragorn.  He comes out as well as some weapons.  When we move he plays a couple Sauron trackers, who die to Archery.  I stay, so I can get the Fords.  When he moves, I am able to come at him hard again, killing another companion.  I keep running ahead and healing, while my Shadow keeps Adam effectively stalled.  I rush to site nine and everyone lives.<br>
FW +3/+13<br>
<br>
No this is more like it.  Ian defeats William Diniega, so we are tied for points.  I could stand a chance of placing as long as I win the last game.<br>
<br>
GAME SIX<br>
<br>
vs.  Marcia Forney  Gandalf Rainbow / Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
Marcia was a real nice girl, and she said right away that this was her second tournament, and that she was surprised she had done so well.  Her fiancé had designed her deck, and it was apparently running smooth for her.  Up to now, anyway.  I started and pulled Aragorn, and Archery held off her minions.  I stop so I can pull the Fords.  She moves to Weatherhills first, and one of her Companions, I think Gimli, gets killed.  She decides to move on, and this is were things got ugly.  Another Nazgul joins the first from Site 2, and Gandalf and another of her Companions, I think Boromir, get beat up.  She stops.  I go ahead and blast through to Site 4 with no hassles.  On my next turn I survive the Swarm thanks to the arrows of Legolas and Aragorn.  At Site 6 she plays a Cave Troll and the Keyward.  A Ranger&#8217;s Versatility exhausts the poor creatures, and arrows finish them off.  Marcia kept with it, but her Frodo finally succumbs at Site 7.<br>
FW +3/+16<br>
<br>
Ian had beaten Will Prather to insure his spot as Store Champion.  For second place it was between me and William The Dianoga.  It would all come down to opponents win points to break the tie, and from looking at the games, William seemed to have a slight edge.  It would all depend on two games.  I went outside and smoked a cigarette, to calm down from the day of tough games.  When I went inside, both players I was counting on to win to insure my spot in second place had failed me.  William edged me out for second by only 4 opponent win points.  So I took third.  Ian and I were pushing for a sweep by Colorado Springs, which Scott so kindly announced would have been a first, but it just didn&#8217;t go that way.  William definitely deserved second, as he did have the much harder schedule over all.   Once the numbers came out, he breathed a sigh of relief and I groaned, but he shook my hand and we congratulated each other.  What a great game this is, with great players.<br>
<br>
PROPS<br>
<br>
To Scott Gaeta, of course, for running a great event, as always.  Thanks for the great trade. <br>
<br>
To Brian Montez, for playtesting that morning.<br>
<br>
To Joe Schlagheck, for giving me the hardest game of the day.  <br>
<br>
To Mike Minillo, for sticking with the game.  Hang in there, guy, you&#8217;re getting better every time. <br>
<br>
To Ian Monteith, for taking the whole thing for the Springs, and motivating me to push for the sweep.  We will get them next time.  <br>
<br>
To Marcia Forney, for being so nice, even though things didn&#8217;t work as well for her in our game.  Look out for this girl, fellas.<br>
<br>
SLOPS <br>
<br>
None really, except to me for playing stupidly against Ian.  <br>
<br>
And maybe to David Fonken&#8217;s deck, for turning on him in our game.  Just like Kenny Rogers said :   &#8220; You got to know when to hold &#8216;em, know when to fold &#8216;em. &#8220;<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and to all of the whiners who think that Mirror decks are unstoppable.  Nobody in the top ten of this event were running the Mirror deck, and those that were simply lost too many games to strong Fellowships to make a difference.  Fear not the Mirror.  It is a powerful strategy, yes, but not the end of the world.<br>
