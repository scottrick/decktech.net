I realized that I would have Labor Day off of work, so I let her know. I talked to T.J., who Id lost to back in June in the Northern Cali Territorial (check out my tournament report for more on that beating), and he said hed probably have a tournament going that weekend. Needless to say, that was enough to convince me! <br>
<br>
I let Linda know that Id be coming to visit her and that Id probably play in the tournament, and then invited Mike Mendoza along to come play in the tournament as well. The drive up wasnt so bad. And the store was really close to my sisters. There was a bit of traffic between Rohnert Park and Santa Rosa, but nothing too bad. We got there and said hi to everyone, T.J., Mason, etc. and hung out for a while waiting for some more people to show up before T.J. got the tournament started. I think there ended up being 12 players once Drews cousin and T.J. joined.<br>
<br>
Ahead of time, Im sorry for the lack of details. Most of my games were pretty quick (accept for the game against Drew), sowell, read on, youll see.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs. Drew Biederman (1577) a.k.a. Space-out Boy (Moria/Big Fellowship)<br>
<br>
T.J. had told me a bit about Drew beforehand when we were chatting on AIM. Apparently the kid has extreme difficulty focusing in anything, hence the nickname Space-out Boy. Once Drew sat down he started talking to me. Heres how the conversation went:<br>
<br>
Drew: How long have you been playing?<br>
Me: Oh, since April. What about you?<br>
Drew (with a sly grin on his face): Since it came out.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I was playing my Nazgul/Horn deck that I played last week (with a few changes), so we bid. He bid two to my zero and opted to go first. The game went really slowly (See T.J.s report for further details on this). He had 6 guys down and I played Enquea. He says, What does that card do? So I let him read it. Oh, he says. I took out Boromir (LOG), just cuz hes a tank.<br>

It was about that time that a lady (T.J. since told me this was Drews aunt) came in the tournament room and proceeded to start talking to Drew during our game. He couldnt get focused back on the game at all. I had to keep trying to get him to pay attention. It didnt help that the lady wouldnt leave either. She watched for a few minutes and Drew just couldnt decide which was more important, playing or talking. T.J. came over and I asked him to be so kind as to not let the game time out. Luckily he told me that he wasnt timing it, so that made me feel a little better. I wanted to ask the lady to leave, but I didnt want to be rude. Honestly though I was a bit surprised she didnt realize she was interrupting something. She didnt even seem to notice I was there!<br>
<br>
So anyways, back to the game. At site 3 I pulled Rumil and Tale of Gil-galad, so I played that. That was pretty nice. Kept him from stacking anyone on swarms. He got one Troll on me the whole game, and thats pretty much how it went. I ditched almost all the conditions he played (thank God for Secret Sentinels). I doubled from 6-8 and then won at 9, never really seeing a swarm. He was on site 6 when I won. He didnt get to move very fast because my Nazis slowed him down. Overall, it was a relatively easy walk once Drew actually started playing. Changing it up to Aragorn RON has really helped my deck when facing Moria.<br>
<br>
FW +3/3<br>
<br>
Highs: Rumil with Gil-galad against Moria.<br>
Lows: Drews Aunt and Drews short attention span.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. Frank Pinkela (1708) a.k.a. Burden Lover (Archery/Sauron/Twilight Nazgul Corruption)<br>
<br>
After his first game I heard Frank bragging about his corruption deckthat hed won every single game hed played with it by corruption. So hes the Burden Lover. We got down to it, and he won the bid and chose to go first (I bid zero most of the time, plus I already knew he was playing corruption, so why would I help him by adding burdens?). I drew up my hand and almost laughed. Brilliant shadow hand! Out of the corner of my eye, I saw him add Aragorns Bow to Aragorn. Even better, hehehe!<br>
<br>
When he moved to site two, Bree Streets, I just played two guys, Cantea and Toldea. He told me to take two archery, but I stopped him. What about maneuvers Frank? I dropped two Relentless Charges. Both Aragorn and Legolas died. On my turn I played a bunch of stuff. I was going to stop, but none of his guys survived, so I went on. Doh, he wasnt playing the Fords. I made it easily. At site 2 I also got rid of his Orc Bowmen (but forgot to snag Thin and Stretched since it was buried under Frodo) with my Secret Sentinels. I asked Frank if I could lose that too, but he said no. No worries though, I had another Sentinels in hand, and I used it at site 3 to get rid of Thin and Stretched and yet another Bowmen. When he hit site 3, I couldnt play anything. His little Frodo lasted to site 4, Eregion Hills. I gatesed in Cantea and he was done.<br>
<br>
We had a lot of time left, so we played again. I didnt get the double Relentless Charges, but I made it to site 9.and got corrupted. Props for that Frank. I dont think Id ever lost by corruption before.<br>
<br>
FW +3/6<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning against Frank, cuz he was getting a little overconfident with his deck. Double Relentless Charges at site 2.<br>
Lows: None really.<br>
<br>
Frank and I traded a little after the game, then for the first time I actually realized that T.J. was playing. T.J. ended up paired against Mike, and I ended up going against Ethan, who doesnt have a rating, but managed to give Mike a run for his money and beat someone else.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs. Ethan Rustad (1500) a.k.a. The Cute Little Kid (Nazgul)<br>
This game was great for me because I got my entire Fellowship set up by site 3. His Nazgul couldnt touch Boromir or Aragorn (strength 15 and 16 against Nazgul respectively). I didnt even have to use the Horn. Every single time he threw down a Black Breath, Id have a Sentinels in my hand to get rid of it. Cool stuff. I ended up winning at site 8, when he tried to double-move. Three Nazgul was too many for his beaten-up crew.<br>
<br>
FW +3/9<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning three straight and getting my fellowship set up right away.<br>
Lows: Ethan trying to trick me into telling him what was in my deck. Hes a cute kidand he knows it! I bet a lot of people fall for that. :)<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs. Michael Mendoza (1873) a.k.a. The Master (Gandalf/Nazgul)<br>
Well, this was the showdown. Michael and I played 5-6 games before the tournament, and he beat me down every single time, so thats why hes also known as The Master. There was only one game that was remotely close, and that was when I doubled from 7-9 and ate it at 9Each of those games we played Id bid zero, and Mike made me go first, so I figured I should change it up and try to get him to go first. I bid one and so did he. He was shocked about that. We rolled dice and I won, 6 to his 4. Yup Mikey, youre going first. :)<br>
<br>
I drew up my hand and to my surprise I had a Nazi, Breath, and Too Great and Terrible. Wonderful cards when your opponent starts Gandalf. He plays Aragorn and moves to the Streets. I play Toldea, play a Black Breath, and then play Too Great. Gandalf takes two for that, and then Aragorn takes two against Toldea and I breathed him. Mike stops. On my turn all I have to play are allies and support stuff. But I dont want to give him too much pool because knowingly he has a handful of guys to drop on me, so instead, I hang onto Galadriel and Rumil. Details are hazy, but Im pretty sure Boromir took two here. Its kinda sadIve played so many games against Mike that Im trying to remember which scenarios happened in which game. :) Im sure if I got anything really wrong, hell make a correction when he reviews this.<br>
<br>
At site three, I get down fierce Nelya and another guy to kill off both Gandalf and Aragorn. Wow. I have to admit that I took myself by surprise there. This is going rather well, wouldnt you say? Mike stops, and its my turn to hit the Fords. I draw up Aragorn, so I play him, add two to heal Boromir (I pretty much dont have a choice) and move. He gets down a squad, and initially I think Im done, but then I realize I can assign a Nazgul to Frodo and exert Merry. On the fierce Boromir dies, Merry dies, and Aragorn ends up taking two. So Im left with just tipped Frodo and Aragorn (it just sucks when Boromir dies at site 3 in a Horn Deck, doesnt it???).<br>
<br>
So Mike moves to 4 and I cant play anything. At site 4, he plays Twilight Nelya. Frodo and his burdens and Aragorn without Armor dont like this at all. Aragorn dies. So it comes to the Bridge. Mike doesnt draw anything, so poor little Frodo has to take on a ferocious Nazgul all by his lonesome, and thats game. <br>
<br>
FW +3/12<br>
<br>
Highs: I cant lieit was good to finally beat Mike after getting beat down repeatedly (and badly) by him. Not to mention hes been a mentor to me when it comes to Rings. All that play-testing really paid offthanks for that Mike.<br>
Lows: Beating up and getting beaten up by a friend. He slapped my guys upside the head, thats for sure. :) But I did it back...<br>
<br>
<br>
So thats that. I won my second straight tournament. Who would have thought that would be possible? :) T.J. asked me what packs I preferred for prize support and I said I didnt mind. Luckily he picked Realms and guess what I pull? Elrond, Herald to Gil-galad foil. Sweet card! Im usually the one that gets Despair and Wealth of Moria in packs (not even the foil versions, just the regular ones).<br>
<br>
I did some trading, got some really cool stuff off T.J. and some others (even got a Lurtz foil!), and then we all headed out.<br>
<br>
Weekend Props:<br>
-T.J. for running a great tournament, for the sweet trades, and the most-excellent prize support.<br>
-Mike and my sis for letting me crash with them.<br>
-Mike for the play-testing.<br>
-The players up north for being a really cool, relaxed, and friendly bunch.<br>
-San Francisco water, air, and pretty much everything, but especially for not being L.A. Its a beautiful city for sure. I wont ever forget the way the Golden Gate Bridge looked coming back into the city. Id even say it was worth the increased fee ($5 instead of $3).<br>
-Me for somehow managing to win my second straight tournament. :)<br>
<br>
Weekend Slops:<br>
-Drews aunt.<br>
-Trafficthere wasnt too much on the way up, but my drive back to L.A. on Monday was HORRIBLE. Plus driving alone is never fun.<br>
-Rob Nen, cuz he blew that saveand hes on my fantasy team. ERA of infinity isnt good for anyone.<br>
-Podracing.<br>
-Rats for being nocturnal.<br>
-Bubble Boy...what a cheesy movie. It had some moments, but for the most part it was horrible. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3969&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
