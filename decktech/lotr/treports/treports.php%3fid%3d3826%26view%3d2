Gamer&#8217;s Haven had posted an event for July 6th, the Saturday after the street date of the new expansion.  For first place the TD, Charles Schofield, announced he would award a whole box of the new expansion.  The entry fee was ten dollars, and there was some debate over whether or not ten bucks was worth a shot at the box, especially for some of the newer players. We took a vote before the event, and it was a majority who wanted to have the box be the award for first place, with a few packs here and there for extra prize support.  I pitched in my ten dollars to give it a run.  Among those in attendance, and among who I considered my more serious competition, were Ian Monteith, back from his hiatus in Albuquerque,  Danny Hummel, Brian Montez, and Charles the TD.  I had recently taken first place and third place in a couple events with a Ranger / Uruk-Hai deck.  Since RotEL was not legal for this event, I figured I would use the same deck that had faired so well.  This deck had beaten everyone here except Ian Monteith, so I figured I had a decent shot.  I could smell the box already.  However, as we shall soon see, my chances of touching the box would fade quickly.   <br>
<br>
GAME ONE <br>
<br>
vs Mike Minillo  Dwarves / Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
I chuckled to myself when they announced this pairing.  Mike has been playing LOTR since day one, and it took him three tournaments before he got a win under his belt.  However, he has recently become the Padawan Learner of Danny Hummel, Colorado&#8217;s number three player, and apparently his game has improved.  I figured this game would be a cake walk for me.  I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong.  Mike won the bid, and double moved to Site 3 after facing maybe one Uruk minion.  Since I don&#8217;t get the Pony to start and pull Aragorn, I am forced to draw for him.  My opening hand has all of the Ranger&#8217;s toys, but I don&#8217;t see the man himself.  Mike&#8217;s goblins get taken out with Legolas&#8217;s arrows, and I get to the sanctuary without much struggle as well.  At Site 4, I can&#8217;t get through to do too many wounds, thanks to Gimli&#8217;s Helm and a load of Strength boosters.  On my turn, still no Aragorn, and I get through a few Moria chumps, but I definitely have to stop.  Mike moves to the Bridge, and due to the lack of Shadow cards in my now choked hand, I play the Balrog from my draw deck, only to do a whole two wounds to a boosted Gimli.  On my turn, I still cannot find the SOB ( did you know Viggo Mortensen played Satan in The Prophecy ?  Check that one out, folks, Christopher Walken is a badass Archangel Gabriel ).  At any rate, the Devil doesn&#8217;t show up, and at the Bridge I face down five Goblin Doofuses and the Balrog.  Frodo ends up taking on two Runners in the first Assignment, and without any helper cards or Sting, I am sadly overwhelmed.  ( Two Goblin Runners has got to be the most embarrassing overwhelm Moria can give out ) .  Mike laughs an evil laugh an rubs in the fact that I got a screw draw.<br>
<br>
FL +1 / +1 <br>
<br>
Off to a fabulous start.  I can already feel that my chance at getting into a box tonight was falling apart. <br>
<br>
GAME TWO <br>
<br>
vs.  Michelle Holmes  Gandalf / Nazgul <br>
<br>
I have never played Michelle before, and she is apparently a newer player who has joined the League at Gamer&#8217;s Haven.  I am already in a foul mood from my bad draw in the first game, so I am less than friendly to this cheerful little girl wearing a floppy hat and a huge grin.  When we start, she wins the bid.  I am tempted to start with Aragorn after the last game&#8217;s debacle, but I still have faith in my decks ability to draw one of the three in the deck within a couple moves.  I instaed start with Arwen and Legolas.  The only problem is that I have lost the bid and I have four burdens.  ON Michelles first turn, she plays some lame Gandalf card, like The Nine Walkers, then plays Gandalf&#8217;s Staff, and moves.  I have 5 Twilight to work with.  I play some Saruman&#8217;s Ambitions to clear my hand and pass.  She presses on to Site 3, where she cancels the Skirmish against my Uruk Fighter with Gandalf&#8217;s Staff.  Great.  On my turn, I cannot get Aragorn, so I play Gwemegil and move.  I face down a Nazgul, Arwen gets nailed with a Blade Tip, and decide to move ahead to Site 3.  Ulaire Toldea shows up and assigns himself to Legolas, overwhelming the poor little Elf.  Sweet.  Michelle handles the Troop of Uruk-Hai at Hollin by again canceling the Skirmish with the G-Man&#8217;s Staff.  Arwen takes on Ulaire Lemenya at Site 4 and lives.  Michelle handles Site 5 like a champ, stealthing away from the Balrog twice ( stupid Demon from the Pits of Khazad-dum ).  This whole time, Michelle is taking the time every turn to ask for Maneuver, Archery, Regroup actions, even when it is obvious that none can  take place.  This is really getting on my nerves, and I make it known.  On my turn, Satan doesn&#8217;t show up, so I move to the Bridge with an exhausted Arwen and a Buck Nekkid Frodo.  Two Nazgul arrive at this little party.  Arwen faces hers and dies, while Frodo loks up at Ulaire Lemenya, spills his pint of ale, wets his Little Hobbit Breeches, and dies. <br>
<br>
FL +1 / +2 <br>
<br>
After the game I suck down a cigarette with the TD.  Michelle stressed me out with her detailed, slow play, and the fact that I had lost two games in a row to some players who are ranked over 200 points below me has really twisted my teats.  I go back inside and apologize to Michelle for being such a tool, and invite her to my tournaments at Hobby Town.  We talked about her playing style, and I explained that it is not necessary to ask for actions when none are possible (  like asking for Archery actions when there isn&#8217;t a single active archer on the table )  I told her to take her time and not to feel pressured from the faster players who play at my events.  With some experience, those actions will come natural, and her games will run a lot smoother.  With Karma back on my side, I get ready for the next pairing, now feeling sure that there was no chance in hell I was getting any box action this evening. <br>
<br>
GAME THREE <br>
<br>
vs.  Mark Chambers  Super Fellowship / Uruk-Hai<br>
<br>
Mark has been playing at my events for some time, and has started to improve his game.  He sat down across from me and said he was ready to lose.  I told him that with the way I was performing tonight, he was going to overwhelm me by Site 5.  We laughed and started the game.  While we were bidding, I noticed he had the Prancing Pony already set up.  I asked if it was his Site, and he shrugged and said yeah.  He laughed at his mistake, I bid zero, and let him go first.  He plays several Companions, bringing his Fellowship up to six before he even moved.  Among the unlucky chumps was the uncommon version of Boromir.  When he moved to Site 2, I overwhelm his Boromir with a Savagery and Saruman&#8217;s Abmition on a Troop of Uruk-Hai.  My Fellowship actually comes out as designed and moves to Site 3 with no opposition.  At Hollin, Mark loses his Pippen.  I am able to fend off his minions easily.  At Site 5, Mark loses his Merry.  Finally, at Site 8, I overwhelm his Aragorn with a few boosters played on Lurtz.  On the Fierce Skirmish, the only Comapnion left standing is Mark&#8217;s Frodo.  I seal the victory with the overwhelm on Mark&#8217;s Ringbearer. <br>
<br>
FW + 3 / +5 <br>
<br>
At the end of the game, I was taking some notes for this report.  Mark laughed and said I should just write that he was dumb on several occasions.  Actually, he wasn&#8217;t, I just actually got to play my Fellowship this game.  Okay, maybe showing your starting site before the bid was a little on the dumb side, but hey, I bet he won&#8217;t do it again. <br>
<br>
GAME FOUR<br>
<br>
vs.  Rodney Shuemaker  Bilbo Hobbits / Moria <br>
<br>
Rodney is apparently another newer player who has picked up League play at the Haven.  He wins the bid and goes first, playing Bilbo from his draw deck.  I take a gamble and start Legolas and Arwen instead of just Aragorn, and it pays off, because Aragorn is in my opening hand along with most of his cool stuff.  When Rodney moves his Fellowship to Site 2, after playing some Hobbit Allies, I play a Tower Assassin and promptly kill off his Party Guest.  He decides to stop, while I double through to Site 3 with no opposition, only his Moria conditionshimmerting the table.  When he does finally play a minion at Site 4, it was like playing Michelle all over again.  Rodney asked for every action in the rules, while only a few Goblins are on the table.  Huh?  At any rate, I am double moving through his Moria garbage pile, while my minions are keeping him to one move per turn.  When I get to Site 7, I ask for time remaining and I am told I have 15 minutes.  Should be plenty of time, right?  Huh-uh.  After I kill his Legolas at Site 5, Rodney is hurting for Companions.  He takes forever to play some Hobbit Allies, then finally moves.  I am at Site 7, ready to double to Site 9 for the win.  I move to his Site 8, and he takes 9 minutes to play 5 minions with scimitars, etc.  Holy crap !  I am also at the site where I take 2 Archery for every Companion over 4.  I am at 7 Companions, due to his Moria Swarm tactics, so I dole out 6 wounds. I call for time, and there is one minute left.  I assign like crazy, declaring kill after kill on his Moria scrubs, then declare I will move on.  Rodney decides he will regroup his hand first, and apparently he has to read every card, including lore.  I tell him look, I just need his Site 9, then he can play whatever he wants for however long he needs.  He finally flips it, I move, and time is called.  So, I can relax, because I can get to the regroup and have a full win as long as Frodo survives.  Rodney plays somewhere around 8 minions, two of which I kill to Archery.  Frodo sits down and smokes some Old Toby while his buddies finish off the Moria hordes. <br>
<br>
FW +3 / +8 <br>
<br>
Speaking of smoking, I really needed a smoke after that game.  There was some serious stress involved in that one.  This was turning out to be a bad day, and I wasn&#8217;t even going to get to touch the box.<br>
<br>
GAME FIVE <br>
<br>
vs. Steve Perucca  Boromir and Merry / Sauron burdening <br>
<br>
Great, after going to time, I now have to face another player who is infamous for taking a long time to play.  Steve has sped up his game though, and this one would turn out to be the most fun of the day.  Steve decides to go first after winning the bid, then attempts to double move to Site 3.  This gives me enough Twilight to kill of both his Boromir and his Merry with some boosted Uruk-Hai.  <br>
When I move to Site 3, my Legolas is exhausted from firing off arrows at Site 2, and he gets Hated on.  My Aragorn falls at Site 5, after an Enduring Evil reduced his Strength to 5, an easy overwhelm for a Morgul Hunter.  When Steve moves on to Site 6, his Frodo has taken a few burdens from Worry.  Enquea hits the table and murders his Aragorn in cold blood right there in Lothlorien.  I have moved ahead in the race, and when I get to Site 7, he uses his Enquea to murder my Arwen, leaving Frodo all alone with something like 7 Burdens.  When Steve moves to Site 7, his Fellowship is nothing but a weary Frodo, with 7 or 8 Burdens as well.  I play a Tower Assassin, exert to kill his Bounder, then overwhelm his Frodo, who is holding a Hobbit Sword instead of Sting.  <br>
<br>
FW +3 / +11 <br>
<br>
That was an incredibly close game, and I have to say that Steve has really picked up his game keeps up a good pace.  <br>
<br>
When the dust settled, Ian Monteith was in first place, and he won the box.  Then, something incredible happened.  Ian decided top share the box !  He gave a pack to everyone who showed up, then he and the Charles put out some random rares to give out as well.  I ended up getting a Mirror and Gondor Bowmen.  I traded off the Mirror to Brian Montez for a Tower of Orthanc to complete my RotEl collection.  <br>
<br>
SUPA-DUPA MAD PROPS<br>
<br>
To Ian Monteith, for sharing the box.  What a guy.<br>

<br>
To me, for losing to Mike &quot; I can&#8217;t pronounce scimitar &quot; Minillo.  <br>

To me, for not getting any box.<br>
