As this was before the Far-Seeing eyes errata, I had a deck that used lots of elves and far-seeing eyes and archery to make opponent discard their whole hand combined with a kind of sauron corruption deck. It took me forever to find the place, because of slightly confusing directions, but I ended up being the first one their. Considering that my deck was missing like 15 cards I ended up trading madly for the cards I needed before the tournament started. I got an Arwen for two Goblin Archers (SCORE), but ended up having to trade my fourth lurtz to get some sweet sauron stuff. My brother was at a swim meet and was supposed to arrive soon, but I didnt see him for a while, because the swim meet went late and he had to miss the first round. There are close to 30 people in the shop and there is a pokemon tournament being run at the same time (demon-possessed little buggers), and some other table there are these guys playing a game of Mage Knights that has like 3000 points and they start with like 40 of those little figure things. Crazy. Anyway match-ups are called and Karl Horn is the initial ring-bearer. He plays against Heidi Farinhoit. I get paired up against Derek Brooks (a rider of Rohan, I believe). <br>
<br>
Game 1: my discard cheese vs. derek brooks nassssstyyyy hobbitsesssssss .. <br>
<br>
hey he&#39;s playing hobbits and he outbids me, so he goes first. He puts out a bunch of junk, including Aragorn AND Boromir and all the hobbits. Anyways, my second site is Midgewater Moors, so I put down like 4 or 5 minions and make him discard half of his hand or so. I really beat the crap out of his nasssty hobbits and put a desperate defense of the ring or two out. I am actually feeling pretty good about this. For my fellowship first turn, I get out Galadriel, Celeborn, and Elrond and two Far-Seeing Eyes, and maybe another elf, leaving him with nothing in his hand, so I move on completely free. Then I stop because I wanted to get out MY third site, and I&#39;d given him a huge pool and I didn&#39;t want to face a full hand of minions. So he goes (by the way, he is playing painstakingly slow and pondering every assignment for a minute or two), this might have something to do with the fact that this was the first tournament so many people were not experienced. At the third site, I get out the silinde combo with the site that lets you draw a card, so I&#39;m drawing 2 cards every time I play an elf and I get out a bunch of junk and then I stop at the fifth site, where he puts down a couple of minions that my archery takes complete care of. I am staying almost right with him this whole time, but unfortunately behind him. It&#39;s like 8 minutes until time is up and he moves on from site five. I get all four desperate defense of the Ring, plus thin and stretched out. One nassty hobbit has already died to an enduring evil and I&#39;m holding one in my hand for frodo. He has four burdens (I have three) and he exerts sam three times to remove three. He moves on, and I put out four or five orcs fast. He has like four cards in hand, so at the least he will add three burdens, but he DOES NOT MAKE ANY ASSIGNMENTS. Time is called and it&#39;s hands down so he never adds burdens for the assignments that he HAD to make but was being so slow about. So he cheesily wins by being a site ahead even though I have mad minions on the table and he still needed to add burdens. ARGH!! Needless to say, I was not bitter in the slightest, just slightly peeved. <br>
<br>
TL +1 <br>
<br>
The ringbearer gets a timed win and keeps the ring, so he is at +2. <br>
<br>
Game 2: my stupid deck vs. sandy wible&#39;s super rangers and uruk-hai <br>
<br>
hey cool I get to play sandy wible of decipher semi-fame. he has a really nifty beard/ goatee/ whatever. anyways . . . he outbids me by much and starts with aragorn, king in exile and the north road. aragorn gets his bow fairly quickly, then he gets out boromir and arwen, and by the fifth site, ALL THREE of them have no stranger to the shadows. I am in serious twilight denial, but I end up just putting one or two minions down to get out desperate defense of the ring, just so he has to add burdens, most of these are wiped out by Aragorn&#39;s bow or the blade of gondor. but I am getting ahead of myself. anyways, I get a HORRIBLE draw for my fellowship and I am really only getting the puniest of the archers, no far-seeing eyes, nothing. he gets out lots of uruk-hai and uses spies of saruman to beat the crap out of my archers, fortunately I have lots of companions so I can sacrifice lorien elves to the uruk-hai. I am moving ultra-slow, I am at around site six and he is at eight. He moves on to nine, and my ninth site lets my draw six cards, so I have 14 cards in hand and I put down like 5 orcs and he gets one to every character, but one is on frodo and he has to add two burdens from desperate defense of the ring. Frodo gets assigned and I play, guess what . . . Enduring Evil. Frodo is power zero, double that = zero, triple that = zero, he&#39;s overwhelmed and I win the game. FW +3 <br>
<br>
+4 <br>
<br>
The ringbearer gets another timed win, keeping the ring, so he is at +4, this means I have a chance of facing him, but . . . I don&#39;t. <br>
<br>
Game 3: me vs. Dan Bojanowski, decksimilartosandywiblesexceptwithsauron <br>
<br>
This is a horrible game for me, really. Because I lost. Dan has two under the watching eye and two orc bowmen in his deck. He gets all of this out before I get to the third site. Which means . . . I&#39;m taking 4 hits a turn. Ouch. My characters do not live long taking this kind of beating, also my draws were similar to last game (= very bad). Dan&#39;s shadow deck is better than Sandy&#39;s was, I&#39;m not winning any skirmishes, and I don&#39;t think I can pull a win out of my hat here. The real problem with this game was not my FP, but my shadow. Why? My minions were stacked at the bottom of the deck. He got to move completely free from site three to site five because I drew absolutely no minions. This of course, completely screwed me over for both fellowship AND shadow, first off because I can&#39;t take cards out of his hand, second because I can&#39;t cycle cards out of my own. My characters die slowly and painfully. Every time he plays an orc inquisitor, he discards an orc inquisitor out of my hand. Three times he does this. What are the chances of that? (1 in 256 actually, but you knew that). So anyway he is at the eight site and I am at the seventh with only frodo left and he decides to stop . . . hmm, good idea. So I move on with just frodo and he puts out orc scouting bands, an orc assassin, and an orc soldier, I play 2x power according to stature, killing them, then I move on and he plays three orc war bands and I play 2 more power according to stature killing them and winning the game. HAHA JUST KIDDING!!! No one does that kind of crap! FRODO was crushed and mangled and I lost! HAHAHA!!! <br>
<br>
FL +1 <br>
+5 <br>
<br>
Ok ringbearer loses this time, a timed loss (seeing a pattern?) to derek brooks the guy with the nasssty hobbitssessssss . . . and I get matched up against Heidi Farinhoit. <br>
<br>
Game 4 me vs. Heidi Farinhoit Moria identical to William Diniegas (lots of cave troll) with Elf archery stuff. <br>
<br>
Ok this is funny cause we start exactly the same stuff, legolas and arwen. Anyway she outbids me, and she is playing some wacky deck with like saga of elendil and splendor of their banners and all this stuff, but the archery never really does a whole lot to my minions, cause they have pretty good vitality. She does kill a few with the aimed shots from legolas and rumil though. Anyway sauron orcs hurt a lot and she doesn&#39;t really have any anti-condition so I get a lot of desperate defense of the ring out, and she loses lots of good cards from hand. For fellowship I get the whole thing set up with eventually all four far-seeing eyes. At site 3 I get the silinde set up and put out tons of elves and make her discard her whole hand, giving her a massive twilight pool, then I move on, she puts out like one orc that gets shot full of holes, and that was the ONLY minion I saw the WHOLE game. I actually moved ahead of her in here. Anyway she moves on, I kill some companions with Enduring Evil, her archery total is up to four now but my minions are absorbing it. When she moves to the sixth site she has just legolas, another elf, and frodo left and I end up stacking two minions on frodo and then playing an enduring evil to make him strength zero and win the game. <br>
<br>

This time Derek loses, and the ring goes on to someone else, I&#39;m not sure who. IN the fifth and final game, this new ringbearer loses to Sandy Wible who takes the ring. Sandy, being a Decipher employee hands the ring off to the first place winner, William Diniega (The One Spoon). And since I am fated always to play my brother, I do. <br>

I really can&#39;t remember this game very well. The reason is this, WE HAVE PLAYED IT ABOUT A MILLION TIMES!! I hate that. Anyway here is what ususally happens, I set up my engine perfectly making him discard his whole hand every turn and pissing him off and he has no fun. This is why the errattaed far-seeing eyes. This is why I believe that was a necessary and appropriate errata. Props to Decipher, I just wish they had caught it before the game came out. Anyways, I really can&#39;t remember the game, but I kill companions one by one with enduring evil, even though he bids zero. Frodo bites the dust to EE around site six. Ok that&#39;s it for now. PEACE OUT. If you want to read where I learned how to play this game better go look at my other TR, how to win in three minutes. <br>
