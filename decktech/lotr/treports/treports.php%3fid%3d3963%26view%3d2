<br>
-8/13, Clarks Trading, Santa Rosa CA:  4-0, 1st Place (Archery/Moria Swarm)<br>
  There was some good competition, but I pretty much smashed everything.<br>
-8/17, Clarks Trading, Santa Rosa CA:  3-1, 2nd Place (Big Trust/Uruk beatdown)<br>
  I lost to my friend Mason in round 1 (I think he was rated 1765 to my 1760 at that point), then finished with 3 wins.  3-way tie for 1st, and I got 2nd by strength of schedule.<br>
-8/24, Clarks Trading, Santa Rosa CA:  4-0, 1st Place (Archery+Choke/Nazgul)<br>
  My deck was untouchable that day, 2 fellowship wins and 2 shadow wins because my opponent had to make stupid double-moves to keep up.<br>
<br>
OK, now that thats done, on to the most recent tourney.  Weve had pretty poor turnout recently (normally exactly 8 players, but always a different 8), but Lisa Gansky was going to be up here from Los Angeles and a few players who hadnt come for a while said theyd be there, so I was optimistic.  Well, 15 minutes before the tourney was supposed to start, we had 3 players (me, Drew, and Mason, my local rival), so things were not looking good.  10 minutes later, we were up to 11, as some more of our locals showed up, and Lisa showed up with Mike Mendoza, who she picked up from San Francisco on her way.  Well, since weve now got an odd number, Im not going to be playing, so I let one of the newer players use the deck I was going to play that day (crazy Horn/Uruk beats) and starting lending out cards to the other players who didnt have what they needed (I must have given out 20 or 30 rares, most of them from my extra decks).  So, we start round 1, and Lisa and Mike (along with Mason and I, they are clearly the best players there) get paired up with the 2 worst players at the tourney, and I feel horrible that they came all this way and had to do that (Lisas opponent, for example, has this problem of playing very slowly and staring off into space during a game, and has even been known to get so lost that he falls out of his chairgood stuff, but not the most enjoyable opponent).  Well, the round is almost over (most games are at site 7 except for Lisas game, which is somewhere around 4 or 5, so shes begging me not to let the game time out), and another player shows up.  Meaning I now need to play to make the numbers even.  And somebody else is using my deck.  And all my other decks are missing cards.  So, I scramble madly to fill the holes in my most-intact deck by taking cards from my other decks, and try to play really quickly so we finish in time for round 2.  I ended up going with my Gondor DenialTrust/Nazgul deck, starts Frodo OBH and Gandalf TGW, who can exert to play Aragorn RotN and Boromir DoMT for 2 and 1 twilight, respectively, then shifts into full Trust mode.<br>
<br>
GAME 1:  Me vs. Johns Elves/Nazgul (unsure of his rating)<br>
Most of the games are now at site 8 (although Lisas game is now at the Bridge, again, sorry you had to play him, Lisa), so I figure Im just going to double-move every turn no matter what so the game will end quickly no matter what the outcome.  He bids 2 to my 0, goes first, starts Arwen Elven Rider and Greenleaf, adds a burden to get Aragorn with the Pony, and moves to 2 (Bree Streets).  Gates, Enquea, Twilight Nelya, spot 2 burdens, 3 wounds to Aragorn, 1 to Legolas, and 2 to Arwen.  My turn, I drop Trust, Aragorn, Brand, Sword, move, he plays a couple scrubby Nazgul, Gandalf takes a wound and Aragorn kills one, then kills the other in the fierce, I move again to the Ford, he drops a pair of Blade Tips, His Terrible Servants, and another Nazgul, Aragorn beats it down.  His turn, he plays Haldir and moves, I drop Toldea and Attea, Arwen and Haldir die in the first skirmish, then Aragorn dies and Lego takes another wound in the fierce fight.  I Sleep, drop Boromir and Sam PP, move to 4 (Eregion Hills, which I hoped he was playing), Aragorn kills the Nazgul that shows up, I move to the Bridge, same as site 2, 2 Nazgul, Boromir loses to one, Aragorn kills one, then Aragorn kills the second one in the fierce fight.  His turn, he moves to 4, now at 4 burdens, I just drew into another Toldea (2 in my hand now), Lego dies in the first fight and Frodo goes down in the fierce.<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Props<br>
-Very quick game, we ALMOST finished before a certain other game did<br>
-My Nazgul, for being beasts<br>
-Aragorn, for being a Nazgul-killing machine<br>
Slops<br>
-I feel bad for beating John down so hard<br>
<br>
Mason, Mike, and Lisa all won their games, as did Frank (our #3 local player) and Trask (a newer player who Ive been helping with his deck, its solid but hes still learning the game), so there should be some heavy competition in the 2nd round.  Pairings come up, its Mike and Trask, Lisa and Frank, and me and Mason.  I always seem to play Mason in round 2 in most tournaments, and its pretty much back-and-forth as far as who wins.<br>
<br>
GAME 2: me vs Mason Gilligans Trust/Uruks  (1777 with 3-1 not entered)<br>
He bids 4 and goes first.  He starts Boromir DoMT and Pippin HoSI to remove a burden, then gets Sam with Green Dragon Inn to remove the rest of his burdens.  He plays Aragorn with a sword and brand, then moves.  I play Enquea and Attea and have 1 left for Attea, so he gives 3 wounds to Enquea with Aragorn and Boromir takes 1, then Enquea dies and Sam dies.  My turn, I drop Aragorn with  a Brand and Boromir, then move.  He plays a Troop and a fistful of pumps to overwhelm Aragorn at site 2.  Crap.  He plays Legolas PoM and moves, Toldea comes down with a sword and is joined by Enquea.  Legolas takes 2 wounds and a Blade Tip and Aragorn kills Enquea in the fierce skirmish.  I play the Blade of Gondor and Betrayal of Isengard and move to the Ford, he plays an Uruk that gives Boromir a pair of wounds.  He heals up, Lego takes a wound, he plays the Blade of Gondor on Boromir, and moves to Eregion Hills.  I can only get one Nazgul down and it would get beat down by Aragorn, so I pass, meaning that if he doubles there will be more than Aragorn can handle, so he stops with my fellowship looking a little battered without Aragorn.  I heal, exert Gandalf to play Suicide Sam free, play Armor on Boromir, then play Sting on Frodo and some equipment on Gandalf, Sting his hand to check for pumps, play Trust, then move to 4, he drops an Uruk and Boromir takes a wound.  Legolas takes a wound from the tip, then he plays Filibert Bolger and moves to the Bridge looking very solid against my Nazgul, so I play The Balrog, Durins Bane instead, along with a Black Breath.  Aragorn and Boromir take a pair of wounds each, he was double-moving into 6 and apparently wanted to save the hobbits vitality for Filibert there.  He moves again, I play a pair of Nazgul, Aragorn kills one (but gets a Breath) and the other kills Pippin, then dies to Aragorn in the fierce skirmish.  On my turn, I Sting his hand, heal Boromir, and move to the Bridge, where I am met by a few Uruks.  One of them exerts for Sarumans Power to discard my Trust, so I make Sam defender+1 and assign the two biggest Uruks to him, assign the third one to Boromir, Sam dies and Boromir takes a wound.  Mason heals everyone (except Aragorn, he still has the two wounds from the Balrog), then Legolas gets Tipped, he drops Gandalf with Trust and his Staff, Flaming Brand on Boromir, then moves to Anduin Confluence, goodbye Filibert.  At this point his fellowship is looking great, but since Im holding 2x Too Great and Terrible, its OK, I just need to get a wound on Gandalf and then hes gone in the next maneuver phase.  So, I drop Attea and the Witch-King with some leftover pool.  He puts the King on Boromir, Attea on Aragorn, I remove one to make Attea strength 13, he exerts for Trust, I remove 3 more to tie at 16, he exerts again for Trust, Attea dies (but Gandalf now has 2 wounds, which is huge), Boromir takes two wounds from the King and he stops.  My turn, I just move into 6, one Uruk comes down, Gandalf takes a pair.  His turn, Legolas gets tipped, he heals Gandalf with an extra copy (4 vitality left, still good), heals Boromir once, then moves.  I flip over my site 8, Shores of Nen Hithoelexcept its the Gates of Argonath.  I left the wrong site 8 in there.  Oh well, maybe at site 9so I drop Attea and the King with a Breath and Tip, Aragorn kills Attea and the King kills Legolas, then Boromir gets tipped and breathed in the fierce.  He knows that if he stops Boromir is done, and hes at a strength 12 against Nazgul, so he moves again.  I draw up, drop Attea and Cantea.  Hes still looking OK, Frodo shouldnt have to fight, and if he does theres always Trust.  Then I ask if hes got a maneuver and he kinda looks at me funny, says no, and I drop a Too Great and Terrible, gandalf now has 3 wounds (5 vitality), so hes like, fine, he can still take a Nazgul twice.  Then I drop another one, and hes like, gosh darnit, I lose.  Pretty much, Mason, pretty much.  So, he can either have Aragorn be defender +1 and die with Boromir and have Frodo die to 3 Nazgul in the fierce, or he can have Aragorn win, Boromir die, and Frodo die in the first skirmish.  So, of course, Aragorn takes on two and goes out in a blaze of glory, then Frodo gets severely overwhelmed in the fierce.<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Props<br>
-Mason for a tough game<br>
-Too Great and Terrible for being huge<br>
Slops<br>
-Aragorn for getting overwhelmed at site 2<br>
-Me, for not having the right site 8<br>
<br>
OK, so now the undefeated players are Mike, Lisa, and me, which is not altogether unexpected.  So, two of us are playingyep, me and Mike.  He said he came to the tourney just to play me (and was very unhappy when I wasnt going to play because of the odd number of players), so now he gets his chance.  <br>
<br>
GAME 3: Me vs Mike Mendozas Gandalf/Gondor/Nazgul (1873)<br>
Well, Im definitely looking forward to playing Mike, hes a great player.  The only thing is, he hasnt played for a while (not since the NorCal Territorial, which he won), and Ive been having him check out my decks before tourneys, including the deck Im playing right now, so he had the decklist a few days before the tourney, which makes things a lot more interesting since he knows exactly what Im playing (not that it would matter in this game).  Anyway, he bids one and starts Gandalf TGP, goes first (East Road), and drops Aragorn and Sam as well as some equipment on Aragorn and Gandalf.  He Glamdrings my hand and sees some nice fellowship cards, but only 2 shadow- Attea and a Morgul Gates.  So, he moves, I Gates in Attea, Gandalf takes him twice and he stops.  My turn, I play Glamdring, use it, see some Nazgul, then do the most stupid thing possible: I exert Gandalf twice to play Aragorn and Boromir for 2 each (their normal cost, with East Road).  I did this because thats how my deck is supposed to work, and since I was playing a good opponent I of course had to be a scrub and give Gandalf some extra wounds after seeing that I would still be giving him more pool than he could use.  Really, can you blame me?  Thats what my deck is meant to do, and I was so intent on doing what my deck is supposed to do that I didnt really think about what I was doing.  So, I then play Gandalfs Staff, Blade of Gondor, and Aragorns Bow, then move.  Down come Twilight Otsea, Cantea, and some other fierce Nazgul, along with 2 Blade Tips and a Black Breath.  Painful, but not deadlyexcept that Gandalf only has 2 vitality left after my stupid fellowship phase decisions.  Long story short, Aragorn takes two wounds and loses the Bow, Boromir takes 2 wounds, a Tip, and a Breath, and Gandalf takes a wound and a Tip.  Moving again would end the game, so I stop.  He moves to 3, I drop a Nazgul, grin at him and say, Maneuver actions?  Hes like, dude, do you have it in your hand?  Nope, just screwing with you, Mike.  Hehe, Aragorn takes a pair and he stops.  My turn, Boromir and Gandalf die to their Blade Tips.  Great.  Oh look, I just drew Trust Me As You Once did.  A bit late, huh?  Oh well, I move to 2, Twilight Otsea comes down again, and Aragorn takes another wound, as well as the Tip and Breath he just played.  Wonderful, thats game.  At this point Mike and I are both busting up laughing because its so hilarious how bad I just scrubbed out, and neither of us can believe it.  He plays some equipment and moves to site 4, I play a Breath and Attea.  I say, Maneuver?  He just kinda grins at me, and then Too Great and Terrible comes down.  He just laughs and discards Gandalfs Staff and Intimidate (wtf?  Who plays that?  lol, just kidding Mike, Im loving the Intimidate tech, I did that too when I played the Aragorn-signet Gandalf deck).  Theres enough pool left to overwhelm Aragorn, so Gandalf takes a pair of wounds and a Breath.  On my turn, Aragorn dies and I move to 4, not enough pool for a Nazgul, so I stop.  He gets some gear on Aragorn and I think plays Boromir with some stuff, then moves, I drop a pair of Nazgul, Boromir takes a pair and Aragorn wins his fights.  My turn, Im like, yeah, Im done.  But wait!  Suicide Sam has just made an appearance!  Like it matters.  I move to the Bridge, down come Otsea and Cantea (both of them overwhelm both hobbits), so I know its over.  But, Sam goes defender +1 anyway just so it looks like he did something, then Frodo dies in the fierce.  Oh well, what can ya do.<br>
FL +1/+7<br>
Props<br>
-Mike, for being a beast<br>
-Sam, for dying like a man (hobbit?)<br>
Slops<br>
-Gandalf and Boromir, for dying at site 2<br>
-me, for being the reason they died at site 2, hehe<br>
-Intimidate, for being janky tech against my anti-Gandalf package<br>
Well, so much for another 1st-place finish, that ends my latest winning streak at 9 games.  Lisa won again, so its between her and Mike for first place (at least Im not gonna get beat by another local player), and Im paired up with Ben Kantor for the last round.  Ben hasnt been playing Rings for very long (a month or two), but hes an old-school Star Wars player, so he knows whats up, and usually finishes 2nd or 3rd to me and Mason.  He played my Hobbit/Sauron deck in his first tourney, but hes now evolved to consistently playing an Uruk shadow, so I know thats coming, the only question is his fellowship, it had been hobbits and shifting toward Gondor, but after Mason and I beat everyone down with Trust a few tourneys ago, everyone seems to be going that way here (friggin lemmingsthats why I never play the same deck two weeks in a row, everybody seems to try to do whatever Mason or I did the week before).<br>
<br>
GAME 4: Me vs Ben Kantors Trust/Uruks (1614 with I think 6-2 not in)<br>
He bids 1, debates for a while, then chooses to go first even though he heard I was playing Nazgul.  He starts Gimli SoG and Lego PoM, and the early game is pretty uneventful, he gets some gear down on Lego and the Axe on Gimli and gets to 3 with no harm done except a Tip on Legolas, and I make it to 3 with a couple wounds on Aragorn and Boromir from some Uruks.  He moves to Eregion Hills and gets a burden, but Im 1 twilight short of playing a minion, and he stops there.  I get some more stuff down (now have Blade and Brand on Boromir, Bow on Aragorn, Armor on both men, Trust, Glamdring and Staff, looking solid) and move, he drops a pair of Uruks, uses Sarumans Power to dump my Trust and No Strangers, Aragorn takes a wound and Boromir kills his Uruk.  Im confident in my shadow and content to stay right behind Ben, plus Ive got a little surprise for him, so I stop.  Legolas gets Tipped (now exhausted), and he moves to the Bridge, enough pool to play 1 Nazgul, Gimli can handle it, right?  Nope, Balrog bomb, baby.  He just grimaces, stares at the common Balrog for a few seconds, then goes, Yeah, that kills them both.  Thats the idea, Ben, thats the idea.  So, I play Sam PP and Sting and move to 5, he gets down 4 Uruks.  I know he has a Savagery, but I can handle it, and wanted to get Sam out of my hand to set up some Nazgul beats for him.  So, one of the Uruks takes an archery wound from Aragorns Bow, Sam double-exerts and takes on the two biggest Uruks, Boromir takes one, and Frodo takes the wounded one.  Sam dies (it seems to be his fate to die senselessly at the Bridge today), Frodo kills his Uruk with PATHS, Boromir kills his Uruk, then the fierce Uruk gives him a wound.  His lone Frodo moves to 6, not enough pool, but Im content to set up another surprise for him, so I just play a Tip and a Breath and discard a Nazgul.  I move to 6, 2 Uruks, Aragorn and Boromir each take a wound.  His turn, hes looking very happy as he drops Gandalf FotS with Staff to go with the Trust on the table and is holding 3 Servants.  Hehe, its not your day, Ben.  He moves to site 7, I drop the Witch-King.  I ask if hes got a maneuver, he says no, so I play a Too Great and Terrible.  He discards a Servant and an extra Trust, then goes to assign Gandalf to the King.  Uh-uh, Ben, heres another Too Great and Terrible for you.  Hes like, great, now Gandalf will be exhausted after he loses twice.  Sorry, Ben, wrong again.  You seemed to like those two, so heres another one.  He thinks about it, sees that if he doesnt discard the Servants, Gandalf will be exhausted and die in the first fight (and since Frodos at a strength 4, even 2 Servants wont let him fight the King), then Frodo will die in the fierce.  And if he does discard the Servants, Gandalf will have enough vitality left, but at strength 7 hes overwhelmed (and since I killed 2 of his 3 Gandalf signet characters for Trust, the 3rd being Aragorn, who hasnt showed up yet, there will be no pumping Gandalf).  So, Gandalf takes the two wounds from TGAT, dies, and then the King finishes Frodo off in the fierce.<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
<br>
3-1, not bad considering how hardcore I scrubbed out against Mike.  In the game for first place, Lisa beat Mike (apparently they were both down to just Frodo by site 5, and it was his fellowship turn first), meaning she has gone from never winning a tourney to going a combined 8-0 to win her last two, mad props for that.  Mason, Mike, and I tie for 2nd, and I end up taking 3rd by strength of schedule (John, who I played round 1, ended up going 0-4, so that killed my SoS).  Well, Lisas an Elrond-collecting fanatic, and I had picked up a foil Herald to Gil-Galad a few weeks earlier that she wanted to trade for, but I told her wed open our prize packs first, then trade.  She said she didnt care if she got Realms or Fellowship, so I picked some Realms packs for her.  First pack, crap.  Second pack, Aragorn HttWC, nice.  Third pack, FOIL ELROND HTGG!  Oh yeah, that made her day, and meant I got to keep mine, very nice.  So, there was some massive trading afterwards, I think I picked up around 30 foil sites, then everybody headed out.  Well, thats all for my tournament report, be sure to check out my TR coming next week, and following that will be several TRs for the LotR ENDURO Im running in Santa Rosa on the 13th/14th, it should be lots of fun, weve currently got I think 8 of CAs top 25 (Top 20 after our ratings update) signed up to come, so that should be tons of fun.  Speaking of that, there are still several spots open, so if youre interested in playing in an Enduro in Northern California in a couple weeks, let me know (jedimasterzeke@yahoo.com). <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3963&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
