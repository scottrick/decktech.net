I tagged along with a few friends, hoping to better my rating, and the $4 entry fee means I get to save 50 cents off a booster pack, and I&#39;m a cheapskate. Good turn-out, estimate almost 30. LotR tournaments are still a rarity here so every tournament is an important event.<br>
<br>
Unlike last time when I entered with a 1-week-old deck, my deck is completed, with all the rares I need. I&#39;m playing Ranger/Hobbit/Twilight Denial and for shadow, those cute Uruk-Hai. I have tailored the shadow half for anti-archery hate, utilising Spies, high-vitality and low-cost minions. The fellowship side is more metaed against Moria, with Nazgul being my prime concern. Playing no elves so that I can p*** those Moria Scouts off. Borrowed a couple of Power According to His Stature from my friend (and a foil too, that bastard) and replaced the Hobbit Intuitions in deck with them. And after realising that I&#39;m going to lose all skirmishes against Nazgul, I trade for a Merry rare to replace the common version, and with Farmer easterlinggot around, I&#39;m set.<br>
<br>
Worthy Mention: In a warm-up game, I pulled off a Saruman&#39;s Power against an exhausted Aragorn + Saga of Elendil and exhausted Legolas + Tale of Gil-Galad. WOOHOO!<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: vs Gene Wong, Gandalf<br>
Pipeweed/Moria Swarm<br>
<br>
Argh, really nervous here. I see his deck-size and immediately know he plays Moria and the Longbottom Leaf that drops out while he shuffles allows me to fathom what deck he is playing. With this in mind, I bid high: 4, though he bids higher: 6 and starts the Shire Look-Out Point. Thankfully, I have noticed a lot of people recently not starting the Prancing Pony and have included 3 Aragorns in deck.<br>
<br>
After Gandalf&#39;s Cart and all the stacking, he stops at Site 2 after I impeded him with a minion. Then my turn, a Bounder and I move, then I made the stupidest mistake of my life.<br>
<br>
He played a Goblin Runner and Goblin Backstabber. Me, being the smarty-pants I am, assigned Boromir to Backstabber and let HIM assign the Runner. I thought I was safe. If he assigned it to Frodo or Merry R, Stealth, if he assigned to Boromir, Merry pumping would kill both minions.<br>
<br>
Or would he? It all came down to simple maths. Maybe it was nervousness or plain carelessness. He assigned the Runner against Boromir, 10-7, then...MERRY IS ONLY 3 strength? Oh wait a minute, 7+3=5+5, huh?<br>
<br>
Boromir dies first turn and I&#39;m left with Frodo and Merry.<br>
<br>
His turn, and he plays Greenleaf while I am still reeling in shock. A couple of Old Tobys and he moves to Site 3. He gives me 6 twilight. I draw the only Enquea in my deck. He has 6 burdens. What am I to do? Legolas dies at the sanctuary and sigh, it&#39;s my fellowship phase.<br>
<br>
Luckily, Bounder and Hobbit Stealth keep me surviving for much longer than I thought I would, and I take it 1 site a turn. He meanwhile finds himself in trouble. He plays Aragorn before going underground onto the Bridge and comes out with Gandalf dead and Aragorn with 2 wounds. I try to twilight-choke him on my side with my ultra-small fellowship but draw Aragorn right before entering the Bridge and using Sting, shrink the twilight pool to nothingness. Fortunately, he didn&#39;t and would never get out all the Moria conditions trickery (Armory, Swarms, They are Coming etc) and the 3 minions I fight, 2 are PATHed away. On his turn, he moves to Site 6, I played 2 cheap STR 8 minions for the victory.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Props: Making a comeback and surviving after that horrific mistake<br>
Slops: THAT HORRIFIC MISTAKE! Had me in a stasis for a while<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: vs Loh Mun Kit, Arwen/Legolas<br>
Strength of Spirit Archery/Nazgul<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 2 and starts the Pony. Uses a lot of twilight and stops at Site 2. I get Aragorn&#39;s Bow out first turn and Thror&#39;s Map (invaluable to get it out early against Nazgul) and move, the obscene amount of twilight I gave him allowing 2 roaming Nazgul (Ostea and Witch-King I believe) to charge out. Trollshaw Forest, hmm...Versatility. Screw the Ford, I use Map to get out Rivendell Waterfall and move, but he still managed to get a Nazgul down. Black Breath at Site 3 is vicious, Boromir was left exhausted and smelly. I had Athelas out but I would skip the Aragorn and sanctuary-healing process.<br>
<br>
I emerge from underground first, using some clever Merry manipulation and Damage +1 trickery to emerge with minimal wounds and avoid fierce skirmishes. He went underground with quite a few wounds and minus Sam. A timely Saruman&#39;s Power discarded Tale of Gil-Galad, Last Alliance and No Stranger. I pounce at the Bridge. Three minions with Spies of Saruman, I think. A Double-Savagery to Match Their Numbers and Aragorn, Legolas, Arwen and Gandalf are all killed in one fell swoop, leaving Frodo alone alive.<br>
<br>
On his next turn, he lays down Boromir R + Blade, and moves. In the nick of time, he needn&#39;t exert for Silverlode Banks ;) ARV-PATHS keeps him going. On his next turn, he puts down Elrond and I smile inwardly as ge moves to Silverlode. You just don&#39;t give that kind of free twilight out with just 2 companions. He moves and I put down 3 minions. ARV and he assigns both exhausted minions to each, leaving me one to assign. I realise that using him to hit Boromir would not work as he could just exert for Blade to kill my exhausted minion and resolve to win the skirmish, so I assign the minion to Frodo. He doesn&#39;t play anything and Frodo is overwhelmed 6-16.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Props: Uruk-Hai slaughter at its finest<br>
Slops: none<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: vs Gabriel Kang, Arwen/Legolas<br>
Strength of Spirit Archery/Nazgul<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 2 and starts the Pony. He stops at Site 2. Sting is out first turn and I find him playing Nazgul, allowing me to tailor my game-plan and look for hotspot Nazgul cards like All Blades Perish and Relentless Charge. I again get Thror&#39;s Map out first turn and double-move and once again avoid the Ford for Rivendell Waterfall. ARV the minion and instead of shooting him with normal archery, I exert Aragorn for the Bow, he smiles disappointedly at that piece of play and plays All Blades Perish - I saw it earlier in his hand from Sting and normal archery would have meant me skirmishing that minion so phew. Aragorn exerts twice and I stop, with a Breathed but full-health Boromir.<br>
<br>
We go underground and both of us find ourselves in trouble. I am forced to exert Aragorn twice for archery in Site 4 and through Sting, find out he has 2 Relentless Charges as he chuckles, but I have the last laugh playing Saga of Elendil right there. Face the Witch-King and Ostea in the Bridge, and after 3 exertions, he hesitates long before placing the normal archery wound on Ostea, exhausting it instead of the Witch-King (dang, nearly got the King with PATHS). With Mr. Witchie and 2 Blade Tips in his support area, it&#39;s time for one of my companions to go, and with Boromir still Breathed and my Athelas buried somewhere in the bottom of my deck, Boromir bites the dust in the fierce skirmish.<br>
<br>
He double-moved into the Bridge to overtake me and faced 3 minions. I make a mistake and Savagery the Uruk Fighter facing Arwen (Fighter&#39;s already fierce), 12-8, he Servants and discards virtually his whole hand to prevent the Fighter running rampant. He emerges with wounds.<br>
<br>
Slowly though, I lose my grasp as Pippin goes to the dead pile soon after and because I exerted Sam one too many times, he too goes there after dying on the fierce skirmish against  Cantea. We are both at Site 7 and his turn, I draw ARV and contemplate the chances of me charging into Site 8 with guns (bow) a-blazing and run to site 9, sacrificing Aragorn and Merry since there is no way anybody can get down 3 Nazgul against me. First, I have to stop him from getting there first. He looks at my hand with Glamdring and realises I only have Lurtz and Troop in hand. He moves to Site 8, ARVs both of them, and moves to the Slopes of Amon Hen with me having a minion-less hand. On hindsight, I could not have won either if I cautioned against the ARV and kept the minions in hand and played them on site 9 as there were no more minions left in my draw deck.<br>
<br>
FL +1/+7<br>
Props: Best game I ever played, and as he remarked, best game he had that day so far. Had the archery phase skipped A LOT of times<br>
Slops: Loss...<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4: vs Samuel Chua, Arwen/Legolas<br>
Strength of Spirit Archery/Sauron-Nazgul Direct Damage<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 2 and starts the Pony (notice any pattern here?). He draws Thror&#39;s Map on his first turn and gets Weatherhills and Ford in play. Stops at Site 2 after I bring out 2 or 3 minions. I draw Sting first turn and this proves vital, allowing me to choke him, limiting him to 1 minion a turn until the Bridge and after that, 2 minions a turn. Pretty boring game until Site 4. He gave me 10 twilight, and I wanted someone big to exhaust the archers or cause some wounds before he moved into Site 5 where I could catch him with my non-roaming Uruk-Hai. Troop of Uruk-Hai for 7...3 for Rampage, perfect. He chooses not to gun down my Troop and takes 2 wounds each on Gandalf and Aragorn. He moves into Site 5 and despite not playing anything, I unleash hell, playing 3 minions and Spies, and Savagery one of them. Gandalf gets killed while Aragorn and Arwen get overwhelmed, leaving Frodo with a sole Aragorn escort. He reaches the sanctuary licking his wounds and plays Boromir, Sam and Tharin before leaving (what?!). Sam and Tharin die at the Silverlode. I double-move from Site 6 to 8 to keep the pressure on him. His turn, he moves into Anduin Banks and I play 2 Shamans, blocked by Boromir and Frodo. Boromir dies. Frodo is saved from the overwhelm by Bounder and with Isildur&#39;s Bane, racks up a total of 7 burdens and 4 wounds (could have made it 9 burdens with Battle Cry but forgot). He wisely decides not to move again, as the 2 Shamans would follow and even if Frodo doesn&#39;t get overwhelmed, he&#39;ll get killed or (hehe) corrupted.<br>
<br>
My turn, I move and lose all my companions to Watching Eye/Bowmen/Hate etc except Frodo. I didn&#39;t care, just made sure Aragorn&#39;s Bow got the only 3-vitality minion down to 2. I could&#39;ve saved a companion or two if I really thinked but I didn&#39;t care. 2 PATHS in hand, there was no way he could kill me.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
<br>
Props: Power According To His Stature FOIL to wrap the tournament. Sweet ;)<br>
Slops: Missing out on corrupting Frodo. Messing up the whole last turn.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I finish with 3-1, cool, and considering the guy I lost to went 4-0 (3 people went 4-0), there should be quite a rating boost. I should finish anywhere from 4th to 8th. I receive a booster pack for participation and pull...ugh, The Nine Walkers, and get some deck protectors in the lucky draw. Hate how everybody regardless of record gets 1 booster pack, my friends who went 2-2 were pulling all the Gandalfs, Greenleafs and Arwens. <br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Getting 3-1 and bragging rights among my group of players since they all went 2-2.<br>
-A couple of days ago, my shadow was total crap. The addition of cheap minions like Fighter, Warrior and Shaman gave it a new lease of life.<br>
-P***ing off all Moria and archery decks<br>
-Who cares if Moria has numbers to match their savagery, who cares if Nazgul have bad breath, who cares if Sauron sucks, I have SAVAGERY TO MATCH THEIR NUMBERS! ROAR!<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-THAT HORRIFIC MISTAKE!<br>
-Um...Nine Walkers?<br>
-Um...deck protectors?<br>
-Didn&#39;t kill anybody with Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry. Ambition + Battle Cry is lethal but (un)fortunately, I didn&#39;t need Battle Cry to kill on this occasion ;)<br>
<br>
And as always, I&#39;ll feature Mr. Idiot of the Tournament. This guy was playing my friend. The game was heavily overtime but since there was a dinner break, the games were allowed to continue.<br>
<br>
Friend: So you only have 3 Hobbits for companions now and move to Site 9?<br>
Idiot: Um......yyyyyeeesssss<br>
Friend: Okay...that&#39;s XX twilight for me...<br>
Idiot: Hey Judge, this game is time-out already, right?<br>
Judge: Huh...um...<br>
Idiot: I was ahead of him in the adventure path when you checked when time ran out, so I&#39;ve already won, right?<br>
Judge: Um...I thought I let the game continue...<br>
Idiot: So it&#39;s time-out. Can you just record that I&#39;ve won already?<br>
Judge: Okay.<br>
Friend: Ahem...<br>
<br>
Until the next tournament, I&#39;m off and rest assured I&#39;ll be bragging till then. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3385&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
