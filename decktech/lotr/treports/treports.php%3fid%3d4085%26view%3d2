<br />
Gotta start with Essen, 2 big events in short time. Although my flat is pretty small, i invited 4 ppl to stay at my place, Hayes Hunter, Kim Caton, Alex Tennet and Clint Hays. Good times were had in that week and although my place looked like crap afterwards, its all good. They even brought me some presents! Hayes brought two 12-can-packs of Mountain Dew all the way from Arizona. I love that stuff. I even found a shop in the nearest big city that has it, at 1.40 a can though! (Both $ and Euros, its pretty much the same). So the free Dew was much appreciated. Kim hooked me up with an english Scrabble board, or more importantly, an english set of letters. And Alex, not wanting to be the one without a present (that role was filled by Clint, but its all ok) brought me some dark, bitter chocolate. Noticing my obvious distaste for that kind of chocolate, he said &quot;well, you can have that decklist i scribbled down on the trainride to your place, thats worth 2.500$ (the win for a premier event, namely essen)&quot;.  Guess which deck it was. Yes, the pipeweed. Legends are made of stuff like that.<br />
The premier event came up and i made top 8 with the deck, earning not 2.5 G but 125$ which aint half bad either. Alex himself fell short because of his tendencies to do time wins i think.<br />
It was good to see all those north-americans ( and of course also all those other europeans and not to forget, the malaysians!) on our turf and not the other way around like all the years before. <br />
As good as the times were though, i wanna fastforward a week to the main event of this TR : Dcon2002.<br />
Unlike last years freedomcon, where i was the only german in attendance, i would travel and room with 2 good friends of mine, Angelo Consoli and Benjamin Fadda. For both of them its their first trip to the US of A. But they now have that fire in their eyes, they gonna come back for sure next year.<br />
<br />
We arrive tuesday evening together with fellow german Thomas Kisselbach and there was noone else yet. So we went out to eat something. We found a random pizza place, sit down and order. We must have done something wrong though, cause the waitress makes us sit at 2 other tables, says the table we were at wont fit the pizza. I mean, all we ordered were two 12&quot; and a 16&quot; and we practically eat all of it (why cant they serve decent meals in an airplane? We were hungry as hell). Afterwards we buy some stuff (DEW!!!!), head back to the hotel and totally crash at 10.30 pm. Random german Dennis Jenkel is so nice to inform us per phone that he also arrived (at midnight! i could have killed him right there!) and then we continue trying to adjust to the local timezone. We suceeded, more or less ( Angelo was up and showered at 5.30 am and went out to walk around, but only that one morning). Next morning its time to greet Kim, Alex and Doug Faust, who also arrived the last night but were kind enough not to wake us up. After introducing my friends to DEW it was now time for the second installment of the &quot;american con feeling&quot; : IHOP!!<br />
Good stuff, only i dont like that butterball on top of the pancakes. Alex loves it though, he took like 3 or 4 of them. Disgusting. We spend the day playing around with lotr and wars decks ( no scrabble yet though) and then go down for preregistration. Big props to decipher for that, they learned something. Finally you could get your badge and stuff the evening before instead of waiting in line for an hour at the start of the con like in 2000. That evening and the next morning i meet and greet what must have been a thousand faces i was so happy to see again. Mark Tuttle lets everyone know thats hes totally ga-ga and then the con is underway. Originally, thursday morning was the planned sports-event time but the weather is way too bad, so i dont have to decided between basketball and the 10am lotr-day1 tourney. We have 194 players and i play a random trust me/moria deck with 4 Gandalfs, 4 wizard is never late, 1 ottar and 4 elronds. I go 2-2 drop. After losing to Patrick Malboeuf in Essen i was really impressed with his moria deck but i just cant get moria to work consistenly. I reaffirm myself i wanna play uruks tomorrow. At least that tourney helped me realize that. So i hang out a bit till the second day1 tourney starts at 5 pm. The regular tourney has more than 150 ppl but i opt not to bother cause theres a much easier way, a shortcut to day 2 : Multiplayer. In case you didnt know yet, i got a broken multiplayer deck. Its posted on my page (Multiplayer Mayhem) and i was sure it was gonna qualify me. That and the fact, that prolly not a lot of good players play multiplayer.  I warped the free ppl some (adding 2 hobbit party guests) and the shadow some more ( more cheap isengard minions, its all about the sarumans power! and when i say all i mean ALL). Only 21 ppl showed up, so the minimum 4 are gonna qualify. We play 4 games of 90 minutes each. After winning the first 3 i was in no matter what so i killed myself in game 4 to get some more sleep ( it was after 1 am by now). Because of that, i didnt win the tourney like i should have, but only place 3rd. Eh, whatever.<br />
<br />
Next up was day 2 of lotr, they make it 2 different pods and from the names, it seems i got into the easier one, pod B. We have 48 players, so a 6-2 is required to make it to the sweet 16. Deck is pipeweed/uruks again, same as in Essen (changed like 1 card, filibert for merry). I went 3-0 first with wins over wiliam diniega and 2 others i dont remember, then lose my first game to Marcin Solonczak, the european champ. Next i get paired up against 4-0 Dominic Gaudreault and win and then i lose to some random nazgul player. I am now 4-2 and get to play Clint Hays whos 5-1 with a time win. Always bad to play a friend that late in the tourney but if i win hes not eliminated yet, we could both win our last game and be in. I start and doublemove to 3. He moves to site 2 and i play 2 guys and an ambition. Lego shoots one guy and the other inflicts 1 wound on Aragorn cause he has armor. I reconcile 4 or 5 cards. He moves again, not giving me enough pool to play another guy. I drop 2 more ambitions. He thinks wether to sacrifce lego or take the risk that i drew 4 pump on his first move. He paires my troop up against aragorn and i show him the savagery. That and the 3 ambitions and gorn is dead. The rest is a formality and i am 5-2. I now get a do-or-die match against Alfred Dong. He plays Nazgul and well, i get a good opening hand and hes not playing black breath anyway. So i beat him. You know, for wars i always liked to describe my games and stuff but in lotr, its all the same all the time. I cant remember half of my games and even what i remember, it would all sound the same. Lotr i guess was not made with tournament reports in mind. Anyway, i just qualified my hiney for some granted money. The question at hand now was : what to do? Cause the main reason for my trip was to play wars, to defend my title from last years freedomcon and to earn some money playing the game of all games. I was qualified for wars day 2 beforehand so there was nothing else to do on thursday and friday, thats why i played lotr. But the final events would both be on saturday and there was no way to play both. I had to decide. But the decidion was already made, i made it like half a year ago when the schedule came out and i first talked about it with someone, prolly Hayes Hunter : I was gonna play wars for real.<br />
But as there was money up for grab for lotr even for the 16th place i would show up and then bid 10 twice. That way i would have participated and should get 125 $.Thats what i told everyone the weeks before the con and thats what i told all the 20 or more persons that asked me that evening. Wars is the game i love and i know how to play and my chances of making top 8 and making at least 300 $ were pretty good. On the other hand, i had no sercret tech for lotr, no idea how to meta against the field and no idea how to guarantee a better than 50% chance of winning each match. Those quebeccers were everywhere and they had some sweet stuff as i was able to witness in the essen premier event where i got kicked out by the bad beef himself. The word of my decision was spreading quickly, ppl were coming up to me and saying that its the coolest thing they ever witnessed (wars players of course) and others could only shake their head over my decision to forfeit guaranteed money for another grueling meat-grinder in which i would need to make top 8. But word also spread to the decipher guys. Obviously, they were not happy about my decision but they didnt say anything yet. I had a very good discussion in the bar later that evening with Gabe Alonso and Mary-Gail Coffee about if what i wanted to do is unsportsmanlike or unfair to the 17th or not in the spirit of the game but Mary-Gail was practically reading my mind and voiced exactly what i felt : it was my opportunity, i earned it by qualifying and it was mine to forfeit if i wanted to. I went to bed reaffirmed of my choice but still there was this strange feeling in my stomach, that uncertainty if decipher would do anything and if, what it would be. I fell assleep, but i woke up at 5.30 or sumthing and couldnt sleep anymore because the thoughts were making me mad. Finally it was time to get up, shower and head over to face the decipher goliath. And guess what, they told me i couldnt register for both events, i had to decide. They told me they both started at 10 am ( YEAH, RIGHT! Decipher events starting on time!) and it would therefore be technically impossible for me to attend both events. Also it would be unsportsmanlike according to their code of conduct and a reason for disqualification without prize. <br />
Well, the code of conduct leaves a lot of things to be interpretet so all i could ask for is that they make the rules clear to everyone BEFOREHAND next time but of course i couldnt do anything. Its their con, they make the rules. This killed one of my reasons to play wars (a 50 % chance of not winning more than the 125 $ i would get anyway) but i sticked to my decision. Its time for wars, baby!<br />
<br />
We start at about 11.30 or so ( 15 minutes after the other event, ah, nevermind, its over) and theres 52 players in attendance. 8 games its gonna be. Decks are Watto and QMC, Angelo is gonna post his and mine are like 5 cards different so i wont bother. The reason to play QMC is that its overall solid, leaves a lot up to the player , so i figured i could beat anyone far worse no matter what matchup. And Watto is just da diggity-bomb. As it turned out, i was not the only one to realize that. Hayes Hunter was playing it, Brian Hunter was playing it, Chu was playing it, everybody and their mom were playing it ! Speaking of Chu, he was the main guy i missed last year and it was real good to see him ( and play him as it would turn out!) again. First class player and sportsman. Anyway, here we go :<br />
<br />
Game 1, my QMC against Don &quot;DPC Dan&quot; Kitzman and his Watto<br />
Don writes real entertaining TRs and from those i read i knew he played watto for a long time. Just hes playing some other cards as we do. Hes playing a bunch of twixes, cards like overload and other stuff. If he wants to beat me, he has to put pressure on me early on, ideally do some battle damage in the first 5 turns. Once QMC is set up and the lost pile is not that big, its over. And thats what happenes, he draws up 2 turns straight and i got all the time in the world to get my evasion cards and set up celeberation. I win easily by 29.<br />
<br />
Game 2, my Watto against Matt Scott, WYS mostly space with some beatdown stuff and beggar<br />
Nothing eventful happened that game, watto was just too much pressure. My guys were on my sites and in the cantina and i got a ship up early and blocked his kessel drain unless he would concentrate all his 3 ships there in which case i would go to tatooine. Also he had to pay for Battle Order and i didnt. He made one half-hearted attemp to come to the ground but i was more than ready and smacked him away. I win by 26<br />
<br />
Game 3, my QMC against Mike &quot;Deck&quot; Gemme and his dark senate<br />
This must have been the most frustrating game for Mike ever. Like everything he did, i had the perfect answer. He flips with lotti doddi and some other guy. I play V-Leia first turn and place Lott dod OOP. I set up at the system with V-Luke in ship. He comes down with Thrawn in saber 1, i barrier, he plays the cannon anyway. On my turn, xwing cannon is not in my force pile, so i take alternatives to fighting. I play it,track a destiny and then next turn i play the cannon and the tie goes boom. He plays something on the ground and beats me bad, but i houjix. Then he comes down with his second saber 1 and his second cannon and this time its even the baron piloting. But i got my only barrier again, track a destiny and he goes boom again. We skirmish some more on the ground but i got evasion and he draws up before i retrieve my last cards. Win by 29 i think.<br />
The whole game was feeling weird, cause last years we had such a great time as friends and now it was if he wanted to proof something, that he could challenge me, that he was real good at this game (And he certainly is, judging his finishes over the whole year). We didnt talk about decks beforehand (you dont wanna tell another guy who might make top 8) so he knew i take him seriously and the game was not as lighthearted as it could have been. I dunno, it just felt weird. <br />
<br />
Game 4, my Watto against Johnny Chu and his light combat with racing<br />
Its on! We only played once at a local in Fitchburg , MA the week prior to ramapo 3 and this certainly promised to become a good game. I keep the pressurelevel high early on and get mad activation so i can always draw enough cards to fuel my engine. Down comes obi-wans aparition to naboo and my activation falters a bit. Johnny wins the podrace and retrieves 6. Down comes the second system and i chase V-Luke around with thrawn and guri in the chimaera. But he retrieves and his occasional drains are now for free. V-Reegesk and Janus tagteam to allow me to track sweet destinies like xwing cannon and a second copy of artoo in red 5. He keeps losing 2 to my objective cause he doesnt know my playing style, my bluffing habits. Down comes Wedge in space and now i cant drain in space anymore cause hes not running away anymore. Guri dies to cover some battle damage. Im slowly losing the grip and although he is low on force, hes not out yet, hes hanging in there. He brings down han, chewie in the falcon, but only has 1 destiny left. Still its enough to make me lose both thrawn and the chimaera. Now hes the only one draining for free and that and luke retrieval threaten to turn the game around. Fortunately for me, time is called and i get a time with like 17 force or so. With 10 more minutes, he might just as well win it, but it was a great game nonetheless. Close till the end, closer than i would have liked it.<br />
<br />
Game 5, my QMC against Brian Hunter and his watto<br />
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.<br />
Brians Watto deck is much more similar to mine as Dons, only he doesnt have Reegesk. In retrospect, i think it was my second turn that turned me in. I pay 1 to go for a location and theres only the sector in the deck, the other 2 sites, north corridor and the 1/0 site are in my force pile. I put Luke at the sytem first turn and i hold wedge, mirax and figrin. I wanna keep wedge to get the cannon and shoot down zuckuss which he just put down at his system, carida or rendili. Instead of waiting a turn and taking the damage, i flip with mirax and figrin and guess what, the sites, especially the 1/0 were in the force spent. With only 2 battleground sites down it was easy for Brian to control me on the ground. Also, he had a barrier for wedge and then zuckuss ran away to bespin where he had played the chimaera. I pull a bunch of crazy stunts and figrin stays in there like a champ blocking drains but in the end he gets me by 12.<br />
<br />
Game 6, my Watto against Scott Lingrell and his Blow the bunker (no podracing anymore)<br />
Before the game, Scott was already thinking about quitting the tourney and driving home, his wife was seemingly missing him a lot. But somehow they talked on the mobile and Scott could play on. He´s 3-2 right now, so not out yet. It felt like last year, as we both play the same light decks. Only his deck got much worse upon losing the race component. So we fool around some and have a good time, but the end was inevitable i think, watto wins, forgot by how much. As Scott is now 3-3, he drops and drives home at this point.<br />
<br />
Game 7, my QMC against Brad Reinhold and his Senate<br />
QMC against Senate is a pretty even matchup i think, it can go both ways. In game 3 against Mike i was lucky to get the perfect game going, but no upside without a downside and here it was. Even after flipping i couldnt find the V-Leia and also, Brad got the +3 activation effect early and his activation was just huge, like  near the 20s very early. He flooded my sites and that resulted in a 15-damage overflow on figrin dan after playing a sense and canceling my other react with the blockade senator on that one political effect.From there on the rest was a formality and he won by like 20 or sumthing. I still have huge diff but only 9 points cause of the time win. Still a full win next game should qualify me, but in the lower bracket, like 7th or 8th.<br />
<br />
Game 8, my Watto against Mike &quot;Deck&quot; Gemme and his Senate<br />
Mike is 4-3 at that point and most def out of the runnings. But Justin Desai has the best diff out of all 4-3ers so thats enough reason to try and get me out of his way. Im still thinking that maybe i could get in in 7th and Justin in 8th but first of all, i gotta win this one. In playtesting, the light senate gave us some problems because of the beatdown it can deliver with the help of palpatine and colo claw. The latter problem i solved by starting the fish myself, only to have Mike start the anti-fish. Mike applied the strategy of paying 2 all the time, negating my damage from the objective. But this way, the ground got flooded with my characters pretty fast and theres no way for him to deliver a beating. As light senate relies on beatings though and has nowhere to drain, my slow but steady drains turn him in, much helped by the appearance of search and destroy somewhere in the middle game. <br />
<br />
Im now at 11 points with a diff of well over 100. I go to check the command cards on the tables in front of me and horror starts to kick in. I sat at the 7th table. Table 1 has 2 guys with 6-1 , so both are ahead of me. Tables 3-6 all have 2 guys with 5-2 and no timewins, so the 4 winners are gonna be ahead of me too. And Table 2 has Hayes Hunter at 6-1 playing Paul Myers at 5-2, so if Paul wins they are both ahead of me and im gonna finish 9th! I badly need Hayes Hunter to win so i can clinch the top 8. While i finished my game pretty fast, their game is seemingly going on forever. Because they are some of the last to finish, their game draws a pretty big crowd. But i cant watch it. I wander around the rest of the hall and finally lay myself down somewhere in a corridor outside the hall and wait for what seems to be eternity. Then finally someone comes up to me and tells me that Hayes won. PHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW! I walk up to Hayes and thank him but then i think Hayes might have ended up in first, so we would have to play first round. I go check and while i find out i dont have to play him, i realize that my buddy, roommate and playtesting partner from way back home finished the swiss on top of the standings : Angelo Consoli. gosh darnited. We both play basically the same decks, only like 5 cards different each based on personal style. Of course he will choose to play Watto and he should win about 7 out of 10. We playtested the matchup at home. A lot. <br />
Theres plenty of time before the quarterfinals start cause they do deckchecks on all of our decks and also they put them in new sleeves to prevent any possible shady stuff from happening. Nothing wrong to spend 6 bucks on new sleeves when you gonna win at least 300 anyway. So Angelo and me share a pizza and talk about how it sux we gotta play first round. I think Angelo was somewhat nervous while i just feel dead tired from the low amount of sleep i got last night. Eventually we talk about the money. We agree that we should do some money split and being the nice guy with a job ( and him being a student) i offer him a 60-40 split based on the fact that he got the better matchup. He agrees and our game just got a little less stressful. As i told you above, i hate not being able to influence my fate and having others decide it. But should Angelo win our match, i had a good feeling that he could do the whole thing  (I know its easy to say that afterwards, but i really felt that way after our game).<br />
<br />
Quarterfinals, my QMC against Angelo Consoli, Watto<br />
I get a good opening hand in the fact that it had 2 sites. So all my sites were out first turn. He flipped with Reegesk and watto i think. I cant flip because i only have 1 character, Qui-gon w/stick  so i use him to attack watto on my second turn. Angelo has the barrier though. He accelerates for visage, puts it down on colo claw and plays P-59. He bluffs me to lose 2 cards, then attacks and hits me to lose 2 more and i think i hit watto and played sorry to draw destiny. Angelo has a watto in hand though ( we play 3 and the first one came from reserve ) and flips again on his next turn. Angelo gets Zuckuss down at his system but i get wedge w/ cannon and make him pay for drains again. Wedge retreats to Bespin. Which leads us to the crucial turn i think, a bit later in the game. He has the chimaera and Boba Fett in Slave 1 at Rendili. I deploy Dash in the outrider and move Wedge w/ cannon over. He cant run cause its 4 parsec to bespin and chimaera cant do it. I dont have a used 5 or sumthing and couldnt track anything yet so i activate all but 3 next turn. I go and check and its : 2,2,1. So no action in space yet. I have another qui-gon in hand but with these destinies, i cant use him to clear some house on bespin as i would have needed so i put him down to kill watto. And of course Angelo has the third and final watto in hand by that time so that was the last nail and i go down by sumthing like 15 or 11 i think. As i said, the matchup favors him but i got a decent draw so i might have had a chance. Oh well, Angelo played well and he certainly earned it.<br />
<br />
As always, during the game i didnt really feel tired but now that its over, it comes back. We find out that Brian Fred beat Rippetoe and is gonna play Angelo next. I advise him to play QMC against his MKOS because its another good matchup and for light, Brian plays WYS with beggar and the beatdown combo. And Angelo doenst play the anti-beggar shield anymore! Then i go to watch the final of Lotr on the big screen. I trusted Angelo in doing well, but i just couldnt watch his games. Peter Sundholm tells me about game 1 and then they get ready for the second game. Suddenly Angelo is in the room and he signals me the thump down. gosh darnit! Then he starts smiling and gives me the thump up. Dude, im getting old, my poor heart! So hes in the final, his game against Fred took less than 10 minutes ( sumthing about a beatdown on zuckuss and antilles maneuver being a real good card that no american plays, hehe) and we got some serious money. Nice. I watch the lotr game till both players are at site 7. Since we can see both players hand i know that alex cant win anymore and leave to see how the wars thing is going. I find out that Hayes is still playing his quarterfinal against Brian Twigg! In  the end, they took more than 2 and a half hours. I dont even  wanna know about their argument afterwards, sumthing about how the judge missed something, so i leave the scene. Dom lets everyone know that he drank lots of alcohol by making a total fool of himself. By now, its getting close to 2 am at which point the convention center will close down. So the remaining 2 games will be held in the wellesley inn next door. I head over there to check it out but its gonna be a while till the final will even start and i am so gosh darnit tired. So i wish Angelo the best of luck, head back to our hotel room and fall asleep almost immediately. At about 5.30 my roomies come back and tell me the Angelo made it. STRIKE! Thats gosh darnit straight. <br />
Regular players at our monthly bochum tourney : 3 titles - USA : 2 titles. <br />
Maybe next year, Martin Falke can get some time off his studies and make it even at 4-4 against the rest of the world :-).<br />
All fun aside, as Angelo was getting the big cheque now, my decision to play wars instead of lotr totalled me more than 2000 bucks. Pretty gosh darnit straight too. I would have needed to make the final in lotr to get more than that and i cant see that happen. So everything worked out well. Celebrating at 5.30 is tricky though, we were all tired so soon enough we passed out.<br />
Next up is sunday, the chill day. No decklists to write, no hurry to register for anything. We head over to the con at some point and hang out. Dom asks me to play wars, so i give him my dark against my light. I tell him he has the better matchup and he asks some questions why and what the deck does and then we play some. <br />
Meanwhile the award ceremony starts and at some point we have to stop cause i´m called up for doing top 8. We continue playing and then suddenly i´m called up again. They voted me into the Hall of Fame. So i stand there and dont know what to think, i mean its a big honor and i totally didnt know or expect it. Among the 21 ppl they call up theres like 5 or even more who by now work for decipher which seems kinda weird to me but who am i to judge. I think besides me theres only one other guy from europe, a trek guy whos name doesnt really sound english &quot;Thorsten Wanek&quot;, might even be a german, so thats nice too. They announced that they would include ppl every year from now on but being on the first team certainly makes it special. Oh, i won the game against Dom btw. I play another game against Eric George with my QMC and hes hunt down which is a tough match but i win it by like 6. A very funny thing happened during that game though. We were talking alot and somehow we talk about Matt Allen who Eric played on day 1. Now i never saw Matt cheat myself but both Angelo and Benjamin described to me various things he did and i totally trust these guys. Like being drained for 4 and then he would think what to lose and after losing 2, he would act as if he was done and the game could continue. Or not losing force at all. Like multiple times. Or putting a card back on his deck. Nothing that happens &quot;accidently&quot;. Obviously Eric experienced something similar so at one point hes saying something along the lines of &quot;Matt Allen is a cheater&quot; and its was like in a movie cause next thing he says is &quot;Hes standing behind me, right?&quot; and i just nod. Funny stuff. Later i run into Mike Carr and his wife and Greg Anderson and they want to do a multiplayer game for lotr so i think thats certainly gonna be chill and i play. I warn them that i got a broken deck though :-). So we play like 2 turns and its getting close to 2 pm and theres a chase the ring tourney starting and they all want to play in that. So much for chilling. With nothing else to do, i take part in that tourney too. Its 4 games only and theres gonna be more than 2 undefeateds going into the last game so its kinda random. But whatever. I pull out my pipeweed deck and off we go. I win game 1 and then game 2 its me against : Josh Cornell-Mott! They guy i would have played game 1 on day 3 for lotr! Nice. Hes nazgul and i forgot about his free people. Actually i forgot about the whole game but i won. Good to know. So game 3 i play against fellow german Dennis Jenkel, they guy that woke us up at midnight the first night, so my chance for revenge for that :-). I even remember something about this game. He moves to site 7 first using a pathfinder to not lose his allies, especially since he just gave boromir his horn. He stops. I move 6-8  and since my weed will remove my wounds, i look in good shape to go to site 9 next turn. So he has to doublemove. He gives me a bunch of pool but doesnt heal boromir for 2. I pull out Saruman and 2 ambitions i think and reconcile. He moves on and i put down a bunch of guys and one of them is the captain so its like 7 minions to his 5 guys. He thinks a bit and then extends his hand to signal his defeat. Benjamin askes him, why he didnt heal so he could use his horn twice and Dennis says : &quot;I had the horn?! gosh darnit, i was hoping to draw it, i didnt see it&quot;. Whatever, a win is a win. So now theres 5 undefeateds left including me so i get a 20 % chance to face the ringbearer since he could be paired down like everyone else. But im lucky and i get him. He tells me its his 2nd tourney and its not his own deck, he got it from the TD. I can tell by its size that its moria, but its gotta be like 100 cards or even more! Turns out that its moria archery and unless i dont draw sleep, my deck should steamroll it. The game was actually funny cause he was talking all the time, often to himself. I draw sleep at site 5 and reach site 9 safely. So i get the ring to round out my weekend. The conference center closes and we decide to head to applebees with a big bunch of ppl. Our car takes a wrong exit at some point and the applebees is a bit off the road, so we dont find it on first try but its all good, cause when we arrive the others JUST got seated and we didnt have to wait. Matt Allen is also there so another funny story happened. I mean, as a person Matt is certainly a nice guy, we stayed at his place for 2 nights in 99 when we were visiting the english grand slam and that was cool but dude, stop that cheating. Its not a sport trying to not to get caught, its a bad habit and ppl will dislike you for it and will be a prick to you and i dont think you want that. <br />
So Matt is sitting on my right, then Alex Tennet and then Mary-Gail. She is trying to say something to Alex but Matt interrupts her twice so she says &quot;You talk too much&quot;. I just couldnt help it and added &quot;Yeah, and you cheat too much&quot;. Matt looked at me and says &quot;Pardon??!&quot; and Alex was just grinning but we didnt say anything anymore and we went to other topics. I hope the message reached him though. <br />
After the meal, we head back to the hotel to finally play some real scrabble. On thursday, i played a game with chu and praskac but we used the original rules which suck if you got more than 2 players. <br />
So now we use the multiplayer rules, everybody got pen and paper and tries to make the best word out of the letters that are open to everyone. We start without Alex so that someone else can win cause he is a beast at scrabble and Andreas Petz ( from austria) really worked hard to create a position way behind but somehow Alex took it over and barely edged Kim out. I had to settle for 3rd cause i scored 0 points 3 times in a row. Thats because of the time limit, once somebody thinks he has a good word, he starts the clock and then its one more minute. So i write down desperate words and they challenge me on each one. Matt Allen played too and from time to time, we inquired to see if he really got the word written down that he claimed the points for :-) frimbazeling Matt Lush was there too and he frimbazeling liked the frimbazeling multiplayer rules and got pissed when a frimbazeling german got better words than him. All in all, a very funny evening.<br />
Next day, nothing interesting happens and we check out and fly home and thats the end. Well, nearly the end, one more story to tell. We arrive in washington at 4 and our flight to dusseldorf is at 6. We find Dennis Jenkel hanging out at another gate where he is waiting for his flight to frankfurt at 5.30. We talk some and then try to find something to eat and end up at mcdonalds. So at 5.15 we come back to our gate and bejamin wants to say bye to dennis and i tell him, he will be on the plane by now so i stay here. Well, the next thing i hear is an announcement &quot;United is paging the following passengers : Mr. Whatsoever, Mr. Jenkel, Mr...&quot; so i head over there too. Turns out everyone boarded already, only dennis is sitting at the opposite gate and calmly reads some mag. Freak (in a nice way thought, sort of).  So we get to say bye and then get on our own flight. The plane is crowded and theres no room for my feet but somehow i survive.<br />
<br />
THE END<br />
<br />
Props :<br />
<br />
Angelo Consoli : The little one is playing with the big boys now :-) Good job , alder!<br />
Benjamin Fadda : Even if you didnt win anything (not counting winning a costume tourney without a costume, that was pretty lame) you had tons of fun and thats what counts. And you were a good roomie, i could tell stories about that one roommate from last year....  <br />
Alex Tennet : Good job dude, and thanks again for the deck!<br />
Kim Caton : Origins, baby! Its gonna be huge. Scrabble is no fun if you dont challenge that much :-)<br />
Hayes Hunter : Thanks for winning that last game against Myers and getting me into the top 8. The twin towers will represent again.<br />
Clint Hays : 3 to beam up!<br />
Mike Gemme : No con is complete without you anymore, i hope we hang out some more next time again.<br />
Justin Desai : Dont worry dude, you didnt choke. You both had a great year and that should make you proud. <br />
Alan Rimell and Bruce Savin : I guess the bar means a lot more to you guys than it does to me, but you guys make it mean some to me (does that make sense? i hope so)<br />
Jason Kily : Young Jedi world champion, respect! I guess theres no such thing as &quot;dirty money&quot; and 500 bucks aint shabby. When will you finally come to germany??? Its gonna be phat!<br />
Matt Lush : Its cool you came over for just 2 days, good to see you (again? your sure?)<br />
All the quebeccers : What a bunch of great guys! Biggest possible props to your domination of the LotR-events. This so much reminds me of 1997, when we came to worlds for wars with a group of 5 germans and 4 of us made the top 12 and Philip Jacobs won it. It was a great feeling and its gonna be a sweet memory for all my life and i guess its the same for you guys.<br />
Heidi Farinholt : Every costume that requires parts from an online-sexshop should automatically win a costume contest. You got cheated!<br />
Andreas Petz : For dominating the sealed side events. 13-0 until the streak ended? Thats phat.<br />
Mary-Gail Coffee : For being able to read my mind and voice it better than i could have. Although it didnt help in the end, its greatly appreciated.<br />
Kyle Craft : Too bad you had to miss Dcon. I cant look at our money anymore without thinking &quot;Pirate Booty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry if i forgot you, if you can think of anything funny that happened between the 2 of us, props to you too.<br />
