I had planned on playing my sick Gandalf/Gondor/Uruk deck (The Great Gondor Beatdown) that has been so successful for me, but the day before the tourney I decided to instead play a Gondor pump/Moria swarm-slowdown deck (it runs 4 Cave Trolls and 4 Goblin Flankers, making it very tough to run against me even if the swarm doesnt come together).  I playtested it against all kinds of decks (Elf/Nazgul, Ranger/Uruk, Hobbit/Moria, Hobbit/Sauron, superfellowship/Uruk, etc.), and it beat all of them, so I was pretty confident going in.  Normally, at least half of the players in my area are running Uruks, 25% are playing Nazgul, and the rest are playing Moria or Isengard Orcs, with an occasional Sauron deck thrown in there, and the fellowships are almost all Elves, Rangers, or big fellowships, but today everyone seemed to be playing Moria.  Anyway, heres how my day went.<br>
<br>
GAME 1- me vs John Davids Dwarves/Moria Swarm<br>
  Well, John is a brand-new player, but he is playing a Dwarf anti-Moria deck (Song of Durin is dirty), so that makes it tougher.  I bid zero as always, he bids 2 and chooses to have me go first.  So, I switch my start from Aragorn RotN to Boromir LoG, shuffle my deck, draw my hand, then Pony for Aragorn.  I play a Flaming Brand on Aragorn, play Sting, use it, see 4 orcs and clear the pool, then I play Orophin (since the 2 extra twilight still isnt enough for him to win a skirmish against me) and a No Stranger on Aragorn, then move to site 2 (Ettenmoors), 10 in the pool.  He plays a Moria Scout for 2, a Goblin Runner for 1, and a Goblin Scavenger for 5, 2 left.  Scavenger loses to Aragorn, Scout loses to Boromir (still alive), runner loses to Frodo, I sting twice to remove the rest of the pool, he regroups, I move again and he drops another runner for 1, 2 in the pool, Aragorn and Boromir clean up the mess and I stop.  He starts Gimli and Gloin, plays a Dwarven Axe and an Endurance of Dwarves on gimli, plays Fror, and moves to Ettenmoors, 9 in the pool.  I play a Goblin Armory, a runner for 1, a scimitar on the runner to add 1 and draw a card, a scavenger for 5, scimitar to add 1 back and draw, and a scout for 4.  Since the scavengers would overwhelm his other companions, he assigns Gimli to the scavengers, runner to Fror, and the scout to Gloin.  All of my minions win their skirmishes, doing a wound to each dwarf (where are my Swarms?), so he stops.  My turn, I play Galadriel, Aragorns Bow, a No Stranger and a Blade of Gondor on Boromir, move to Mithril Mine, 9 in the pool, he plays a runner, Goblin Patrol Troop and a scavengers with a scimitar, Aragorn exerts to kill the Scavengers, then kills the runner, Boromir takes a wound from the Patrol Troop, I Sting and see that he has no minions but the rare Balrog (with his Whip), so I move again, 7 in the pool, he draws 2 cardsand pulls his 4th runner.  Crap.  Now there are 8 in the pool, so the Balrog comes down, I see that someone is dying (stupid runner!) since Aragorn is only an 8 and Boromir has no Armor, so Aragorn kills the runner, Frodo Stealths the Balrog, Boromir takes another wound from the Patrol Troop, then Boromir dies in the fierce fight.  Oh well, no worries, Aragorn only has 1 wound and I draw Rumil and Celeborn when I reconcile.  Hehe.  He plays Hand Axes on Gimli and Gloin, moves to site 3, I drop two Armories, a Goblin Scrabbler with scimitar free (still 4 in the pool), another Scrabbler for 2 (2 in the pool), and a runner to add 1 (Moria trackers rock!).  Both Scrabblers die, but the runner wounds Gloin, so Im happy having done 5 wounds already.  On my turn, I exert Galadriel to play Rumil and Celeborn free, drop a Saga of Elendil and a Rangers Sword on Aragorn (I would have loved that last turn), and move to Galadriels Glade, 6 in the pool, he drops a Goblin Patrol Troop, and it dies to archery.  I could move again easily, but stop because Im 3 sites ahead and Im hitting his fellowship hard.  He plays Endurance of Dwarves on Gloin, transfers the Dwarven Axe to Gloin, plays Gimlis Battle Axe, and moves to 4, 10 in the pool.  I play a scavenger and pull a scimitar for a net cost of zero, play They Are Coming for 3, a scout for 2, pull a scimitar with the site to add 2 back (-1 for the site, +3 for the Armories), Goblin Flankers for 5 (2 left), and discard 6 cards from hand to play 2 runners from my discard pile with TAC (4 left), then pull the 3rd scimitar from the discard pile and put it on a runner.  So, his 4 companions have to face my 5 minions, both runners go on Frodo, 12 to his 4, game over.<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Highs:<br>
-Seeing my small fellowship cruise even without Boromir.<br>
-Seeing my shadow dominate what is arguably the strongest anti-Moria culture.<br>
Lows:<br>
-Losing Boromir at the Bridge when he drew his 4th runner in 2 turns to add enough pool for the Balrog.<br>
<br>
GAME 2: Me vs Bryce Barrows Pipeweed/Moria swarm<br>
  Another Moria deck?  Strange, but whatever.  He bids 6 knowing Im playing Moria, starts Gandalf FotS and pulls the Cart with Shire Lookout Point, drops some weed and a pipe on the cart, and moves to Ettenmoors, 5 in the pool, I play a scavenger, Gandalf takes a wound, and he stops.  My turn, I play Boromir, Orophin, and a Rangers Sword, move, 11 in the pool, he plays a scavenger for 5 and a Goblin Sneak for 3 (3 left), Aragorn kills the scavenger and Boromir handles the sneak, I move again, 6 in the pool, he plays a runner and a scout, and they die horrible deaths.  His turn, he moves to 3, I play a runner, Gandalf kills it, and he stops because he has a bad hand.  My turn, I play Galadriel and exert her for Celeborn, play a Flaming Brand on both men, armor on Boromir, remove 2 (Council Courtyard), and move to Moria Stairway, 7 in the pool, he plays a scout free and a Cave Troll for 7.  Aragorn kills the scout, and Boromir takes a pair from the Troll, then I stop.  On his turn, he drops more weed and pipes on the cart, then moves to 4, 4 in the pool, I play a scout and 2 scrabblers, Gandalf wounds the scout and the scrabblers overwhelm Frodo, 8-4.  Hehehe, that was hilarious.<br>
   Since that took all of about 5 minutes, we play again for fun, and this time I use my beastly Gandalf/Gondor/Uruk deck.  He bids 6 again since Im playing Uruks, drops the cart and a couple pipes, then moves to Ettenmoors, I have 5 pool so I play Sarumans Ambition and reconcile, discarding Cantea (I almost always play at least one or two of him in my Uruk decks).  My turn, I drop some elves and possessions, then walk past him untouched to site 3.  On his turn, he plays Glamdring and Legolas (Greenleaf), so hes happy to have another companion this time, he moves to 3, and I promptly drop Enquea and chain-gun Legolas into oblivion.  Hehe, back to Gandalf and Frodo.  Enquea does a pair to Gandalf and he stops.  I play some more gear and rumble to 5.  On his turn, he moves to 4 and I play a Troop, doing a pair to Gandalf.  My turn, I move to 6 and stop.  On his turn, he plays Aragorn HttWC and Frodos Pipe, then smokes some weed to heal Gandalf once, then moves to 5.  I play 2 Lieutenants and an Orc Overseer, so Frodo gets hammered once again.<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Highs:<br>
-Beating the crap out of his fellowship with my tournament deck andmy other tournament deck, lol.<br>
-Easily getting out in front with my fellowship again.<br>
-Overhwelming Frodo with Scrabblers.<br>
Lows:<br>
-none<br>
<br>
GAME 3: me vs Frank Pinkelas Gondor Denial-Archery/Moria Troll Swarm<br>
  At this point, Frank and I are the two undefeated players, so Im hoping that this will be a challenge, and I wasnt disappointed (Franks a solid player, so its always interesting).  He bids 1 and goes first, starts Aragorn HttWC and Westfarthing, plays Boromir, Aragorns Bow, a Last Alliance on Aragorn, and a Gondor Bowmen, then moves to 2.  I play a scout with scimitar and a scrabbler to dump the Last Alliance (finally, the scrabbler did its job!), he discards Gondor Bowmen to kill them both, then moves into 3 (Rivendell Waterfall), where I drop a runner that dies.  My turn, I play Boromir for 2, Sam Proper Poet for 1, Blade of Gondor, and move, 8 in the pool.  He plays an Armory, a scavengers, and 2 runners (1 with a scimitar), Aragorn kills a runner and Boromir kills the scavengers, and Frodo takes a wound from the runner, then I move again, he drops a moria scout, kill both minions, and stop.  His turn, he plays a Last Alliance on Aragorn again, a Saga on Boromir, Galadriel, and a Rangers Sword, then moves to 4, where I use the whole pool to play 2 Goblin Flankers and a Swarms.  Needless to say, they both win their skirmishes and swarm, then he stops.  My turn, I play Last Alliance and Armor on Boromir, No Strangers on both men, Sting, Galadriel (who exerts for Rumil), Sting his hand three times to remove the whole pool (2 orcs and a host), spot a ranger at Rivendell Waterfall to make the move limit +1, move to 4, 4 in the pool, he plays an Armory, a scavenger with scimitar, a runner to add 1, and a scout free (still 4 in the pool).  Boromir kills the scavenger, Aragorn wounds the scout, and Frodo kills the runner, so I move again, 12 in the pool and a wounded scout following me.  He plays the Balrog (4 left), exerts and removes 2 for a runner (3 left), scimitar on the runner (5 left), exerts for a runner (4 left), hosts for a scavenger w/scimitar (3 left), then plays a scout and a sneak from hand.  So, 6 orcs and the Balrog to my 4 companions.  No worries.  Rumil blasts the scavengers, Sam goes defender+1 and takes the Balrog and a runner, Frodo fights a runner, Aragorn fights the sneak, and Boromir fights the runner w/scimitar.  Frodo and the men win their skirmishes, Sam stealths and then dies in the fierce, and I move again with just a runner following.  He drops a couple more guys and they all get shot down or killed my the men.  His turn, he gets No Strangers on both men, moves to the bridge (7 in the pool), I play an Armory, a scavenger that pulls a scimitar for 2, and a Flanker from the swarms for the other 5.  The Flanker does a wound to Boromir and Aragorn kills the scavenger, then he moves to site 6 (Dimrill Dale), 4 in the pool, the other Flankers comes off the swarms free (-2 for Dimrill Dale, adds 3 back since he already moved), and both Flankers win their skirmishes and go back on the swarms.  My turn, I heal and move to 7, he drops a bunch of orcs, I take out his Armories with a Secret Sentinels and shoot down two orcs with Rumil, Aragorn takes a wound from the Trolls Keyward, Boromir wins his skirmish, and Frodo takes a wound from a scout.  He also played 2x Depths of Moria, so I decided not to move again in case he was holding a Troll (which he was).  His turn, he heals and moves to 7, I pass and discard a Swarms (trying to get all fellowship, which I do), he decides to stop because the Flankers will come down for 2 each if he doubles, and he hasnt seen any Cave Trolls yet (I discarded one earlier, but he knew there were more in the deck), so he would die if I was bluffing and had a Troll and another orc or two.  I reconcile to an all-fellowship hand, move to site 8, he drops three orcs and the Cave Troll with both Hammer and Chain, Rumil takes out one of the orcs, Aragorn wounds a moria scout, Frodo kills the runner hes fighting, and Boromir takes two from the troll (armor is huge).  So, I look at my hand, like what I see, and move into 8, giving him a ton of pool (with 2 Depths of Moria down), he drops 2 Armories and 5 more orcs, I play 2 Elendils Valors on Boromir to make him defender +2, Rumil exerts to shoot a scavenger, he discards an Armory to prevent it, and so we have assignment.  Boromir takes on the Troll, the Keyward (with scimitar), and a scavenger with scimitar, Aragorn takes on a Moria Scout with scimitar, Frodo takes on a runner, and he has two scouts (one with a scimitar) left to assign.  Since he knows Im playing a Gondor pump deck, and only one Swordarm has been played so far, he assumes Aragorn can handle himself if he goes for him in hopes of having the Troll fight a lone Frodo in the fierce (Aragorn has two wounds, so he can survive if not overwhelmed), and so he assigns both scouts (one has a wound) to Frodo.  I do Frodos fight first, play PATHS, killing the runner and wounding the healthy scout, he discards his last Armory to save the other scout and keep Frodo doubledso I play another PATHS and finish them off.  Hehe.  Aragorn takes a wound from his scout, Boromir dies to the giant minion pile hes facing, and Frodo watches as the troll eats Aragorn in the fierce fight.<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Highs:<br>
-Surviving swarm after swarm and multiple Cave Trolls.<br>
-Successfully triple-moving through Moria.<br>
-Double-moving for the win with a Troll following me.<br>
-Making him single-move just by having 2 minions on my Swarms.<br>
Lows:<br>
-None, really, it was a great game<br>
<br>
GAME 4: me vs Jason Piazzas Dwarves/Uruks<br>
  Well, it looks like Im playing yet another anti-Moria deck, and this time its being played by an experienced player.  Anyway, the early game went pretty quietly, I dont think either of our fellowships lost a single skirmish until we hit Moria.  He got 2x Lord of Moria and a Song of Durin out early, so my minions couldnt add to the pool with scimitars and even the higher-vitality ones couldnt survive their skirmishes.  As far as my fellowship, Aragorn got suited up early, I had Orophin and Galadriel along with Last Alliances on both men by site 4, and we basically walked to the Bridge, neither of us willing to double-move and risk a beatdown.  I ended up doubling from 4-6, so I got a site ahead that way, and from that point it was pretty much a question of whether or not he could stop me.  He made it to 6 fairly uneventfully, although the Balrog did die to Gimli+several Flurry of Blows at the Bridge (Gimlis Helm never showed up, and Gimli had a wound from exerting to boost his strength at site 4, so he couldnt afford to lose a skirmish to the Balrog).  I moved 5-7 and was met by an Orthanc Assassin and an Uruk Lieutenant, Aragorn beat the Assassin and the Lieutenant used a couple pump events to wound Boromir twice.  I stopped, and on his turn he moved to 7 and was met by a couple orcs and a Cave Troll with Hammer.  The Orcs died, but the Cave Troll killed Gloin in the regular skirmish and exhausted Gimli in the fierce (he discarded Dwarven Bracers to prevent the 3rd wound), so he was forced to stop.  On my turn, I moved to 8, where I was met by Lurtz.  He gave an archery wound to Frodo and two wounds to Aragorn and I moved on, hoping that he couldnt get a lot more guys down.  Well, he got 2, a Troop and a Lieutenant, so I just played 2 Elendils Valors on Boromir, he fought all 3 of them and died, and then Aragorn died to Lurtz in the fierce skirmish.  Once again my companions were wiped out at site 9, but hey, thats how its supposed to happen with this deck.<br>
FW +3/+12<br>
Highs:<br>
-Beating a deck designed to beat Moria.<br>
-Running through Uruks like they were Goblin Scrabblers for most of the site path.<br>
Lows:<br>
-Playing Moria and getting choked by Song of Durin.<br>
<br>
So, I ended the tournament undefeated at 4-0, not bad.  It was a fun day, with some pretty good competition, so Im pleased all around.  Since Mason Gilligan and Nick Scinto werent around for our usual massive post-tourney multiplayer game, I just played a game of Star Wars CCG against Jason (my 4th-round opponent).  He was dark side, playing a Court deck, and I was running my sick Lightsaber Combat Beatdown deck that only runs 5 characters and 1 starship (LSJK x4; Lando, Scoundrel x3; Yoda, MOTF x3; Qui-Gon Jinn, Jedi Master x2; and Caldera Righim x2, with Han, Chewie, & the Falcon up in space).  Basically, he got set up early on Tatooine (Jabba, Fett, Dengar, and Bossk in the Audience Chamber), so I dropped Yoda MOTF and Caldera Righim to the Audience Chamber along with Order to engage; this is such a beastly combo, they either battle or lose 3 force every turn, and Caldera prevents them from battling.  The game went pretty quick, though, I saved up some force and dropped Lando at Yodas site (Caldera was gone at this point) and Luke with a lightsaber at the adjacent site, lost a destiny 6 from my hand to a Force Drain, he battles Yoda and Lando, retrieve the 6 to make Lando a power 12, Run Luke Run gets Luke there at a 10 power, I play 2x Gift of the Mentor, 25 base power + 6 battle destinies, the result was 51 power and 26 attrition to his 15 power, so it knocked out his deck instantly.  Well, now that Ive finished with the SWCCG mini-report, I guess Im done for today.  I should be posting my LotR deck from the tourney fairly soon, so be sure to check it out. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3879&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
