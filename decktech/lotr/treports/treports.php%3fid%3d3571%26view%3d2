Small turnout, a little more than 10, as it was Friday night and there was another tournament the next day. But hey, admission for this tournament is free as there are no prizes except for the foils from Decipher if I got a top-3 placing.<br>
<br>
I was using my only deck. Hobbits + Men that deny twilight and are nigh-indestructible and Unbelievable Uruks for shadow. Very successful deck that has made me the newly-crowned top national player. Oh yes, did I remember to mention that I am the newly-crowned top national player? Didn&#39;t? Oh okay, I&#39;m the newly-crowned top national player. Hey you can&#39;t hear me?...<br>
<br>
I made a few modifications to it, like figuring that Lurtz was 10 times more effective than Wizard Storm and doing the appropriate substitution. I followed the crowd and included Filibert Bolger. He is most useful against Nazgul and Isengard, and okay against Moria, though useless against Sauron, but a quick look round showed NOBODY playing Sauron. They received a great MoM screwjob.<br>
<br>
On to the games.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 1</b><br>
vs James Chan<br>
Boromir, Lord of Gondor/Pippin, Mr. Took start<br>
Hobbit-Men-Gandalf/Isengard<br>
<br>
A good friend here. We are permanent members of the Unbelievable Uruks club and trade tips and such, but we&#39;ve never sparred in a tournament yet. Lately, his deck has improved greatly, and he finished 4th on the last tournament, and unlucky to do so. In fact, it bears traces of mine, except that mine completely lacks the Gandalf element.<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 0. I deliberate for a while before letting him go first (I was trying out staying behind when opponent is playing Uruks) before kicking myself. I forgot he was playing Mr. Took which draws into Aragorn and Gandalf and that he starts the Hobbiton Woods, not the Pony. That doesn&#39;t matter though as I draw Aragorn in my opening hand and...no minions?<br>
<br>
He plays his Breeland Forest with Woods after deploying some stuff. I keep a poker face and scrunch my nose up as I tap on my cards, mouthing secret words that only I knew. Then I looked up, and declared nothing to play.<br>
<br>
He bought it. He should have bought it. He later said he really bought it. WHY DO THEY INTRODUCE A BLOODY ELEMENT LIKE STING IN THIS GAME? There goes the ancient mastery of card games, the art of deceit. He double-moves to the sanctuary unharmed.<br>
<br>
I deploy Aragorn + Bow and am glad to get Armor out on Boromir first turn but it isn&#39;t so good when I move to Trollshaw Forest and he dumps a Troop of Uruk-Hai on me, and the idiot is Beyond the Height of Boromir. There goes the only Armor in my deck, and I am against Uruk-Hai. I risk the threat of Battle Cry and it pays off as Boromir takes 2 wounds, now comes the interesting part.<br>
<br>
Mine is a running deck, not designed to stay behind the opponent and I couldn&#39;t accept him being in front. I double to the sanctuary, and he gets just enough twilight to drop a Uruk Warrior, and I pay for that rash act.<br>
<br>
I could throw a normal archery shot and take the two on both men, letting Boromir die, or exert twice to kill the Warrior and let the Troop take on Aragorn + Flaming Brand, Merry, Friend to Sam boost, and hopefully win the skirmish and nobody dies, or he wins the skirmish and Aragorn dies. This is risky, but I guess I was emboldened by the non-existence of Battle Cry on the previous site. Aragorn guns down the Warrior, takes on the Troop. I exert Merry twice for 12-9 and turn around as I don&#39;t dare to watch. My fear materilises, and Aragorn dies first turn at Site 3.<br>
<br>
Hey you think that&#39;s bad? Boromir died on Site 4 next turn to a Battle Cry, and I was in deep, deep trouble. Yep folks, my deck just turned into a HOBBIT DECK! I totally screwed up! First game and here is the newly-crowned top national player! You won&#39;t believe the number of Athelas, Flaming Brands, Bows, Blades, No Strangers blah blah blah I tossed during the course of the game.<br>
<br>
My fellowship is a pathetic sight, but I survive the Bridge with Stealths. His fellowship is doing fine with Gandalf&#39;s Staff not allowing my Savageries to be used. He gets to Site 6 first.<br>
<br>
I had deployed Pippin rare and Sam burden-remover to get 4 hobbits out (with Talent for Not Being Seen out) but those were the only companions left in my deck, and they seriously looked puny. My deck wasn&#39;t built for hobbits to survive ALONE. I move to the Valley of the Silverlode and he plays nothing. I have Sting, teehee you cheeky...NO BUSINESS OF OURS?!!! WHAT!<br>
<br>
Compare this to early in the game in Site 2!<br>
<br>
I shrug and move again. I could not let him dictate the pace, which would have been the case if I had stopped. He drops a Captain and pulls back a Lurtz. Somehow I survive, but Pippin bites it and Frodo accumulates around 4 or 5 burdens, and Merry exerted his crap out, and I have passed the last sanctuary and Farmer F@ggot is simply not being drawn into. Yep, I can&#39;t heal my hobbits. This is gonna be a loooong day. First game and I&#39;m in such deep crap.<br>
<br>
He moves to Site 7 and 3 Uruks + Spies come down. He exhausts Gandalf stopping them, Aragorn takes two and Boromir has his Blade to stop the last one.<br>
<br>
My fellowship now and Farmer F@g is still not here. With Merry on 2 wounds, it is time for the heave-ho as I exhaust him for Thror&#39;s Map and move to Pillars of the King (hmm...why is it useless for me now?) A Troop and Warrior come down. Merry dies to the Troop and Frodo accumulates 7 burdens fending off the Warrior. Believe me, I contemplated moving again with 2 PATHS in my hand and only Troop having 4 vitality but I realise that one Lurtz can totally screw me up.<br>
<br>
Yes brother! I&#39;m still alive at Site 8!<br>
<br>
He moves to Site 8 and Captain and Lurtz charge out. Gandalf and Aragorn die, leaving only Boromir and Frodo alive. He chooses not to move, which is wise considering I still had 4 minions to drop at the Slopes of Amon Hen, and face it, who doesn&#39;t want to bully a fellowship with exhausted Frodo with 7 burdens and Sam with 2 wounds?<br>
<br>
I move to Site 9 and he drops a Raiding Party and 2 Lieutenants, and he is starting to realise I might actually pull a win out of nothing. Did I mention that only Raiding Party has more than 2 vitality? And just for fun, I assigned the Raiding Party on Frodo as he piled the other two on Sam. Frodo died and Sam stole it, and the ring gave him POWER ACCORDING TO HIS STATURE.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
Props:<br>
-Surviving after my Men were felled at Sites 3 and 4 and actually getting to Site 9 first<br>
-Close game. We both thought he had it.<br>
-Dang Uruks rule. Only they can inflict this punishment!<br>
-Sam rules. Sure, I know Frodo could have survived but I didn&#39;t want him to.<br>
-To me for pulling a win out of nothing. Oh well, I am the top player? :P<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-To James for losing it when it was so near.<br>
-NO BUSINESS OF OURS!!!<br>
<br>
In the break, I wonder at the potential of No Business of Ours as James advises me. It reflects the light of the Mirror (NOT YOUR BUSINESS!), turns Sting green with envy (NOT YOUR BUSINESS!), turns Glamdring purple with fear (NOT YOUR BUSINESS!) and might just prevent that Foul Creation (NOT YOUR BUSINESS!). It doesn&#39;t cost an exertion and is free, and might just attract Dreary to discard it instead of a Rampage or Ambition. Food for thought indeed.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 2</b><br>
vs Kang Chin Seng<br>
Arwen/Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine start<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Nazgul hybrid<br>
<br>
With all due respect, this game was a breeze compared to my heart attack in the 1st one. He bid 2 to my 1 and made me start first. Only Nazgul do that. He plays without Blade Tip or Black Breath though, and mixes the twilight Nazgul with normal Nazgul, which seriously hinders his shadow. We both stop at Site 2, before I Thror&#39;s Map for Council Courtyard and he plays Nelya...before passing. I point out to him he can switch the site to the Ford and play another Nazgul and that he does, but I don&#39;t really care if I lose skirmishes, there are no Tips or Breaths around.<br>
<br>
Pretty uneventful game but soon, I build up a 2-site advantage, and could have furthered it with ease if I wanted to. The Flaming Brands were out and him...let&#39;s just say he met Lurtz at Site 4, Lurtz at Site 5, Lurtz at Site 6 and Lurtz at Site 7. I wait at the Pillars of the Kings for him as he leaves the sanctuary and next turn walk into Site 9 with 2 Nazgul coming out. Nazgul are puny in the late-game.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Props: <br>
-Hmm...good for my heart<br>
-Lurtz is one cool guy<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Arwen/Merry start??<br>
<br>
<b>Game 3</b><br>
vs Anthony Lim<br>
Boromir, Lord of Gondor/Merry, Friend to Sam start<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Nazgul Overwhelming<br>
<br>
Now here&#39;s a guy who has the luxury to choose which deck to enter the tournament with. This one bases on huge strength-boosts on Nazgul, including Black Steeds in plains for overwhelming.<br>
<br>
I bid 1 to his 0 and go first. Deploy some stuff and move to Ettenmoors. A Nazgul come down but no way he&#39;s overwhelming Boromir. I stop as he plays a crapload of stuff like Aragorn, Arwen and lots of goodies before moving to Ettenmoors. Then his strategy totally backfired.<br>
<br>
Lurtz and Warrior come down. Lurtz is assigned to Aragorn + Ranger&#39;s Sword and Warrior to Boromir. Merry R exerts once to make himself 5 strength before exerting twice to add his strength to Aragorn. 15-13. I exert Lurtz, 15-15. He exerts Aragorn (believe me, it is not worth it EXERTING to make yourself strength +something against Uruks) for 17-15. I exert Lurtz for 17-17. He exerts Aragorn for 19-17. I wrap it up with Savagery to Match their Numbers, 21-19. Aragorn DIE!<br>
<br>
And just like that, without any overwhelming strength-boosters or Battle Cries, I killed Aragorn off at Site 2. Arwen died in the fierce skirmish and he is down to 3 companions and Boromir and Merry are exhausted.<br>
<br>
I survive the Ford and it turns to his fellowship phase where he gives me 3 twilight. Humph. Me, I move to Hollin (no, I didn&#39;t play that site, he played it) and Witch-King + Black Steed + Nazgul Sword = 20 strength. Isn&#39;t that...1 strength short? I Stealth 1 skirmish and Boromir takes the next.<br>
<br>
He gets Gandalf + Albert Dreary out before moving to Hollin, where my non-roaming Uruks lay out some lovin&#39;, but don&#39;t take any victims. My turn and I move to the Bridge, using up all the Stealths I saved for there. His turn and he plays Ottar and draws 3 and comments on good draw. he moves in, and 2 Uruks come out, and I have 6 twilight to make both fierce for Rampage. Boromir and Frodo are exhausted. Merry and Frodo take both Uruks and I think dang, you really drew 3 Stealths? But he resolves Merry first and Merry dies. Frodo takes 4 burdens as he is exhausted, bringing him to 5. Both are fierce. Gandalf takes 2 wounds and Frodo fights Warrior again, 6-9. I confirm that he is wearing the Ring before playing Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry. He is forced to take 6 burdens, which gives him a total of 11. CORRUPTION! Pretty short game there.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Props:<br>
-Ettenmoors. Teehee<br>
-Corruption!<br>
-First turn havoc<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-None<br>
<br>
So I am 3-0 with another guy, Loh Mun Kit, and win him on tiebreakers but we have a final to decide who is the real Dark Lord and grab the rare foil (finished 2nd in tournies all my life)<br>
<br>
<b>Final</b><br>
vs Loh Mun Kit<br>
Ranger-Elf Archery/Nazgul slowdown<br>
<br>
We have played each other countless times and know each other&#39;s deck as well as we know...each other. He is renowned for running 4 ARVs and 4 PATHS.<br>
<br>
He bids 2 to my 1 and starts first and plays an array of stuff, including Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Thror&#39;s Map. He moved to Site 2 where I dropped 2 Uruks. He wasted 1 away before moving again, not giving me enough twilight for another. The surviving Uruk got wasted too.<br>
<br>
So he knows his fellowship had better run FAST unlike all the previous times. This is going to be a race. I get some stuff like Filibert, 1 Flaming Brand, Bow etc and move into Site 2 to face a Nazgul and...yes, let me take a bow, I charge into the Ford of Bruinen with a Nazgul chasing me.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I face 3 Nazgul at the Ford. Aragorn and Boromir take 1, and all 3 Nazgul are Filiberted on the fierce skirmish. So I survive.<br>
<br>
He forgets about Thror&#39;s Map and moves into Hollin, where 2 Uruks discourage him from double-moving into the Bridge. Not a good idea against Uruks.<br>
<br>
Then I moved into Hollin and faced another Nazgul. I know clearly that it all depends on who reaches Site 6 first and yes, let me take ANOTHER bow. I charge into the Bridge of Khazad-Dum with a Nazgul chasing me.<br>
<br>
Needless to say x2, I face 3 Nazgul at the Bridge. Aragorn exerts once to wound Nelya. He torches Nelya alive. One of the other two is Stealthed and the other, Boromir is wounded. Aragorn is wounded on the fierce skirmish and Filibert cancels the other one.<br>
<br>
Pulled off 2 amazing feats with my indestructible fellowship already and what happens? I GIFT him Site 6. I totally embarrassed Isengard players all around the world when I declared nothing to play at Site 5 and what does he do? STING ME! He moves into the Valley of the Silverlode unchallenged.<br>
<br>
So I lost the race to Site 6. It is time for desperate measures. Farmer F@g heals Merry, and I use all my copies of Athelas to heal Aragorn and Boromir. I move into the Valley, giving him 4 twilight, but Gates + Enquea arrives. Enquea takes a normal archery shot before hitting Boro. So, I charge into Silverlode Banks with a Nazgul chasing me.<br>
<br>
Thankfully, he does nothing except equip Enquea with a Sword. Enquea takes 1 more normal archery wound and this is where I contemplate taking the risk. I have 2 PATHS in hand for his 2 vitality but 1 All Blades Perish and even Bounder couldn&#39;t save Frodo from 13 strength. Or I could just let Aragorn and Boromir take 1 apiece and exhaust them...<br>
<br>
I threw the 2 PATHS and closed my eyes. He shrugs and Enquea dies. Whew. He moves to Silverlode and I play 3 Uruks, making VERY sure there&#39;s an Uruk Scout in there before loosing the Spies of Saruman. He attempts an ARV and it&#39;s cancelled. Two Uruks are killed though, but he wasn&#39;t saavy enough to kill Uruk Captain. He moves to Site 8 to keep the pressure on me. I use the Captain to bring back the Scout and play a Lurtz. He ARVs again and again I cancel it. Oh well he ARVs AGAIN! Then he proceeds to exhaust all his archers to kill off the minions. Dang he knows me. He knows I&#39;m running for it.<br>
<br>
So I reconcile and dig the 2nd Flaming Brand. That&#39;s 14 strength for Aragorn. I deploy Sam too just in case, before moving into the Pillars of the Kings. He plays Enquea and Attea and takes the normal archery wound on Enquea. Both 3 vitality...2 Flaming Brands Damage +2. Yep ladies and gentlemen! ENQUEA AND ATTEA WERE NOT FIERCE! ARAGORN WAS! He kills them both after the fierce skirmish and I move to Site 9, the 2 Nazgul not providing any resistance.<br>
<br>
FW<br>
Props<br>
-Made me pant as I tried to catch up<br>
-The &#39;fierce&#39; text on Nazgul is so unfair to them?<br>
-The three great double-moves of faith<br>
-Somebody kill my fellowship please?<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-&#39;Twas late<br>
<br>
So, I win the tournament, and strangely, this is my first. I always finish 2nd or around there, always due to tiebreakers and such, and one time due to a screwjob. It was late though and the TD had left, asking us to e-mail him the result of our final.  <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3571&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
