<br>
So, ever since origins, i&#39;ve been looking forward to Gen con, this time i actually (gasp) made plans ahead of time.  got a place to stay with Andrew Howard and Eric Olson, and a ride down with Chris Perman.  I got some generic decks that i playtested with, a usual ranger+elf allies + mirror / uruk-hai deck, a frodo new aragorn choke w/ moria swarm, and the Hobbit Mirror deck that Kessling posted to DT a long time back, except with uruk-hai.  I also played around with Trust me but decided the draws were too inconsistant for my liking.<br>
<br>
So we leave the Twin Cities at 7 am on Thursday and get to Milwaukee at noonish, too late for me to enter the warm-up tournament that started at 12.  I leave my clothes and sleeping bag in Chris&#39; car &#39;cos i didn&#39;t want to carry it around for the rest of the day, even tho&#39; i didn&#39;t know when i&#39;d see Chris again.  I go to the Decipher booth and see some people demoing lotr, they didn&#39;t have either the faramir cards or the lotr rpg book yet, so i wander over to the tournament hall and check up on people playing the warm-up tournament.  Meet up with some other Minnesota folks, buy some singles from dealers, including 3x saruman, so now i have 4 for my deck, and bought the Rook capsul.  We also meet up with John Vessay, who&#39;s crashing with us.  After the tournament we go to the local mall and grab some food to eat and go back to the hotel.  Thursday night was spent helping Steve Kuperman prepare for day 1 of continentals.  I play him in 3 games with my ranger+mirror/urukhai against choke/moria archery, trust me nazguls, and some other deck and he beats me in all 3 games!  Kupe is gonna win day 1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I try to go down to the hotel bar at 1 or so and apparently it closes at 12, how gay.  I wander back and play some more games and head to bed, but i hadn&#39;t met up with Chris at all so i have no sleeping bag, and no blanket, so i wake up freezing and with half a cold.  I head back over to the con at around 11 and stop by the decipher booth, they still did not have the faramir cards, but they were starting to put out the lotr rpg books.  The books looked cool so i pick one up, and they tell me that i am the first person ever to buy that book! wtf.  I stop back at the tournament hall to see how day 1 was going.  Kupe was not doing too well, i think he lost to some kid playing 25 gondor pump cards (lurtz against aragorn, take 2, no, daggar strike, swordsman x2, i win, lurtz dies.  or 4 guys against aragorn boromir and frodo, valiant man x2, pump aragorn up some, i take 1 wound)  Chris Fanchi wins day 1 with a moria swarm deck that was metaed perfectly against all the twilight denial going around, and Hayes takes 2nd, losing only to Chris.  i play some random games with people like Eric Topham and William Cruse with the hobbit mirror deck and it didn&#39;t lose, so i was feeling good.  We get ready for the team tournament, my team includes me, Andrew Howard, Eric Olson, and Al Schafer.  don&#39;t remember much of the details of the games, except in the first game i got timed out by some new guy just as i got to 8 and was gonna double to 9.  i ended up getting the timed win, but it seems like in every big tournament at a con that i play in i play one guy who&#39;s at his first tournament and gets timed out, 45 minutes just isn&#39;t enough.  anyways, i&#39;m 3-0, and howard and olson are 2-1, we think about dropping and going to eat, but we find out we still have a chance at winning the whole thing and a set of realms foil, so we stay in... bad choice.  I get pit up against Will Cruse with the white arrows sauron deck that i&#39;ve seen him play several times.  his minion side is very simple, the cost 1 trackers, guys that excert to wound, and 4x bowmen, 4x UTWE, and 4x Hate.  His fellowship was there to help discard important fellowship cards out of your hand, hopefully the sleep or sentinels you just drew.  anyways i knew what he was playing so i tried to keep wounds on my guys to a minimum. but it wasn&#39;t working so well.  at one site i just dropped all my companions from my hand, but after he got me down to 6 companions he enqueaed aragorn 3 times and then hated.  i couldn&#39;t draw a sentinels the whole game and got overwhelmed at site 8.  So i find out that everyone on our team lost the last game!!!! so we head out to hooters to eat and then go back to the hotel.  We meet up with Brian Hunter who was there to win the SW:TCG world championships with his broken vaders.  I think about changing the hobbit mirror deck to moria because of the heavy choke being played, but i didn&#39;t know what people were doing to their decks overnight so i just stay with uruk-hai.  <br>
<br>
Day 2!!!!!<br>
<br>
<cut right to the games><br>
before i start i must say that it is incredibly difficult to remember lotr games, i might be mistaken about what happened in some of the games, but i think i got the general flow of each game down correctly at least.<br>
<br>
game 1, vs Matthew Yakobina, rangers choke horn w/ uruk-hai<br>
<br>
i win the bid, get out some elf allies but not both galadriel and mirror, move to my site 2 ferry, and stop.  his turn he moves to 3.  i get to 3 on my turn.  his turn he&#39;s got a nice setup with and moves to 4, i drop saruman and nothing else.  he stops.  my turn i get out mirror and move to 4 and stop too.  his turn he moves to 5, i play another saruman and nothing else, he has ballz and moves to 6, i can&#39;t get out enough guys to do anything important.  my turn i move to site 5 and he gets out saruman and 2 uruks, i take some wounds but can&#39;t afford to double move, i have about half my deck left and gob is in there.  his turn he moves to 7, takes a couple wounds or something, and stops.  I move to 6 and stop, still haven&#39;t drawn the gob yet.  His turn he moves to 8 and i put down another saruman, i think he&#39;s worried about gob so he just doubles to 9, i get out like 4 uruk-hai against his 4 guys, but boromir horns in 2 guys, and i can&#39;t kill two guys to get a uruk on frodo on the fierce skirmish, one more minion woulda done it.  FL 1<br>
<br>
game 2, vs Matt Quinn, frodo aragorn choke w/ some minion.  <br>
<br>
i bid 7 to his 5, so i win and go first.  he decided it is not worth it to switch his start and just starts frodo and new aragorn.  i stop at two, he drops boromir and armor and sword and doubles to 3, i drop enquea and kill boromir, and aragorn takes a couple wounds. and on my turn i start mirroring stuff out of his hand and stop at 3.  he moves to 4 but forgets to heal his wounds off of aragorn! i think he moves to 5 a turn later and i get out two uruk-hai and thats game. FW 4<br>
<br>
game 3, vs Greg Pers, rangers choke w/ uruk-hai<br>
<br>
apparently, yesterday was Greg&#39;s first tournament ever, and he finished in the top 16 in day 1 to qualify.  So i&#39;m thinking this will be an easy game.  but Greg was to prove me wrong.  he played very well for someone who&#39;s never played in a tournament before.  basically i run and mirror, and he kills my guys, and galadriel gets killed by a tower assassin. and he starts dropping uruk raiders.  i&#39;m at 6 and he&#39;s at 5, i move to 7, its his no archery site, and he drops 3 raiders and someone else on me, i lose everyone except frodo gandalf and aragorn, all with a couple wounds, does not look good.  his turn he moves to six, and i put down a warrior and troop.  This is where his inexperience comes in, apparently he doesn&#39;t really know what the troop does, so he puts him up against frodo, and he says pass.  this saves me, since i was likely gonna get killed the next turn.  i say, i pass too, thats game.  he gets a shocked look on his face and i point out that his frodo is only a power 4 to my 9.  FW 7<br>
<br>
a cheap way to win against a good guy that was just inexperienced, but i&#39;ll take it.<br>
<br>
game 4, vs Maxim Briand, Trust me Uruk-hai<br>
<br>
this game i actually get a first turn galadriel mirror and dominate his hand from the begining.  basically we both single move to 3. i move to 4 and nothing happens, he drops a lot of pool and moves to 4 too, i drop a ravager and lurtz.  i have 3 or 4 ambitions on table, and 2 savagery in hand.  he shoots lurtz with legolas, i guess he was gonna try to kill both and double move.  he has gandalf with sword and gimli with axe and bracers, and trust me out.  he puts gandalf on lurtz and the ravager on gimli.  his gandalf is a power 12 to my 13, so he excerts once for trust me to be 15 to my 13.  I could play my savagery, but i wanted to kill gandalf then and there, so i ditch an ambition, hoping that he takes that to mean i don&#39;t have a savegery in hand, and excerts gandaleasterlingain to get to two wounds, when i would lower the boom and kill gandalf.  so we&#39;re 15 to 15, he takes the bait and excerts gandaleasterlingain, he&#39;s 18 to my 15, now that gandalf has 2 wounds, i savagery and lurtz is 19 to 18.  he excerts a third time to be 21 to 19.  i ditch another ambition.  he starts putting gandalf in his dead pile, and i was like, no no do you have another action in this skirmish, he says pass, so i savagery the guy fighting gimli.  so both my guys are +4 and fierce, and i think i ended up killing 3 of his guys that turn.  i simply overwhelm him at the next site. FW 10<br>
<br>
game 5, vs Joe Dineaga, rangers choke / uruk-hai<br>
<br>
don&#39;t remember much of what happened, i jump ahead and stay ahead, i have a hard time dropping minions on him, at a couple sites just dropped saruman by himself to try to scare him into not double moving.  i ended up just out running him and getting to site 9. FW 13<br>
<br>
game 6, vs Chris Fanchi, gandalf?/moria<br>
<br>
Chris is playing moria, i stop at two knowing i can run on moria later, i get mirror going early and mirror a swarm out of his hand, turns out that was the only one he played so it helped a lot.  moving to site 5 he had both troll and balrog in hand, but i pull neither and he drops both on me, doesn&#39;t do too much damage with my hobbits and filbert around, but i have to stop.  because he&#39;s not playing choke my uruks have no trouble stopping him too so i get to site 6 before him.  i run to 8 and gets everyone but frodo and aragorn killed in the process, but he has decked himself by this point so i&#39;m not worried about a huge swarm, altho&#39; aragorn does have two wounds on him. his turn he moves and i just dump cards out of my hand the best i could, and i draw into an aragorn.  use elrond and celeborn to draw cards on my turn and draw another aragorn.  so i move to site 9, he drops 2 moria scouts and a troll, with fully healed aragorn, filbert, and frodo with 2 wounds on him that was game. FW 16<br>
<br>
So i finish 5-1 and knew i made the top 8 for sure.  i hang around and i&#39;m the #5 seed going into the playoffs, as the lowest 5-1.<br>
<br>
game 7, vs Will Dineaga, ranger&#39;s choke / uruk-hai<br>
<br>
Will is playing the same deck his brother played.  i had not lost a single bid the entire tournament so i bid the same, 7.  well he bids 7 too and wins the toss so he goes first.  i draw galadriel first turn and run to 3 so i don&#39;t fall behind.  i get ahead of him at 6 but i could not draw one of my 3 mirrors for the life of me, and i can&#39;t draw my map either, so i move to 7 and all my allies gets discarded, and my guys take a huge beating and i think i&#39;m left with frodo, legolas and gandalf.  he moves to 7 and stops, i move to 8 and he puts down saruman and 3 uruk-hai, that&#39;s game. FL<br>
<br>
I&#39;m disapointed at the loss, but i think i did pretty well overall to get in the top 8, so i&#39;m pretty happy, all the lower seeds lost the first round, so i end up at #5.  i pick up 10 packs, a rook deck box, and a foil orthanc berserker for my troubles.  i&#39;m hungry as hell so i want to go eat, and i find vessey but we lost howard and olson.  we call howard&#39;s cell and they went back to the hotel and was about to order pizza, so head back.  Howard picked up like 6 JP OTSDs and we play this funny format where you open all the packs and put all the LS and DS cards together and play.  i play howard and my jawas follow his sandwhirl around to drain him, and i save a lot of force and throw down a sick beat down squad with 3 different ways of excluding his guys from battle, so he drains me for 1 the lower passages and i drain him for 5 everywhere else on tatooine, so i win.<br>
<br>
I head to bed at around 3, get up at 10 and head back to the con one last time, and then meet up with chris at noon and head home to minnesota.<br>
