But do to the fact that I am still holding an ice pack on my head recovering from the recklessness that took place, I must apologize for anything that doesnt quite make sense. <br>
<br>
I guess Im going to knock off my fellow Team PCA player, Bad Player, and break this up into days. I guess thats the easiest way to go. <br>
<br>
Wednesday: <br>
	Let me tell you, 10 hours in the car when you cant fall asleep is BALLS. We got into Columbus at 4 AM and let me tell you another thing. The city of Columbus is BUSTED. Theres one 24 hour business in the whole city and its NOT a gas station! Its a White Castle in the middle of the ghetto! *rolls eyes* Oh wait, were into Thursday morning now. My bad!<br>
<br>
Thursday morning: <br>
	Ok, yeah. Here we go. So another busted thing about Columbus is that check-in isnt until 3 PM (What kind of a hotel has check-in at 3?!) So were kickin it, half dead, in the White Castle drinking coffee and reading useless information in the newspaper (Did you know that its only legal to buy fireworks in Ohio if you sign an affidavit that says youll take them to another state in 24 hours. HOW BUSTED IS THAT?!). It was around the time that a homeless guy came in flailing his arms and bellowing about the blood of Jesus giving him the right to one shoe, a coffee, murdering people and that shoe being on his left foot that we decided the Con would be a safer place to kick it until 3. <br>
	Yeah, nothing was going on at the Con except for my butt crack being exposed because I was wearing these pants that my butt wasnt big enough to fit it so every time I sat down, sometime saw that I have a drug problem. SAY NO TO CRACK! <br>
<br>
Thursday evening: <br>
	After we got the hotel situated, I got all fly-looking and stuff to go out for the evening. It was around this time that I saw fellow Team PCA player, Clint Hays, and had the pleasure of eating dinner with him at this micro brewery with a HORRIBLE cover band. Oh yeah, and another BUSTED thing about Ohio. Did anybody see fireworks? HELL NO! I didnt see a single one while I was there. As a matter of fact, I saw more shot off on Wednesday night in Atlanta then we did in BUSTED Ohio and you cant even buy fireworks in Georgia. <br>
	After walking around a bit, I had the pleasure of meeting Mike Dalton, Matt Lush and Heidi at the bar then spent the rest of my night in the Huntsville, AL crews room waiting for the other half of the crew to arrive (which wasnt until 2:30 I might add). And instead of going to sleep, I get this brilliant idea to play Everquest in the middle of the night and everybody was like hell yeah so we walked all the way down there to find the Open Gaming not open at night (WHO EVER HEARD OF GAMERS SLEEPING AT NIGHT? THATS BUSTED!). Oh wait, Im into Friday morning. Man, Im bad at this mixing days together thing.<br>
<br>
Friday morning: <br>
	I got a total of ONE hour of sleep so I walked into the LOTR tournament expecting to suck. I dont remember these games all that well and this is the important part I suppose but anybody that wants to know how my games went should just know IM A BEAST and the FEAR ME! *flexes* If you want to skip over all the babbling, go down to Game 6 against Charlie Herren. THAT GAME WAS THE MONEY SHOT! Uhm, yeah, here are the games.<br>
<br>
¤Game 1: -VS- This dude dressed in green that was all trying to be a sweet-talking man like Hey, even if I lose, at least I lost to the prettiest LOTR player. Translation: uhm, yeah I suck, so please dont do what you usually do and demolish my balls by  tightening a vice on them because youre a beast like that. That was a record 4-minute win I think. He played Uruk-hai with this retarded [bad] deck and I played Uruks with THE MONEY DECK. He bid 5 and went first. He moved to 2 and I overwhelmed Gandalf (his start) so Frodo was all naked and stuff. *giggle* I moved to 2 and nothing important happened because Im a beast. *flexes* He moved to 3 and I overwhelmed his Aragorn so WHAT DO YOU KNOW?! Frodo is all naked again (I had fun during this game). Yeah, so I did my unimportant move because I knew at this point that he had to pull something magical out his butt to win but yeah, I moved to 3. He moved to 4 and I overwhelmed his poor little naked Frodo and I enjoyed is thiiiiiiissss much. (3)<br>
<br>
¤Game 2: -VS- Hrm who did I play? *scratches head* OH YEAH! THIS TOTAL CHUMP! Get this, I have only made one deck, THE MONEY DECK, Balls Deep in Moria, and this chump PLAYS MY MONEY DECK! I was like hey, cool, thats my deck, and hes like no its not, and Im like HOW DARE YOU PLAY MY MONEY SHOT DECK AND THEN TRY TO SAY ITS NOT MINE. I was about to donkey punch that fool. Anyways, Its a pretty neck and neck game and Im ahead one most of it. So at 7, I mirror both his ARVs and Im think HAHA! CHUMP! YOU SUCK! J00 LOSE! because hes at 6. Well, during his turn, HE PULLS THIS CARD OUT HIS BUTT to get the two ARVs back in his draw deck and Elronds to get them back. Yeah, one card difference makes it so its not my deck anymore. Balls to the wall, that kid pissed me off. (4)<br>
<br>
¤Game 3: (This is where the games start getting blurry) -VS- ANOTHER CHUMP! It was different this time though. He was playing his own deck but check it, I HAD TO PEE SO BAD! I had to pee really bad when they started calling out pairings but I decided it could wait. Well hes playing something stupid or whatever and we get to 9 and IM DYING! I hurt so bad and Im thinking if I even move, Im going to piss all over the floor and then that would make a much more interesting TR so Im seriously debating peeing right there. Anyways, were at 9 and theres 2 fierce minions (one Uruk and an Enquea) and another Uruk and hes got exhausted Aragorn and exhausted Gimli and no Filibert so Ive won it unless he pulls something out his butt, right? BUT NO! HES SITTING THERE STARING AT IT AND IM OVER HERE DYING! So I lose my temper and Im like YO! CONCEDE! YOURE GOING TO LOSE! IVE GOT TO PEE! CONCEDE! and he wants to play it out like a chump so I let him and HE LOST! Bah. We did share some intimate moments throughout the game though when I was in pain and bellowing out that I had to pee. I had never run so fast when I was running for that pink-painted wall after the game. It was the money shot. (7)<br>
<br>
¤Game 4: -VS- One of the 8 shy Canadians that wouldnt talk to me much (the 9th loud and outgoing one obviously being Dom). I think his name was Mike but this guy played well with a good deck and seriously deserved to be in the final. Youd expect me to be talking smack because he smashed my face into the table with his big fellowship and Moria swarms (with Enquea and Tower Assassin) but he was a cool guy despite the fast that the only 2 words I heard him say were numbers when he mirrored me. Hehe. Basically, at site 7, my fellowship was pretty bruised up and he put out an UNGODLY amount of minions out and I just shook his hand and was like Go on with yo bad self, Canadian dude. Yous a pimp.<br>
<br>
¤Game 5: -VS- Elissa something. She was one of the 4 girls playing (Heidi, Kim, Elissa and I). Heidi and Kim being the cute ones and me being the loud one, you can narrow it down to who she was. ANYWAYS, around this time, I was very very tired and I had my huge coffee and huge Dr. Pepper barely keeping me alive but the only reason I decided to play was because by the time I go back from the bathroom, pairings were being called out and I didnt want to cause them trouble by dropping. She played Uruks and Mirror but a less complicated deck then mine (just incase you hadnt figured out by now, I was playing the money deck). She made it to 9. My hand was all fellowship and shadow buffers.<br>
<br>
¤Game 6: -VS- CHARLIE HERREN! Ok, this is the money shot game. Both of us were pretty tired and we both wanted to drop but its funny that we would get paired together because were 2 out of 3 Team PCA players that were playing (Clint Hays being the 3rd).  I get the idea that we should play Paper, Rock, Scissor (best 2 out of 3) to see who gets it. So due to the special circumstances and needing extra space due the physical effort needed to play in this extreme way, we sat at another table different from our pairings seat where nobody else was sitting (with the judges permission of course). OK, Game 1: 1, 2, 3, shoot. NOOOO! HE GOES ROCK AND I GO SCISSOR! D*mn. Im down one so I stop to take a breather because Im a little nervous at this point. Ok Game 2: 1, 2, 3, shoot. UNBELIEVABLE PEOPLE! WE BOTH GO PAPER! So we both scoot up on the edges of our table after a quick breather and stretch. The pressures on as we go into Game 3: 1, 2, 3, SHOOT! NOOOO! I WENT ROCK AND HE STUCK WITH PAPER! WHAT WAS I THINKING! CHARLIE DOES IT! HE DEFEATS THE MUNCHKINATOR (oh yeah, up until now, I was 4 and 0 against Charlie in tourneys). We beat the earlier record at a record time of ONE MINUTE! <br>
<br>
After that massive game, I was pooped so I passed out until the night time. <br>
<br>
Friday evening:  <br>
	The Atlanta crew (Matt Pint Baldwin, Corey, Dan Brown, Eric, Charlie Herren and I) kicked it at the bar with some Mortons List and nice crowd. We spent the vast majority of the time playing some serious Mortons list (the best quests being the race quest where we played drunken Red light, Green light, the making money quest where we had make escapades to gain a dollar [Matt Baldwin put a cigar out on his arm, I switched shirts with Matt Lush and Corey wore my see through black over shirt for 30 minutes] and who can forget the going clubbing quest when we found the infamous party on the 20th floor). Its safe to say Charlie as well as myself and a few others had a wee bit too much to drink that night, but dont worry, pictures will be coming soon. <br>
<br>
Saturday: <br>
	I chilled around the RPG room and exhibit hall most of this day. I had the pleasure of hanging out with Dom a lot while playing magic, LOTR and having lunch. Besides the occasional having no idea what the other was saying, I really enjoyed myself. <br>
	Oh yeah and when we met Gimli, when he asked Charlie if he went to a university and he said yeah (a lie), Gimli called him a start, tubby fellow. That was funny, I must say. Oh yeah, and he had cool shoes on.<br>
	That night, we drank some more and playing Mortons List but I called it an earlier night as all of us were still very hung over. <br>
	<br>
Sunday: <br>
	I woke up early to head to the con in the morning before we had to head out and was walking around in the exhibit hall with Heidi until mysteriously she was gone and Dom was behind me. haha. We ate breakfast before I had to leave and then I headed out to an uneventful 10 hour drive home when Charlie and I got a beautiful picture of a Big Bone Lick State Park sign. <br>
<br>
Overall, the weekend was crazy but Munchkin (with the Sabac of course [those of you who were with me during my second night of drunken stupor will know what Sabac is]) had an awesome time on her first trip to Origins. <br>
<br>
Big ups to:<br>
Sabac, everybody I met and hung out with (Dom, Heidi, Lush, the crazy shy Canadians, Berta, Hayes, Hayes little brother that got smashed in a hardcore game of Uno, Alex Tennet, those judges that put up with my trying to steal the giant Aragorn card, Mike Dalton, the other Mike that was on the 20th floor with us, the Huntsville (AL) crew, Eric, THE DUDE IN THE SLIM JIM SHIRT THAT SAW WHAT I DID WITH MY CIGARETTE BUT DIDNT TELL ANYBODY! YOU ROCK! And anybody else I may have forgotten, my apologies), Gimli, the guys that made Mortons List (it was great hanging out with you guys), the poor midget (yes she was actually a midget) that cleaned up the horrendous mess that came from our dearly beloved, Charlie after he drank a wee bit too much, to the entire Atlanta and Team PCA that could make it [BIG BIG ups to my crew], to Mikey Kessling who couldnt make it but is my other half and has tons of pictures to look at from it [I named my deck Essence of Kessling in honor of him] and a very big big ups to Clint Hays (who did really well in the tourney and Im so proud of) and Dom (who is crazy but was really fun getting to know). <br>
<br>
Big downs: TO COLUMBUS OHIO FOR BEING A BUSTED CITY!! WHAT KIND OF A CITY HAS A WENDYS THAT CLOSES AT 6?! Bah. <br>
