I played my 4 hobbit + men of gondor/moria + troll deck.  It did well, the fellowship side moved nicely, never was it really in too much danger and the moria swarm was reasonably effective.  I did however lose 1 game to John Lolli, partially due to a mistake I made at site 8 that cost me 5 orcs in play, partly because my moria swarm just didn&#39;t come together right.  He went from 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, and then 7-9 on me (while my hobbits got a slow start vs. the nazgul, but went 1-2, 2-3, 3-5, 5- 7, and were reasonably prepared to go 7-9).  Oh well, bunch of people ended up w/ 10 vps cause Andy Parks plays too slow and got 2 timed wins when he shoulda won as the only undefeated.  It however came down to the tiebreaker, 3 people tied at 34, while I was at 33 so I basically got nothing cause 1 of my opponent&#39;s got a timed win instead of a full win somewhere in there.  Those games just weren&#39;t exciting so there will be no report on that tournament...<br>
<br>
	Sunday however I trek out to Lansdale, PA, and manage to find NeoQuest Games.  1st off, the store is fantastic, all the gaming systems you could want, hooked up computers, cool stuff all over, it was like being in your own house, if you were mad rich and wanted to create a sweet playroom for you and all your &quot;haven&#39;t-grown-up-yet&quot; friends.  Everything was top-notch, down to the chairs and tables (which were most important, as we were there to play cards :).  The crowd was a veritable SW:CCG reunion, Kim and Bob Caton, Ted P., John Lolli, Doug Faust, George Gundry, Bill Kafer, Greg Shaw, of the 11 players, 8 were former (and some current) local SW:CCG players.  Kim was the tournament director for the day.  I arrived about 40 minutes early, not really knowing how long it&#39;d take to get there, and having an urge to test out the new deck I was carrying.  Over the past 2 weeks I&#39;d talked w/ Alex Tennet and seen him play some games online w/ his Frodo and Aragorn deck.  My initial reaction was &quot;that would never work, you&#39;d never got to site 9 w/ it&quot;.  After further thought, I still didn&#39;t think you could get to site 9 against say, a good Sauron deck, however who says you need to get to site 9 to win? :).  Played many games against it myself, winning the only 4 we finished (1 I had to leave in the middle of, but he was prolly going to win).  Despite beating the deck, I saw it&#39;s strength, it was very frustrating to play against, and had much potential so after getting a decklist from Alex I slapped together my own version.  So, I&#39;m a bit early, and instead of grabbing food like I should of I play a game for fun against Gundry and basically wreck him w/ my troll while he doesn&#39;t manage to get enough going w/ his own moria+troll deck.  1st test passed (if you can consider Gundry a test).  We finish and it&#39;s time to start the real thing...<br>
<br>
1st game: vs. Doug Faust (Elves+Aragorn/Sauron damage)<br>
<br>
I played Doug in the last game of the Chase the Can tournament last month, and I was playing my nazgul half which didn&#39;t do much to him, I really thought my moria side would&#39;ve had a better shot, now I get to find out.  I know his minion side is nasty (Bowmen, UtWE, Hate, etc.), but I feel confident the pool denial will help me a lot.  He wins the bid and goes 1st, pulls Aragorn w/ Pony and moves easy to site 3 as I hold my good minions in hand (wasn&#39;t gonna do damage early anyway).  I drop some stuff, including Sting, remove the pool, and move to my site 2 giving him 3 pool (unfortunately didn&#39;t find a No Stranger) so he is able to play a tracker and an UTWE on me.  He moves to site 4 w/ I think Gandalf out now too (as well as Aragorn&#39;s Bow on Aragorn), I drop like a troll and some orcs and he just exerts to get rid of the troll.  Next site I think I drop another Troll, and Gandalf and Arwen each take the hits.  He stops there, w/ basically every non-frodo companion out exhausted.  Meanwhile I stroll into site 3, 2 pool, he can&#39;t do anything.  He moves on to site 6 after healing some (Athelas and a copy of Aragorn I think) and manages to live through the stuff I drop down there.  I do a ton of damage, but like none of it sticks.  I stroll on to site 4 where he actually gets to play something w/ his like 4 pool.  So, he heals up most of his guys at 6 and moves to the Wilderland.  I manage to get out 6 minions, he&#39;s got 5 guys, which means Frodo takes 2 of them, he&#39;s got nothing to boost Frodo so that&#39;s game.<br>
<br>
2nd game: vs. George Gundry (Gandalf+Weed/Moria+Troll)<br>
<br>
We play the same matchup we played before the tournament.  I&#39;m not too pleased, as he knows what&#39;s coming, but I doubt he can really do much about it...  He starts rare Gandalf and fetches the Cart.  Rare Boro and Blade come down 1st turn.  He makes site 3 easily.  I move and he can&#39;t play much (or doesn&#39;t).  I&#39;m not too well setup for his trip through Moria, but I do get a troll out at 1 site, and a bunch of orcs at another, which kills off Gandalf at site 6 I think.  I make my way up to site 4 w/ no problems while he goes for the double move to site 8 as he finished off everything at site 7, but he&#39;s met w/ the troll and a couple of goblins.  With only Boromir and Frodo there&#39;s nothing he can do, the troll eats Boro and then Frodo.<br>
<br>
3rd game: vs. Scott Landis (Elves+Aragorn/Nazgul)<br>
<br>
I win the bid and make him go 1st.  He fetched Aragorn, drops Choice of Luthien, Last Alliance and moves on, I drop random orcs I don&#39;t want in hand and Aragorn and Legolas deal w/ them easily.  I move easily as he&#39;s playing on my sites and his nazgul are too expensive to play.  He goes to site 4 and meets the troll, who meets lots of archery.  He stops.  I move in to site 3, again nothing.  He moves out to 5 and another troll hits, he heals Aragorn w/ Athelas, and manages to survive as Aragorn and Arwen each take a turn w/ the troll.  I move to site 4, and I think he still plays nothing.  He moves to site 6 and I play my 3rd and final troll, he had healed Aragorn down to 2 wounds, and Arwen was at 1, but he makes a mistake in not using Choice of Luthien.  Neither of them can take on the troll in this situation, so the troll eats Legolas, and then Arwen.  I move to site 5 and he drops the Witch King w/ Morgul Gates, and a Nazgul Sword, but Aragorn just takes 2 wounds.  He heals up Aragorn and moves to site 7, Confluence.  So Aragorn&#39;s Bow is useless, and I drop like 5 orcs and that&#39;s game (forget if he had a PAtHs or not but I had armories out).<br>
<br>
4th game: vs. Greg Shaw (Rangers+Merry/Uruks)<br>
<br>
Last game, I was the only undefeated.  There was talk of a final confrontation, but that was left kinda up in the air.  We bid, he won and chose the Pony.  He starts rare Boro and common Merry and fetches premmy Aragorn.  Puts No Stranger on both his rangers!  I don&#39;t do much to him from site 1-4, as he doesn&#39;t give much pool, and he stops there.  Meanwhile he really can&#39;t even play an uruk (but he does drop a condition or 2).  Site 5 he meets the troll, but Sam and Thrarin are both out so it&#39;s no big thing.  I start to head through Moria and he still doesn&#39;t put up much resistance.  He moves into site 6 and I don&#39;t do much damage.  Site 7 however I drop a bunch of orcs and I have swarms out as well.  I had seen his hand w/ Sting, and despite being able to put like 4 orcs on frodo it&#39;s not enough w/ his 2x Hobbit Intuition.  So I force him to play his Intuitions, and I think I overwhelm Aragorn (w/ a bunch of goblins going to swarms).  I venture into site 6 w/ relative ease.  He moves to site 8 and faces 7 orcs, including the Keyward, and a Troll, that&#39;s game.<br>
<br>
	So, in the end I&#39;m the only undefeated.  The 2 players at 3-1 are Doug and Scott, both of whom I beat, so it&#39;s decided a final confrontation isn&#39;t really necessary.  However they&#39;re both tied exactly, so they do play to see who wins the uncommon foil and the extra pack for 2nd place.  I get 3 packs (pulled a rare Gandalf) and a replica ring so I can try turning invisible.  After the tournament I get in some fun games while the snow piles up outside and I really should be going home (or atleast eating some food as it&#39;s now like 5:30 and I haven&#39;t eaten all day).  However Bob Caton wants to see the deck, skeptical of it&#39;s power as I once was.  His dwarves did well against it, while the Sauron half did little.  Site 7 saw a bunch of orcs and rare Aragorn exerting to fight many of them.  Swarms was out, so all those orcs were there at site 8 as well, Gimli never found his axe so that&#39;s game.  To complete the Caton Sweep I play a game w/ Kim, her elven archery/nazgul deck.  She knows the deck, and decides to let me go ahead.  She trails right behind me every site, but w/ her slow movement I&#39;m able to setup my hand and get a troll out at site 4, 5, and 6 which is more than she can handle.  I don&#39;t see many nazgul, never losing a fight so I don&#39;t get blade tipped, aragorn did manage to accumulate 3 black breaths, 3 athelas, no stranger, a bow, rangers sword and saga of elendil (that&#39;s 10 cards on him :).  So, the deck goes 7-0 on the day, no doubt it&#39;s powerful.  It&#39;s not unbeatable or anything, helps to know how to play against it, w/ the right draw it&#39;s very tough to beat.  Not overly fun to play with however, prolly find a new deck for next weekend.  So, I finally head out at like 6:30, grab some Wendy&#39;s, and trek home in the snow/sleet/rain.  Didn&#39;t take much more than 2 hours so it wasn&#39;t that bad, I did fear for my life (and that of my new car however).  Fun time, great competition, look forward to more tournaments like this. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3241&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
