This time around Michael &#8220; Garibaldi &#8220; Armistead was going as well.  We had playtested a couple days throughout the week, and at the last minute I changed up my Rangers deck to add Boromir and Armor, to hang a little better with Uruks and Cave Trolls.  I also tuned up my Ringwraith deck, so it was back to Of Rangers and Ringwraiths for today&#8217;s event.  The forecast had called for sixty degree weather with some wind, but apparently the weatherman was smoking some Old Toby that day, because the wind was gusting at 60-70 miles an hour and it was snowing.  This was going to make for some horrendous smoke breaks.  On the way, Mike and I realized we were starving, and we were not going to indulge in Gamers Gathering Snack Bar of Doom.  We stopped off at Wendy&#8217;s for some Double Stacks, but I didn&#8217;t have time to finish both of mine.  We got into the store to see once again Ian Monteith, Will Prather and Danny Hummel had shown.  Brian Montez was hosting the event, and after some pulpit pounding preaching from the store owner about not bringing in your own drinks and not using profanity, we were ready to play some LOTR.<br>
<br>
GAME ONE <br>
<br>
vs.  Will Prather Sauron Orcs <br>
<br>
Once again Will is playing Sauron, so I know to bid low.  We went back and forth , with nothing really exciting happening, until about Site 5.  At this point Legolas was exerted to exhaustion, and a lame little Orc appeared and said &#8220; I Hate you ! &#8220;  and Legolas was so hurt he died.  In order to stay alive, I played Boromir to take the Elf&#8217;s place.  By Site 7 Will had lost a few companions to Nazgul, and finally at Site 8 Ulaire Attea and Ulaire Toldea both appeared, brandishing swords.  They kill off the Companions they are assigned to fight in the first Skirmish round, then both turn Fierce, faceless gazes to Frodo, who was frozen with fear.  You guessed it, Frodo wet his little Hobbit breeches and died with soggy pants on.  <br>

I hate to say it, but it is always satisfying to beat Will.  He is a good player with a great attitude.  He just happens to be rated higher than me right now, so taking him out brings some satisfaction.  Thanks for the good game, Will.<br>
<br>
GAME TWO <br>
<br>
vs. David Sampsel Giant Fellowship / Moria Swarm.<br>
<br>
Sweet, I have to play David.  David used to play Star Wars quite a bit, but never really placed high in any events, but he kept coming and kept having fun.  David is alright, but he is annoying to play against.  Basically, the game was mine from the start, or so I thought.  He bid to go first and moved to Weatherhills to face ofeasterlingainst two Nazgul.  On my turn I shoot away any annoying Moria goofballs.  On his next turn, he comes to the Ford of Bruinen, and two more Nazgul come out to play, killing someone, I cant remember who.  You will have to forgive me on this one, but this game was a pisser.  Basically I kill a bunch of his Companions, with my Boromir taking a dirt nap at the Bridge after facing the Cave Troll  ( who David dorkily referred to as Fluffy )<br>
At Site 7, David gets to play his Site, and it is the site with no Archery.  Sweet.  I hold my own against his swarm by playing ARV to exhaust some of the beefier Orcs, and play Paths to stay alive.  Aragorn gets overwhelmed at this site as well, if my memory serves me.  However, this is when things go to poop.  David moves his Fellowship to Site 7, plays ARV on my two Nazgul, and then KILLS THEM TO ARCHERY. SHADY!  I completely let it get by me.  Those minions would have killed another Companion or two, but instead they are sleeping with the fishes.  ( Watch the Godfather ) David double jumps to Site 9 on his next turn for the stolen victory.  Ian reminded me after the game of what SHOULD have happened, and I kicked myself.  David immediately started boasting that he had found a game he could beat me at, to which I replied that cheating is hardly handing me a defeat.  A bunch of the players heard this exchange and started talking about how David also cheated at Star Wars.  Shady. Oh well, I&#8217;ll take the loss, but my eyes will be peeled the next time I sit across from David.  David&#8217;s defense was that he forgot, which I guess makes sense, since I forgot too.  He even offered me a candy bar.  How sweet.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, David is a nice enough guy, but I hate playing against him.  At least he had a hot girlfriend at one time. <br>
FL +1/+4<br>
<br>
After that fiasco I definitely needed a smoke, and Mike and I endured hurricane gales to suck down some cancer stick.  For those younger readers out there, smoking in 60 mile an hour winds is by no means cool, in fact it is down right retarded, and I highly suggest leaving smoking alone.  <br>
<br>
GAME THREE <br>
<br>
vs.  Thomas Harris  Men and Nazgul<br>
<br>
Thomas won my last event, beating a lot of great players to do so, but for some reason he has no confidence going into this game.  He is playing a revamped version of the deck he won my tournament with, and I am a little worried, to be honest.  During this game, we went back and forth stalling each other at every site with Ringwraiths.  My Fellowship seemed to be holding up a little better, however, and they trudged all the way to Site 9.  Thomas couldn&#8217;t draw a single minion, so I basically walked this game.<br>
FW +3/+7<br>
<br>
Thomas is almost depressing to play against, and I wish he would lighten up a little.  I can almost never hear anything he says when we play.  Thomas, if you&#8217;re out there, have fun.  Hey, at least you&#8217;re not David Sampsel.  Just kidding.  No, really, I&#8217;m just kidding.<br>
<br>
GAME FOUR<br>
<br>
vs.  Michael Perucca  Boromir and Merry / Sauron Nastiness<br>
<br>
Michael is a younger kid, who comes to these events with his Dad.  When this pairing gets announced, I am hoping this kid doesn&#8217;t play like his Dad, who times out his games about 75 % of the time.  As it turns out, Michael is a careful, but decent player who doesn&#8217;t take five minutes to play one minion.  We go back and forth, with me killing off many of the Orcs he throws out with Archery.  My Nazgul get through to kill off Sam and Merry, with Boromir on his last leg.  At Site 6 Michael plays Aragorn with his Bow and Saga of Elendil AND Legolas with Tale of Gil-Galad.  Talk about a lucky break.  The rest of the game my Nazgul are getting exhausted at rivers and falling to arrows.  At Site 8 I am ahead, but Michael plays the site that adds 2 to the Archery total for every companion over 4.  This is combination with 4 Orc Bowmen puts a nasty hurting on my Fellowship, who cannot move again for the win.  Michael, on the other hand, has no problem exhausting every Ringwraith that comes at him with ARV, them putting them out with regular Archery fire.  He double jumps to Site 9 without even breaking a sweat.  Probably one of the better games of the day, but I lose anyway.  Nice work, Michael.<br>
FL +1/+8<br>
<br>
Once again, I really don&#8217;t mind losing to a good deck, played by a decent player.  This kid was polite, even offering his hand to shake.  Players like these make this game excellent to play.<br>
<br>
GAME FIVE<br>
<br>
vs. David Hausknecht  Rangers / Uruk-Hai<br>
<br>
David is another younger player, and he has a decent deck.  He killed off my Arwen right away with some puny Uruk and Lurtz&#8217;s Battle Cry.  Ouch.  We go back and forth until Site 6, where things get hairy. His Fellowship moves to Lothlorien Woods.  I play Ulaire Cantea with a Nazgul Sword.  David asks if I had any Maneuver actions, and I played Relentless Charge to wound Arwen and kill Legolas.  Then he plays ARV.  Huh ?  I didn&#8217;t like it, but he put Legolas in the dead pile and then assigned Cantea to Frodo, thinking he can play PATHS and kill off the big bad guy.  Instead, I play All Blades Perish, and you can actually hear Frodo crapping in his little Hobbit breeches this time. <br>
FW +3/+11 <br>
<br>
That was a shady win, and I feel bad, but then I realized that All Blades Perish would have kept Cantea alive anyway, and either Arwen, Legolas or both would have died anyway.  <br>
<br>
It was right about now that Joe Schlagheck erupted into a diatribe about how he was absolutely NOT gay, and that he could prove it, etc. etc.  Apparently someone said something somewhere questioning this poor boy&#8217;s sexuality, and now he feels like he has to defend himself in public venues.  Joe, if you&#8217;re gay, its OK.  Just ask Big Gay Al.  And no, I don&#8217;t want you to &#8220; prove &#8220; it, thanks.<br>
<br>
<br>
So out of a showing of 14 players I end up in 6th place.  Brian decides to try a new prize support method, giving one rare out of a pool of opened packs to second place and everyone down the line, like a draft, until the last place guy got a pick, then all of the leftovers going to first place.  Hmmmmm, seems kind of shady.  But it was not Brian&#8217;s fault.  He had to work with limited support from the store.  After preaching to us about reviving Decipher gaming and providing excellent prizes, the store took our $5 entry fee and gave Brian one pack per person plus 33 % of attendance.  So the store made about $ 3.68 per pack.  Wow, they made a bit of a profit.  Shady.  Anyway, when I went up for my rare draft, I took one of the two Legolas Greenleafs that was pulled from the packs.  Not bad.  <br>
