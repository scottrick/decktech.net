Sadly, no such luck, but at least it was sanctioned with exactly 8.  My Gondor Trust-Denial/Nazgul deck had worked fairly well last week, but the fellowship was a little fragile for my taste, and after last weeks top 3 players (me, Mike Mendoza, and Lisa Gansky) played Nazgul, I was expecting a fair Nazgul/Too Great and Terrible presence, so I decided to try my luck with a Horn deck (Boromir DoMT/Merry FTS start), and paired it with my usual Uruk shadow since I figured people would be preparing their decks for Nazgul.  So, the players arrived, people scrounged some cards off me to fill holes in their decks, as always, and we began.<br>
<br>
GAME 1:  Me vs Matt (Archery/Moria)<br>
Matts a fairly new player, but he was a good SWCCG player way back when, and hes using one of my extra decks since his collection isnt very big yet.  I went 4-0 with this deck a few weeks ago, so its definitely solid, but Im not worried about it.  He bids one to my zero, goes first, starts Greenleaf and Arwen DoE, gets Aragorn KiE with the Pony, drops a Rangers Sword and the Bow of the Galadhrim, and moves.  I play an Uruk Raider and an Uruk Lieutenant, he shoots down the Lieutenant with Legolas and the Raider dies to Aragorn after taking an archery wound.  He moves again, I draw 2 copies of Saruman, so I play one just to cycle my hand.  On my turn, I drop Aragorn HttWC with a Rangers Sword, Blade of Gondor, Armor, and Horn on Boromir, Elrond HtGG, and a Hobbit Sword on Merry.  I move, he gets down an orc, Boromir takes care of it, I move again, he gets down the Cave Troll and a couple of orcs.  Aragorn and Elrond kill the orcs, and Boromir takes a pair of wounds from the troll.  His turn, he plays Galadriel LotGW and Elrond HtGG and moves to Hollin, I drop Lurtz, a Lieutenant, and a Captain.  End result, Aragorn has a pair of wounds, Arwen is exhausted, and Legolas is dead from a fierce Lurtz (after he shot down the Lieutenant).  My turn, I drop Galadriel and exert her to play a few site 6 archers, then move to Hollin, kill the orcs he gets down, and stop.  He moves to 5, I play Saruman and a Captain, the Captain gets a Lieutenant, I take an archery wound, Aragorn beats one (but I keep it alive with Saruman), Arwen dies, and in the fierce Frodo gets overwhelmed.<br>

GAME 2:  Me vs Ben (Archery/Uruks)<br>
Ben is quickly becoming one of our better local players, and after last weeks beating of his Trust deck (check the tourney report, my Nazgul got dirty), I know hes out for blood.  So, he bids 5 to my zero, starts Arwen and Sam, gets Aragorn HttWC with the Pony, removes burdens with Sam, moves, I play Lurtz and a Sarumans Ambition, he tosses Sam out in front of Lurtz to prevent an overwhelm of someone else.  My turn, I play Aragorn and a few possessions, an Uruk comes down, Aragorn takes a pair of wounds, and I stop.  His turn, he plays a Rangers Sword, Armor, and Saga of Elendil, moves, I cant play anything, discard Saruman, he moves again to Hollin, I drop two Lieutenants and a Raider, Raider on Frodo, I dump the Ambition to overwhelm Frodo.<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
Highs<br>
-Killing Frodo at site 4, thats always good<br>
Lows<br>
-I feel bad for beating Ben so quickly<br>
<br>
So, were done already and all the other games are still at site 2 or 3, so we play again to kill some time while we wait.  This time he doesnt double into Hollin, but my fellowship sets up quickly and Im running ahead (1-3, 3-4, 4-6 untouched), so he has to double past the Bridge with Saruman following (at this point his fellowship is just Aragorn with Bow, Sword, and Brand, Arwen with Bow, and Frodo with Sting), I drop a Captain and use him to grab Lurtz, Lurtz does a couple wounds to Aragorn, I burn two Savageries to overwhelm Arwen, and dump two Ambitions to overwhelm Frodo in the fierce fight.  Okay, now the other games are finished, and in the game between my two main opponents (Mason Gilligan and Frank Pinkela), Frank wins (Mason always used to beat him down, but lately Frank just seems to be invincible against him) so Im playing him.<br>
<br>
GAME 3:  Me vs Frank (Gondor with Elf allies/Moria)<br>
He goes first, the early game is pretty uneventful, except for a scare from Such a Little Thing at site 2 (gotta love that first-turn Saga of Elendil giving Boromir 4 vitality), I then get set up with the Horn, a bunch of allies (although not Rumil or Galadriel), Legolas, Aragorns Bow, Blade of Gondor, Hobbit Swords on the hobbits, Armor on Boromir, etc.  Basically, he gets ahead early after Im stopped at site 2 by the Cave Troll, so Im forced to make a seemingly-suicidal double-move to 6 against the Cave Troll, he ends up getting out about 4 orcs as well, and after some directed archery (1 exertion short of being able to kill the Troll, so I settled for bagging some orcs, although he saved some with armories), Elrond and Orophin joined Merry in the dead pile (Merry was a Cave Troll snack at the bridge), but I was otherwise unhurt.  He moves to 7, and is pretty well set up at this point, with Aragorn at a strength 14 (Sword, Brand, Last Alliance), Boromir at a 10 (Blade and Brand, Armor), Galadriel and Elrond hanging out along with Galdor, a couple Gondor Bowmen sitting there, and Frodo looking pretty secure with Sting.  Im holding Lurtz, Saruman, a Captain, and a Troop, but I cant afford to play enough to do anything, so I hold them, hoping hell move again and get beat down.  Instead, he uses Sting, sees the beatdown crew Im holding, and stops.  I heal up, drop Galadriel, and use her to play Celeborn, Rumil, and Calaglin, and move.  He gets down some orcs, who do no wounds except for some Horn exertions, but a few survive (stupid non-damage+1 elves), so I stop since hes decked himself, and I figure hell either stop at 8 and Ill have an easy double for the win or hell double into 9 and get a beating at the Slopes.  So, I set up my hand, reconcile into mainly fellowship, with the same shadow cards as before now joined by an Orc Overseer and another Captain.  He moves, I play the extra Captain to get another card draw, it dies, he Stings my hand, looks at his own (only 3 cards), and decides he has to move.  I discard a card, and draw into 2 Savageries (I only have a couple cards left in my deck).  Theres now around 25+ twilight in the pool, and his fellowship is wound-free except for the Sting exertions on Frodo.  So, I play Saruman, Lurtz, Captain, exert the Captain for a Lieutenant, and play the Overseer from my hand.  He exerts Aragorn 3 times to try and take Lurtz out, I take two of them and prevent one with Saruman.  He then exerts Boromir once and Aragorn once (he has the Saga, so is now exhausted) and discards two Gondor bowmen, I spread out the 4 archery among my other minions.  He takes quite some time to assign, finally puts Lurtz on Aragorn, Troop on Boromir, Captain on Frodo, and leaves the Overseer by Frodo (assuming thats where Ill put it), but I decide to toss the Overseer on Boromir to try for a stronger fierce setup against Frodo.  He does the Aragorn fight, 14 to 13, I use my third Savagery of the game to get Lurtz to a 15 and kill Aragorn, he does the Boromir fight, 19 to his 7, I play the other Savagery to get to 21 overall, just enough to overwhelm him.  Now all three Uruks are fierce, and I have 32 strength to his 4.  He shows me the 3 stealth cards in his hand, and says he cant believe I didnt go for Frodo in the first skirmish.  Well, Frank, thats why.<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Highs<br>
-Uruk swarm at site 9; Saruman for being a beast<br>
-Surviving multiple trolls and multiple swarms<br>
Lows<br>
-Having to make some crazy double-moves to keep up with his fellowship<br>
<br>
Wow, that was a lot closer than I wanted it to be, but Frank and I have a long history of games coming down to site 9 (usually with me making crazy doubles into 9 against the Cave Troll and some orcs, then making Aragorn or Boromir defender+lots and die, having Frodo PATHS off the minions on him, then having the other man die to the Troll in the fierce (basically, leaving Frodo all alone but alive).  So, Im now the only undefeated player, so I just have to win my next game to take the tourney.<br>
<br>
GAME 4:  Me vs John (Gondor/Elves/Moria)<br>
Basically, both of our fellowships get set up very quickly, my Uruks are still tough enough to survive and prevent the double-moves, but between Aragorns Bow, Greenleaf, Rumil, and Calaglin, I kill everything and am able to double-move pretty easily, so he ends up having to make some ill-advised double moves that get his fellowship pretty bloody.  Were both at site 6, I move first and get a Cave Troll and some orcs, and decide to stop there.  He doubles into 8, losing Haldir, Arwen, and Sam (joining Legolas, who died earlier).  On my turn, I move into 8 completely healed up, he drops 4 orcs and yet another Troll, all the orcs die except for a Moria Scout with a Scimitar who has one wound (stupid Celeborn not being able to kill things well), so I exert Calaglin twice to wound the Troll twice, exert Dinendal a couple times to clear the twilight pool, and move again, all he can get down is another orc, so Greenleaf shoots down the Troll and Aragorn and Boromir clean up the orcs.<br>
FW +3/+12<br>
Highs<br>
-Steamrolling through his hordes of orcs and multiple Cave Trolls<br>
Lows<br>
-Being forced to win with my fellowship; I wanted to have a clean sweep of overwhelms!<br>
<br>
So, I go 4-0 to win my last local tourney in Santa Rosa until probably December, and I get some pretty good pulls from my prize packs (I went for Fellowship, since its got the most foils I want); Legolas Greenleaf, Isildurs Bane, Twilight World, Stone Trolls, and a foil Threat of the Unknown.  Then we did some trading, I picked up some foils I needed plus some trade material (Cave Troll, Flaming Brand, etc).  Overall, not a bad tournament.<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Frank Pinkela, for being the man and trading me a foil Galadriel LotGW (I now just need Elrond LoR and Celeborn for all the foil Elf allies)<br>
-everybody who showed up, for making it sanctioned<br>
-Frank, Mason, and Jason for the traditional multi-player game afterwards<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-everybody who didnt show up, for making it barely sanctioned<br>
-Jason, for showing up as the last round was ending; where were you, man?<br>
-Mason, for playing Moria instead of his sick Uruks; dude, you should know better than thatremember what happened the last time you brought something other than your Uruks?  If not Im sure Nick will be happy to remind you :-) <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3977&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
