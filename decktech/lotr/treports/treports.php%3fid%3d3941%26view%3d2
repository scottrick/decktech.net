Well I started a new job that Jared the Scary Looking Rob Zombie guy got me.  It is a janitor at the Castle Boutique (that&#39;s French, duh).  It pays well, though sometimes it is a little disgusting, as you can imagine.  Well, Friday night, I had too much to drink (12 beers, a pint of Vodka and 7 Mt Dews) I suddenly had the urge to go do num. 1 (AKA expelling urine).  Well, some fool clogged the toilet so I ran across to a Texaco where I found that the bathroom had been taken over by the freaking roach Mafia.  They said I could only use it if I did them a favor, so I was left with no other choice but to use my Dad&#39;s grenade from Vietnam and I blew up the bathroom.  So I still had to go really stinkin bad I decided that I could run over to the city sewer drainage area.  Well, I got there and when I decided to go...nothing happened.  Terror filled the deepest bowels of my soul.  Finally I ran to near by bush and, with all my concentration and will power, I squeezed out a huge red Kidney Stone.  It hurt so badly that I peed myself.  Well, I took the kidney stone and dropped off the edge of a freeway bridge where it killed 18 people.  I then named the Stone: Peter the Destroyer.  So, when I arrived at Gamers Edge on the Sat. morning I was feeling a bit sore.  But 10 people were in attendance and we were off.<br>
My deck: Aragorn&#39;s Arrow Penetrates Arwen.  Basically your run-of-the-mill archery deck with Uruks.<br>
Game 1<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Arrow Penetrates Arwen Vs. Random Guy #1&#39;s Gandalf/Uruk Deck<br>
This was this guy&#8217;s first tournament since January so I forget his name.  He starts The Grey Pilgrim and bid higher so I go first.  I play Aragorn KIE, and Splendor of their Banners on Lego, Son of Famboozle. I move to site 2.  Down comes some Uruks and I match them up against Lego and Aragorn.  Mistake #1: matching Lego up in a skirmish...why?!  Gorn takes two and Lego get Battle Cried and his entire lower torso is ripped away, leaving the gooey organs exposed.  I stop.  He goes, forgets to draw a card, plays Gorn and Boromir and moves.  Troop and some other random fool Uruk meet him and assigns wounds accordingly.  He stops.  My go, I play Gondor Bowmen and Elven bow on Arwen and move.  He doesn&#39;t have jack so I stop.  His turn, he forgets to draw a card and doesn&#39;t heal anybody and moves.  Well he gives me pipeweed for twilight so I just sit there.  He stops.  My go, put Gwemigil on Arwen and Sword on Aragorn and I move.  I face some Uruks at Hollin where my dudes make short work of them.  I fear his deck though.  The Battle Cry could be bad news.  He goes, forgets to draw a card plays some shimmer and moves.  He gets ambushed by a Troop and some other random scrub, kills the scrub and takes a wound on Gorn (who now has f*cking armor).  My turn, Gorn humps Arwen, I play Boromir +horn and move.  I face one Uruk, who I defeat and decide to move onto to site 6.  I meet Lurtz and friends and in a climactic battle Arwen&#39;s head is rolling off into the forest and my men dismember a few Uruks.  He goes, forgets to draw a card and forgets to heal with Gorn and faces a few baddies.  He makes short work of them and moves to site 6.  Well, he now faces the terror of Sauramon and friends and Boromir loses a leg, then has his guts ripped through his mouth and dies.  I go, heal up my men, play pathfinder and Orophin.  I deal easily with his Uruks and push to site 8.  Again, he plays little, save Sauramon and a few buddies, but with multiple Bowmen and such they all die to archery.  His turn, he forgets to draw a card and marches to site 7.  Well, at this point I could give a rats hiney about my shadow side so dump what I have from my hand so I can get a good set up for my fellowship turn.  He easily defeats my Uruks and decides to stop, seeing it pointless to go on.  I go, Aragorn, now desperate after the death of his how, screws Boromir up the hiney and I decided enough of that shimmer and move to site 9.  He throws down plenty of Uruks but my Guys are fairly healed and with the horn of Boromir I send in Orophin and Elrond and my dudes survive to tell the tale.<br>
FW +3<br>
Props: Stopping my opponent at site 2.  My opponent for making a good come back after many months with out playing.<br>
Slops:  Me, for forgetting his name.  My opponent for forgetting to do so much (like a draw a card with Gandalf).<br>
Game 2:<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Arrow Penetrates Arwen Vs. Mark Zawacki&#39;s Bowmen/Nazgul deck.<br>
Ah, classic match up.  My old nemesis since the very beginning.  I go first, play Aragorn and Rumil and move.  I face Nazgul for the very first time in many long months and I am now growing kinda worried.  They have a lot of tricks to stop direct damage stuff.  I take 2 wounds on Aragorn and Arwen and I decide to stay.  Hs go he drops HTTWC, armor, Brand, Bow, 2 condor cowmen and moves.  Well, he only ends up giving me 10 twilight, so I play 2 Warriors who are easily shot down.  He stays.  I go, draw up NOTHING and move.  I face the fords where the Witch King is waiting for me.  I fight him off to no avail and take more wounds.  I stay.  He goes gives me four twilight so I play nothing.   Here is where the game gets bad (for me).  Because he is twilight choking me AND killing my guys before the archery phase, I keep getting stuck with Savageries and Uruks in my hand.  This kinda sucks.  Uruks are becoming as painful as my kidney stone.  Well, once again on my turn I play nothing, move to site four where I receive a burden and meet some random Nazgul.  Gorn gets blade Tipped and wounded and so I stay.  His turn he heals up and play stuff on Gorn and Arwen (elven bow and the like) and moves.  I have nothing to really stop him, his archery is killing me and I can&#39;t draw Sauramon or Spies.  He moves to 5 and kills off more of my men easily.  I could have played the Balrog, but it ultimately would have been pointless.  Gorn was too buff and with armor he would&#39;ve soaked up the damage anyways.  My go and once again my hand clogged with feces (Uruks) and I move.  I face the common balrog who eats Legolas and Arwen.  I stay.  I am now feeling quit beside myself and I watch Mark fly through site 6 and 7 with no stopping him.  My turn, Aragorn gets wounded by the f*cking blade tip and he and Frodo walk into Lothlorien quit naked.  I guess the elves found this quit humorous to see a naked man and a naked hobbit stumble into their forest because NONE of them decided to even show up for the end battle that involved Neyla and Lemenya killing Gorn and rapping Frodo to the point of death.<br>
FL (-1)4<br>
Props: Mark for being a good opponent and laughing too much at my horrible luck.<br>
Slops: To my horrible luck and getting my hand clogged like a kidney stone by those shimmerhead Uruk Hai.<br>
Game 3<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Arrow Penetrates Arwen Vs. John Towner&#39;s Trust/Uruk deck.<br>
Interesting.  This is the guy I play the most.  Since Jared the Scary looking Rob Zombie guys was sent to prison for robbing a Hollywood Video Store, I have had to rely on Mr. Towner for all my playtesting needs.  Anywho, I hate playing the guy in a tournament simply because I ALWAYS play him.  Well, I go first and set up fairly quickly with Bow on Gorn, Splendor and Gondor Bowmen.  I move and easily wipe out he few Uruks he plays and I move to 3 without facing any opposition.  He goes, forgets to draw a card with the Grey Pilgrim, plays Boromir and Pippin and Trust Me.  Poo.  I hate trust me.  Especially on the first turn.  I play two Uruks who both lose their skirmished but don&#39;t die.  He ponders if he should move again and doesn&#39;t as I have enough Twilight to play another Uruk or two.  My go, I heal, drop more Bowmen, Elven Bow on Arwen and move.  I face some Troops at Hollin and I take some wounds.  I decide to stay.  His turn, he forgets to draw a card and plays Blade of Gondor and Gandalf&#39;s Staff and moves.  I play a Troop of Uruk Hai and Pippin&#39;s legs are removed from his body and shoved down him mouth.  I go, Aragorn humps Arwen, play Orophin and Galadriel and I move to 5.  Between double shots and Banners, I kill his guys off and move to 6 where I fight one lone Uruk, who of course dies to archery.  His go, he forgets to draw a card, plays Aragorn ROTN with weapons and moves.  He faces two Uruks and Sauramon.  My Uruks lose their fights but Sauramon prevents them from dying.  John decides not to move again, as he fears a swarm of Uruks on site 5.  A smart choice as I had 4 more cheap Uruks to dump on his 4 guys.  My go, heal up, play PathFinder for my site 7 (Great River) and I move.  I face some Uruks and Arwen is folded over in half causing her spine to tear through her thin body.  Aragorn swears revenge.  John&#39;s turn, he forgets to draw card with Gandalf and moves to site 5.  At this point I don&#39;t care about my shadow anymore and I just dump and play everything in had to set up for the double move to site 9.  My Uruks all die to Trust he and he doubles (pointlessly) to site 6.  My turn, I play Boromir +horn, sting, Galadriel humps Orophin and I set off.  I blow through 8 and at 9 I horn in Elrond and Orophin who take care of the Uruks waiting for me.  John reaches over to shake my hand.  I extend my hand to except his gesture when he tries to punch me!  Then he flips the table, scattering cards all over the place.  He apologizes and says it&#39;s the alcohol that&#39;s making him do this.  So I&#39;m like &quot;That&#39;s cool.&quot;<br>
FW +3 (7)<br>
Props:  Setting up so quickly.  John for being a good sport after the loss.<br>
Slops: John&#39;s awful luck and forgetting to draw a card with Gandalf!<br>
Ok people, if you are going to play Gandalf the Grey Pilgrim please utilize his game text and draw a f*cking card!<br>
Game 4<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Arrow Penetrates Arwen  Vs. Tim Fournier&#39;s Gondor Bowmen/Nazgul Deck.<br>
Tim is a really good player is ranked pretty high (1880&#39;s I think).  So I feel like I&#39;m just going to lose this one and go 2-2.  But I learn in this game to never underestimate the power of the common Balrog! We bid the same and he goes first.  He plays Banners, HTTWC and moves.  He gives like 10 twilight so I play 2 Uruks and they dies to archery.  He stays.  My go.  I play KIE and Banners and move.  I give him 10 twilight and he plays 2 Nazgul, who die to archery. I stay.  Wow, this is starting sound all the same, eh? His turn plays 2 gondor bowmen, and armor and moves to 3. I play nothing<br>
having only four pool so he decides to go to 4.  I play some Uruks and Sauramon and they all dies, but not without dealing a wound to Aragorn.  I go, heal Arwen and move.  I face 2 nazgul at the fords (which he converted using Neyla&#39;s gametext) and they both die to archery.  So then I decide to go to site 4and I face the Witch King.  I take 2 wounds and Gorn gets Blade Tipped.  He goes, playing nothing on his dudes and the common Balrog makes and appearance and eats Legolas and Arwen.  Hurray common Balrog!  He moves to site 6, and kills all the opposition he faces there. Well, nothing eventful happens from there until he goes to site 9, with a beat up Aragorn and Frodo.  I play 4 Uruks, and Valiant Man&#39;s Gorn and Take on the Troop and Lurtz and Frodo faces 2 Uruk Savages and is overwhelmed.  Tim comments on how that was the 2nd game the common Balrog lost him the game.  Hurray for the common Balrog!  the .10 cent card that kills $100 decks!<br>
FW +3 (10)<br>
Props:  Playing a good opponent.  Tim is a fun guy to play.  The common Balrog for wrecking his fellowship.<br>
Slops: Watching Arwen and Legolas die to the common Balrog...<br>
Well, that&#39;s that.  I go 3-1 and get a few packs for my troubles.  Mark Zawacki ends up winning the day and his very first tournament, which was good.  <br>
I go home, feeling bummed about the one loss I had so I build a crappy hobbit deck with moria and give it to my cat.  Needless to say, I ended up killing his Frodo on site five since my cat didn&#39;t have fingers to even play any cards.<br>
FW +3 (13)<br>
Props: To my cat for being stupid.<br>
Slops: For him not having any fingers and the inability to even read the cards.  That ended up costing him the game...<br>
<br>
On a side note, I feel kinda bad for my kidney stone.  But then again....<br>
