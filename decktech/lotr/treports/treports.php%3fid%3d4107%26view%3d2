I managed to coerce Kenneth from the other side of town to come down, and lend him my 2nd deck. This was his first tournament, and he doesn&#39;t play often so we weren&#39;t expecting much of him. Just for him to garner some experience. Old-timers like Mun Kit, Sam and the three small Hobbits also showed up as a pleasant surprise, giving a turn-out of 12. Most of our decks, though, are simply Fellowship decks with Towers sites. Sigh.<br />
<br />
The minutes before the tournament were spent in utter chaos as Kit, Sam, Leck Koon and me etc rummaged in panic in everybody&#39;s album and stacks of cards for sites and a couple of Towers rares to complete respective decks. Kudos to Eugene for showing up and actually remembering our requests and lending out a major part of his foil-site collection. Woohoo.<br />
I am playing denial with Men and Hobbits. Stuck Faramir in instead of Arwen after I had witnessed first-hand Faramir&#39;s prowess against Uruks and Nazgûl in the past week.<br />
<br />
Thanks to my memory with those awesome photographic skills, I can list out all the decks that were there. There was me with Rangers and Hobbits denial and old-school Uruks on shadow. Aldrin with Trust Me and some Gandalf, the White trickiness and Dunland on shadow. Sam had Trust Me/Final Count/My Axe is Notched with spectacular Legolas-Gimli Shoulder to Shoulder ping-pong matches to give Gandalf the White the twilight he needs and Moria for shadow. Muhammed had something strange, revolving around denial with a buff Thrarin to join in fights and Twilight Nazgûl burdening on shadow. Leck Koon had Shoulder Fire for Free Peoples and Moria swarm on shadow just like in the old days. Mun Kit had Rangers with Horn of Boromir goodness and old-school Uruks for shadow. Woon Howe had Rangers and Hobbits denial similar to mine with Nazgûl for shadow. Benjamin had pure Elves, and for shadow, he used the new Uruks with site-control. Brian had something similar. Joachim had Rangers with Uruks. Ken Rhee had something mixed with Rohan and Moria. And Kenneth, of course, had my Rohan mounts-themed deck with Nazgûl. <br />
<br />
<b>Game 1</b><br />
vs Muhammad Al Miqyahil<br />
Frodo, OBH/Boromir, DoMT/Pippin, Mr. Took<br />
Mixed/Twilight Nazgûl<br />
<br />
Hmm, with my discerning his handwriting when I took over the tournament slips, my eyes popped out when I thought I was going to face Muhammed Ali, before he clarified my reading error. <br />
<br />
I bid 2 to his 0 and went first. Had a relatively good draw, I remember, and moved to Plains of Rohan Camp, where I faced twilight Otsëa with Black Steed. Without any Blade Tip in his support area, I was happy to just take a wound. I moved again and Enquëa joined the ranks. No conditions out so I just took wounds. Nothing special.<br />
<br />
His side, he didn&#39;t pull Aragorn through Riddermark. I thought he wanted to wait to get the -2 bonus for Mr. Took in play, but he told me later that he forgot. Only 4 twilight at Plains so I did nothing. One Uruk at Barrows of Edoras did a token 2 wounds.<br />
<br />
I raced to 5 and got Sting, and managed to see his problem. Aragorn&#39;s kit occupied about half his hand. Then on his side, Boromir got overwhelmed by an Uruk at Site 4 and his woes grew greater, as cards like No Stranger joined the ranks of his hand, occupying about 6 of his 8 cards in hand. I stopped at 6, waiting to kill him.<br />
<br />
He played Thrarin with Endurance of Dwarves and Dwarven Axe (what?!?!) before moving. 2 Uruks killed Pippin and Thrarin off, with him burning a Flurry of Blows in the process (what?!?!), leaving him with just Frodo. I made an uneventful move to 7 and waited. He still did not get Aragorn so he moved to 6 with just Frodo, and 1 Uruk was all it took to kill him.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+3<br />
Props:<br />
-A breezy start.<br />
-Very quick game. In fact, our whole table finished our games in record time, getting dubbed the &#39;express table&#39;.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-He didn&#39;t pull Aragorn and self-destructed with his hand-clog.<br />
-You do not play Thrarin + equipment in a tournament and hope to get good results!<br />
<br />
<b>Game 2</b><br />
vs Loh Mun Kit<br />
Frodo, RA/Arwen, DoE/Legolas, G start<br />
Rangers/Uruks<br />
<br />
I bid 2 to his 1 and started The Riddermark. Bemoaned why he wasn&#39;t playing Nazgûl as he always used to as I stuck 2 Flaming Brands on Aragorn, with a Blade of Gondor on Boromir. I moved to Plains of Rohan Camp and faced a Troop. Aragorn took 2, and I moved again, noting that the 4 twilight I gave him was insufficient for another Uruk as I knew he was running Barrows of Edoras, and so he just dropped an Ambition. This was where the exertions for The Riddermark caught up though, as Boromir was put out of the picture with the wound token on him. Aragorn could not win the skirmish even with Merry&#39;s help due to the Ambition and so I sacrificed Merry. By some rustiness, I actually failed to notice that I could have assigned Frodo and used Merry to save him. Bleurgh.<br />
<br />
He pulled Aragorn, Heir to the White City and played Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith, No Stranger, Sting, 2 Last Alliances and Orophin, and after checking my hand, withheld Elrond in hand. He moved, giving me a dosage of twilight, but enough to drop my hand after he had checked that my hand only contained Lurtz and Troop, and had purposely denied me of the 16 I needed. No problem though. I played the Troop and Abandoned Reason for Madness to...oh well, didn&#39;t draw up a cheap Uruk. I did get Saruman&#39;s Power though to kiss his Last Alliances and No Stranger goodbye as he grumbled. Interestingly, instead of exerting Orophin twice and letting the Troop take 1 normal archery, he opted to exert Legolas twice and Orophin once, but he said later he wasn&#39;t planning to move again anyway and could make use of Plains of Rohan Camp&#39;s text.<br />
<br />
I got my own Sting after using the text of Barrows of Edoras, and after checking his hand and finding an Uruk Warrior, Lieutenant and Captain, dropped Sam, Proper Poet, an Armor on Boromir and a Flaming Brand on him too make him a 10. With my choke and his only pump an Ambition on the table, he opted not to play anything and reconciled. Deciding that I could handle 3 or 4 Uruks, I moved again, sure that he was playing Deep of Helm and not Deeping Wall, because, well, he took a Deep of Helm from me before the tournament. Anyway, I had Filibert out just in case he did use the latter. As it was, 4 Uruks came out as I expected. 2 went on Sam, and Boromir and Aragorn took care of the other 2. This meant that I had opened up a 3-site advantage and was well in control of the game.<br />
<br />
He knew things were going bad for him but he still stopped at 3 to heal off his expanse of wounds after I had managed to Savagery a Troop and spotted 5 companions. On my side, I dropped Pippin to replace the token Hobbit which was dying every turn, and also Faramir. I saw he had Saruman&#39;s Power, which was potentially harmful to my 2 No Strangers and 1 A Talent on the table, but I decided to stick Escape on Pippin, since I was perhaps going to discard it anyway. That card was more meant for Merry, who was in the dead pile. I moved, and interestingly, he only played a Troop, without the Power. He later revealed that he was waiting for me to play more conditions. I personally wouldn&#39;t have cared. More turns holding onto Power equates to more twilight denied. I took my wounds against the Troop and stopped at Hornburg Armory.<br />
<br />
He started his turn at Barrows of Edoras and faced a single Uruk Warrior at White Rocks. In a dexterous piece of play, he used Horn of Boromir to blow in Orophin to give me 2 normal archery to kill it off at the cost of 1 exertion, where it could have caused 4 with my Savageries. His Sting revealed that I only had an Uruk Lieutenant in hand, and my hand had 6 cards. I warned him that I would draw into something to kill him if he moved again, and he laughed. So I discarded 1 card and drew 3 as he opted to move again, and my prophecy of doom was fulfilled, as I dropped the Uruk Captain and Saruman I drew into along with that Lieutenant, and pulled a Troop with Captain so that was Saruman and 3 Uruks against his 5 companions as he stared in horror. After the dust had cleared, he was left with exhausted Boromir and Frodo after Aragorn had been overwhelmed by multiple Savageries, Sam killed, Orophin killed and Arwen killed, and he stared at his cards, wondering how that had come out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
I added more kit on my companions, including pushing Faramir up to that 10 strength to forever whip Uruks upside down. Stopped at 7. Still did not hit Power.<br />
He moved to 6, where Troop of Uruk-hai charged out against 1-wound Boromir and Frodo with Sting. He managed to blow in Elrond to take it for the team, after I pumped. He stopped of course.<br />
<br />
I despairingly realised I had nothing to flood the pool, and triggered Wizard&#39;s Vale text when I moved, and only then did Kit play his Power to take away the offending No Strangers and Talent that had caused it. Grrrr. At this stage, My Sting revealed that he had a full-shadow hand, and thus I was happy to take it slow, stopping and waiting to kill him.<br />
He moved to 7, and with my 2 Saruman&#39;s Ambition on the table and him having no more allies on the table, it meant that I only needed 2 Uruks out to overwhelm Frodo, and that I managed easily.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+6<br />
Props:<br />
-Doing exceptionally well against Uruks.<br />
-And doing well against Kit, who&#39;s a good player.<br />
-3 sites ahead for the most part<br />
-Fulfilling my prophecy of doom.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Not realising that Merry did not have to die at Site 3.<br />
-Got to pity him. No minions on the table and your opponent only has 1 minion in a 6-card hand, and still you get destroyed on the double?<br />
<br />
At this stage, me, Koon and Kenneth are the only 2-0s. Kenneth had been doing extremely well up to then in his first tournament and doing my deck proud justice, recording an illustrious win over 2nd-ranked Woon Howe. All the more lethal because his rating is of course at a 1500. Now that Howe can shut up about &#39;never been beaten by Nazgûl&#39; :)<br />
<br />
<b>Game 3</b><br />
vs Foo Woon Howe<br />
Frodo, RA/Boromir, LoG/Merry, FtS start<br />
Rangers Denial/Nazgûl<br />
<br />
Koon and Kenneth got paired up and I got paired down. Woon Howe, in his bad mood, fell deeper into despair in his crap day when he learned that I had randomly drawn him as my opponent, as he knew his deck was not suited against mine.<br />
<br />
I bid 2 to his 1 and went first for The Riddermark. Got Flaming Brand, Blade of Gondor and Bill the Pony for Free Peoples. Faced The Witch-King with Bill Ferny and took my wounds. Moved again and he played nothing. Took wounds, with Aragorn biting a Black Breath with 1 wound on him.<br />
<br />
He flooded the pool, and was punished for it after 2 Uruks exhausted Aragorn and Boromir, and there was no way he could do a double against 3 Uruks in that condition. I drew up a 2nd Flaming Brand and stuck both Brands on Aragorn and used Athelas to get rid of the Black Breath so I was below Grima range once again. Moved to Westemnet Hills but was stopped by a Nazgûl on Black Steed, and with my denial conditions not out yet, did not want to take an uncalculated risk.<br />
<br />
At this stage, he asked me where was my Saruman&#39;s Ambition, which I had played on the first turn, and I too realised that it had mysteriously disappeared. A search revealed it in my discard pile, as I had mistakenly stacked my discarded cards on it. I stuck it back in my support area, as he said that I should reward his honesty by not playing Grima on him, because he was contemplating sticking a No Stranger on Aragorn with Bow and Flaming Brand (Boromir was similarly overloaded, I remember). I shrugged and said, &quot;You know I only have one in my deck. You sure I even have it now in hand?&quot; He shrugged, hesitated and fitted the No Stranger on. He moved, giving me 4 twilight. Given a chance, I would have preferred to hold the Grima in my hand (teehee, I did have it) and intimidate him off a double when he trooped into 5 but with 4 twilight, and my not being able to make use of the twilight effectively if he doubled (and I was sure he would), I played him anyway, as Woon Howe stared. So back went Bow, Brand and No Stranger, as Woon Howe moved again.<br />
<br />
Out came an Uruk. Boromir was already exhausted and rather than choosing for Aragorn to also take 2 and to have an extremely painful move to 5 next turn, he opted to let twice-exerted Merry take it for the team.<br />
<br />
So I reconciled and by the time I finished my Fellowship Phase, Woon Howe knew the game was up. I played Filibert and Sting, and found that Grima had done his job. His only minion in hand was Attëa. I thus flooded the pool, sticking a Hobbit Sword on Merry, playing Faramir, Son of Denethor, and Woon Howe gasped in despair as I transferred the 2 Flaming Brands to Faramir (no Grima, no Cantëa, no Black Breath. GAME OVER!). I played Pippin too, and it was when I finally moved that I realised in panic that I had inadvertently fielded 6 companions against Nazgûl. I quickly got Pippin killed against Attëa before Faramir torched him alive in the fierce skirmish. An easy double to 6 as I whipped his minions. I was going to win the game, and we both knew it at this stage.<br />
<br />
He got a couple of Armors out on Aragorn and Boromir and played Faramir and moved to 5, where he faced 2 or 3 Uruks. No Saruman. 2 Uruks were still left after it was all done to deter a double, but since he figured he was losing anyway, he moved again. 3 Uruks. Faramir died. Aragorn and Boromir took wounds.<br />
<br />
A 3rd Flaming Brand on Aragorn with Ranger&#39;s Sword at Hornburg Armory meant that I had 2 13-strength dudes, one of who was immune to unique Cantëa. I also had Filibert and could minus about 4 twilight from site numbers. Absolutely no contest. Uneventful move to 8, as he impatiently did his own to 7. My turn again and I moved to Palantír Chamber, giving only 10 twilight.<br />
<br />
He did get cheered up a little though, when his The Nine Servants of Sauron tech put in specifically to counter my deck killed Filibert, Farmer Maggot and Merry off at Site 8. Oh well.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+9<br />
Props:<br />
-Textbook win<br />
-Faramir with 2 Flaming Brands = Nazgûl go home<br />
-Gee, I&#39;ll be so grateful that I don&#39;t play Grima on you? Bite me, I&#39;m an ungrateful bastard.<br />
-&quot;So I&#39;ll just play Attëa here, and Toldëa here, but I think I&#39;ll just discard them anyway since they&#39;ll both get torched. Yeah, go double-move. I&#39;ll just discard this Nazgûl I just drew. Stop smiling, David. You think this is funny?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Poor guy&#39;s gonna take a big knock with him going 2-2 and losing to a 1500-er.<br />
<br />
<b>Game 4</b><br />
vs Yeo Leck Koon<br />
Frodo, RA/Arwen, DoE/Legolas, G start<br />
Shoulder Fire/Moria Swarm<br />
<br />
Koon had beaten Kenneth so it was me against him for the tournament and the Fierce T-shirt. I was extra apprehensive about this match-up. My deck does not do well against Moria.<br />
I bid 2 to his 0 and went first for The Riddermark. Got a good draw, with Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Flaming Brand and Hobbit Sword. He only played an Armory and They are Coming at Site 2, so I moved again into Golden Hall. Bleurgh. There went my only copy of Aragorn&#39;s Bow in the deck, and I was up against Moria.<br />
<br />
He played Boromir and Aragorn and a host of other cards, instantly giving me 5 companions. I had 2 Savageries in hand but doubted I could use them this early since he was bound to shoot down most of my minions. As planned, the 2 Uruks I played both got shot down at Uruk Camp and I discarded a Saruman&#39;s Power as he watched on. Power is of course his bane in that combo-ish Free Peoples half. I left it up to fate to decide when I would draw my 2nd copy. He moved again and my Uruk survived archery this time, but even with Savagery, it only caused 2 wounds each on Aragorn and Boromir to be healed off next turn.<br />
I moved to 4, and though noticing that he seemed to be on a shortage of minions, stopped after a Flanker with Moria Axe caused some damage. He always had They are Coming to punish me if I moved anyway.<br />
<br />
He played Sam, Son of Hamfast, Aragorn&#39;s Bow and The Saga of Elendil but withheld Ranger&#39;s Sword for fear of Grima, and that was calculated as I did have him in hand. Moved to White Rocks and 2 Uruks came out. Legolas exhausted himself to shoot 1 down and the other went rampant with Savagery. He shook his head as he stopped, noting how having only just come out of the sanctuary, Arwen, Boromir and Legolas were already exhausted.<br />
<br />
I played Faramir but withheld Pippin for fear of Enquëa. At Hornburg Courtyard stopped again as an Orc and Troll came out, and I was caught without Armor.<br />
<br />
He played The Tale of Gil-Galad and Thrarin to finally make use of Shoulder to Shoulder as he moved to Hornburg Courtyard. Got 3 Uruks down, but regrettably no Saruman. He transferred a wound on Arwen to Aragorn by The Choice of Lúthien and another to Thrarin by Shoulder to Shoulder, and exhausted both Aragorn and Legolas to shoot 2 down, leaving 1 Uruk. It went on Sam and I played Savagery. It went on Arwen with Gwemegil for fierce and I played another Savagery for 17-8, forcing him to discard 2 cards. He stopped, his whole fellowship, except Boromir (1 wound) and Frodo, exhausted. The problem, though, was that I had used up the last copy of Savagery in my deck.<br />
<br />
I moved to Hornburg Armory, and faced 3 or 4 Scavengers whom my Gondor Men were more than able to take down.<br />
<br />
I stopped of course, and as I reconciled, my eye gleamed when I drew up Saruman&#39;s Power. A quick glance at his Free Peoples, and I counted 2 No Strangers, a Shoulder to Shoulder and The Choice of Lúthien, but that was beside the point. No, there were also The Saga of Elendil and The Tale of Gil-Galad, and both bearers were EXHAUSTED. Yes, I looked on with bated breath, imagining the worst scenario when he gave me too little twilight or he discarded extra copies of Aragorn to heal, but he finally moved, and I loosed a breath as he gave me 5 twilight. Out came Uruk Warrior and Saruman&#39;s Power, as he looked on grimly, sticking Aragorn and Legolas in the dead pile. He later said he would not have been so liberal with the exertions previously had he expected that I would have Powered him. He had seen me discard my 1st Saruman&#39;s Power and thought that was my only copy.<br />
<br />
My turn and I moved to Cavern Entrance and discarded Bill the Pony and watched with bated breath, as what originally was 12 pool (I had placed less emphasis on denial in this game agaisnt Moria) turned into 5 minions, against my 5 companions. It was horrifically close as naked Frodo lost a skirmish to a 7-strength Runner, and Merry had to take it for the team by dying to a 10-strength Scavengers. It was even more close, considering that Enquëa was also on the table. This meant that I could not have played Pippin to be safe. This meant that in that scenario, he had only needed 1 more minion to overwhelm me. A Runner and Flanker went on Goblin Swarms as I thanked my lucky stars and stopped.<br />
<br />
It was a race between whose fellowship would die first, it seemed, as he moved to Cavern Entrance, his whole deck crippled by that timely Saruman&#39;s Power. 2 Uruks with Saruman came out. Thrarin took one and Arwen took 2. On the fierce, Boromir took 2 against one and in a blatant ignorance of Cavern&#39;s Entrance text, we both did not realise that we were not allowed to use skirmish events and abilities. My Lieutenant was 8 against his 8. He had 6 cards in hand. He discarded 2 as I discarded my Ambition. He was forced to discard the last 4 in hand as I looked on. It turned out to be a blessing as 4 of the 6 cards he discarded were minions. Though in a way, it was not in my favour too as if Arwen had died like she was supposed to, he would have triggered Wizard&#39;s Vale text upon his next move, allowing me to overwhelm him with 12 twilight, so two errors cancelled each other out, and the outcome of the game was not affected.<br />
<br />
He stopped as I played out Sam, Proper Poet and Thrarin as he groaned. Not wanting to risk another Enquëa, I counted that I could take on 7 minions, and thus had to leave it all up to him to see if he could play more. I watched, almost not daring to breathe, as he got 6 minions out at Wizard&#39;s Vale before finally declaring he was done, and I was just about to exert Thrarin when I stopped, realising that Frodo could go lose a skirmish against Runner + Scimitar again. That proved crucial in the end. So Sam hugged two minions, the Gondor Men took care of themselves and this time, 2 Flankers and a Runner both went on Swarms.<br />
At this stage, we both had only 3 cards left in our draw deck in this extremely tense and close game, and thus we gave each other a couple minutes repose as we rummaged through our discard pile. I quickly found out that my last 3 cards were Sting, Saruman&#39;s Ambition and Abandoning Reason for Madness. No more minions, but in my hand, I had 2 Troops and Lurtz. All three were capable of overwhelming Frodo with Sting, and get to Frodo as he only had 3 companions out, plus I could pull Saruman from Orthanc Balcony if he chose to double past me. With the luxury of having the game wrapped around my finger, I stopped.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t tell me then of course, but he did say later that his last 3 cards were all useless non-minions.<br />
<br />
He moved to 8, only giving me 9 and just ducking under Wizard&#39;s Vale text, and I spent it on just a Troop. He Shouldered away wounds on Arwen before taking 2. He used Sting on me in the regroup phase and looked carefully at my hand, as a mistake here could swing the game in any favour. I still had that last card in my draw deck, and he wondered what it was. I knew it was an Abandoning Reason for Madness. Soon, however, he realised what I had noticed and knew that he would be courting death for sure if he moved again, whereas he could still have a chance to overwhelm me. He stopped.<br />
<br />
I played Pippin and Sting and threw my hand down as I moved to Palantír Chamber. I had 2 Power According to His Stature in there but they would be useless against his 4 Armories. Events were all beyond my control now. I grimly watched as he played the Runner, and carefully added twilight with Scavengers, one from site text and the other from They are Coming. Then 2 Flankers and a Cave Troll. He only had 6 cards in hand before he started after running out cards in his draw deck so he was unable to discard more for They are Coming. 6 minions against my 5 companions with Thrarin, and luck upon luck, none of them except the Troll whom I could easily direct away could overwhelm my Frodo with Sting.<br />
I thanked my lucky stars once again.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+12<br />
Props:<br />
-Very close, went down to the wire, with both of us expending our draw decks. Besides 1-3, we both took it 1 site a turn.<br />
-Leaving Saruman&#39;s Power to fate. And fate dictated that Aragorn and Legolas die. Awesome.<br />
-Hurrah for speed bumps.<br />
-He came up 1 minion short on Site 7 and 9 and 2 short on 8, and 1 card short on 9 for They are Coming. Had he played 1 more minion on either of these last three sites, I would have lost (for 8, 1 more minion would have brought Thrarin in, who would have not been around at Site 9 then).<br />
-Abandoning my No Strangers away for Madness which ultimately got me the right cards at the right time (Saruman&#39;s Power and the speed-bumps)<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Getting Aragorn&#39;s Bow out first turn against Moria, and promptly losing it to Golden Hall. Bleh, Bow would have saved me a lot of headaches and oxygen deficiency late on in the game.<br />
-Both of us being scrubs at Cavern Entrance.<br />
Results<br />
<br />
1st: Me, +12<br />
2nd: Yeo Leck Koon, +10<br />
3rd: Kenneth Goh, +10<br />
Ooh yes, that&#39;s right, Kenneth, in his first tournament, did my 2nd deck proud (Rohan with Aragorn/Nazgûl) by finishing 3rd. And all of us on the podium are #lotrtcg regulars on GalaxyNet. Awesome, now you know the secret to winning tournaments.<br />
<br />
Props:<br />
-3rd T-shirt in 3 tournaments. 3rd T-shirt in 3 weeks. Sweet!<br />
-TD Sam generously giving out Faramir and Eowyn promos to the top 3.<br />
-Kenneth doing well with my deck, which I had only tested in real life twice, and for assassinating everybody with his 1500 rating.<br />
-Koon wondering whether to double-move into 3 for fear of Golden Hall dumping his Bow and 2 or 3 other weapons, to which Kenneth replied, &quot;But I have already played Eomer&#39;s Spear. Why would I bomb myself?&quot; To which Koon nodded, doubled, and hit Golden Hall. Cunning from a player in his first tournament!<br />
-Kenneth for finally making Woon Howe shut up about &quot;I&#39;ve never been beaten by a Nazgûl deck before. Only I can use them correctly.&quot; Golden Hall for discarding Flaming Brands and King&#39;s Room for exerting everybody upon the double-move so that Greenleaf was unable to shoot that Witch-King down. FOUR companions died at King&#39;s Room!<br />
-Old-timers returning to make the tournaments all homey again.<br />
-Eugene for supplying cards to the needy.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Woon Howe playing like a newbie scrub. Resolving War Club skirmish first (against Aldrin), causing a companion to be needlessly overwhelmed. Not having the common sense to guess that his opponent (Kenneth), with Eomer and Eowyn out, was playing King&#39;s Room, or that his opponent, with Weapon Store out, was playing Golden Hall.<br />
-Half of us were playing Fellowship decks with Towers sites.  <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=4107&view=1&PHPSESSID=d50b583a9a1cf5766adb3baa188b91b5'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?PHPSESSID=d50b583a9a1cf5766adb3baa188b91b5'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php?PHPSESSID=d50b583a9a1cf5766adb3baa188b91b5'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
