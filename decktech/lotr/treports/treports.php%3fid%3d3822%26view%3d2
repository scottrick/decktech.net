<br>
ok so like 3 weeks before origins paul, pubes and myself decide to play in the michigan toc.  we hadn&#39;t been to tourneys since march and april so we weren&#39;t sure how well we would do.  anyway that tourney was cool, paul won, i got 4th, a house blew up and a guy went psycho.  anyway so we think we may do ok at origins.<br>
<br>
ok flash forward to the wednesday night before origins.  we decide to playtest then so that on the 4th we can party and watch fireworks.  so we have our big fellowship/uruk deck we used in michigan and we&#39;re planning to use it at origins.  it does ok in playtesting, beating some good decks, but it also loses to some gimmick decks, like gift of boats/mirror, and deft in their movements.  we decide that its too late to build something new though, so we stick with the deck for origins.<br>
<br>
friday morning, july 5 we leave at 6:15 am for origins.  we all sleep on the way down.  we roll in to columbus at about 8:30 or so. we get our convention badges then sign up for the tourney, which was supposed to be 20$ but was only $2.50!  what a deal.  or so we thought.  we go into the ccg hall and look at the lotr area and there is a huge crowd.  so anyway we do decklists and command cards then turn them in, and then they tell us we pay our $20.00 there.  darn. anyway the tourney starts a little late, but we thought it probably would.<br>
<br>
games-what i can remember, not sure what order these really went in either<br>
1. vs trun tran?<br>
he played a nazgul deck with a fellowship, i forget which kind but i think it was a big one.  i win the bid and go first.  move to 2, he plays nazguls, i stop.  i dont remember much about this game, execpt that we single moved a lot untill 6 when i drew into thros map and some ARV.  i won the race.  o yeah i never drew gandalf which sucked.<br>
fw3<br>
<br>
2. vs ??<br>
i won the bid.  i think he played nazgul and a ranger deck.  i move slow but uruks beat stuff dow so i won the race.<br>
fw6<br>
<br>
3. vs dave?<br>
i win and go first.  he has a moria mirror deck.  i jump him with uruks early and he didnt exert sam to be defender +1, then he goes to archery and then wants to go back to manuever, but we&#39;re in archery, and since i&#39;m vs the mirror this would be about the only turn i could play minions so i wanted them to put the hurt on him.  so they kill some guys and he stops.  i&#39;m racing along and his galadriel shows up too late.  i think i may have killed his frodo, not sure though.  <br>
fw9<br>
<br>
4. ??<br>
no clue what happened, except that i won.<br>
fw12<br>
<br>
5. vs steven turner<br>
i win the bid and go.  he has a ranger deck where all of his guys are like 15 power and beatdown all minions.  he played nazgul too.  all i remember from here is that he was able to hurt my felowship alot.  i bluffed him into stopping at likr 6 or 7, and i drew into my 3 ARV so i was able to double jump to 9 for the win.<br>
fw15<br>
<br>
time-out<br>
stuff went on between games, not all between this game, but this is where i&#39;m telling about them.<br>
1-hayes hunter got all 193 players to sing happy birthday to enrique, which was cool.<br>
2-i meet and talk to players i&#39;ve met before and some i haven&#39;t<br>
3- i hear something about a &quot;white arrows&quot; deck going around.  however i als hear about a weight of a legacy deck going around, so i&#39;m like whatever.<br>
<br>
back to the tr<br>
<br>
6. vs ryan granger<br>
he played the deft in their movements deck cause i guess he was the creator of it.  we race and i kill alot of his fellowship.  he gets to 9 and i have enough to play a troop and cantea.  frodo has 3 wounds so he can&#39;t use filbert, so his frodo dies in the fierce skirmish.<br>
<br>
fw18<br>
<br>
so i&#39;m 6-0 and i need 1 win for sure and i&#39;m in.  and i choke...<br>
7. vs matt yakobina <br>
here is the game: we both bid 6.  we roll a 20-sider. he gets a 3.  i get a 2.  game.  i almost just shook his hand right there, but i decided to play on.  he went first.  i knew i couldn&#39;t catch him, so i got careless with my fellowship, trying to setup good minion hands.  i think he killed my frodo, but if not he outraced me.<br>
fl19<br>
<br>
8. vs sam fog <br>
i win and go first.  he played a gandalf deck where he stacks his guys to beat on stuff.  he used moria for shadow.<br>
i win and go first.  we are racing.  he gets to 6, stops.  i double jump to 7 or 8, stop.  i&#39;m thinking, ok cool, i&#39;ll jump to 9 and win.  then he busts out DURINS SECRET and walks to 9 while i don&#39;t draw like any minions.<br>
fl20<br>
<br>
so anyway i still may have a shot.  they call out results and i&#39;m in like 30th place.  oh well.  then craig berry comes over and is like, &quot; dude, you went 6-2 got 30th, i went 5-3 and got around 20th. WTF?&quot;<br>
so i go ask about it.  they take like 30 minutes to find my command, then another 30 to redo the results.  so at like 11, after 8 games on the day, they say &quot;brad you are tied with jonathan marchi, you need to have a playoff right now.&quot;<br>
<br>
well i&#39;m about to fall asleep but i want in to day 2 so i play.  his deck uses elf allies but it didn&#39;t have the mirror.  he out-played me and won.  i told him good luck tomorow and stuff.<br>
<br>
so i meet up with paul, cramer, and pubes.  we go to the hotel.  i&#39;m pretty upset.  it looks likei can play rawdeal tomorrow though.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
saturday.  we get up, i build a rawdeal deck and put on my austin 316 shirt.  i go to the con center and look around at dealer booths.  i take to some lotr players and they are all like &quot; dude, you got screwed yesterday&quot; and stuff.  i&#39;m like well whatever, i can&#39;t do anything about it.  so then i hear someone calling for me and i look and bojo is like &quot;go to the ccg room, you may be playing today&quot;  and so i go there.  i&#39;m sitting around so i make a few changes to my deck ( add 2x worry, 2x traitors voice, and another enquea, to help vs hi bids and triple moves).  i fill out my shadow decklist and then enrique does my felowship, since it was the same as friday and they wanted to get things started.  <br>
<br>
we take picutres and stuff, then play.<br>
<br>
game 1 vs clint hays<br>
i win the bid, go first.  his deck comes together fast, and he strips my hand of my fellowship cards and then kills my frodo.<br>
<br>
2 vs clint hays<br>
i get the monster draw of 2 uruks and 2 savagries to start.  i kill his gimli, so he is stuck with fror in his hand, and couldn&#39;t setup the shoulder to shoulder engine.  i kill his frodo at 5.<br>
<br>
3 vs clint hays.  <br>
well i couldn&#39;t believe i won a game, but it was only because he had a horrible draw.  this game he sets up his deck fast.  he mills off my whole deck by like 5 and i think i died at 7 or 8.  <br>
<br>
well clint was a cool opponent and i tell him good luck and stuff.  <br>
<br>
<br>
prizes are passed out to the 9-16 players. we get a stack of packs and foils, which was cool even though it wasnt cash.<br>
<br>
well its too late for the rawdeal tourney so i spend the rest of the day in the distributor hall and watching the lotr tourney.  congrats to john lolli on the win and to everyone who played and those who got to day 2. <br>
<br>
i watch the smithees for 5 minutes then go watch some more lotr.  <br>
<br>
we meet up w/joey and crew and we talk then he goes to the bar.<br>
<br>
we go to the hotel and watch spaceballs on tnt.<br>
<br>
------<br>
sunday.  <br>
<br>
i wake up an hour before anyone else and i&#39;m reading the event guide then i hear this sound and pubes is snoring so i yell at him.  that wakes us all up.  we get to the con hall by 11 i think.<br>
<br>
i go by decipher booth and they tell me to go to rook.  so i go there, play a bunch of lotr and get some free card cases and a hat.  <br>
<br>
i get gimlis autograph and he made my gimli damage +8 which was cool.  <br>
<br>
i just sorta wander around all day.  i talk to barron vangor toth at rawdeal booth for like 10 minutes and he signs my hogan promo.  <br>
<br>
i buy some cards.  i get some spanish lotr ad get arwen and gewmegil which was cool.  i buy rawdeal from the 1 place there that sold singles.  i go watch some lotr.  we leave around 4 or so.<br>
<br>
