I am now way in the lead as the national player as all the higher players seem to have quit. Pity. Maybe somebody has to stop me rampaging?<br>
<br>
We knew there was something fishy when there were TWO tournaments scheduled for that day in the same time with two tournament directors (good friends). They appeared soon and unbeknownst to us, they collected all the applicants&#39; forms and divided the entries among themselves to hold TWO tournaments with over 10 for each. One took the &#39;kids&#39;, those under 16 and the other the &#39;adults&#39;. Sticking me in the &#39;kids&#39; section...sigh, I was a little complacent. My friend was running a Snow-Bomb deck in the same &#39;kids&#39; section though and that was the only deck I couldn&#39;t beat, whereas I prefer having the &quot;adults&#39;&quot; decks for lunch. Greater sense of satisfaction when you see their faces creased in disappointment and grief. Muhahaha.<br>
<br>
Nice work dividing the participants into two tournaments, though. Easier to secure a better rating and not to mention how it forces Decipher to be more generous with their foils.<br>
<br>
And yes, for the very last time, I&#39;m NOT submitting a decklist here! Rate this tournament report all you want like my previous ones, I&#39;m still not sticking my deck here. There are places for decklists and that&#39;s the Decks section. My tournament reports are decklist-free. Suit yourself.<br>
<br>
What I will say is that I&#39;m still playing the same. Boromir, LoG/Merry, FtS start of Ranger-Hobbits denial/Isengard Beatdown (switched back to Beatdown after I decided that Lurtz works better than Wizard Storm). I do hope to use my new online trading account to secure some cards for a new deck either. You ain&#39;t a master in this game until you get to choose what deck to thrash your opponents with :P<br>
<br>
On to the games:<br>
<br>
<b>Game 1</b><br>
<br>
Bye<br>
<br>
I waited...waited for my name...and I got a bye. To some of you, it might be a valuable free win but I hate byes. It simply meant I would lose out on tiebreakers for first place again. For some reason, for the past few tournaments, I had always been paired down, with the most serious one being how my pairing-down twice cost me the first-place finish, and really this looked like it was happening again.<br>
<br>
But what&#39;s this? Somebody just arrived late, looks like I&#39;ve got a challenger.<br>
<br>
vs Daniel Pratama Witono<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Nazgul<br>
<br>
A very uneventful game. He looked a little nervous getting to play me (hail my reputation). We both bid 1, and not bothering to look for a coin, we use Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who gets to choose who moves first. My scissors cut his paper and i went first, as the TD ss when he sees us doing it. As I said, it was very uneventful, my fellowship was barely ruffled the whole game and it was so routine I can&#39;t even remember whether I won by Site 9 or shadow. I do think he lost after playing a few companions to replace those which died in the Bridge and gave me enough twilight to kill him off.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
<br>
<b>Game 2</b><br>
vs Lewis Lau<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Sauron Direct Damage<br>
<br>
1st Sauron player I&#39;ve seen in a long time. I had lost a pick-up game against my friend the day before (first time I ever did to him) and so I was wary. Lewis is a good player, but for some reason, you can see from how he plays, but he always gets 1-3 type of results, and I did beat him in the last tournament when he tried Moria.<br>
<br>
Things don&#39;t go well right at the start. He made me go first and after I exerted for Midgewater Marshes, he got two Watching Eyes and two Bowmen out on the first turn. Very bad, considering I had no condition-removal. I moved slower than normal against him, aware how the wounds can accumulate quickly in double-moves. He too stayed behind me.<br>
<br>
I did pretty well at the start. The wounds were manageable, and I was careful not to exhaust any companion, while his Fellowship faced a beating in the Bridge against 3 Uruks. I left Site 6 first into Anduin Confluence and promptly lost Bounder and Farmer Maggot. Little did I know how useful they&#39;d be later on. With Farmer Maggot gone and Merry, Friend to Sam unable to be healed anymore, I secretly decide for him to be the first sacrifice on the later sites.<br>
<br>
I got Pillars in the Kings out as Site 8 and lost Aragorn to double-Hate. No qualms about that, it was either Aragorn or 2 other companions, and in my mind, I was secretly hoping for Sam to survive to Site 9. I also filled Isildur&#39;s Bane with 4 burdens, ready to clean them off with Sam the next turn. Then in a close encounter, I had to assign Merry, Frodo or Sam to an Orc Assasin. Merry was safest, but 1 wound would kill him, and I assign Frodo, 4-6. With 4 burdens on my ring, he looked really excited as he played Enduring Evil. He thought he had it, but me being the b*st*rd I am, played PATHS to spoil his party. Unfortunately, that put me at 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 burdens.<br>
<br>
Can&#39;t really remember how his fellowship was doing but I do know that he only had 3 companions by the time the rubble at Site 8 had cleared.<br>
<br>
My turn to heave to Site 9 and I used Pillars&#39; text to heal Boromir up, and played Pippin to remove another vital wound. Then I made 2 horrific mistakes.<br>
<br>
First, since I was planning to sacrifice Merry, I forgot to take off his sword and stick it on Frodo or Sam, who were strangely unequipped then.<br>
<br>
Second, I decided not to exert Sam and exhaust him in the process to lower Frodo to 4 burdens because I was afraid of him Hating Sam away. HOW STUPID WAS I?! WHICH ONE IS WORSE?!  ENQUEA SPOTTING 5 BURDENS OR HATE?!<br>
<br>
You might know how this is gonna turn out. I got Slopes of Amon Hen into play and moved in, and by now, Frodo was exhausted with *FIVE* burdens, Pippin was 2 wounds from death, Boromir 2 wounds from death, Merry exhausted and Sam 2 wounds from death. 5 companions and giving him 12 twilight. It looks like another...<br>
<br>
He played Enquea, Nelya and Orc Ambusher. He killed off Boromir (had 2 Flaming Brands on him) and Merry in the maneuver phase, and so there we have it Frodo with 4 strength, Pippin with 3 strength, Sam with 3 strength against Enquea with 11 strength, Nelya with 10 strength and Ambusher with 5 strength, and Enquea and Nelya were fierce. And those watching us were laughing under their skin, hoping to see the top national player toppled.<br>
<br>
I had to take 2 wounds from archery, and this was where it became controversial. I at first exhausted both Sam and Pippin with the 2 wounds but after a while, asked if I could leave Pippin without the wound and cram Frodo with 7 burdens on Isildur&#39;s Bane. He relented without thinking, presuming he had already won.<br>
<br>
Oh well, you agreed, dude. Before 5 million spectators watching us, I clinched victory from the jaws of defeat. Frodo against Enquea, Pippin vs Ambusher, Sam vs Nelya. Frodo first, 4-11, I let Frodo get overwhelmed and Sam stole the ring to give him 1 extra vitality and 5 free burdens (Frodo would have been corrupted after the fierce skirmish). Pippin took 1 wound against Ambusher. Sam against Nelya 4-10. I threw a Stealth. Fierce skirmish, Pippin vs Enquea and Sam vs Nelya. Pippin died, Sam against Nelya 4-10, I threw ANOTHER Stealth. The dust cleared and Sam was alone in the rubble giving the spectators the finger, and around his finger was.....<b>ISILDUR&#39;S BANE</b>.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT!<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-His record. He eventually finished 1-3 in this tournament like usual, which is very contradictory to his skill.<br>
-2 horrific mistakes<br>
-NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER 5 burdens!<br>
-Me for being such a b*st*rd and spoiling somebody&#39;s day<br>
<br>
The TD was called over by him as he realised how that undo granted me victory, and asked if it could be reversed. The TD listened to both sides of the account and eventually ruled that since he had let me take back that move when he wasn&#39;t obliged to and didn&#39;t have the foresight to see the game end like this, the undo would have to stay. Poor guy.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 3</b><br>
vs Benjamin Lin<br>
Dwarves/Moria &#39;Swarms&#39;<br>
<br>
Notice how I put Swarms in parentheses because this guy&#39;s Moria half featured no conditions, yet he always drew luckily into cheap minions. Wonder how he shuffles...never mind.<br>
<br>
He won the bid but made me go first (dude, you really want me to get my Pony? Thanks). I double-moved to the sanctuary easily, while he was stopped at Site 2. Did I ever mention that this guy&#39;s starting fellowship was Gimli and Farin and the only other companions in his deck were 2 Dwarf Guards?<br>
<br>
I really did not enjoy this game. His deck was...well, boring, and unlike an eager guy keen to learn some tips from the top...ahem, he was rather irritable. He chattered with this person continuously about a trade while I was trying to attract his attention as he stalled time. He always took ages with his phases, then would keep asking me to hurry up during mine when my phases were what, twice as quick as his? And he would look away, acting bored and exasperated, never knowing that it was already his phase. A friend of his came by halfway and he was laughing on about how his hand was always so perfect. At Site 7, I Stealthed Merry and added 7 strength to Aragorn for 17 strength to win a skirmish against the Cave Troll and he promptly barked in a surly tone that Merry wasn&#39;t in a skirmish. I laughed in the same surly tone, being seriously p***ed off by him and dared him to call the TD. The TD came and ruled that I was right, as it was specified in the FAQ, and his face fell. And yes, did I mention how he said that &quot;Uruks suck&quot; when Gimli won a skirmish against a Dwarf?<br>
<br>
Really, I wouldn&#39;t have minded if he backed up his thrash-talk in the game, but he was far from it. I was 3 sites in front of him and at Site 5, he purposely sacrified 2 Dwarf Guards when he needn&#39;t, just so he could keep 4 Axe Strikes in hand. Then at Site 6, Farin was overwhelmed, leaving just Gimli and Frodo. Pity I got to Site 9 before I could humiliate his fellowship. My fellowship was practically untouched the whole game.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-None<br>
-As an afterthought, this guy got 1-3 after getting beaten by me and two other friends. What a prop.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-One of the least enjoyable games I&#39;ve played. Really hated it.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 4</b><br>
vs Benjamen Lim (compare to above name)<br>
Ranger-Elf Denial/Nazgul Tip/Breath<br>
<br>
I started the game together with this guy, and where I am now...well at the top of the local sanctioned list, this guy is a little behind... We come from the same school, and were from the same class, and we do get in touch often, but due to some events over the past few weeks, this was his first tournament in a long time, and a long time since I last played him, and I knew he had switched his deck around. &quot;8 Twilight at Site 8!&quot; he was gasping over the phone and &quot;6 Twilight at Site 5&quot; the next day.<br>
<br>
We were both the only 3-0 so winner takes all. It is my chance to win another tournament (2 in 2 days!) and stay way in front of the rankings or for him to pull off one against me and forever get bragging rights.<br>
<br>
I bid 1 to his 0, and I went first, starting the Pony and daring the Ford. I stopped at Trollshaw Forest, afraid of the Ford and he too stopped there, wanting to get the Ford into play. I move, and assign Aragorn to Nelya with Tip and Breath in his support area. Skirmish events first, and he transfers Black Breath over, whereupon I exerted Merry twice for Aragorn to win the skirmish and avoid the Tip. If he hadn&#39;t transferred the Breath, I would have let myself bite the Tip, had 1 Athelas out.<br>
<br>
He got a ludicrous hand, drawing around 6 cards at Trollshaw (Rule of Four, help!) and moved to Site 3. With him having 2 No Strangers and 1 Last Alliance out, I was determined not to let him choke me at Site 4 and showed him Saruman&#39;s Power.<br>
<br>
I moved to Site 4 and he played nothing, daring me with a bluff. He always occassionally does that, and I wondered. I thought long before deciding to double-move. He knows that my strategy is to get to Site 6 first in order to win the race and if I only single-moved, I knew it would be his logic to overtake me and gain control.<br>
<br>
So, it was a bluff. 3 Nazgul but I was fine with them. Filibert was massive during the fierce skirmish as all 3 skirmishes were cancelled. Nothing big in the end, just Boromir with a Tip/Breath on him and Aragorn still had Athelas.<br>
<br>
I was right, he too doubled into the Bridge, losing Arwen along the way.<br>
<br>
I moved into Site 6 and skipped the sanctuary, as I knew I told him before that if you reach Site 6 last, get to Site 7 first. I should stop sharing my philosophies, they&#39;re making my fellowship pant against him.<br>
<br>
He moved into 6 and stopped, knowing he couldn&#39;t catch up. I moved to Pillars of the Kings and on my fellowship phase negated the effects of Blade Tip with the text. I also drew my 2nd Flaming Brand. So, 5 companions going to Site 9 against 2 Nazgul.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+12<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Double moves galore<br>
-Him for getting his best record ever<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Screw my philosophies<br>
<br>
And so, the final standings:<br>
<br>
1st: Me, +12<br>
2nd: Benjamen, +10<br>
3rd: Woon Howe, +10<br>
4th: Yihong, +10<br>
<br>
Bwahaha, the top 4 players were all from my school. Dang, we should start a team or something and sweep the standings all over.<br>
<br>
In the &#39;Open&#39; tournament, an Isengard player also won. This means that last week&#39;s tourny had 1-2-4 for Isengard (I was 2nd behind the &#39;Open&#39; winner due to tiebreakers), yesterday&#39;s had 1st for Isengard (me) and today&#39;s had 1st in both tournaments for Isengard (me and him). So Isengard has dominated the last 4 tournaments. URUKS RULE!<br>
<br>
I got a certificate (hot, 3rd certificate in a week!) and 6 MoM booster packs and opened them with Ben. We really hate MoM packs, total crap in them which are limited in use (except Flaming Brand, Mithril Coat, Flame of Udun and a few others) and totally worthless to sell or trade due to MoM having a smaller card-list and thus features easier-to-obtain cards. Anyway, we open total crap as should be expected with MoM, though I did get a Sam, Proper Poet foil.<br>
<br>
No tournaments for 3 weeks or so so my reign as King will be more than 1-month old. In the meantime, I&#39;ll just wait for the stack of foils Decipher owes me. Just don&#39;t <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3587&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
