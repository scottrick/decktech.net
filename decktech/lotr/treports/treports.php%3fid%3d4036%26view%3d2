So, if you wanted to read a typical tournament report then you should just go back and not waste your time, because this tournament report is going to be different.<br>
<br>
Location: Mind Games<br>
Date: 10/16/2002<br>
<br>
Since the introduction of LOTR Mind Games has been hosting a weekly Wednesday night tournament.  This tournament has occurred every week without question.  Because the tournament has been so consistent it gathers a minimum of 10 players every time and most times goes above the 16 player maximum for the tournament director to participate.  Also, because people know that if they happen to be free on a Wednesday night they know they can catch a tournament at Mind Games, so sometimes there are people who show up from other cities to the north and to the south of Salt Lake valley (there is a lake and a mountain range to the west and a big mountain range to the east).  This tournament is where you also can test your mettle against some of the best players in the state.  Five out of the top Ten players in Utah consistently show up to this tournament.  Basically, this tournament provides a reasonably large pool of players and some stiff competition.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Cortney Haggerty is the one who usually runs these weekly tournaments.  The Wednesday night ritual was actually started back with SWCCG, but as the game died, LOTR took its place as the Wednesday night tournament.  Cortney was going to the World Cup in Germany with Team Lothlorian (Team Lothlorian lost to Team Germany at the time of this TR and faces stiff competition in the form of Team UK, Team USA and possibly Team Rivendell to get to a number #1 ranking).  Since he was going to be gone he asked me to run the tournament in his place.  Ive never run a tournament before.  Id been to plenty as a player and knew how the procedure worked so I felt that it would be ok.  I agreed to run the tournament because its important to keep up the momentum and make sure that the Wednesday night tradition continued.<br>
<br>
When I signed up the tournament on deciphers website I decided to do something a little bit special I had decided to name the tournament Utah Cup in commemoration of the World Cup being played on the very same day.  It was mostly done as a joke since the World Cup was the reason I had to run the whole thing anyway.  The day of the tournament I put together a deck that I could use in case there was an odd number of people and I was needed to prevent a bye.  I got to the store about 20 minutes before the tournament to let those that were there early fill out their scorecards.  It turned out that my using the words Utah Cup was pure marketing genius because a total of 23 people showed to play in this tournament.  Thats the strength of running a tournament every week.  Sometimes you may have trouble getting sanctioned, but other times the players flood out of the woodwork.  Tonight was a night where people were bursting the store to its breaking point.<br>
<br>
When I announced initial pairings I had decided to do something a little bit different.  I copied out a list of the player ranking in the state of Utah.  As a player turned in a scorecard I found their name of the list and put their utah ranking on the scorecard.  My list only contained the top 100 and if there was a player that wasnt on a list I gave them a number above 100.  I then did matchups that would pit the highest ranked players vs. the lowest ranked players.  This was done to avoid high ranked players meeting each other early on in the tournament.  I also gave some latitude and changed pairings so that unfamiliar players would play each other.<br>
<br>
Round 1 <br>
<br>
After announcing all of the pairings I gave everyone one minute to get ready.  As a player I got frustrated with a tournament director would give out prep time and then say that nobody could start until his say so.  As a tournament director I told people they had one minute of prep time but if they were ready to begin they could do so at any time. <br>
<br>
Because of the large amount of players that had shown up there was a dearth of tables and there were four people who had to end up playing on the floor.  There was some table space available but those tables were miniature tables and were not ideal for playing cards upon.  Looking at the gaming supplies available there were some large plastic sheets that are used to play Battlefleet Gothic.  I cleared off the terrain from one of the tables and placed the plastic sheets down for a card gaming surface.  I also scrounged around and found enough chairs so that only one person ended up being chairless during each round.<br>
<br>
Its a tournament directors job to make sure that the players are concerned about playing the game.  I am supposed to mother them and take of their needs as it comes along.   As the round progressed I noticed that all of the bodies in the store were starting to heat the place up a bit, so I opened up the front door before it started to become a problem for the players.<br>
<br>
As the round came to an end, I gave out time warnings of 15, 5, and one minute.  When pairings were completed I would go out and get the tournament sheets and mark down the result.  This gave me something to do during the time, allowed me to organize the scorecards for next round and allowed the players to concentrate on clearing up their cards and tokens for the next round.<br>
<br>
Only one round went to time and the player who was going to lose conceded the game to give out the full win.<br>
<br>
Round 2<br>
<br>
There was a bye created by a late entry into the tournament after the first round.  Before the start of the second round I asked for anyone who lost the first round to volunteer for the bye.  This isnt a bad strategy as there is usually someone who may want the bye for a variety of reasons.  Nobody volunteered however and I randomly chose Derrick Hisatake to sit out the second round.<br>
<br>
Read my book for a while until pairings started to complete.  Nobody had to play on the floor anymore and everything was completed with five minutes to spare.<br>
<br>
Round 3<br>
<br>
The bye disappeared as one player dropped.<br>
<br>
I patrolled the store looking down upon the games and letting each player know about my presence.  I spent the my free time in this round walking around and watching a game every once and a while.  I was especially interested in Michael Wingers game.  Mike didnt have a tournament deck and borrowed my deck so that he could play.   I put together an experimental shadow strategy.  Meaning, Id try it out at the tournament and then make adjustments later.  It wasnt meant to be good, just something different.  Unfortunately Mike didnt know the deck and wasnt running it as well as it could have.  Oh well, he won his game anyway.<br>
<br>
Round 4<br>
<br>
This was the final round.  The problem with running a tournament on a weeknight is that you can only do four rounds and then you have to call it over.  With 22 people still in the tournament and only four rounds to determine the winner there was a good chance there would be more than one undefeated player left remaining.  I paired up Casey Barson (4) vs. Scott Kinnersley(5) against each other to determine one undefeated person.  Unfortunately there was only one other undefeated person left so I had to pair them up with a person who had taken one loss.  I had spent time placing those rankings on the scorecard and I was going to use them, so I was going to take the highest rated 2-1 player and match them up to the remaining undefeated person.  Normally, this would mean that Nathan Magro(3) would have played, but he had a bye for the first round and didnt have a chance to claim second if he actually won.  After looking at each persons score card I settled upon Brad Littler(12) to play Matt Freed(2).  Brad had just lost to Casey and had some good opposition going into the game.  If he won hed have a good chance of claiming second.  <br>
<br>
Casey defeated Scott to claim a 4-0 record for the tournament and Brad pulled off a stunning upset of Matt to place both of them at 3-1.  Brad had never defeated Matt before and I was teasing Brad about giving him the opportunity to play Matt as a way to challenge his LOTR skills.  After Brad beat Matt I asked him if he was glad I paired him up and he said he was, so kudos to the TD.<br>
<br>
Michael Winger went to time and lost to Theodore Cowen as Theos minions overwhelmed Frodo at site 9.<br>
<br>
Final Results<br>
<br>
Casey Barson took first as the only undefeated player at the tournament with a record of 4-0<br>
<br>
Brad Littler took second with a 3-1 record and a monster opposition score of 40 over the course of four rounds.  That translates into Brad playing 4 people with 3-1 records and only losing to one of them<br>
<br>
Zach Gainsley took the participant award winner and had a decent 2-2 record for the tournament.<br>
<br>
Grats:<br>
<br>
Josh Fellows(13) went 0-4 over the course of the tournament.  He was the person who kept getting bumped up to the higher bracket due to his 13 ranking.  So when he was 0-1 he played a 1-0 opponent.  When he 0-2 he played a 1-1 opponent.  When he was 0-3 he played a 1-2 opponent.  He got his 0-4 record the hard way and wasnt complaining about it, so good on you Josh.<br>
<br>
Jake Trumbo, Logan Fields, Jeremiah Lupo, Michael LeVasser.  All of these guys dont normally show up to Mind Games, most, if not all of them, live a good 30 minute drive or more from the store.  I appreciate you guys coming down and making the first Utah Cup a great success.<br>
<br>
Jeff Mafi(48) for going 3-1.  He defeated Nathan Magro(3) in the second round and his only loss was to Matt Freed when he couldnt draw any minions until site 6 or 7.<br>
<br>
Theodore Cowan and Dan Keene who went 3-1 for the first time at a tournament.  Their enthusiasm after the tournament was a bit infectious.<br>
<br>
Brad Littler for defeating Matt Freed.  If you play Matt enough youll eventually beat him, though your lifetime ranking against him wont be too good.<br>
<br>
All of those guys who had to play in the back, without a chair, or on the floor.  Your devotion makes running a tournament worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Everyone who showed up because I didnt have to resolve one bitter rule dispute, all I had to do was clarify a few things.  Nobody gave me any problems and I appreciate it from everyone.<br>
<br>
Slaps:<br>
<br>
Nathan Magro for not filling out a scorecard until after pairings for the first round even though he showed up 15-20 minutes early.  Hopefully next time hell do so earlier.<br>
<br>
Not enough chairs and table space to host more than 20 people.  Matt wont buy more chairs.<br>
<br>
To me for calling the converted miniature table with a missing chair the losers table because four 0-2 players were paired on it.  My comment got a few laughs, but I should have had a bit more decorum when running the tournament. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=4036&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
