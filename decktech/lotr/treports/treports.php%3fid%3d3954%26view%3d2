A pathetic turn-out of 8. This increased to 9 in the 2nd round and decreased to 7 in the 3rd.<br>
<br>
I am a bloody poor idiot so I had no choice but to use my normal Men-Hobbits/Uruks deck. Added 4 Deft and some random shadow to compensate for the faster card-cycling in multiplayer, including, hoho, 3 Saruman&#39;s Power.<br>
<br>
Of the 9, 5 played Moria, 2 (including me) played Uruks, 1 Nazgul, 1 Isengard Orcs. Shockingly, only I played Saruman&#39;s Power.<br>
<br>
With only 8 players in the 1st round, we were divided into 2 games with 4 players each.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 1</b><br>
vs Ong Yunnshing, Bryan Wong, Joachim<br>
<br>
Yunnshing played Large Fellowship with Moria Archery. Bryan played Rangers with Moria swarms, Joachim played Rangers with Uruks.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing bid 3, I bid 1, the other 2 bid 0. Yunnshing opted to go first, starting the Shire Lookout Point. I knew I had to position myself in Free Peoples order, in front of a Moria player in the clockwise direction, so that I could reap the benefits when shadow phases commence in the anti-clockwise direction. Unfortunately, being unable to differentiate front from back, I chose to go 2nd instead of last. Oops. No problem, perhaps Bryan would go 3rd. He and Joachim roll a die and Joachim wins, going 3rd. Shucks. Now he would use up all the twilight reserved for my Uruks on his Uruks.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing started Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer and Gandalf, the Grey Pilgrim. I started Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir, Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith and Merry, Friend to Sam. Joachim and Bryan both started Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer, Arwen, Daughter of Elrond and Legolas Greenleaf. <br>
Yunnshing got the Cart and played a number of stuff before making an easy double to 3. On my side, I played negligible stuff like Athelas and Flaming Brand before moving. At Trollshaw, they all looked blankly at each other and all passed. I followed Yunnshing to Council Courtyard. They all looked blankly at each other and again all passed. Move limit is 3...I could made one more move, but that would leave me HURTLING into Moria with 3 weak companions, ready to be decimated on my next Free Peoples turn. I opted not to move.<br>
<br>
Joachim also followed to 3, but Bryan hung back at 2 after my Wizard Storm raised doubts in him.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing played A Blended Race before moving, and triggered Bryan&#39;s Moria Stairway instead of Joachim&#39;s or my Hollin. After some discussion, Joachim played a Troop. It went to Boromir. 7-7. He played a Battle Cry before discarding his Saruman&#39;s Ambition. 8-7! But he escaped death when Yunnshing played Servant of the Secret Fire. Joachim&#39;s face fell, but I intervened. I played Bred for Battle to pump it back to 8-7, and Yunnshing played another Servant. Both our faces fell.<br>
<br>
I moved to 4 and too was forced to stop. I wasn&#39;t going to move into 5 with just Boromir, Merry and Frodo and the Balrog looming large.<br>
<br>
Joachim followed suit to 4. Bryan stopped at 3.<br>
Yunnshing played Aragorn and some other toys, giving a scandalous amount of twilight at the Bridge. After the dust was cleared, he was staring at LOTS of Moria Orcs (albeit small), a Balrog, and a few Uruks. 2 companions died, though not the major ones like Gandalf, Aragorn and Boromir. He wisely stopped.<br>
<br>
And guess what? Bryan&#39;s Moria Orcs went onto Swarms...just in time for them to be readied for playing....AGAINST ME!<br>
I was in trouble here. I got Aragorn and his Bow out with a Sword on Frodo before moving to the Bridge. I watched nervously as Joachim played Enquea, and Bryan emptied most of his Swarms, culminating with the Balrog. As many minions as I had companions, thankfully. During Maneuver, Yunnshing played Such a Little Thing. I had 4 possessions: Bow, 2 Flaming Brands on Boromir and a Sword each on Frodo and Merry. I contemplated long. The Sword on Frodo was staying definitely: I could use it and Bounder to chase away the Balrog for a skirmish. I had to pick 2 out of the other 4. Taking Flaming Brand out would mean me unable to torch Enquea to pieces. Bow meant I would be unable to shoot. I contemplated long before getting rid of a Brand and Sword. Then he played another Such a Little Thing. D&#39;oh! All 4 possessions ended up in the discard pile and I watched him with a furtive look. I had 1 possession left. He smiled and shook his head.<br>
<br>
As it turned out, nobody died, though Aragorn took 2 wounds, Boromir ended up exhausted, Merry took 1 and Pippin somehow miraculously survived somewhere along the lines.<br>
Joachim and Bryan made single-moves, with Joachim getting Legolas and Boromir killed after my fierce Uruks ran havoc and Aragorn and Arwen were left with Frodo, both exhausted. Bryan had Arwen and Legolas killed at the exact time he began drawing into Asfaloths, Gwemegils and Tales of Gil-Galad. He never drew another minion for the rest of the game until....well.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing tripped Bryan&#39;s Valley of the Silverlode (Moria decks play that??) and managed to deal with whatever we threw at him.<br>
<br>
I made the move too after some extensive healing and had no problem surviving. At this point, I knew this wasn&#39;t going to work. I couldn&#39;t just follow behind him. I had to make a quick break somewhere to overtake him, but I still had quite a few wounds leftover from the beating at 5.<br>
Yunnshing played A Blended Race before making a double to 8. He didn&#39;t go for the triple after he suffered another barrage of wounds after A Blended Race lost its effect after the first move.<br>
<br>
Time was going to be called as I began my move. I had 2 options. Make a simple move to 7 or 8 and end up 2nd behind Yunnshing (4 points) OR make an ill-advised, successful triple right into 9 and finish 1st at the stroke of time (7 points) OR I could make my ill-advised triple right into 9, die and finish last in a timed loss (0 points).<br>
I did some Stinging. Yunnshing had 2 Orcs. Bryan had nothing. I didn&#39;t Sting Joachim. I moved, giving 8 at 7. Yunnshing dropped his first 2 Armories, and left the 8 for Joachim&#39;s Troop of Uruk-hai + Uruk-hai Rampage. Left Boromir exhausted. I played 2 Deft in Their Movements. Made the move to 8, giving 5 twilight at Pillars of the Kings. Yunnshing got 2 Moria archers down, as Bryan passed again, leaving 3 twilight for Joachim&#39;s Rampage at his insistence. The 2 archery wounds...I contemplated long before taking one of them as burdens, even though if I ran, the next site was Summit of Amon Hen. Bad choice, that meant my 3 burdens encompassed 9 potential shadow card-draws. Anyway, a Marksman injured Pippin while Aragorn was unable to kill Bowman + Scimitar after 2 Armories were sacked. Boromir died to the Troop. I wondered what the hell was I doing. Should&#39;ve let Pippin die and Boromir kill the Marksman. Bleh. Anyway, I purposely lost the skirmish so that he would use up the 3 twilight, and he faced Aragorn, giving 2 wounds.<br>
<br>
I made it easily to 8. So, 5 points or 7? 5 points or 0? <br>
Choices...crossroads...<br>
<br>
I moved to Summit, giving them 6 twilight (should&#39;ve been 5 if Boromir and No Stranger were there, but it didn&#39;t matter in the end). 2 puny Moria archers with my PATHS in hand, and 1 Troop of Uruk-hai who could be directed to any of my 4 companions except Frodo, and only 6 twilight for more minions. No Armories, no nothing. I had the game sealed, right?<br>
<br>
I watched in horror as Yunnshing and Bryan proceeded to play a whole bunch of Runners with an Armory and Scimitar. I didn&#39;t bother to count how many they played. Just too many. Then the Orcs hid and suddenly, out of the gloom...Lurtz came out, emptying the twilight pool, and Joachim swore to take revenge and kill me after I had ripped his fellowship in half. I was dealing with LOTS of Orcs, Lurtz and a Troop here!<br>
<br>
My original plan had been to take care of the first round of skirmishes with PATHS and use companions to shield Frodo from fierce skirmishes, but the number of Orcs....?! This was going to be impossible, and it all stemmed because I sat behind those Moria players. Time for the riskier plan.<br>
Lurtz and Troop and a Scavenger killed my other 3 companions off as Frodo PATHSed...well, a lot of Orcs to death. Fierce, Lurtz returned, 6-13. I exerted Bounder and prayed. Hard. He played Bred for Battle and Savagery. 18-6.<br>
<br>
18-6?<br>
<br>
gosh darnit!<br>
<br>
TL +0/+0<br>
<br>
After I died. Joachim moved to 7 as time was called. With all their resources depleted to kill me (grrr), he survived with just Aragorn and Frodo. So finally, the results for this game.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing, (+6 Site 8)<br>
Joachim (+4 Site 7)<br>
Bryan (+2 Site 6)<br>
Me (+0 DEAD at Site 9)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-KAMIKAZE!<br>
Slops: <br>
-A Blended Race<br>
-It really sucks to sit behind Yunnshing.<br>
-It really sucks to kill Joachim&#39;s companions. <br>
<br>
In the other game, Loh Mun Kit in a similar scenario dropped from 2nd to 3rd after a kamikaze 6-9 triple-move. <br>
<br>
Somebody played Can You Protect on him with 2 burdens. He added 2 to 4. The next guy played another one to add 2 to 6. Back to the first guy, he played another one to add 2 to 8. And the next one played another one and in exasperation, Kit finally exhausted Aragorn after taking 6 useless burdens.<br>
<br>
With a late player joining our ranks, we had 9, enough for 3 games with 3 players each. I went to the losers table, sniff.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 2</b><br>
vs Gene Wong, Mark Liew<br>
<br>
Gene played super-choke with Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom and for the most part an Aragorn/Frodo fellowship, and Isengard Orcs for shadow. Mark played Hobbits Hospital choke, with Consorting and such, and Moria swarms for shadow.<br>
Oh yes, you see the very big problem. ALL THREE OF US WERE PLAYING CHOKE! Albeit 3 different types.<br>
<br>
Mark bid 5, Gene and I both bid 1. Mark opted to go 2nd. Gene and I rolled dice, and he won, making me go first. In front of the Moria player! Woot! I started the Pony.<br>
Gene started Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir, Aragorn, Ranger of the North. Mark started Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir, Sam, Son of Hamfast, Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine and Pippin, Friend to Frodo (excellent choice). I started...zzz. <br>
Drew a largely shadow hand. Pulled Aragorn, Heir to the White City and played some negligible stuff. Tripped Mark&#39;s Buckleberry Ferry. Faced negligible resistance but opted out of the double. Moving too fast at the start can be dangerous with not one, but TWO choke opponents.<br>
<br>
Mark removed some burdens and played a lot of stuff, amounting to 9 twilight, including Aragorn, Heir to the White City after much hesitation and soaked it up with 3 Bilbo-Consorting-Hobbit Party Guest (got it first turn, gosh darnit!) exertions and Aragorn. He gave 10 twilight. I got the green from Gene and used it all with 2 Uruks. 1 Savagery with 5 companions meant Merry took 2 and Aragorn died as all 3 of us started laughing. He had made a hard choice on whether to grab Aragorn or move into Buckleberry with just Hobbits and...oh shrug, let&#39;s take it that he never pulled Aragorn after all ;).<br>
<br>
Gene got No Stranger and Bill the Pony out, with Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom before playing free Ranger&#39;s Sword and Flaming Brand, giving us a grand total of 2 twilight at Buckleberry. He moved again, remarking how we were scaredy-cats to stop at 2. Mark used the 4 twilight to drop some conditions since I couldn&#39;t use it.<br>
<br>
I played 2 Bounders before giving 4 twilight at 3. Mark used it all on a Pursuer since Gene too couldn&#39;t use it. I diced it and played Deft in Their Movements before moving to Pass of Caradhras, giving 4 twilight again. Mark used it all again on Moria Scout and Goblin Pursuer and more conditions and such. I diced both Orcs up.<br>
<br>
Mark stopped at 3 to heal off some wounds.<br>
<br>
Gene moved, giving...well, 2 twilight. Mark dropped more conditions and I started to grip my Saruman&#39;s Power tightly. Hadn&#39;t had the twilight to use it yet, but soon...<br>
I moved to 5, giving 8. We cheered as Gene played an Isengard Retainer, his VERY FIRST minion so far! That left nothing for Mark&#39;s Balrog, and he played a flurry of Orcs, of which a Scavenger survived to Swarms. I stopped, too many Orcs.<br>
<br>
Mark moved to 4 and Gene used the twilight up since I was roaming.<br>
<br>
Then Gene moved to 5, giving 7 twilight. I requested 5 and hinted that I wanted to play a big minion. Mark smiled, realising what I wanted to play. What he thought I wanted to play. He left that to me after playing a Scavenger. I used it to play an Uruk Warrior and Saruman&#39;s Power, destroying Gene&#39;s Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom, No Stranger and A Talent, but MOST importantly, I destroyed Mark&#39;s 3 Goblin Armories, 1 Goblin Swarms, 2 Relics of Moria and 1 They are Coming. We bowled over laughing at Mark&#39;s good-natured exclamations of betrayal. The Warrior won Aragorn after a pump and the Scavenger won Frodo. He stopped.<br>
<br>
I stopped at 6 to heal off wounds. I gave 5 twilight there, and so, Mark concentrated on replacing his conditions, with 1 Armory and 1 Swarms. I raised an eyebrow. Mark then doubled to 6 and. Gene moved to 6 and with his denial conditions destroyed last turn, Mark and I got a sizable force out considering that we were against a choke. And yes, I played my 2nd Saruman&#39;s Power, victimising Mark again as he dumped his Armory and Swarms. Those were the last conditions in his deck, as he had already discarded his extras, and he again cursed my Power good-naturedly. Gene had to stop as Aragorn and Frodo both took wounds.<br>
I made an easy double to 8, making quick work of 1-vitality Orcs and Isengard Retainers. Mark and Gene both knew that they had lost it. They had to fight for 2nd place or kill me, which was rather improbable, considering how Mark had no more conditions (lol) and Gene used Isengard Orcs, who do badly at Site 9. It was a race between Mark and Gene. Mark went first and moved to 7. Gene told me to use the twilight and I used it on 2 Uruks and...a THIRD Saruman&#39;s Power. Mark could only cover his face in exasperation as he discarded his three Promises and A Talent For Not Being Seen and Gene laughed heartily. Pippin prevented me from touching a lot of his tales though, including Consorting With Wizards. With Frodo and Sam suddenly a lot less intimidating, and the Uruks a whole lot more, he stopped.<br>
Gene remarked that he only needed to survive to 7 as his Frodo had only 1 burden while Mark&#39;s had 3. He played Pippin and made the move to 7, giving only 11 twilight. I only had a Saruman and Ravager in hand, so I told Mark to use it all. A Runner with Scimitar and a Cave Troll. Thrarin and Pippin fed the Troll while for a curious reason, Frodo let himself get wounded by the Runner.<br>
Gene was just about to end his turn and declare to stop and finish a happy 2nd when he caught sight of Mark&#39;s Sam! That put Gene&#39;s resistance at 9 and Mark&#39;s at 12. He hastily ordered to move again as Mark groaned and gave a sly laugh. With his master plan failed, he now had to kill Gene to finish 2nd. He scowled at his hand.<br>
<br>
And I stepped in. I told him to leave me to it and dropped Saruman, Ravager and Berserker, as Mark smiled as a glimmer of hope appeared. So, a 15-strength Troll, 7-strength Runner, 11-strength Uruk and 9-strength Uruk on the table, and all except the Runner were Damage +1 and Fierce against Aragorn and Frodo. Game?<br>
<br>
Ranger of the North took on all 4 minions for the first skirmish and died a very bloody death. Then the Uruks and Cave Troll came back for the Fierce with 35 strength stacked on Frodo&#39;s 6. Bounder was there but...<br>
<br>
Gene showed us why he lacked minions for the last couple of turns. He dropped his whole hand, containing 3 Stealths and 2 Intuitions to put Frodo at 18. 18! Bounder exerted...Mark and I stared in disbelief. And even then, the 4 wounds Frodo had to take were soaked up comfortably by the Ruling Ring. Gene had kept all those cards in hand, hoping for a final surge in the last couple of sites to overtake us, and they served him well.<br>
<br>
Anyway on my turn, I moved into 9 after playing Sam, Proper Poet. That gave me 6 companions and allowed me to comfortably take on 10 minions or so if need be. They both had nothing in their hand though.<br>
<br>
FW +7/+7<br>
<br>
1st: Me, (+7, Site 9)<br>
2nd: Gene Wong, (+5, Site 8)<br>
3rd: Mark Liew, (+3, Site 7)<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
-Saruman&#39;s Power...THRICE!!! Poor Mark.<br>
-Really enjoyable game with lots of laughs<br>
-The priceless look on Mark&#39;s face<br>
-Very fast game, finished in less than an hour.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-None, great game.<br>
We waited really long for the other 2 tables to finish. There were supposed to be 4 rounds, but due to time constraints, only 3 would be played after all. 2 people left, bringing the number to 7, and a 4-player and 3-player game.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 3</b><br>
vs Joachim, Celia, Ong Yunnshing<br>
<br>
This looked almost exactly like Game 1?! Sigh, yawn. I&#39;d much rather have had another quick game at the other table...Anyway, this tournament was seriously dragging. Joachim looked ill, Celia was getting snappy, Yunnshing wanted to go home, and I was just hungry. <br>
Celia played Hobbits with Moria.<br>
<br>
Yunnshing only needed to finish 3rd in this game to win the tournament so we schemed before, forming the Last Alliance of Moria and Isengard to dump him out 1st while he listened to our plans with wide eyes.<br>
<br>
Celia and Joachim both bid 4, I bid 1, Yunnshing bid 0.<br>
Joachim won the dice-roll and went first. Celia went second. Me...thanks to my bloody memory, I mistakenly thought Joachim was Bryan and went to sit 4th &#39;in front&#39; of him, hoping to reap the benefits of Moria. Of course he was using Uruks, d&#39;oh. D&#39;OH!<br>
<br>
Joachim started the Prancing Pony and realised with a sinking feeling that the burden he added for Pony put him at 5, and he didn&#39;t start Sam or something. Strangely enough, none of just drew an Enquea for the whole game.<br>
Uneventful first turns. Joachim and Yunnshing went to 2 while Celia and I doubled to 3. Joachim then went to 3 and Celia tripped Hollin before stopping. Then Yunnshing moved to 3 and the alliance began to crumble.<br>
<br>
He gave 5 twilight, with his companions battered. I explained to Celia, who played first, to give the twilight to Joachim or me where our 3-cost Uruk would win a skirmish, exhaust Gandalf or Aragorn, and prevent a double-move, as the Uruk would still be there, and it was sound advice, but she, annoyed by how she was unable to get a shadow card in for much of the shadow phase before, didn&#39;t listen to our counsel and dropped a Scavenger. Gandalf diced it up and Yunnshing took the double gratefully, whereupon our minions were unable to do much by then. I wasn&#39;t pleased.<br>
<br>
I too stopped at 4, ill-equipped to deal with the Balrog. At this stage, Yunnshing had already brought out 3 Armories and all the staple conditions expected of Moria. Joachim too stopped at 4 on his turn. Celia moved to the Bridge and Stealthed out of most of what we threw. Then Yunnshing played Boromir with Armor and moved to 5, giving a generous 15 twilight.<br>
<br>
At this stage, I again tried to advise Celia, who was playing first again. Yunnshing&#39;s Glamdring had revealed her to have the Balrog and Troll in hand but no Orcs. I pointed out that this was the time to kill him. He only had 4 companions but gave out 15 twilight, and his Frodo had no Bounder, no Sting, just a naked 4-strength, and Aragorn had no Bow or anything. All we had to do was to get 5 minions out and Yunnshing was out. I could bring 2 Uruks out with 7 twilight, and Joachim could slip in a 5 if the twilight allowed. All we needed was for Celia to pitch her hand to They are Coming for Scavengers and hopefully draw into Runners, Scavengers....blah blah, just get 2 minions out and leave enough in the twilight pool, which was very possible, if just for attempting it. What she should NOT do, I pointed out, was to play the Balrog or Troll because both Yunnshing&#39;s Aragorn and Boromir were attired with Armor and they would do nothing. What we needed in this situation was numbers, not brute strength.<br>
<br>
Again, Joachim&#39;s and my counsel fell on deaf ears. She didn&#39;t even consider our proposal, just played a Scavenger and the Balrog after discarding to They are Coming, leaving only 3 in the pool, where I could only play my Captain. I was really offended this time, but kept quiet. Joachim too looked rather angry, as she denied him a chance to play anything from his hand with the 3 twilight.<br>
<br>
Of course, no lasting harm was done. Aragorn and Boromir simply shrugged off the attentions of the Balrog, and the Scavenger went on Swarms.<br>
<br>
I too faced a horde of Orcs both from Yunnshing and Celia and had to stop.<br>
<br>
Joachim was the last one to enter the Bridge and he fared the worst. He gave 12 twilight. Celia was really miffed by now so I allied with Yunnshing to bring out Berserker, Warrior and Yunnshing an Archer Commander. I could have used the Berserker&#39;s text after spotting his 5 burdens but decided not to.<br>
<br>
I had good reason. He assigned Berserker to Aragorn, and I used Bred for Battle and Savagery to get the Berserker to 16 strength, overwhelming him, and leaving exhausted Arwen and Legolas. Now he really felt like leaving the game, but not after killing me and taking revenge, as he swore in the first game.<br>
<br>
I still had not drawn into a single Saruman&#39;s Power and Celia got full use of her conditions as she unleashed a horde of Orcs on Yunnshing, again leaving Joachim and me nothing. They did a lot of damage, and most of them went on Swarms, and as I stared, they all went on Swarms, just in turn to face.....ME on my next turn. Dang Yunnshing, you always have to do that! :P Ironically, when she finally took my advice, it was to put an extra Orc in a losing skirmish with a Goblin Runner, so that it would go on Swarms. I rock, I just helped her put the Runner on Swarms to use it against me next turn.<br>
<br>
I had to tread very carefully here. I used Sting on Joachim to help my decision on whether to drop Sam as a 5th companion and to see if his vows to kill me were true. All my questions were answered right away. He had 2 Savageries and 2 Bred for Battle in his hand, and on the table were 4 Saruman&#39;s Ambition. Excellent. So I not only had to deal with the largest Moria swarm ever, but the largest Troop of Uruk-hai ever!<br>
<br>
The swarm wasn&#39;t that big, helped by the low twilight of Site 6, but it still wasn&#39;t good. Altogether, 2 Goblin Scavengers with Scimitars, 2 Backstabbers, 1 Runner and 1 potentially HUGE Troop of Uruk-hai stared at my 4 companions.<br>
<br>
I knew anybody would die against the Troop so I assigned Merry to it. I had a PATHS in hand but both Yunnshing and Celia had an abundancy of Armories and they were rather willing to sack them, since they figured that I would Power them eventually after that uproar in my last game.<br>
Aragorn and Boromir took on the 10-strength Orcs. Frodo took on a Runner. I left the 2 Backstabbers unassigned. It was the best anybody could do, if you do the thinking. I seriously hoped the other 3 players would not sight what I had already seen long ago...<br>
<br>
I stopped breathing for a while as Celia noted that I could just take burdens if they put the Backstabbers on Frodo. I breathed again in relief as even Yunnshing failed to notice how I could be killed. The 2 Backstabbers went on Aragorn for an overwhelm (both Aragorn and Boromir had Armor). They didn&#39;t realise that if they stacked them on Frodo, I could prevent an overwhelm with Bounder but Damage +4 and me taking 5 wounds would corrupt me. Glad they didn&#39;t bother with simple maths. The price was high though, I was left with Boromir and Frodo alone. That&#39;s what happens when you sit behind a Moria player, or for that matter, 2 Moria players with 3 Armories apiece.<br>
<br>
Everything except the Runner went to Celia&#39;s Swarms. Joachim found nothing useful and moved to 3 with 3 companions, and was horribly outnumbered. He was the first to lose the game, and that meant Yunnshing was now confirmed the winner of the tournament.<br>
<br>
Celia used Sting on Yunnshing and found no Orcs. She used Thror&#39;s Map for Anduin Wilderland. I looked at my hand and concealed my anxiety. This was not good. The move limit in this game was 3. I shrugged at Yunnshing as Celia turned away for a second.<br>
<br>
Clearing my throat, I leaned forward on the table and grimaced at my hand, remarking how the twilight she gave was insufficient for my Lurtz to have an accompanying Uruk. Yes yes, this hand would be better suited for higher twilight resources, I concluded. And so, I played nothing.<br>
Blah, so she had Sting but at least it was worth a try. She moved again to my Gates of Argonath and Yunnshing shrugged at me. I had a small trump. The Ravager I just drew with a Wizard Storm.<br>
<br>
Her Frodo took care of the Ravager and she would have survived easily had she moved but she didn&#39;t, obviously unnerved by the Storm. Good, the job had been done.<br>
Yunnshing attempted to test the move-limit too but was stopped by a horde of Orcs. I still drew nothing for shadow.<br>
On my side, I dropped Sam, Proper Poet and resolved to also test the move-limit. I had a couple of Deft in Their Movements in hand to allow me to give an unbelievable 1 or 2 twilight once I survived 7, and PATHS, and they had already sacked most of their Armories by now. Too many Orcs again however, and Sam was forced to die and I was forced to use the PATHS to bail me out before the Site 9 hurrah I planned. I abandoned the notion and got rid of as many Free Peoples as I could.<br>
<br>
Time to try and kill Celia. Her Sting revealed Yunnshing to have nothing. I was slightly better, I had an Uruk Warrior, yeah, just one. She had 4 rather large Hobbits, including Sam.<br>
<br>
She moved to my Slopes of Amon Hen. I played the Warrior and FINALLY my first Saruman&#39;s Power (nice time to draw it) to get rid of her Promises but I turned around and saw Yunnshing dumping his They are Coming. NOOOOOOOO! Oh wait, he played another from his hand. He dumped 3 cards for a Scavenger and drew 1. Dumped 3 cards for a Scavenger and drew 1. Dumped his last 3 cards for another Scavenger and drew 1...he looked at the card and smiled sadly at me.<br>
<br>
L +3/+10<br>
<br>
1st: Celia, (+7, Site 9)<br>
2nd: Yunnshing, (+5, Site 7, 9 Resistance)<br>
3rd: Me, (+3, Site 7, 6 Resistance)<br>
4th: Joachim, (+1, overwhelmed at Site 6)<br>
<br>
Props<br>
-Now I can go home!<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-Me and Yunnshing having no minions in the end and giving Celia a free trip.<br>
-It really sucks to sit behind Yunnshing.<br>
-It really sucks to kill Joachim&#39;s companions.<br>
-I sucked.<br>
<br>
Final results:<br>
1st: Ong Yunnshing, +18 (1st TL, 1st, 2nd)<br>
2nd: Celia Chen, +14 (1st TL, 4th, 1st)<br>
3rd: Me, +10 (4th TL, 1st, 3rd)<br>
<br>
Really pathetic that I actually finished 3rd with just 10 points, but there were a lot of people with 7-9 points. Nice job to Yunnshing for adapting to the new environment and Celia for getting her best tournament finish.<br>
As for me, shouldn&#39;t have put in those extra cards. They only made my deck more inconsistent (i.e. no multiple PATHS for Site 9, Saruman&#39;s Power, weak companions etc) and didn&#39;t do much, except 3 Saruman&#39;s Power, hoho. And next time, I WILL sit in front of a Moria player! I managed it in Game 2 and it was a breeze in that one.<br>
<br>
The Mirror, post latest errata, is still a viable utility in the correct multiplayer deck. Go think on it. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3954&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
