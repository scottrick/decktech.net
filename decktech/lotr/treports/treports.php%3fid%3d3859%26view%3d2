That sucked, but at least a couple guys from Santa Clara came up to make it sanctioned.  Anyway, I was playing an Uruk shadow with a Gondor-based fellowship on a Gandalf TGP card-drawing platform.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Me vs. Frank Pinkelas nonexistent lone Frodo/Moria Archery<br>
  Well, no report needed, he showed up an hour late (although he called ahead of time to let us know), so for the first round he was the bye (and of course I got stuck with it since everyone else wanted to play and I was the TDI hate that).  Oh well, I had him anyway, my deck wouldve rolled through his archers like nobodys business with my Aragorn signets, Citadels, Athelas, and Elrond, and his Frodo had nothin on my Uruks (you have pumps, Frodo?  Me too.  PATHs?  Meet Saruman.  hehe).<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
<br>
Game 2: Me vs. Steve Daniels Frodo-Aragorn Pumper Choke/Uruks<br>
  This game was more of a slapping match than a brawl, we both single-moved most of the way, pinging away at each other with 1 minion (max 2 on my fellowship) per site.  He finally doubled 5-7, so he was at 8 when I moved out of the sanctuary (I single-moved every turn, my fellowship was not setting up, and he got 2 guys down at site 6, so I wasnt about to skip it).  However, when I drew my hand for fellowship at site 6, I drew 3 Servants (to join the one I was holding), 2 Armors, Aragorns Bow, and a Blade of Gondor (at that point my 9th card was a Saruman I was holding).  Great, my fellowship is untouchable now that hes too far ahead to catch.  So, I move to 7, where he drops a Fighter and a Lieutenant.  I assign the Lieutenant to Frodo because he wants to see some action, he plays Bred for Battle (Lieutenants at a 12), I Servant (back to 9), he discards Ambition (11), Servant (8), Ambition (10), Servant (7), Ambition (9), Servant (6) to Frodos 7.  Die you bastard, die.  Hehehe, that was fun.  Then Boromir proceeds to beat the Fighter severely, and since I cant catch him I stop (having now cleared my hand of fellowship).  He moves to site 9 (Slopes), I drop Saruman, a Captain, and a Troop, he has just Aragorn HttWC (2 wounds to give) and Frodo with Sting and a Bounder, as well as like 5 cards in his hand.  I have 2 pool left (1 more and I could have played another minion), so I use the Palantir to drop two of his cards, Valiant Man of the West and Sentinels of Numenor (nice!  Id been hitting nothing but Shadow cards all game, and I was getting really annoyed).  I was holding some Savageries to hit Frodo with, and I think I had him (he had no Frodo pumps, just 3x PATHs, worthless with Saruman there).  But then he plays the other Valiant Man he was holding (3rd that game, and he still had quite a bit of deck left), Aragorn takes them both twice.  Game over.  Oh well, it was close, I lost to a great opponent, and at least my fellowship got all indestructible eventually (although a little to late to make a difference).<br>
FL +1/+4<br>

Game 3: Me vs. Mason Gilligans Superfellowship/Isengard Orcs<br>
  I seem to play Mason in pretty much every tourney (even the NorCal Territorial), and its always a very close game.  Haha, not today, baby, not today.  His Orcs did jack against me-- I set up early like Im supposed to and worked him over, his Orc Overseers and Commanders got some wounds through pretty much every turn, but Elrond, Aragorn signets, and the Citadels negated everything he did.  I could have just cruised to 9, but instead I just got 2 sites ahead and beat down his fellowship.  Sam, Arwen, Gimli, and Gandalf were all dead by site 5, and when he moved into Lothlorien he had exhausted Legolas and exhausted Boromir as Frodos only support, I had 2x Tower of Orthanc down (dirty!), so he played nothing and I got 12 at site 6 anyway.  Hehe.  I dropped a pair of Troops, and it was over for Lego and Boromir.  So, on my turn I just single-moved to 8.  On his turn he dropped Elrond, drew 4 cards (one of them was another Elrond), dropped Aragorn KiE, moved to 7, and faced 2 Lieutenants and a Guard.  Have a nice day, Frodo.<br>
FW +3/+7<br>

Game 4: Me vs. Jason Piazzas Archery/Nazgul<br>
  Jason was playing the same deck that got all its conditions out early and killed my ranger deck last tourney, so I was looking for revenge.  This time I knew not to play Aragorns Bow, so that helped, but basically I just ran through him like there was nothing there, Aragorn was naked pretty much all game (his sword and my 2nd Brand were at the bottom of the deck, apparently), but Gandalf hit 6 vitality, Boromir got his blade and a brand, and Elrond showed up with his ring and started bouncing Breaths and Tips back at Jason.  Once again, he got the conditions out very early (Aragorn got hit with the pair at site 3), but this time Elrond made an appearance and dropped the Tip at site 5 then the Breath when I moved into 6.  I ended up doubling into 9 with Boromir at a wound-free strength 12, Aragorn at a 10 (sword showed up at site 7) and wound-free, and Gandalf with Breath, Tip, and 4 wounds (still 2 left!) and Toldea following me.  He dropped the Witch-King and Lemenya, but it didnt matter.  Gandalf Intimidated the wound from the Kings first fight, Aragorn killed Lemenya, Boromir killed Toldea, and Boromir did 3 wounds to the King in the fierce thanks to a Servant.  Oh, and by the way, Frodo was at a strength 7 complete with O Elbereth, so he basically needed to get 6 guys down at site 9 to get to Frodo (and even that wouldnt have done it, I would have tossed the big ones on him and discarded O Elbereth!, Aragorn and Boromir each kill one, and Frodo once again is left without someone to skirmish in the fierce).  Man, I love this deck.<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
<br>
  So, thats what happened at the tourney in my games.  The best thing was in the last round though, the new guy (Benjamin) who was playing my Hobbit/Sauron deck almost beat Mason, he had 4 Orc Bowmen down, had Hated Arwen and Legolas to death, Gandalf and Gimli had fallen to archery, and Sam was long gone, he moved into 9 where he was met by a Morgul Hunter and a pair of trackers, Aragorn gets exhausted by archery (takes 3 of them, the Saga saved him) and Boromir dies to it, Aragorn dies to the Hunter and Frodo kills the trackers with 2x PATHs (giving him 9 burdens to go with his 4 wounds, very close there).  Mason won, but it was great watching him sweat and almost lose to a guy who didnt really know what he was doing to go 1-3.  Still, he pulled it out and managed to go 2-2 (losing to me and Steve, the top 2 finishers).  Of course, we had the traditional multi-player games afterward, the first was me and Frank vs. Mason, Jason, and Nick.  Frank died to Jasons Nazgul at site 4 (Morgul Gates, Witch-King, They Will Never Stop Hunting You to both Legolas and Arwen, Relentless Charge, the King eats Frodo), so it was now just me vs. 3 opponents, but I almost pulled it off (I managed to triple-move from 5 to 8 without taking a single woundhows that for a beastly fellowship, huh?).  The next game was me and Frank vs. Mason and Jason (Nick was off reading comic books at that point), and we resumed our tradition of excellence, killing Mason at site 6 and decking Jason at 7, Frank and I were both at 8 and Jason was at 7, and both of us had our turns before his next fellowship, so he gave up.  Well, I hope you enjoyed the report, maybe next time well have enough people to make it interesting.<br>
