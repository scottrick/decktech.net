My deck is/was horrible. I name it the Mini-Fellowship (usually 4 companions) Twilight Denial arch-type when in truth, it is more of a jumble of assorted cards (skeleton&#39;s Ranger-Elf support/pure Isengard). I was then still unable to remove my 2 Boromir Uncommons for a single Boromir rare and had only one or none each of Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Gwemegil, Lurtz and other essential rares. Hard trading with my measly pocket money.<br>
<br>
The tournament was scheduled to start at 6.30p.m., and I was anxious, knowing my tight schedule for the next day. At least it was Friday, and school would not fit into it.<br>
<br>
Game 1: vs Samuel, Ranger-Elf/Sauron-Nazgul discard/direct-damage<br>
<br>
Heard a lot of this deck, and it was scary hearing all the &quot;look at your hand, discard 1 I want&quot; sentences multiple times in a turn while he was sparring in some friendly games, and the measly hand-sizes and draw deck his opponents had. Samuel is also an experienced player in every CCG and one of the shopkeepers. I was prepared for the worst.<br>
<br>
I bid 6, he bid 4 and raised an eyebrow. Everybody does that when I bid 6, but they never realise the power of Sam. I start Arwen and Sam, he starts Arwen and Greenleaf. Start the Prancing Pony and am stopped from moving on Site 2. He double-moves to Site 3, and I realise I&#39;d better go on the offensive. I move on to site 3, and with him putting down more Bowmen and Under the Watching Eye but scarce a minion, I press on and skip the sanctuary. Survived. We both reached Site 6 at the same time, with me leaving first. Stopped at Site 7, he doubled to Site 8. Drew Thror&#39;s Map to ensure my last sites were rivers (never drew Aragorn&#39;s Bow, though, so Ranger&#39;s Versatility was neutralised) and, on hindsight, avoided a potentially painful Shores of Nen Hithoel. Didn&#39;t despatch of his minions completely, but decided to move on to the last site by virtue of his strong fellowship. Then the bomb dropped.<br>
<br>
He Hated away my Arwen, leaving me with 3 companions. He puts down a fierce Enquea and uses Tol Brandir to get 3 Orc Scouting Bands on the table. 4 vs 3.<br>
<br>
Blessedly, he made his first and only mistake of the game. Frodo survived against the 2 Scouting Bands skirmishing him after Boromir pumped him. Thank God I never managed to get Boromir rare before this tournament!<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
<br>
Pulled off a huge upset. Wow.<br>
<br>
Game 2: vs (only remember his IRC name&#39;s Skizzik, K*** H***  or something), Gandalf pipe/Moria swarm<br>
<br>
gosh darnit, another pro. He was one of the earliest in the area to start on the game and his card album makes me drool.<br>
<br>
I bid 6, he bids 4, he raises an eyebrow again although he has seen me crazily trying to outbid my Bag End friend with a bid of 9 before. I start Arwen and Sam, he starts Gandalf. Was careless early, dropping Lurtz down at site 2 to &#39;make a statement&#39; and promptly lost him to normal archery. I pass Site 4 and Site 5 with bated breath and am surprised to find he doesn&#39;t drop a single minion. I move to Site 6 and boom, he drops his whole hand, he was stocking up on minions.<br>
<br>
I am a sorry sight in the assignment phase. He is more careful than my last opponent, making sure there is a Backstabber helping the fight against Boromir after assigning some other random guy to Frodo. Resolve Frodo, Boromir saves him from being overwhelmed, and promptly dies in his own skirmish. Managed to fix things up a little at the sanctuary and we ended up at Site 7 at the same time. Thror&#39;s Map was out, and I charged forward, ready to make the double to the last site but am blockaded by a literal host of thousands at Site 8. Again, my failure to draw Aragorn&#39;s Bow neutralised my ARV. I was forced to stop. He makes the double after realising I only had an Uruk Slayer in hand, and just to rub salt into wound, he refused to let his Merry get overwhelmed by it, pumping it vigorously, only taking 2 wounds.<br>
<br>
FL +1/+4<br>
<br>
Humbled. He played well, not much I could do. Not drawing Bow hurt me again.<br>
<br>
Game 3: vs Benjamen (no typo), Ranger-Elf archery/Nazgul<br>
<br>
Ben&#39;s the friend I tagged along with for the tournament. We started the game together, and he nearly quit after losing a very long unbroken string of games to me at the start. Has started defeating me lately though, with his unabashed copying of the Fellowship half my deck, except that he had more rares to put in.<br>
<br>
We know each other&#39;s styles and both bid 0. He wins the toss and chooses to go second, as usual. Forced to stop at Site 2 after an untimely Beauty is Fading discarded my only Gwemegil, leaving me shying away from the prospect of a naked Arwen at Ford of Bruinen. He too stops at 2, perhaps wanting to get the Ford into play.<br>
<br>
I survive the Ford, and draw Thror&#39;s Map there to get Pass of Caradhras out and keep Asfaloth around for one more turn (needed the horse with his Nazgul running around and Gwemegil in the discard). He doesn&#39;t play a minion at Site 4, wistfully suggesting to himself to put down &quot;that guy&quot; later. I look him in the eye and move to Site 5, where his face falls and he passes his shadow phase. When he later came to Site 5, I dropped down the only copies of Lurtz and Troop of Uruk-Hai in my deck, with a Sword on the Troop and a timely Spies of Saruman and Uruk-Hai Rampage to leave him hurting and behind.<br>
<br>
Eventually built up a 2-site lead, using Thror&#39;s Map to again plot the rest of the sites to be rivers and forests, but again, I failed to draw Aragorn&#39;s Bow, and the ARVs were again dead cards. I go along fine though, with Arwen&#39;s strength bonus against Nazgul keeping her in the game and Aragorn and Boromir getting almost their full kit out (except for the dratted Bow). Was fast enough to take a breath at Site 8 since he was still at the sanctuary, and on my next turn, moved to Site 9, Aragorn and Arwen more than adequate to dispose of the 2 fierce Nazul which came down.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+7<br>
<br>
Agreed before this game that the winner would share his spoils. Glad he sort of relaxed the agreement, as I wouldn&#39;t enjoy tearing up the prize I got later. Still haven&#39;t drawn the Bow.<br>
<br>
Game 4: vs (forgot) Ranger-Elf archery/Moria swarm<br>
<br>
Hmm...a wierd guy here, prone to sudden emotional outbursts and quirky actions, and some incoherent mumblings. I was thinking mental...hmm, never mind.<br>
<br>
Was a little suspicious. Did see him shuffling his deck but on my turn, he slaps down 3 Goblin Armouries, and they were all together in his hand. I double-move to Site 3, knowing from my experience with my Moria friend that he won&#39;t be able to launch a sustained, damaging attack before Site 4. Then on his turn, my eyes narrowed more as I saw him practically putting the full kit on Aragorn, Arwen and Boromir with his hand, and giving me 20+twilight. Played some minions to burn cards, and they promptly fell to archery and super-buff Aragorn, Arwen and Boromir (1st turn only...)<br>
<br>
Got swarmed at Site 5. Made a horrific mistake. I sneakily put down Rumil at the side of the table, hoping he wouldn&#39;t notice, but it backfired as *I* didn&#39;t see Rumil and Arwen promptly got Backstabbed (or to put in the words of my opponent, cloberd in the front and back simultaneously by 2 Goblins). With just 3 companions, I was easy target for another swarm on Site 8.<br>
<br>
FL +1/+8<br>
<br>
Hmm...was a little unconvinced with his terrific draw and my continued inability to draw Aragorn&#39;s Bow, plus I was kicking myself with my carelessness with Rumil. Got cheered up a little though as he was the only one the whole night who gave me a handshake and conceded (rather unconvincingly and encouragingly, one might add) that I was one minion away from killing him on Site 5 (Lurtz + Slayer + Spies).<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
Immediately after the game, the organiser came and gave me and (unnamed 4th opponent) each a booster pack for participating. He immediately ripped his open and found The Choice of Luthien. I opened mine slowly and took out...Legolas Greenleaf. Made the whole trip worthwhile! A rare to add to my pitiful collection, and my first Greenleaf at that. Someone else pulled a Cave Troll foil, that was all.<br>
<br>
The final was between Frankie (one of the shopkeepers and organisers) and Skizzik&#39;s friend whom I never found out the name of and who I believe was the last (and perhaps realistically, only) winner of the tournament. A very long, tense and close game, with (champion) at Site 7 and Frankie on Site 6, (champion) with 3 companions in the dead pile, 4 on the table. (champion) moves to Site 8, and Gandalf, Boromir and Merry are promptly killed like bowling pins with Under the Watching Eye/Bowmen/Direct Damage, and Frodo barely survives, using his Intuition and putting on Isildur&#39;s Bane to get himself weighed down with 8 burdens and 3 wounds. <- that turn took over 20 minutes. Frankie&#39;s turn, and he blasts open the Moria minions laid down easily, but passes, presumably with the hope of splicing &quot;Frodo Solo&quot; wide open. On (champion)&#39;s turn, however, he drew Tharin, Aragorn and Gimli (Moria&#39;s quick deck-search is awesome) and laid them down. After Under the Watching Eye/Bowmen, Enquea came out to kill Aragorn in the maneuver phase, but that was the only minion who came out. Tharin and Gimli sacrificed themselves to save Frodo from the fierce Nazgul.<br>
<br>
Props<br>
 - 2-2, which, figuratively, puts me as an okay player?<br>
 - Boromir uncommon for seriously making me contemplate leaving him in after that timely save on the first game. But, um, on afterthought...Son of Denethor, you suck, heave-ho.<br>
 - Did better than Benjamen, that lame copycat.<br>
 - PULLED GREENLEAF!<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
 - Lost against Moria. Inherent quality of small fellowships, and never managed to set up archery shop. Have to play more against those ugly little broods, they&#39;re very popular around here.<br>
<br>
 - Never drew Aragorn&#39;s Bow the whole day! Was the deciding factor that I lost the 2 Moria games. Perhaps Greenleaf can help, until I can get another Bow, sigh.<br>
<br>
 - Didn&#39;t see anybody playing Isengard, or anybody remarkable playing them for that matter. Humph.<br>
<br>
 - The number of Aragorn, Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Prancing Pony, Arwen, Legolas Greenleaf, Last Alliance, A Ranger&#39;s Versatility etc on everybody&#39;s tables. Everybody plays them, and I call them uncreative, them of which I am one too. Uh well, can&#39;t change a deck with my pitiful collection of cards, and my pitiful budget should take a blue moon to afford a booster box. In the meantime, I am happy to be called a lame, uncreative bastard by myself.<br>
<br>
 - Some idiot who Timed Out all four of his games, with 2 or 3 ending in Time-Wins (having the fortune to be just ahead in sites for very undeserved wins). He stalled, perhaps purposely. My new acquintance was unfortunate enough to face him.<br>
<br>
Idiot: Hey, I just passed by the sanctuary. Can I heal?<br>
Opponent: No, you can&#39;t, you didn&#39;t stop so you skipped your fellowship phase.<br>
Idiot: But why? I passed by the sanctuary!<br>
Opponent: You skipped your fellowship phase.<br>
Idiot: Huh? Where? When?<br>
Opponent: You double-moved, so you sped past the sanctuary.<br>
Idiot: JUDGE!<br>
5 minutes later...<br>
Judge: He&#39;s right, you can&#39;t do that.<br>
Idiot: Oh...then can I go back to the sanctuary and stop? I didn&#39;t know that.<br>
Opponent: (fumes)<br>
Idiot: The twilight...the site...and here are the cards you played. Have &#39;em back.<br>
Opponent: Zzzzzz<br>
Time elapsed: 15 minutes<br>
<br>
Idiot: I play Gimli.<br>
Opponent: You can&#39;t, he&#39;s already in your play area.<br>
Idiot: Why not?<br>
Opponent: He&#39;s unique.<br>
Idiot: So?<br>
Opponent: So you cannot have more than one copy of him in your play area!<br>
Idiot: That&#39;s absurd.<br>
Opponent: That&#39;s the rule.<br>
Idiot: In that case, can I replace the Gimli on the table with my Gimli?<br>
Opponent: No!<br>
Idiot: Why not? They&#39;re both the same. They have the same text and I&#39;ll only have one in my play area.<br>
Opponent: (grits teeth) You...can&#39;t...do...that.<br>
Idiot: Hey, you&#39;re wrong. They&#39;re not the same. This one&#39;s Son of Gloin and this one&#39;s Dwarf of Erebor. I can have both in my play area!<br>
Opponent: (no response)<br>
Idiot: JUDGE!<br>
5 minutes of explanation later...<br>
Idiot: Oh, so I can discard Gimli to heal Gimli? Okay, I&#39;ll do that. Hello? I&#39;m moving.<br>
Opponent: (wakes up) Huh?<br>
