<br>
Everything started 2 weeks ago. As an area Rider I was part of a coordination effort to get ALL of the New England Terratorials Coordinated so that they would not overlap. It came down to the fact that we would either have to run it on May 11th or on a Sunday somewhere in the middle. We decide that the 11th would be best. Now we needed to find a TD. I was willing and able to run, But I first wanted to find out if anybody else was willing and able. I got one! John Mullarkey a new Rider from Connecticut was the poor soul that opened his mouth.<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourney Stuff<br>
Prior to going to the first Terrtaorial this season, I&#39;ve decide that I would need to playtest heavily if I wanted to win. I had been Playing Mirror/Moria deck since Christmas. About a week before Mines came out I spoke to Hayes Hunter (HH) and he mentioned a deck taht had been going solid for him for several weeks. I asked him if his reason for doing so well was his deck, or lack of other good decks in teh area. Of course there was no simple answer to HH sent me his deck to playtets in the Connecticut Meta. It did VERY well. So well in fact that I decide after a few Meta Tweaks it would be machine for our area. So I started playing a variant, but still the same Core-Tech.<br>
<br>
So after playing this deck for so long, I had a choice to make. Either stick with Old-reliable (which everybody knew) or go with a new deck that was to be unexpected from me. I didn&#39;t want poeple to meta against me yet I wanted a deck I could be familiar with and be Tourney worthy. So Myself and Chris Brennan (A local Rider) each built several decks and playtested vs each other. It seemd that Uruks had a very Good Potential. I built taht deck and played it at several open-gaming nights. Chris finally convinces me that my deck has already proven itself to be worthy of the Rhode Island Terratorial. I made it so.<br>
<br>
5/11<br>
I wake up and get ready. I make a decklist, shower, and ponder going down to the lake for a bit of fishing. But I decide I would probably be late if I went. So I Didnt go. So I relax and get into pregame mood and I set out for a short 2 hour ride to providence. On the way I pick up John Mullarkey and we talk about cops and getting pulled over, as well as LotR tech on the ride up. We arrive in Providence at 11:30 and John tells me he doesnt have decklists for the tournamnet and I suggest a stop at Staples to make some copies. So we stop lunch at FKC/Pizza Hut and we make copies at staples. We get to the tourney and we start!<br>
<br>
I&#39;m running a Ranger/Moria Racing deck. I go into the tourney as a 1715 (approx).<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs Eric Hunter (1644) Uruks<br>
I walked into this game knowing absolutely nothing about what Eric has played in the past. So I had NO idea what to expect. I won the bid and chose to go first and started Green Dragon Inn With Arwen and Greenleaf. I started off by runningto site 3 on 1st Turn. I saw a couple of uruks show their faces. Nothing major. I burned an Orc Bane early to clear my hand of cards. His turn, he follows me to site 3. Nothing major except I was able to clear every minion card out of my hand including getting an early They Are Coming. Next Turn, I lost Arwen at Site 4 to a Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry. Ugh! So Now I find out he is playing Dirty Nasty Uruk Tech. I know I gotta be on the look-out. So I started stinging him almost every turn from here on out to see what he had. We raced to site 9. When we finally reached Site 9, All I had left in the fellowship was Aragorn (KIE), and Greenleaf,a long with Frodo. He popped 4 minions on me. Normally I would have been screwed, but I was lucky enough to Have 2 Vitality left on Aragorn and a Valiant Man of the West in hand. So I play Valiant, Aragorn is a power-10 with weilding a Flaming Brand and a Last Alliance. I stack him up against 2 Uruks taht total power = 17. He had NO ambitions on the table. Lego has to take Lurtz and Frodo take a Power-9 Uruk.  In My mind, I am telling myself &quot;DONT FORGET TO DO ARAGORNS BATTLE FIRST&quot; because if I lose Lego I am only a Power 9 and any uruk Pump would kill me. Now that I&#39;m pretty much sure i can Garuntee my win, I go through with the motions. 1st battle, Lego vs Lurtz. I Lose, Lego dies. totally Expected. 2nd battel Frodo vs Uruk. Frodo take 2 Wounds. Totally Expected. next Aragorns Battle, he PLays a Pump. he is power 19 to my 10. I&#39;m not overwhelmed... Or at least I thoghT I wasn&#39;t. gosh darnitit I fogot to Have Aragorn Play first. Now I&#39;m Dead. Fierce Lurtz Kills Frodo. Thats Game. we Shake hands and I say &quot;I&#39;ll see you in the Final Confrontation.&quot;<br>
<br>
Highs: Playing a fun/solid game even after losing Arwen at site-4.<br>
Lows:  Legolas before Aragorn! Grrrrr!<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs Kerry Simeon (1516) Nazgul<br>
Before the tourney Kerry and I talked about what we planed on playing and she mentoined taht her deck was a Mix of everything but mostly Nazgul.ANzgul has always been my toughest Challenge. I rely on the fact that Nazgul have Poor Throuput and that I dont have to double move Every turn. But I figured 1st Turn couldnt be TOO bad. So Double moved to 3 and Faced 2 Nazgul and I lost Sam and Lego. And since I had such a Poor start, I had Nothing in my hand to help me. Luckily on her Turn I drew into Aragorn.She only moved 1 site. I moved to 4 and stopped. She double moved past the sanctuary and into site 4 where My moria destroyed her and Killed Frodo. 2 Flankers, 2 Moria Scouts a Runner, and The Keyward. Thats Game Frodo dies.<br>
<br>
Highs: She traded me a Foil Greenleaf after the game.<br>
Lows:  Losing two Companionsat site 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Fred Coughlin (1500) Uruks<br>
Fred was a pretty cool guy that was a Providence local. He&#39;s explaining to me how he and his college roomate share cards and build decks out of one common collection. He mentioend that most of the cards were his roomates, but share em all as equal. I thought this was pretty cool. We spent spent most of the game BS&#39;ing about everything. We had a nice relaxing game. Nothing eventful happned in the game. We both Raced to Site 9. I made it forst since I bid to go first with Green Dragon Inn. It was an easy walk to site 9. he nly had 1 minion for me.<br>
<br>
Highs: Nice relaxing game and meeting a cool new person.<br>
Lows:  The $0.75 can of soda I bought. God gosh darnit inflation sucks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Notes: Chris Johnson is now 3-0 and so is Jason Liu. they have to face each other Next Round. Eric and I are both 2-1. We&#39;ll see whats to come.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs Charlie Hoffman (1564) & his 100 card Moria Deck<br>
Let me star by saying that Charlie is a Connecticut local that I always play. I have seen his 100 card deck and was afraid of it cause I lost to it and even saw it win that tourney. So needless to say I thought that this game was going to be difficult. I dont knwo what happened, but his deck came together liek any other 100 card deck would... Not very well. He couldn&#39;t get anything going and I killed Frodo at site 5 (I think). Sorry Charlie.<br>
<br>
Highs: Quick-Swift kill.<br>
Lows:  Having to play an area local in an Out-of-Town event.<br>
<br>
<br>
Chris beat Jason in the match but it was a Timed Win. THIS was the break I was looking for. But Now I have to play Chris. i was NOT looking forward to this game. Chris Had destroyed me in a tournament 2-weeks earlier amnd I think he knew my deck inside and out. I tried to keep a secret from him what I was playing. He started off Cautiously.<br>
<br>
Game 5 vs Chris Johnson (1790) Moria/Ranger race (Anti-Uruk)<br>
Here we go! I gotta be on top of my game for this one. I know I can beat Him. Iw ent into the game with a lot of positive thinking. All I know is that I got ROMPED on the whole game. He ended up passing me in the race after I bid to go first again. I get an AWESOME starting hand. Aragorn, Flaming brand, Sting, and Gwemgil. Aww Yeah! Awesome Start. I am almost positive chris is playing Moria so I sting and walk to site 3 no problem. He follwos the same. I double move to site 5. I see Balrog & troll at site 5. But I am lucky enough to make Aragorna  Valiant Man, And I toss Sam and Gandalf away to be eaten. Next I stop at Site 6 and he passes me on the left into site 7. NextTurn he is able to stop me at site 7 I just have too many minions left on the table to double move and survive. He doubles to 8 and I can ONLY get 3 minions out Even with THey Are coming out. I had a Terrible Minion game. I couldnt pull Any! He uses the map to play his OWN site 9 whcih is draw a card for each burden, Which he has none. So That ws not helpful. But When I redrew 8 cards. I pulled 8 Shadows Cards. He had 7 companions out ad I was Lucky enough to draw Nertea and Enquea. Needless to say I pulled this game out of my arse, with a CAve troll, Some flankers, Keyward, Enquea killed Sam and Gandalf. his directed Archery killed off the 2 Nazguls (Good Choice since I had 3 Armories out). Frodo was overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
Highs: Tense Game that kept me on my toes against a great Player! I love that feeling.<br>
Lows: This game gave me a headache.<br>
<br>
<br>
Phew! I was glad that game was over. My Blood Pressure was soaring. Me, Eric Hunter, and Chris Johnson are all 4-1, but Chris has a timed Win. So If I win my next game I am garunteed in the Final Confrontation. Next Please!<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 6 vs Jason Liu (1745) Moria/Elven deck with Goblin Spear Tech<br>
I had previously played Jason twice at double header tournamnet 2 weeks ago. I lost BOTH games to him. Needles to say I am once again nervous. Again I bid for the win and I go first. I pull Sam and play Aragorn from Hand with Ranger Sword. and I walk to site 3. No problems. He follows. Nothing Great happens. I move to site 4 and I face 1 Minion, and I dont have sting yet, so I cant See what he has in his hand. I take a Chance and Double move into site 5.  He says &quot;Free Ride&quot; and pitches Balrog out of his hand. He had NO minions in his hand except Balrog and Cave TRoll. good thing I killed that Scavenger at site 4. He moves to site 4 and he concedes by Feeding Frodo and Sam to the Cave Troll. Game-Over. Apparently he was too frustrated and was too tired from the long day.<br>
<br>
Highs: I&#39;m *IN* the final confrontation.<br>
Lows:  I didn&#39;t like the idea that I got a free ride into the Finals.<br>
<br>
<br>
Eric and Chris both win their Final Games, but since one of Chris&#39;s Wins was timed, Me and Eric Qualify for the Final Confrontation.<br>
<br>
What a coincidence. Round-1 After Eric Beats me I tell him I will see him in the Final Round. I needed to take a break cause I was getting so stressed out/Nervous. Apparently the uneasy feeling i had was that fact that I had to take a leak for the last 3 rounds but just didnt. I leaked and felt 100x better. Now Im ready!<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 7 [FINAL CONFRONTATION] vs Eric Hunter (1645) Nasty Uruks<br>
Okay, I convinced myself that I beat Eric Game 1. I needed the self confidence that I could do it again. This really helped me. I know that Eric was going to try and outbid me for the start and I went extra High to assure that I would go first. So I bid an extra 2. I win! I was 1 burden ahead of him. Phew. Green dragon Inn, My Savior! This is almost an identical repeat to round-1, Except Arwen survived to the End. I made some several Key mistakes in this game. Eric tried to double move past me at site 8 and I was able to get 5 orcs out at the Shores, but i forgot to say &quot;I spot 5 Orcs, Move Limit -1.&quot; Eric Asks me twice, Is it maneuver Phase and I assure him yes. As soon as I say Yes, I say &quot;WAIT!&quot; But its too late. Oh-well I have to live with my mistakes. So He lives and he has NO minions in his hand and I still have 2 minions left on the table. he has to make a decision whether to double move or not. he decides that He wont be able to kill me so he Has to move. I pull my site-9 EmynMuil (Exert to make Fierce), And Iplay a boat load of High Vitality Minions, but AGAIN! I forget about the site text and I forget to make evrybody fierce. But I think it was for the better, It kept everybody alive from archery. I overwhelm Frodo with 2 Moria Scouts and a Scimitar. Game-Over. DAY-OVER.<br>
<br>
Phew. Dcon2k2 Day-2 Here I come...<br>
<br>
Highs: Another AWESOME game with Eric. I love thos types of games when its real close down the last drop!<br>
Lows:  My Stupidity and forgetfulness. Oh-Well, Stuff Happens.<br>
<br>
<br>
