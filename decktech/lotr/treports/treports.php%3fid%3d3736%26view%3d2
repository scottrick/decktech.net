	Prologue:  As some may know in the Colorado Gaming world I used to be a prolific Wars player, playing all over Colorado when I could.  My last Rings tournament was on March 16, 2002.  Its been a mighty long time!  I was a little dissatisfied with the current Meta, and there was erratas coming down like every day, so I took a break from the Tournament life.  Well with RotEL just around the corner its time to rumble again as Team Grand Slam and me prepared to make our return to Parker Colorado.  We saw that there was going to be regular Tuesday night tournaments down at Collectormania so we prepared to play.  We playtested Decktech/Gamplayers decks for four days straight trying to figure out what is popular and we need to beat.  I played several different decks, such as the Steven Lewis Pile, a Shoulder to Shoulder Lorien Deck, and the King and Wizard deck.  Of course the Pile proved to me the most consistent winner.  <br>
	My friends however played their standby strategies with some Meta in them.  Sean Gilfoyle put together his Hobbit.com Nazgul Deck.  Tim The Hair Kefalis revised his Rangers/Moria deck, and my brother Kevin put his deck together 20 minutes before we left, which was Hobbit/Uruk-hai- Worry.  After four days of playtesting we felt that we were prepared for our Grand return to Lord of the Rings!<br>
<br>
	We roll into the Mania at about 5:30pm.  I see some familiar faces John Arendt, Bryce Stevenson, and Scott Gaeta.  John and me chat a little, I pester him about Two Towers play testing, which gets nowhere, but I have to try.  We chat a little about the current Meta, and it sounds as though we are well prepared for todays 5 games.  After some chatting Team Grand Slam gets set up and we occupy the last two tables.  We get started at 6pm with about 19 peeps.<br>

Shaun is a local and we start off by chatting a little, he asks if there is any good players up in the Ft. Collins area and I say something like Sort of, I guess.  We bid some burdens, and I bid 5, and so does he . . . ack!  So we roll a die, which I lose and Shaun gets to go first.  He Starts the Green Dragon Inn so Im happy.  He grabs Samwise and lays down so other Tom Foolery in the form of Aragorn and moves.  There is like 15 in the pool and I look in my hand and notice that there are no minions there, which sucked cause Shaun was able to move again without opposition.  I guess my deck is used to going first cause it drew fellowship instead of minions.  On my turn I play Sam, remove burdens and I have to move.  I drew a lot of fellowship but no Fellowship members.  He plays some Uruk-Hais and Legolas kills them, and I have to stop.  Its okay because he moved to my site 3 which was the Rivendale Valley, aka if I get in a real bind I can triple move!  So I draw up and I get like 3 minions, which is cool cause hes going to move to Hollin.  He plays Gandalf I believe, putting him in Savagery Range and he moves to Hollin, puts in some good Shadow.  I play a Troop, Lieutenant and a Fighter.  He shoots to kill fighter and takes four wounds from Troop and Lieutenant, and he stops cause he didnt want to move to the Bridge with that horror.  I reconcile and draw Aragorn, and then I play Aragorn, and I play Last Alliance, Sword, and Flaming Brand.  I play Orophin also, which brings Aragorn up to a total of 14 power!  Then I move to three, which is uneventful, and I hold up.  I feel confident that I can triple move with super Aragorn, so all I have to do is hold Shaun at the bridge.  On his turn he moves to the bridge, giving up about 12 shadow.  Not much but enough.  We see an instant replay of last round, Troop, Lieutenant, and Warrior.  He doesnt have the archery this time, so hes like, not good.  I actually get a savagery in my hand and am able to do some terrible things to Shaun like kill Arwen and Legolas.  Not bad if you asks me.  Well he looks at the board and says I cant move to Six so it is now my turn.  I get to Play Gandalf on my turn, which is happiness, and with Orophin and Legolas at full life, Im sitting pretty.  I also play Albert Dreary before I move to get some Ambition control.  I move to Hollin giving up like 15 or so and he was only able to play two guys.  I manhandle with Gorn and Gandalf easily and I decide to move.  I move to the Bridge and all I hear are crickets chirping.  Not good for Shaun.  I use my +1 move limit to move to site 6 without opposition and I am a happy player.  Shaun moves to Six, I give him a minion or two to play with just to make sure he stops at 6, and like a smart person he does.  On my turn, I get silly and drop Gimli and Aragorns Bow, and Armor and move to the no Archery Site.  Fortunately for me Gandalf is an 11 and Aragorn is a 14.  I easily deal with his minions at sites 7 and 8.  Shaun at site six sees the writing on the wall, he needs minion cards to beat me, he play a bunch of fellowship and moves to 7, I give him like three minions and a headache.  He has to stop.  I draw and I get Thrarin and 3 Servants.  I move to nine, and Shaun can only play ONE minion, talk about a bad draw.  Well, in hopes I didnt have to kill off any fellowship on site nine, Thrarin steps up.  Its 4 to 8, and I decide to play servant of the secret fire on his Uruk Fighter.  Then I play another Servant, and then another, I guess Thrarin was overwhelming the Uruk Fighter.  Shaun, not to be outdone by my three fires played 2 Savagerys and manhandled Thrarin 7-4 ; )  Gandalf cancelled the Fierce Round.  <br>
<br>
Full Win +3<br>
<br>
3<br>
Highs: Any time I triple move it is good times for all!  The Golden Pile triumphant!<br>
Lows: Lost the Bid, and I Drew NO Minions against a 15 pool, BAD DECK!<br>
<br>
	Well for those of you reading this Parker Report may be asking why didnt I mention William Dieneiga yet?  Well thats because he was late.  He came in with the late Bye round, and guess who I got to play in the second round, oh yeah baby!<br>
<br>
Game 2: William Dieniega (1978) Rangers & Uruk-Hai<br>
I have never beaten William in one on one, mainly because I am still a scrub at this game and dont know how to beat William.  But I have player almost every time I go to Denver, so why should this be any different?  I bid five, and I get to go first.  I draw my hand and it is NOT bootylicious as it should be, of course.  I grab Samwise and move some burdens, and play Boromir with Flaming Brand and move.  He plays some Uruks and I know Im screwed cause I have a fellowship of five, so hes got me easy I think to my self.  But the guys he plays Im able to clear with Orophin and Legolas, and I move to the Sanctuary.  I get there and he plays one guy who I take some wounds from.  I was rather happy with my turn cause I got to double move with a bad draw.  Anyways, William drops like Aragorn, Boromir, Sam and a bunch of gear down on the table (Armors and Swords) and he moves to two.  I play three Uruks.  One he kills with Legolas the other two he chump blocks with Sam and Arwen, and they both die, keeping his Fellowship number under 5 is always a smart thing to do eh?  He moves to three I give him an Uruk to kill and he is done.  So William has one tough fellowship at the moment, and I know the way his Ranger Fellowship draws against me.  I go, I get Gandalf and move to his four, he plays some guys and I fend them off accordingly.  However I hold up for the Double move to Six, as planned.  William goes and he heals up like a mad man.  I play 3 Uruks for the nine that he gave me, and kills one with Legolas and takes the other two with Armored up Boromir and Aragorn.  He kills one of them and I reconcile and draw some fellowship cards, he decides to move onto 5 and I just didnt have the cards to make him pay.  He handles the Uruks easy, and he ha to hold up.  My Turn I play Merry and move to 5.  On the Bridge I get some resistance, but Legolas is still good to go, so he pulls the trigger and I am able to deal.  I move and I get nothing at the sanctuary, so in essence I am ahead of William, good deal.  William moves to the sanctuary, where he has 6 wounds, so Im pretty confident that he HAS to hold up if hes going to survive.  Well here comes why William is a better play than I.  I am only able to play like one guy for him at site six, he easily kills him off.  I reconcile and Get Lurtz and another Chump.  William decides to forgo the Sanctuary, well thats not cool.  He has his bow on Aragorn, but Aragorn isnt looking great, however I play Lurtz and the Chump, and he just plays ARV and shoots them up, and melees the last one with Aragorn.  Now the big question here is why didnt I have the Anduin Wilderland as my site 7 to deal with ARV?  Cause I am a fool, and am still learning Meta, I though the Confluence would still be solid for Ally removal since Isengard has so little of that.  Well my inability to stop him at six, and my misplay for not making him par for the double move at 7 literally lost me the game.  On my next turn I drop down Gimli and Aragorn, and Glamdring, look at Williams hand and I see 3 PATHS, so even if I get an awesome minion draw hes just going to PATH them away . . . I dont run Snow in this deck.  So William is able to pull of the Win due to some Tom foolery.  I move to seven, he cant do a thing about my fellowship.  And I stop at 7 knowing that I couldnt win (I could have also used Gift of Boats if it was in my deck) and I let him go, hoping I could work him over on site 8 and nine.  Well I come too weak at both sites, and he doesnt even have to defend with Frodo and I lose to his Fellowship!<br>
<br>
Full Loss +1<br>
<br>
4<br>
Highs: None really, I lost a game that looked clear to me as a victory.<br>
Lows: Classic 5-7 double move really gets me miffed.  I should have been able to make him pay for that, oh well, excellent game William maybe next time!<br>
<br>
I am 1-1 that means its time to play a pseudo-scrub baby!<br>
<br>
	Game 3: Jet Peterson (1617) Dwarves & Moria<br>
Jet is hilarious.  He wears a Gilligans Island fishing hat so you cant EVER take him seriously, which is probably what makes him a great scrub.  In fact, the fact that he plays Dwarves makes him an even better scrub.  The problem is he has beaten me before, and I have beaten him with a close, close victory before.  So who is the scrub?  Well we start I bid 5 and go first, I get Samwise and Aragorn with sword and bow, and Last alliance and move.  He brings a lot of jank to site two, since Moria is jank.  I move to three and he plays that 11 power 3 wound guy that puts three into the pool if I double move.  Classic Jet.  HE goes, he plays Thrarin and some other Dwarves who are terrible and he moves.  I get 6 in the pool I believe and play my lone Tower Assassin and kill poor Thrarin.  Jet bows down to the power of my 11 power Orc and holds up.  On my turn I play some Fellowship guys (I didnt keep notes on my plays here) and I move, I think he plays a Cave Troll, which he said he was happy about cause its the first one he ever owned.  I step up Sam and Arwen, they both die and I hold up.  He moves to site 3 and I play an Uruk-Hai who he kills with like two bonus cards . . . sigh Dwarves.  I go, and I move to the Bridge, Im sure I played some stuff, and he plays a Scavenger and Balrog, Flame of Udun.  Well darn, I thought!  I didnt want my guys to get killed do I spotted 5 exertions on my Archers and killed the Balrog and moved to 6.  Then Jet played Ulaire Enquea and didnt use his maneuver ability to kill any of my guys, I though I had a fellowship of 6, maybe it was 5.  I am forced to eat some more wounds and I hold up at six.  Jet moves to four, he play his 5th Fellowship member and moves to site four.  I get to play 2 Uruks and I have two savageries in my hand.  He uses a Defender plus one card for his Dwarven guard so I have to use both of my Savagerys on the guard.  I manhandle him and then give Gimli and Frorn some beatings as they both die.  So I heal, play Boromir, and Thrarin, and Rumil and move to 7-8.  Jet cant really play anything so I know site nine will be interesting.  He moves to the Bridge, he plays another Dwarven guard, and I play like three guys, he plays the defender +1 thing on the guard and I dont get to manhandle him on the bridge, so my fellowship is going to have to pull through for me.  Well I go, I have a Fellowship or 5 and I decide to play Armor and Elrond for some reason, and THEN I dont Sting Jet to remove the 5.  I move to Jets site nine, and he gets to draw 4 cards for the summit.  So this could be bad, this deck doesnt run PATHS as all, although I had an unwounded Aragorn.  Well Jet gets into the Moria Chain (without a stack or armor) and gets out Ten minions on my.  Ten is a lot for five to handle.  So I maneuver to make Aragorn Defender +3, Step up Thrarin, and shoot one goblin.  Aragorn takes 4, Gandalf 1, Legolas 1, Boromir 1, Thrarin 1, and Frodo takes on two runners.  Jet thankfully does not have a stupid Moria bonus card and I win the Game YAY!<br>
<br>
Full Win +3<br>
<br>
7<br>
Highs: I got to play against Gilligans Island Hat Kid!<br>
Lows: Seriously I almost lost because I didnt Sting for some reason.  Im sure the 7 Shadow was huge cause he didnt have a lot of shadow In the first place, instead or 13 shadow I gave him like 20, I am such a scrub!<br>
<br>
Well after that fiasco I am 2-1, and my Brother and Sean are both undefeated.  Tim is 2-1.  So I have a feeling I might get matched up with a member of Team Grand Slam.  And I do!<br>
<br>
	Game 4: Kevin Keen (1560) Hobbits & Uruk-Hai<br>
Sweet, I get to play my brother.  I havent played against this deck hes using because he threw it together before we came down.  So we bid burdens, I bid 3 and he bids 6.  He goes first and starts the East Road.  Sigh.  Well Kev plays his regular silly Hobbit Junk and moves and I get to play an Uruk-Hai and not do anything to him . . . yay.  On my turn I play Sting and look at Kev&#39;s hand.  I notice he has an Uruk Scout and No Savagerys.  So I say thats interesting and play Aragorn and Gandalf both for 6 because of the East Road and move to two.  He plays his Scout, Uruk Rampage, and a Worry.  I kill the scout and move to site 3.  At 3 I move he plays a guy and I block with Arwen to get her killed so I dont have to worry about Savagery.  His next turn he moves to three and I pass cause he only put four in the pool, aka I can play Jank.  On my next turn I decide I need to play small fellowship, and play it conservative, or else hes going to win a ton of skirmished and Ill be forced to burden Frodo up a ton.  However, I am lucky in getting Aragorn with Sword, Brand, and the Last Alliance to be able to win some skirmishes my self.  I move to Hollin and he plays a couple guys.  I am able to play an Uruk or two and I hold up, look for the move from 4-6.  Kev goes and as usual I cant do a thing, I play an Uruk or two to make him play some stealth cards, and he holds up there.  On my turn I draw some Servants of the secret fire so Ill be able to win more battles this way.  I move to the bridge and Kev gives me three guys to deal with, which is bad.  Win and lose some skirmishes, and I am forced to hold up, which should be okay cause Ill be able to outrun Kev in the long run.  Kev moves and more of the same happens, I just try to draw Gandalfs and Aragorns for later heals.  On my turn I am able to heal Gandalf, which in turn means I can heal Frodo of some of those Worry wounds.  I move into Galadriels Glade and I get a Minion that I can kill.  The heals for next turn are looking good.  Kev Rolls into six, I give him a minion that kills either Pippin of Merry, I forget which.  My turn comes and I heal Legolas Twice, Gandalf Twice, and Frodo once.  I discard two Aragorns to Heal Aragorn, so all I have is 2 wounds of Frodo, and I was still at three burdens.  I move to 7, Kevin gives me two Troops of Uruk-Hai who Aragorn and Gandalf take wounds from.  Then I move to site 8, I ARV the two Troops, and all I have to deal with is a guy that Aragorn can kill.  On Kevs turn he decides that he may need to double move to catch up with me to force a timed victory.  He removes some burdens and moves to 7.  I play three guys and with my Sarumans ambitions on the Table I am able to kill Merry and Keep Kevin from double moving.  On my Turn I drop Merry and Gimli, and Thrarin and move into Nine, Kev didnt have enough minions to challenge me on site Nine and I win.  <br>
<br>
Full Win +3<br>
<br>
10<br>
Highs:  I think I managed Kevins strategy real well with this deck; it was also a fun game because I had to manage what I was doing, instead of dropping my fellowship and moving every turn.  It was a perfect success.<br>
Lows: Well beating my brother and taking him down from undefeated kind of sucked, I should have just let him win, and put him in pole position for first place.  It probably wasnt the good Team thing to do, but it was the right thing to play him to my fullest ability.  It turns out that it didnt mean anything anyway.<br>
<br>
Well Sean Gilfoyle played William and Sean actually beat William for the first time ever.  Sean has played William just as many times as I have.  So Sean was in first place and Kev, me, and Tim were all 3-1.  <br>
<br>
	Game 5 Sean Gilfoyle (1720) Hobbit.com & Power Nazgul<br>
Hobbit.com is a store joke.  Seans fellowship deck plays starting hobbits and a fellowship of nine.  Since every deck I saw online that we play tested at the shop had big fellowship we called them .com decks.  So Kev, Sean, and Tim called my deck Jason.com and I called Seans deck Hobbit.com Id rather call mine the Golden Pile anyways.  Well anyways me and Sean set up and I bid four burdens and he bids 8 burdens, he really wanted to go first against me to make sure he won.  So I draw my hand and there are EIGHT minion cards in it . . . thats interesting I say.  Sean says something like, Jason your going to kill me, and I inform Sean that this is going to be a quick game either way we look at it.  He plays nothing and moves, I look at my hand of minions and I decide that Lurtz 1 and Lurtz 2 are too expensive to play, and I notice that Ulaire Enquea is also too expensive, so I play a Uruk Warrior which Sean stealths.  My turn is just as good as his, I play noting cause everything is minion and he plays noting cause I didnt give him enough.  He moves to site three and I play nothing but an Ambition.  I draw a Merry and play him cause I want out of this game pretty much.  Sean plays Toldea and I bid 4 at the beginning for some reason; P So I lose Legolas and Merry, and I decide to double move cause this just isnt worth my time. Sean beats me Handily.<br>
<br>
Full Loss +1<br>
<br>
11<br>
Highs: Ummmmm, Sean is 5-0?<br>
Lows: EIGHT MINON CARDS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br>
<br>
<br>
Well Sean beat me so hes 5-0.  Kevin beat William so he is 4-1.  So Sean gets first and Kevin gets Second.  Tim and me were both 3-2.  We finished with the same record as William.  I didnt get all of the info but Im going to venture to guess that I was at least 3rd or 4th place because of schedule difficulty, and I actually beat Kevin.  So Team Grand Slam (15-5) wrecked shop that day since Im sure all four of us were in the top out of the 19 players there.  Not bad I think considering none of us had played in a tournament duel since 3/16/02 . . . longer for some of us.  After Sean and me played I bought Lord of the Rings the board game for more Tolkien Tom Foolery.  On the way home we got lost in the dark and took a detour past Castle Rock and ate at Perkins . . . Team Grand Slam victorious!  I cant wait till next Tuesday to do better.<br>
