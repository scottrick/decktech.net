Southern California regional:<br>
<br>
	Pre tournament material: (must know)<br>
<br>
I had no interest going to a lotrs tournament. I just started collecting cards and learning how to play this new game. For many years I played star wars. But due to lose of contract and lack of wars I decided to try this new game. I contact my old crew john patchell and cat. They said there is a tournament this Saturday at Tustin. They did not mention it was a regional open. Hmmm forgot I guess. So I went out to the frank and sons bough a case of moria and few boxes of starter decks of fellowship. But did not know how to built a deck so I just left them at home. I contact Lisa who I met at the DPC Vegas last week. I told her I needed good simple deck to play. I made embassies having a good beginners deck. Nothing too fancy but unfortunately it was not to be. I met Lisa at the Pasadena Friday night so she can show me how to run the deck. I played few games won all of them. I mean I kick the crap out of the people I played. SO I felt good. Right before we decided to leave some guy (can not mention his name here) decided to change it. Make it more professional and game worthy. Well he did. He took 20 cards out and replaced them with cards that I have no idea how to play. It was like, handing a new bee WYS with 30 interrupts. It was the same feeling. I had no idea about this new deck. It looks cool, no characters and events. As soon as this new deck gets built, john, Dan, mike Mendoza shows up. They get a pick up game while this guy going through the deck and explain it to me.  Of course, it came through one ear and went out of the other. As soon as this guy finished explain the mechanics to me john-said let&#8217;s go to my place to drink and play some lotrs. I said it was cool. So, we piled in my car and went to john&#8217;s famous apartment. On the way to the johns, Lisa and me pick up some beer, and Smirnoff (Vodka).  We bought the Smirnoff for our usage and the beer for the crew. At least that&#8217;s what we thought. We got there. John was playing some guy lotrs. Mike was playing Dan. We put the beer on the refrigerator and hide the vodka. Well, at least we tried to high vodka. Mike and john went through the vodka in one hour. Those bastards&#8230;Well around 4 o&#8217;clock john decided to sleep. Dan and frank passed out too. Lisa went home to sleep. Mike and me decided to watch TV and talk about the glory days. Mike and me drank some more beer and about 6:00 we fell a sleep. No more than 38 minutes Dan the man gets up. He starts wondering the apartment. Wakes mike and me up so he does not have to be alone. I yell at him to stop few times but to no avail.  John wakes up and starts wondering as well. By now, mike and me are up. Mike starts cooking. I make coffee. I mean lots of coffee. We gather our stuff and leave for the tournament.<br>
<br>
We get to the tournament.  I grab Lisa Vegas deck, which did well there.  I see most of the greatest war players in the area.  It was good seen them and talking to them. I see my good friend cat. We bullshimmer for a while they call pairing. It started around 12:45. <br>
<br>
The tournament:<br>
<br>
Game one<br>
Some guy with a moria swarm deck versus my moria swarm deck.<br>
<br>
I bid 2 and he bids 3 and starts. He pulls Sam to heal burden and uses archers on every guy almost. He gets Frodo, Sam and boromir with merry unchallenged. I do the same thing. He moves to the site four and I unload on him. I had 4 runners and 2 scangers. I am looking for a weapon in the lost pile nothing there. It is empty just great. I kill Sam and merry. Just shear power. He looks at me and says. I am done with Sam. Which he had nothing on the ring bearer. He stays. I put down the elf and move to site 4 and this time he unloads with 3 scangers and a troll. He destroyed my merry like a took. And almost kills boromir but armor was cool.<br>
I stay. He moves to balrogs home and he path away from the big guy and gets to the sanctuary. Just fabulous. That was the high light of the game. He made the site nine before I did. Dam so close. I was at site 8 because of a troll with an axe. Dam that fierce crap.<br>
<br>
Full Lost<br>
<br>
Prompts: to him for running to site 9<br>
Slops: none.<br>
<br>
Game two:<br>
Some guy who lost first turn looking for blood.<br>
He starts with Frodo and gandalf I bid 4 and play my site. I pull boromir and make a run to the site 4. He starts and pulls boromir and only moves to site 2 and stays. I look at him and say. Wow I might have a chance. He giggles and says go. I move to site four and he unloads. Three archers and one cave troll. Not good. Destroys everyone accept Frodo and boromir. Boromir still in the game. I decided to move to site 5 right there. I knew my fellowship was low so why not. He looks at me and says u sure. Yes. He gets 8 and that is it. He has to pull barlog. No choice. Deploys the big fellow. Later I find out he had three trolls. Boromier takes him on for life; His armor takes care of the damage +1 and gets killed. So Frodo made the site 5 and he is alone. Not good. He deploys few dwarfs and starts moving. I do not oppose him. I am looking a fellowship member. I am not interested in battling. He only moves one site which kind not good. I activate and put down the 4 allies for site 6 and move to site 6. He deploys more archers and kills the allies. Each one. Frodo dies horribly&#8230;<br>
<br>
Full lost<br>
Prompts: to me for running like a champ just kidding. <br>
Slops: not getting any fellowship characters in hand.<br>
<br>
Game three:<br>
<br>
Some archer deck<br>
This is time out and I lost by one burden. The one that I bid. No big battles or anything. <br>
<br>
Time lost<br>
Prompts to the Sam<br>
Slops. To me for bidding one<br>
<br>
<br>
Game four: <br>
<br>
Dwarves deck <br>
By now I am leading the loser brackets. I am dead last but I am hopefully to make the finales. Just kidding just to win one. Lisa and cat keep pumping me up for a win. <br>
<br>
He starts with 3 burdens and I bid 0. I am scared to bid anything over 0.<br>
There are no battles. He keeps deploying one guy who is fierce and damages +1. I get to site 4 and he is done. He shacked my hand tells me good luck. <br>
<br>
Full lost<br>
Prompts to the fierce animals<br>
Slops: to me for not taking more risks. Now I think about it I should of run to the site 9. Live and learn I guess<br>
<br>
Game five:<br>
Now I am hungry and tired. But I am still in the hunt for the first victory. John is 4-0 and cat is 3-1. Everyone thinks john might go all the way. Of course we know better. Every time we put our hopes on john he chokes. Yes you do choke john. <br>
<br>
This game I am with small kids now. Who have no idea how to play this game either. <br>
Moria swarm with my swarm.<br>
He bids 5 and I bid 1. He starts with the dragon inn. Pulls Sam and moves. I got a bomb hand. Got goblins and runners. Runners are great way for me to generate pool. I do nothing. So he thinks he can move again. He does. I unload on him like a stepchild. Runners go down, with weapons and a troll. Its over I over power Frodo at site 3 before I even move. Wow I am good. Kid looks at me and says cool I can come dead last. I look at him and say I do not think so. <br>
<br>
Full win. <br>
Prompts: to the cards in my hand. It was a gods hand. <br>
Slops: to him for challenging me for the last place. <br>
<br>
Game six:<br>
Full lost. It was over before it started. He was playing archers and big fellowship. He walked over me with and killed me on site 6. I do not know why he was 2-3. It looks good.<br>
<br>
Prompts: to him for being nice. <br>
Slops: none<br>
<br>
Game seven<br>
All good things must end. Thank god it was over.<br>
Legos legacy what he called his deck. I called it archers from hell.<br>
<br>
He used archers and killed my guys one by one. He made site nine and left the game. That is it. Nothing can be said.<br>
<br>
Full lost<br>
<br>
Prompts: to him for playing fast<br>
Slops: none<br>
<br>
