Oh yeah, and work and my girlfriend and life and all that other stuff that happens in between playing LOTR.  At any rate, I hope that you find this report worth the wait.  When TTT released, I bought a Deluxe Starter and got familiar with the rules.  I had 6 boxes of boosters coming to me in the mail, so I didn&#8217;t get too carried away.  I was hoping I would get these cards before the first TTT tournament event, a sealed deck up at Collectormania in Parker.  However, that is not how the cards played out.  The cards did come on Friday night before the tournament, and Mike brought them over on the morning of the event.  We cracked open one of my boxes and checked out some of the rares.  We noticed the burden potential of Easterlings right away, and discussed how they could work in combination with Uruk-hai and Worry, or Nazgul.  Then it was time to go, so we bought a fresh pack of smokes, some gas and headed up to Parker.  Many of the Southern Colorado players were there, including Brian Montez, Danny Hummel, and Thomas Harris.  Conspicuously absent were Kyle Craft and William Diniega, who apparently had some serious partying to do in Boulder.  This would make things a little easier, but Thomas McGee was there to make things a tookallenging.  Also in attendance was Chris Fanchi, a long time Star Wars CCG player, one of the best in Colorado, who has recently seen the light and converted to the true faith of LOTR, hallelujah, amen.  All total there were 24 players in attendance, all ready to play their first sanctioned LOTR event.  Scott Gaeta, the store owner and TD, realized early the lopsided advantage the Aragorn deck had over the Theoden deck, so after he randomly assigned Starter decks, we booster drafted the remaining three booster packs we got at the start of the day.  I was lucky enough to get the Aragorn starter, with Dunland minions.  The draft also went well for me, pulling Saruman Rabble Rouser, Aragorn, Heir to Elendil ( Defender +1 )  and a few really good Uruk-Hai to take advantage of the Site Path inn the Theoden deck.  We spent a few minutes building our decks and then we were ready to play some LOTR.  <br />
<br />
GAME ONE <br />
<br />
vs.  Mike &#8220; Stone Trolls &#8220; Armistead  ( Theoden Deck ) <br />
<br />
Great, we drive all the way up here to play each other in the first game.  He had mentioned to me earlier that he had drafted an Easterling Captain, but for some reason, when it came to opening bids, this thought slipped my mind.  I bid six burdens and decide to go first, so I could play Aragorn Heir to Elendil after exerting Gimli and Legoals.  I also played Aragorn&#8217;s Sword on him, which ended up saving my butt.  Mike gets out the Easterling Captain at Site 2 and proceeds to remove Twilight to boost him to 20 Strength.  Aragorn takes him on twice, barely surviving the fight.  I stop.  When Mike moves to Site 2 with Eomer and Theoden, he is faced with a Dunlending Madman, and after some serious Strength adders, Eomer finally overcomes.  Mike then presses on, and faces an Uruk-Hai Raiding Party, who he fights off with only a couple wounds. On my turn I play Eowyn and move to the Sanctuary with little opposition.  When Mike goes to Site 4, he is attacked by two Pillagers.  The first one overwhelms the Rider of Rohan he just played, and Eomer has to fight in the Fierce Skirmish, so he has two wounds.  On my turn I double move to Site 5, which could have cost me the game.  His Site was the Deep of Helm, you know, the Ford of Bruinen for Uruks.  He then plays SIX Uruk-Hai minions for next to nothing, because he used the text of three Uruk Regulars to help with the Twilight cost.  Luckily Aragorn was Defender +1,or it would have been over, but he takes on a couple guys and everyone lives to tell the tale another day.   Mike then plays a couple mounts, and moves to face down 2 Dunlending Robbers, a Dunlending Savage and an Uruk Hunter.  Four minions to his three Companions insures that Frodo gets his at Site 5.  <br />
<br />
FW +3 / +3 <br />
<br />
It sucks to have to beat a good friend in the first game, but sometimes that&#8217;s the way the pairings go.  It wasn&#8217;t the first time we have played each other, and it definitely won&#8217;t be the last.  We discuss the game and what we can do to play better, and we decide that a bid of three burdens is probably enough to make sure I go first.  We will see how that works in the next game.<br />
<br />
GAME TWO<br />
<br />
Vs.  Thomas Harris  ( Aragorn Deck ) <br />
<br />
Thomas has become another one of my Arch Rivals, but I have yet to come with a nickname for him.  Maybe Darth Foily.  At any rate, I win the bid to go first with three burdens ( I know, a bit much against another Aragorn deck, but maybe my opponent doesn&#8217;t play the Riddermark, just to mess me up, then what ? ) I play Heir and double move to Site 3 with no effort.  Thomas sets up his Fellowship just as well and doubles to Site 3but he loses Legolas along the way, and gets one of his Elven Swordsmen killed.  I then double move to Site 5 and stop with little or no damage.  Thomas follows suit.  We go back and forth for a few turns and Thomas gets to Site 9 first.  I play Saruman and three minions to his three Companions, and Frodo gets overwhelmed after a boost from Saruman.  <br />
<br />
FW +3 / +6 <br />
<br />
Another Springs player goes down, and now I am starting to get a bit comfortable with my deck.  I have opted not to do any sideboarding, because the Dunland rabble seem to be working OK.  Maybe in my next game I will get paired up with someone I haven&#8217;t played before. . .<br />
<br />
GAME THREE <br />
<br />
Vs.  Brian &#8220; Doc Oc &#8220; Montez  ( Aragorn Deck ) <br />
<br />
Well, I guess I won&#8217;t get paired with a Denver player.  Instead, I will have to face another one of my longtime Arch Rivals.  I win the bid to go first and pull Heir and double to Site 3 ( do you see the pattern ? ) Brian follows with little opposition.  We both double to Site 5 relatively easily as well.  Then it all starts to come together for me.  At Site 6 I kill off his Gandalf and Gimli with some well timed Strength adders.  By the time Brian gets to Site 8, just after I doubled there, Frodo has to take on some weakling Dunland minion.  Death to the Strawheads and a boost from Saruman seals his fate. <br />
<br />
FW +3 / +9 <br />
<br />
So I have now defeated three of my Nemeses, and I am anxiously awaiting to see how my deck does against some Denver players.  At this point Scott has announced that the top Aragorn player and the top Theoden player will get one of the Three Hunters foils that comes in the Collector&#8217;s Edition DVD of FOTR.  Now that is some serious prize support.  <br />
<br />
GAME FOUR <br />
<br />
vs.  Brian Cofer ( Aragorn Deck ) <br />
<br />
Finally, a Denver player.   Brian is also undefeated thus far, but he seems to have little confidence.  He wins the bid after I only bid one, seeing his Aragorn box.  He starts the Riddermark, to my relief, and then stops at Site 2 after facing a couple Dunlan minions.  I also have to stop, because the minions he plays are just too big to kill off.  Brian has no set up a huge Fellowship, almost reaching the nine Companion limit.  He doubles moves through the Sanctuary, but I am forced to stop for some healing.  Brian now moves to Site 5 with a HUGE fellowship, which is great for DTTSH.  The blood starts to flow here, as I overwhelm his Aragorn and his Eothain.  On his next turn he forgets to heal at Site 6 and then moves to the Causeway.  We then figure out he has to take 8 Archery wounds.  After that, the Hordes came into the fight and overwhelmed three of his Naith Companions.  My Fellowship on the other hand is hanging in there.  I double move to Site 8, forcing him to make the double move from Site 7 on his next turn.  He tries to play a copy of Pippin, but with four Comapnions in the Dead Pile and five on the table, it just can&#8217;t happen.  He argues that his Elven Swordsmen are non-unique and there fore are not considered dead.  I choke down my shock at this kids misunderstanding of the Rule of Nine, explain to hm that dead is dead, and by the way I am a Rider of Rohan, so I know the rules.  He concedes and puts Pippin back in his hand.  By the time he gets to Site 9, he is down to Gimli and Frodo, and that&#8217;s just not enough to handle three Dunland minions.  <br />
<br />
FW +3 / +12 <br />
<br />
Excellent.  As it stands, I am the only undefeated Aragorn player left, so the foil is almost guaranteed to be mine.  But first, I would have to face another of my Southern Colorado Nemeses.<br />
<br />
GAME FIVE <br />
<br />
vs. Danny &#8220; Black Manta &#8220; Hummel ( Aragorn Deck ) <br />
<br />
Danny is the top player in the Springs, and we have gone back and forth fo rthe last year with him getting the most hashes in the win column.  Today that would change.  I win the bid, pull Heir and double to Site 3.  he has to stop at Site 2 however after his Gimli gets overwhelmed.  We then go back and forth pretty evenly, but on my last turn, just as I was about to double move to Site 9, I draw up three Companions, including Eothain, Eowyn and a Gondor Ranger.  I make the double move to Site 9 with eight Companions and Frodo basically sits down, boils up some stew and picks his toes while he watches the Skirmishes.  <br />
<br />
FW + 3 / + 15<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the victory is pretty much sealed fo r me at this point, with just one more game to go, against Thomas McGee.  Thomas is a Theoden player, so even if I somehow manage to lose, I still get the foil.  <br />
<br />
GAME SIX <br />
<br />
vs.  Thomas &#8220; Lets have a Smoke &#8220;  McGee ( Theoden Deck ) <br />
<br />
Thomas so far has lost only one game I believe, but he is still the top rated Theoden player.  Even if he loses this game, he will be the to Theoden player.  Hmmm, I guess that really says something about the Theoden Deck.  I win the bid and pull Heir, and double to Site 3, but I barely make it because all of my Companions are exhausted.  When Thomas moves to Site 3 I end up killing Eowyn and a rider of Rohan.  We go back and forth like this for the whole game, barely surviving to each Sanctuary.  At Site 7, I can only pull one minion, but that one minion kills another Rider of Rohan.  This sets up the double move to Site 9.  I move to the Site with Aragorn, Eowyn Eothain, Gondor Ranger and Frodo.  Thomas plays seven minions.  Aragorn takes on two smaller guys, and the Ranger, Eowyn and Eothain each get one.  They all die in their Skirmish, Aragorn lives, taking three wounds, and Frodo avoids getting overwhelmed by playing the new Bounder Event ( I think it was Severed His Bonds ).  But, it was not over yet!  Thomas had played three minions that go Fierce if there are three or more cards in the dead Pile, and my Dead Pile was huge.  Aragorn takes on two guys again and dies fighting for the Quest, while Frodo hangs on against his one minion.  <br />
<br />
FW + 3 / +18<br />
<br />
That was an incredibly close game, but Thomas and I both still came out on top.  After that game we both definitely needed a smoke.  Outside Chris Fanchi points out that if Thomas had assigned three minions to Aragorn, he would have died, and then those three minions would have been Fierce against a lone Frodo, sealing the win for Thomas.  We went over all of the cards we had in hand and how the Skirmishes would have played out if we had assigned differently in the first Skirmish phase.  It definitely should have been Thomas&#8217;s game.  But, like my Dad always says, &#8220; If my aunt had a d!ck she would be my uncle &#8220; <br />
<br />
So, we head back inside to see who would get what foil.  Up for grabs was Aragorn, Ranger of the North AI and Gimli, Son of Gloin AI.  The first pick would be chosen at random.  Luckily I was drafted to make the first choice, and without hesitation snatched up the Aragorn ROTN.  I also pulled a few packs, getting a foil Faramir&#8217;s Cloak and Forbidden Pool.  Great, now I can build that broken Forbidden Pools deck I have been working on for days.  Yeah, right.<br />
<br />
PROPS<br />
<br />
To Scott Gaeta, for once again running a great event with the most excellent prize support ever.  <br />
<br />
To Thomas McGee, for giving me a great game and making me sweat my last opponent.<br />
<br />
To Chris Fanchi, for finally seeing the light.  Welcome to the Fold, Brother, Hallelujah, amen. <br />
<br />
To all the Southern Colorado players, Thomas Harris, Danny Hummel, Brian Montez, and Mike Armistead, for representing the South.  As a whole we took five of the top ten spots at the event, proving that SoCo is in the mix for LOTR in Colorado.  <br />
<br />
SLOPS<br />
<br />
Um, none really, except to the lopsided advantage the Aragorn deck had over the Theoden deck.  Maybe next set Decipher will get it right.<br />
