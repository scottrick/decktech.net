I fortunately managed to collect my deck on the day before after I lost it in the last tournament and the shop really did pick it up for me and kept it for me. Excellent job. I would field it again, since my other deck was in a mess and some snooping around on days before revealed to me that I would only have to worry about 1 or 2 Uruk decks. Big undirected archery on Free Peoples and Nazgul Tip/Breath on Shadow.<br>
<br>
The night before, Foo Woon Howe, a schoolmate, called me up and asked if he should join. Before, our school was a definitive force in LotR here, with us classmates and schoolmates bagging the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th national rankings at one point. Now...sigh, the world changes and all have quit except me and Foo are still playing, and that guy had been missing for a while. I convinced him to take time off his skating (jesus) and join.<br>
<br>
I arrived half an hour late on the day after some commitments at home, and the first round was, well, 30 minutes into play. Splendid turnout of 19 people filling the centre. Prizes definitely make a difference. I greeted Aldrin the TD and he shot me a dirty look and said I would play the next guy who comes, since he wasn&#39;t enforcing any time-limits in this tournament.<br>
<br>
Then who should come swaggering in but Foo, who had had some trouble escaping the allure of skating, and thus equally late.<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
vs Foo Woon Howe<br>
Frodo, RA/Boromir, LoG/Merry, FtS start<br>
Mixed Fellowship/Nazgul Tip/Breath<br>
<br>
He groaned when paired against me. He thought I was still playing my old deck, which was the only deck he always consistently lost to. Why? Because this MANIAC double-moves every game, every time from 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9. How does he do it? 3 Flaming Brands, 4 Armors, 3 Power According to His Statures, 2 Sleeps, 4 Stealths and lots of companions. There, all 4 cultures settled, and his deck doesn&#39;t contain any RotEL cards. I always have to stop his madness at Site 6 or after and MYSELF do an exhausting 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9 and finish the game panting. I was playing Nazgul this time though, which meant my shadow might not be able to stop him that well.<br>
<br>
We both bid 0. He got to go first and started the Pony. TWO Flaming Brands out already on the first turn, but he distributed them among Aragorn and Boromir, thinking I was playing Uruks. He got Gandalf out and moved and faced a Nazgul. Moved again and with my lack of Tips or Breaths, I failed to inflict any lasting harm on his companions.<br>
<br>
I pulled Aragorn and got Boromir out, with Gwemegil and Gondor Bowmen. Moved to 2 to face site-changer Nelya, plus exertion to bring out Bree Streets in time for Cantea. Dealt him 4 archery with Bowmen to kill off Nelya and exhaust Cantea for Arwen to kill him, and an inconsequential double to 3. His side, Boromir was fully equipped with Blade of Gondor + Flaming Brand, and he moved to Moria Stairway, where he was met with Cantea and Attea + Sword. Boromir took a single wound twice against Attea due to Armor. Gandalf took on Cantea twice and bit a Breath.<br>
<br>
So, with full-health Attea and Cantea out against Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf and Boromir, what did he do? Yep, you guessed it, a double-move to The Bridge. And yep, you guessed it, I had no minions. He sacrificed Gandalf to Cantea due to my Blade Tip and double-PATHSed Attea.<br>
<br>
I got Bow and Splendor out and faced Nelya + Sword at Stairway. Shot him down since I couldn&#39;t win him. Move to 5 and I shot down more Nazgul.<br>
<br>
He got a 2nd Flaming Brand out on Aragorn and blazed a trail through Cantea and friends, as he doubled again to stop at 7 with 2 wounds on Aragorn. My turn and I used every archery trick I could muster to also land at 7 to keep the pressure on him, albeit with Boromir, Legolas and Aragorn exhausted, Arwen wounded with a Black Breath and Frodo with a Black Breath.<br>
<br>
He had nothing and moved to Shores of Nen Hithoel and this was the turning point. I had 15 twilight. I had 2 options, go for Enquea and Cantea, and cause a wound or two (Cantea can almost always guarantee a wound token or two) and lull him into double-moving again, where he would play nicely into my Witch-King + Pale Blade and Cantea trap to kill both his Gondor companions off and destroy Frodo. OR I could just get the King + Blade out there and then, impede him from moving and overtake him to 9. I chose the latter because c&#39;mon, Witch-King + Pale Blade is absolutely cool. Relentless Charge brought Aragorn down to 2 vitality again. Only Boromir had Armor, which meant that he had to choose between Aragorn and Boromir. No prizes for guessing who died. And the greatest miracle...he STOPPED.<br>
<br>
But it was a wrong choice. I had over-estimated my Fellowship. It was tired and was feeling the after-effects of skipping the Site 6 sanctuary. I healed a wound each from Legolas, Aragorn and Boromir, and moved to 7 with 1-wound Legolas, 4-wound Frodo, 1-wound Arwen, 1-wound Boromir, 3-wound Aragorn. Toldea and Attea and a Relentless Charge meant that Legolas and Aragorn were both brought to exhaustion. 5 archery from Boromir&#39;s last exertion for Bowmen meant I faced an exhausted Attea, but crap, all my companions were exhausted except for Arwen! Boromir died on the first skirmish and Arwen took another wound, bringing her to exhaustion. I healed Aragorn with Elrond in the regroup and contemplated. If I moved again, I could ping off Attea with Aragorn and have 4 companions and a sizable Frodo. But I knew he had Witch-King + Pale Blade in hand through Sting. And the whole problem was he could just draw into his 2nd Relentless Charge (he plays 4) and legolas would die and Aragorn unable to ping Attea. In the meantime, on his side he had 2 companions, which meant he could just give me 10 twilight at the Summit or be stupid and play stuff. I only had Cantea and Enquea in hand. I checked my discard pile: 4 Morgul Gates used, Twilight Nelya, my only other 5-twilight minion were all used. My hope was to draw into my last Relentless Charge and exhaust Aragorn then kill both companions off. I did very poor calculation and somehow believed that my shadow could do better than my Fellowship. The chances of my shadow winning were very, extremely slim, whereas I had nothing to lose for Fellowship. I stopped.<br>
<br>
He healed Aragorn which meant my Cantea wouldn&#39;t even be able to defeat Aragorn after his Aragorn&#39;s Bow exertions. I didn&#39;t draw any more shadow. He moved to 9 and as it happened, even if I killed Aragorn with Cantea, Frodo had Stealth to bail him out of fierce.<br>
<br>
And as it happened, the only shadow he had were Witch-King + Pale Blade, Lemenya + Sword. Therefore, if I had moved, Aragorn could ping Attea off, hug the Witch-King (not Arwen or Legolas, else WK would kill the Elf and discard The Saga of Elendil) as Arwen skirmished Lemenya. Arwen wouldn&#39;t even be able to win Lemenya due to his Sword and the Breath on Arwen. Both companions die, and with only Witch-King fierce, Legolas could give himself up.<br>
<br>
Poor judgment there.<br>
<br>
FL +1/+1<br>
Props:<br>
-We finished ahead of quite a few people even though we started 30min late. DOUBLE-MOVE MADNESS!<br>
-He let me treat Site 8 as Shores after I realised I forgot to swap Pillars of the Kings out.<br>
-Great match, just not good for a first game.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-YOU BLOODY MANIAC!<br>
-First time I lost my first game at a tournament<br>
-Mentally exhausting game. We were both really tired by the 2nd round.<br>
-Poor judgment on the last sites. The exhaustion caught up.<br>
-Playing on the floor &#39;cause we were late. Humph.<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
vs Nathanael Lee<br>
Frodo, OBH/Gandalf, FotS start<br>
Frodo&#39;s Signet Pipeweed/Uruks<br>
<br>
This guy and another friend only come down occasionally for tournaments and games as they live on the wrong side of town. Potentially good, my Apprentice buddies, but they lack experience. He was playing a rather interesting deck, very similar to the Frodo-Lovers Narcotics Association deck I posted elsewhere on this site.<br>
<br>
I have an uncanny ability of getting awesome, broken draws after I lose an exhausting tournament game to wrap up a very quick game, perhaps as a compensation for my lost energy. The other time, I drew so many Uruk pumps in my starting hand I overwhelmed Aragorn and Gandalf at Site 2 and 3 as my opponent conceded, and the other, double-moving every turn due to an unbelievable Fellowship. Shrug, I could do with an easy win now to boost my morale.<br>
<br>
He bid 2 to my 0 and started the Shire Lookout Point. I drew my hand. First card, Twilight Nelya. Quick glance at his 2 burdens. Hmm, not bad. Next card, Morgul Gates. Damage +1 Fierce momma at Site 2. Sweet. That&#39;s one dead Gandalf. Next card, Too Great and Terrible.......AWESOME!!!<br>
<br>
Now I had to just see what he had to play. He pulled the Cart, dropped some possessions and played Greenleaf. Another look at my hand...Nazgul Sword and Relentless Charge?<br>
<br>
OH MY BLOODY GOD!!!<br>
<br>
He moved to Trollshaw, giving me 7. Twilight Nelya charged out with his Sword as I used the Too Great and Terrible. He looked, looked again, rubbed his eyes, laughed wryly and put both Legolas and Gandalf in the dead pile.<br>
<br>
My side, I got Aragorn in my starting hand and got him out, but withheld Boromir in hand after I saw him discard Saruman when he reconciled. 2 Gondor Bowmen and I went to 2 to face 2 Uruks. A Gondor Bowmen and 2 arrows from Son of Thranduil solved it. I wasn&#39;t taking any risks with his 2 Ambitions on the table and my naked companions.<br>
<br>
He drew into Boromir, Son of Denethor and played him to save Frodo moving into the Ford. He moved. So, I needed a minion capable of overwhelming Boromir and also capable of overwhelming Frodo after Boromir-pump (i.e. 14 strength or higher), forcing him to exert Boromir twice to save Frodo on the first and get Boromir killed on the fierce, before he can heal up and set up and salvage something. I looked at my hand. ENTER THE WITCH-KING. He shook his head in exasperation as Boromir went to the dead pile and Frodo bit Tip + Breath.<br>
<br>
I got a Saga and moved to 3. He played a single Uruk Fighter who self-destructed in the archery phase for him to cycle his hand. And he badly needed to for his Fellowship. His turn and he got another saving grace, Merry, Friend to Sam. He moved to Moria Stairway where I could only muster up Cantea with the twilight. By now, he was shaking his head in utter disbelief as Merry pumped Frodo then died on the normal skirmish.<br>
<br>
I withheld gaving him too much twilight to choke him and went to 4 and saw another Uruk self-destruct.<br>
<br>
His side, he played Aragorn the Heir, got to 5 burdens, and jokingly wondered how long Aragorn would survive. He moved and here come the men in black. Enquea and Cantea killed off both companions, so yeah, the inevitable finally came after the events of Site 2.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+4<br>
Props:<br>
-My hand was DISGUSTING<br>
-You sure bet I was pumped up after that<br>
-Game finished in 10 minutes<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-His terrible luck. He got 0-4 eventually due to bad draws and mistakes stemming from inexperience.<br>
<br>
With so much time left, we had a rematch and this was what it really should have been. Elsewhere is told the tale of how my 5 companions shot every arrow in my deck, swished every blade against Saruman and his minions, and his POWER, and limped valiantly on, and how all 8 of his companions exerted at Silverlode Banks, and my subsequent killing of all 8 companions at the Shores of Nen Hithoel with a 22-strength Witch-King.<br>
<br>
Game 3<br>
vs Gene Wong<br>
Frodo, OBH/Sam, PP/Merry, FtS start<br>
Gandalf-Hobbits/Sauron-Uruk Discard<br>
<br>
I saw him playing before the game, and did not see his shadow side except for an Orthanc Assassin in his discard pile, which led me to believe he was playing Uruks.<br>
<br>
He bid 1 to my 0 and went first, starting the Prancing Pony. He was delighted to finally get Gandalf out before Site 4 in the tournament and moved, and declined as I reminded him to play Aragorn. Strange, a deck like his should start the Hobbiton Woods for Midgewater Moors, Buckleberry Ferry or something, not let me get out my free Aragorn.<br>
<br>
A revisit to my hand and the vengeance of my luck returned. No minions to compensate for my unbelievable luck. So what do you do when you have no minions and your opponent can get the disgusting free double to the Ford? Yep, you frown at your hand, scowl and lament how 8-twilight is fit for nothing. Then you discard a Pale Blade and ensure he sees your discard pile.<br>
<br>
Good, his eyes widened and he stopped. I pulled Aragorn, played all the FP in my hand, but withheld Boromir as the 5th companion as I did think he was playing Uruks. Bad mistake there, as his true colours were revealed when an Orc Inquisitor pulled him from my hand. Cripes! With only 2 in my deck, that&#39;s as good as killing him outright! An Uruk Rager + Sword also charged out. I despairingly realised I couldn&#39;t shoot them down, and took my wounds, milling 3 cards, mostly Nazgul extras. Stopped as the Rager would screw me up again if I moved.<br>
<br>
I mustered up minions this time after refilling my hand, Witch-King and Enquea, and I was left extremely disgusted when Proper Poet took on both minions twice and Stealth-ed out twice. My Blade Tip in my support area puked too.<br>
<br>
I too stopped at 3. He moved to 4, where he gave me only enough twilight to bring down Attea, not his Sword for Damage +1 madness. Gandalf took 2 as the Tip passed to him. Didn&#39;t comprehend that decision on my part, though it seems like he forgot about the Tip, but he seemed confident, as he could heal up with 4 Gandalfs in his 60-card deck. I saw him discard a Sleep as he reconciled.<br>
<br>
I set up more archery stuff and did a quick double to 5, this time managing to shoot down a Rager + Sword. His side and he moved to the Bridge, and I caught Gandalf with his pants down with Too Great and Terrible. He groaned as he was forced to another stop, this time using Stealths to bail himself out.<br>
<br>
Fearing that he might dump my draw deck and overtake me, I went Pathfinder for 6 to deny him of the Valley for Gift of Boats and with intelligence from Sting, made it to 7 with Arwen exhausted and Aragorn wounded once. Through my Sting, I also saw why he was groaning. Extra copies of Gandalf, his events filled half of his hand.<br>
<br>
He played Aragorn, RotN and moved to 6, where Aragorn promptly got wounded twice and Tipped + Breathed. He opted to move again. Now he really looked desperate. 2 Nazgul out. He wanted to bring Sam out for Defender +1 but I suggested Aragorn since he would die anyway.<br>
<br>
Boromir toys clogged up my hand as the man himself fumed in my discard pile. I got out more archery and moved to 8 to shoot down two 5-cost Uruks. I contemplated stopping, but I decided that he would try to overtake me because he knew his Shadow could no longer stop him, and with Stealths, Intuitions and maybe Elbereth or Filibert popping out, he might actually do it. I moved again to Emyn Muil. Fellowship relatively naked as I slowed my throughput deliberately, but my 2 Gondor Bowmen, Elven Bow and Legolas ensured I could survive anything. <br>
<br>
FW +3/+9<br>
Props:<br>
-Never tried to take advantage of my mistakes and reminded me of potential mistakes in advance. Pleasure to play with.<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
-Paranoid. I finished with half my draw deck left.<br>
<br>
Game 4<br>
vs Yeo Leck Koon<br>
Frodo, OBH/Sam, FC start<br>
Frodo-Sam Choke/Nazgul Tip-Breath<br>
<br>
He had been playing at the same table as me and as his opponent was too playing a similar-themed deck, though minus Sam, they racked up 4 or 5 games of losses between Site 3 and 6 before I was done with Gene. <br>
<br>
He bid 1 to my 0 and went first to start Green Hill Country. I looked at my starting hand, so much the deciding factor against choke. No Aragorn but there was Boromir. He pulled the Pony, got the Farmer out and Filibert, and gave me 3 twilight at Trollshaw. I played Tip and Breath and reconciled, drawing up Aragorn in the process.<br>
<br>
I played both Men and 2 Gondor Bowmen and moved. Met Nelya at 2 who switched the site to Ettenmoors. With no threat of Tips and Breaths or overwhelming, I let them wound me.<br>
<br>
He moved to 3, giving me 2. I used it all by Gates-ing a Witch-King and adding a Sword, and for the second game in a row, was feeling ripped off when he Stealth-ed and used Filibert. My side, I flooded the pool, primarily with a Council of Elrond for The Splendor and Elrond and moved. Witch-King + Pale Blade and Enquea emerged and Enquea instilled Fear in Elrond. BLEURGH.<br>
<br>
No way I could let those 2 big idiots survive the archery phase. a Splendor and 2 Bowmen for 7 archery. I wondered idly if he played All Blades Perish and how I would be screwed if he did, but he didn&#39;t.<br>
<br>
He moved to 4, giving me 2 twilight, and I outdid myself when I got to play a minion, Gates + Lemenya. Who promptly got Stealthed too. I moved to 4 and shot more. Really, my FP turns are starting to get stale.<br>
<br>
He moved to 5, giving me 6, enough only for Attea. He was just about to do the old Stealth-Filibert thing when I said BOO to the wily rascal. He was caught off-guard, Stealth-ed the first, and Sam died on the fierce.<br>
<br>
More shooting as I moved to 5. Relatively unharmed so I moved again to Site 6, and shot more minions down. Nothing new. On his turn, he played 3 Promises in a row and I thought I was getting ripped when I remembered Sam was in the dead pile. Splendid. He stopped at 6 after he denied me of playing any minions.<br>
<br>
I moved to Anduin Wilderland, regretting the Pathfinder I threw away. He had 2 Blade Tips and 2 Black Breaths out and I also started regretting the Vilya I threw away. Nelya and Cantea came. Boromir was a 12 to take care of Nelya. Somebody was going to die to Cantea&#39;s bad breath and sharp blade. I let naked Arwen (not like that, you pervert) take both skirmishes against Cantea as she bit Tip and Breath. Intimidated into stopping.<br>
<br>
He played Sting and moved to 7. Only minion I had that could overwhelm Frodo was Cantea so I played him. Assigned to Frodo of course. I was pretty sure he could PATHS his way out after I dumped his Sting but if I didn&#39;t dump it, there wouldn&#39;t be any difference anyway. I dumped it and got double-PATHSed.<br>
<br>
My turn as I moved to 8 and shot more Nazgul down and healed Aragorn with Elrond. I contemplated stopping but again feared that he would have the same &quot;can&#39;t kill you so nothing-to-lose syndrome&quot; and again, all he needed was Elbereth and Filibert to screw me. Moved again to 9 with my bows ready, and he was only able to muster up Enquea.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
Props<br>
-Making Filibert shiver in his wet breeches in FEAR.<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-His drawing Promises after Sam died<br>
-Stealths are getting annoying.<br>
<br>
Results<br>
1st: Foo Woon Howe +12 (28)<br>
2nd: Joachim Chia +12 (26)<br>
3rd: Celia Chen +10 (30)<br>
4th: Me +10 (28) <br>
<br>
Grrr, finally a prize tournament and I miss out on top 3. Shock was how Joachim, a squeaky, pint-sized guy who usually gets decimated in his older opponents&#39; quests to the top, managed an unbelievable 4-0. His deck isn&#39;t special, but his playing has improved over the weeks. <br>
<br>
Props<br>
-Foo winning after I told him to come<br>
-Foo compensating for beating me by also beating my nearest ratings competitor. Cool.<br>
-God-hand from Hell (Game 2)<br>
-Joachim&#39;s miracle<br>
-Very varied decks in this tournament. No 2 Free Peoples were alike, and equal dosage of all shadow cultures except, well, 0 Sauron. Even Isengard Orcs, Twilight Nazgul and Moria Archery, and only 3 Uruks and 4 Nazgul.<br>
-Some newbie playing a shadow half with all the cultures (except Sauron of course). Yep, he got schooled.<br>
-Good turnout<br>
<br>
Slops<br>
-Got 2 packs and a random rare. Make Light of Burdens, Fearing the Worst, Change of Plans. Zzz. No foil, that means I haven&#39;t pulled a foil since April and that I have only pulled 3 rare foils in over 70 packs.<br>
-That bloody Foo was in a hurry to leave so he left me his BLOODY THICK album for me to lug home and return him. His reason, as I later found out, was that he didn&#39;t have time to stick it in his bag.<br>
-Cripes, nearly lost my deck again. Only stuffed it in my deck as I saw it on the table as I was leaving.<br>
-My two Apprentice buddies getting 0-4 and 0-2. <br></font></blockquote><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3998&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/treports/treports.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
