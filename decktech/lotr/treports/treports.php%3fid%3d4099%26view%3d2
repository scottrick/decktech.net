I had spent the last couple of days readying my first Open deck which really only had just one Towers card (Grima) for shadow and just one Towers card (Escape) for Free Peoples, with the rest all cards from the Fellowship block. Figured that the old stuff was better. I had tried sticking Faramir, SoD in but Sword of Gondor simply blows. Just good old denial then with old-school Uruks on shadow.<br />
<br />
For the first time here, we actually had problems getting the tournament sanctioned with only 7 people and things only got underway when we netted in a reluctant participant. Disturbing, considering how the previous tournament too only had 8 people. Either people have exams, haven&#39;t finished their decks or there is the disturbing possibility that the scene is shrinking badly.<br />
<br />
So, 8 people, which allows me to list out every deck-type there was with my hawkish scouting skills. There&#39;s me with Rangers-Hobbits/Old Uruks, James with Rangers-Hobbits/Old Uruks, Kelvin with Rohan-Gandalf/New Uruks, Don with Elves/Uruk Trackers, Mun Kin with Elves/Nazgul, Dave with Mixed/Uruk Trackers, Gene with Hobbits/Dunland and Mr. No-name (or I just can&#39;t remember his name) with something/Uruk Trackers.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s 3 Uruk Trackers, 3 Uruks, 1 Dunland and 1 Nazgul for you.<br />
<br />
<b>Game 1</b><br />
vs Don Yu<br />
Frodo, RA/Legolas, G/Arwen, DoE<br />
Elves/Uruk Trackers<br />
<br />
In all my testing, I never really got to spar with an Uruk Tracker deck so this could be a shortcoming.<br />
<br />
We both bid 2. I won the dice-roll and started The Riddermark. Pulled Aragorn, played Sting, a No Stranger and an Armor. Sting revealed a couple of Vengeance, which I had to keep re-reading. Move to Wold of Rohan and faced 2 Trackers. Aragorn and Boromir took wounds, with Aragorn biting a Weary as I moved to 3T. Not very good judgment there as the two Men came out exhausted and Merry died, and I lost Sting to Golden Hall.<br />
<br />
He played Galadriel with Orophin and The Splendor of Their Banners on Arwen and moved to Wold of Rohan. I played 2 Uruk Warriors and Abandoned Reason for Madness. Orophin and Legolas shot them down and I didn&#39;t have enough twilight for another minion when he moved to Golden Hall.<br />
<br />
I played Sam, Proper Poet and Hobbit Sword on Frodo before moving to White Rocks. He had made a pleased grunt when he drew up his hand and I saw why. A Weary on Boromir meant my two fighters were both tired, and who should come out but Uruk Searcher. Boromir had Armor, but I knew he still had a Vengeance in hand from the previous turn. I counted though. Boromir had an Armor and No Stranger, +4 to the Searcher&#39;s 9, 13-7. Not enough, eh?<br />
<br />
Nobody told me Weary was a card too, and I didn&#39;t notice it either. Bloody...<br />
<br />
Boromir bit it after Vengeance got the Searcher to 17 (come to think of it, I didn&#39;t notice the +2 for assignment to character bearing search card either) and for fierce, I did what I should have done on the first: assign a non-Weary Frodo to the Searcher.<br />
<br />
He played Gwemegil and Long-Knives and some other negligible stuff before moving to 4. Whatever Uruk I played got shot down by Orophin. My side, I moved, giving 7 twilight at Deep of Helm. That was enough for 3 fierce Uruk Trackers to come up against my 3 companions. This wasn&#39;t looking good. Proper Poet took the 2 biggest as Frodo took a wound against the last, and for fierce, I assigned one each to Frodo and Aragorn, and he stacked the extra minion on Frodo. Aragorn took his wound, and for Frodo, I double-PATHSed my way out of the carnage.<br />
<br />
He played Asfaloth on Arwen, meaning that she now bore 3, 3, 3, cards. He moved, and Saruman, Grima and two random Uruks charged out. Grima stripped Arwen naked during the maneuver phase (love that expression!) and he made an exceptionally bad call during the archery phase when he exerted Orophin and Legolas to shoot, totally forgetting about my Saruman, and thus Legolas had wound tokens on him for doing nothing. Looking grimly at my cards, he took a gamble as he assigned one of the 9-ers to Frodo having Sentinel-ed my Ambition during maneuver with the other going on Arwen. It paid off: I had nothing in my hand. Frodo wore the ring against the 9-er and Arwen took 2. Fierce. Frodo took another 2 burdens, putting him at 8, and Legolas, having exerted for nuts during the archery phase, died a needless death.<br />
<br />
I grimaced as I reconciled and still did not draw up any back-up companions. Gave him 4 twilight at Great Hall and my turn to gamble as I assigned Frodo to the Tracker which came out to protect a Weary Aragorn from death. Nope, no pumps. I took my wounds and stopped.<br />
<br />
He redeployed Asfaloth and Gwemegil on Arwen and moved, but to no avail. My Troop of Uruk-hai ignored them as it ravaged the exhausted Arwen, leaving him with just Frodo. Finally, things were looking up for me, if only I could kill him before he killed me.<br />
<br />
I breathed a sigh of relief as I drew up Thrarin. That would give me some much-needed breathing space. I also finally drew up Athelas to get rid of Weary. Moved to Hornburg Causeway and took a couple more wounds.<br />
<br />
On his side, he played Lorien Guardian with a Tale of Gil-Galad before moving, giving me only 9 twilight, with Orophin ready at the backline to loose. With that in mind, I played Saruman and Troop. Troop was not able to overwhelm Guardian on the normal skirmish when I Savagery-ed after he discarded Tale, and thus the Guardian was there to sacrifice himself for fierce. I swallowed. Every site he survived meant another site I had to survive.<br />
<br />
I gave 6 twilight at Wizard&#39;s Vale, which stretched to 10. Mercifully, he only got out 1 minion, which I could handle amply. I stopped gratefully in this close game.<br />
His side, he flooded the pool as he played Aragorn with Sword and another Lorien Guardian with Elven Bow and The Splendor of Their Banners before moving. The generous helping of twilight meant that I was able to get out Saruman with 3 Uruks. Saruman laughed in Orophin&#39;s face. Frodo had to fight, and with nothing on him and 8 burdens on him, he couldn&#39;t do much.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+3<br />
Props:<br />
-Aragorn and Frodo limping all the way to 8T.<br />
-Won after a very bad start.<br />
-Close game.<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Weary is a card. Jeez, why didn&#39;t I think of that.<br />
-He didn&#39;t pull Aragorn at 1T because he didn&#39;t know that I had started The Riddermark.<br />
-Nearly got cloberd by Uruk Trackers.<br />
<br />
<b>Game 2</b><br />
vs James Chan<br />
Frodo, RA/Boromir, LoG/Pippin, HoSI start<br />
Rangers/Uruks<br />
<br />
James and I have met many times in tournaments, and they have all been close affairs. They have all gone in my favour, but all by just the skin of my teeth. We play very identical decks, with mirrored shadow and his Free Peoples only a slight variation from mine, and we were up for another epic battle.<br />
<br />
He bid 3 to my 2 and started The Riddermark. I only drew up Saruman and Power for shadow but opted not to mulligan due to a favourable Free Peoples hand. He moved after giving me quite a lot of twilight, including a first-turn Blade of Aragorn, Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Armor and the fact that I only managed a Saruman was very telling. He took the double with iron jaws.<br />
<br />
I pulled Aragorn and noticed my Grima was at the bottom of my deck. No go, I shuffled vigorously since his Aragorn was already in Grima-range. Got the Bow and Blade of Gondor as I moved. An Uruk Warrior came out, with 1 point of archery from Aragorn. Against Boromir, I Merry-pumped, and after he used 2 Savageries, I opted to exert once for Blade to kill the Warrior. Moved again and became worried when he played a Warrior and Lieutenant. Thankfully just enough. Aragorn exhausted himself with Bow to kill the Warrior and wound the Lieutenant and Boromir exhausted himself with Blade to finish the job.<br />
<br />
He gave out quite a bit of twilight at Barrows of Edoras before moving to my Westemnet Hills. I got out Troop and Lieutenant. The Lieutenant took one against Aragorn and Troop wounded Faramir. With 2 minions left and the damaging text of Deep of Helm and Deeping Wall looming in the dark, he opted to stop.<br />
<br />
I gave only 4 twilight at Westemnet Hills, which prompted him to just play a Saruman. This confirmed to me that his next site was Deep of Helm and even though I would only give him 8 twilight, the site&#39;s text could spell dire consequences, together with Saruman making them fierce. I stopped.<br />
<br />
He dropped Last Alliance and Flaming Brand on Aragorn, making him a 16-strength against my Uruks, and also Last Alliance on Faramir to make him a 10. Not good. He moved, giving me 17 twilight or so at Deep of Helm. I only had 2 Uruk Warriors and a Lieutenant in my hand, easy fodder for both monstrous Gondor companions. I took a gamble. I played the Warrior and Abandoned Reason for Madness, discarding Warrior, Ambition and Filibert in a wild attempt to grab Grima. Didn&#39;t get him, but I got a combo only slightly less favourable in comparison: Uruk Captain, Saruman and Saruman&#39;s Power. Power got rid of his two Last Alliance and Elbereth, Captain and Lieutenant came out, and Captain pulled a Troop out of the discard, leaving nothing in the pool. 4 Uruks with Saruman, my Madness had paid off.<br />
Nothing much happened though after Orophin and Aragorn managed to get it down to 3 Uruks during the archery phase and Frodo double-PATHSed another Uruk to death. Just that quite a few companions came off exhausted, not Aragorn of course, but with 2 Uruks still left standing after the carnage and Saruman standing regal, I intimidated him off the double-move.<br />
<br />
My opening to surge forward, and I moved, giving 8 twilight. He used Deep&#39;s text to get 2 Troops out and played a free Beyond the Height of Men with the Ambitions out to strip Boromir of his newly-acquired Amor, and I had to kiss my double-move dreams goodbye. Aragorn and Boromir took two wounds each.<br />
<br />
He played Sam, Proper Poet and moved to Hornburg Armory, and Saruman with an Uruk Warrior caused a wound on Armored Aragorn after I Savagery-ed, spotting 5 companions. Another wound for fierce, and this was where he made a rash decision to swing the game in my favour. In all our previous outings, he had lost to me after I had made a wild double-move when he least expected it, most notably from Site 5 to 7, and he was obviously wary of that happening again. With 2 wounds each on Boromir and Aragorn, he moved again with Saruman and Warrior on the table.<br />
<br />
My Hornburg Causeway couldn&#39;t trigger anything so it was up to my minions. I only had an Uruk Lieutenant, which meant that his decision would have paid off, but I put a deaf ear on reason. Abandoned Reason for Madness again and drew up a Troop and Warrior, which allowed me to put out a respectable force of Saruman with 4 Uruks, as he looked on grimly. Even with Proper Poet taking it for the team, he could not prevent Boromir and Faramir (poor brothers) from both biting it, and when the dust was cleared, he was left with just Aragorn and Frodo. <br />
<br />
I played Proper Poet, Arwen and Thrarin and moved to Hornburg Armory to face Saruman and a Warrior. Having Stung his hand, I knew he had a Savagery, but it did not matter. I brought Thrarin out during maneuver and after Frodo survived the normal skirmish with Merry&#39;s help, Thrarin took it. I stopped.<br />
<br />
James played Sting and moved to Wizard&#39;s Vale, where this time I was the beneficiary oeasterlingenerous 4-twilight helping. That was enough for 2 Troops. Aragorn with 2 wounds and Orophin could not fell any of the two during archery and so, one had to go on Frodo. 4-9 with Sting&#39;s bonus compromised, James exerted Bounder but I had the Savagery and Ambition for 13-4.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+6<br />
Props:<br />
-Another close game.<br />
-Abandoning Reason for Madness saved my @$$<br />
-My copies of Abandoning came from James&#39; generous commons donations to me. Hah!<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-My madness paid off. James&#39; madness in that double did not.<br />
-Never drew Grima.<br />
<br />
<b>Game 3</b><br />
vs Dave Chia<br />
Frodo, RA/Eomer, TMotR/Merry, FtS start<br />
Mixed Fellowship/Uruk Trackers<br />
<br />
Only 8 people so this was to be the final round, and we were the only two undefeated at this point.<br />
<br />
I bid 2 to his 0 and started The Riddermark. Got No Stranger, Bill and A Talent in my starting hand and played Arwen to get the engine up and running immediately. Moved to Fangorn Forest and decided to stop after 2 Uruk Trackers, one with a Broad-bladed Sword, caused 4 wounds total.<br />
<br />
He played Firefoot and Eomer&#39;s Spear (argh) before moving. I had a Troop to combat the buff companion and Abandoned to draw up a few negligible cards.<br />
<br />
I gave 5 twilight at Stables and took a Tracker, nothing I could not heal. He played Faramir, SoD and pulled Treebeard, Oldest Living Thing and got stopped after I played Saruman and an Uruk.<br />
<br />
I played another No Stranger and Asfaloth on Arwen, chipping in a -4, and used Sting to find that Grima was lurking in his hand. I had not hit his radar yet. I also found 2 Plains Runners and that 12-strength anti-unbound Hobbits guy. Moved, giving 5. He decided there was no point in playing anything and discarded a Plains Runner as he reconciled. Bad choice there. With him only having a Plains Runner and that Tracker in hand, I doubled into Deeping Wall with no great worries. He opted not to play Saruman, and instead brought out the Plains Runner and the Tracker with an Ugluk he must have drawn, with an Uruk Spear to get rid of Asfaloth. Handled it amply.<br />
<br />
He played Gandalf, the Grey Pilgrim and Brego on Faramir and was stopped at Westemnet Hills by Saruman and an Uruk or two with Savagery against 5 companions, ceding the advantage to me.<br />
<br />
I drew up Ranger&#39;s Sword, Blade of Aragorn and hesitated before playing it on Aragorn and sticking the Flaming Brand on him on Boromir for his 3rd card to draw out the Grima. I had 2 Troops in hand for minions, and this was more about my finishing the race earlier so I wouldn&#39;t mind if my shadow was compromised of stopping power, and I could draw back lost time with the Hornburg Armory I expected to trip. Besides, another hand-check from Sting revealed that if he spent the 2 on Grima, he could only spend 4 on a measly Tracker to be taken care of by 12-strength Aragorn.<br />
I moved to Hornburg Armory, and things went exactly as planned. Grima bounced back an Armor, Flaming Brand and Blade of Gondor on Boromir to total 8 cards in my hand while Aragorn took care of the tracker. I drew one as I reconciled.<br />
<br />
He gave me 17 twilight at Deeping Wall and I played the 2 Troops, both able to win Eomer. Deciding finally that he was savvy enough to evade my own Grima which I had kept in hand since 1T after waiting fruitlessly for him to play his 3rd card on Eomer, I gave up and played him too in a bid to clear out my hand. Was just going to declare that I was done when he asked me if I was done. I did a double-check and cripes! I realised just in the nick of time that I nearly forgot to pull Saruman with the 5 remaining twilight. That I did right before I said I was done.<br />
One Troop lost to Eomer after Merry pumped it. The other lost to Faramir after Wizard&#39;s Staff made it smaller. I had no pumps. For fierce, Eomer took care of the Troop he had exhausted in the normal skirmish as the other Troop wounded Faramir.<br />
<br />
And this was the turning point as he decided to play catch-up. With an exhausted Troop and Grima on the table (I was very careful to let his mounts gain as little advantage as possible), he doubled into Hornburg Armory, where I got out a Lieutenant and Troop. Eomer with defender +1 slaughtered the exhausted Troop and Grima but the other Troop and Warrior killed Faramir and Merry respectively. For fierce, Eomer took care of the Lieutenant while the Troop killed Gandalf, as he was left with Eomer and Frodo.<br />
<br />
My side, I did another hand-check and detected no dangers but saw a minion-filled hand as I played Thrarin and drew 3 for Armory with Boromir&#39;s possessions coming back into play. Moved, giving 6 twilight at King&#39;s Room. After I had taken my exertions, Cantea came out. After taking a point of archery. Frodo PATHSed to exhaust him and took a wound and Boromir with Blade and Brand slaughtered him for fierce. I took it slow and stopped, knowing that the game was now within my control.<br />
<br />
He stuck a Sword on Frodo before moving to King&#39;s Room. With 8 twilight to work on, I only got out 2 Uruks, one which got massacred by Eomer and the other which failed to overwhelm Frodo. He actually considered moving again, with Treebeard up for skirmishing at 8T but decided against it.<br />
Another hand-check revealed just Trackers, no Enquea or Grima. Brilliantly realising that the next site would most definitely be Wizard&#39;s Vale, I peed a little more into the pool, playing Sam, Proper Poet and Gwemegil and something else before moving, giving him exactly 10 (10! 10!) twilight at Wizard&#39;s Vale to duck under the text. He spent it all on Ugluk and that 6-twilight Tracker. Boromir took a wound against 12-strength Ugluk while Aragorn with 13 strength beat the Tracker. For fierce, Aragorn killed the Tracker, bringing Ugluk down to 9-strength, which was ample for 10-strength Boromir to take care of with Damage +1.<br />
With no twilight left in the pool, I moved again triumphantly to Orthanc Balcony, with 6 companions including Proper Poet, and excluding Thrarin. After realising that he only had 9 pool to work on, he acknowledged that it was over and shook my hand.<br />
<br />
FW +3/+9<br />
Props:<br />
-He didn&#39;t draw any of his 2 Saruman&#39;s Power.<br />
-Taking 4 twilight away from every site by 4T.<br />
-Shadow did well again.<br />
-Finally a win by running.<br />
-Giving 10 twilight at Wizard&#39;s Vale<br />
<br />
Slops:<br />
-Uruk Spear?<br />
-Broad-bladed Sword?<br />
With just 7 people after Kelvin left, and more people needing to leave, we ended it at 3 rounds.<br />
<br />
Results<br />
1st: Me, +9<br />
