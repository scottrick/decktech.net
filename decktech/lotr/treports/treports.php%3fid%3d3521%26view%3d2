<br>
My friend Lan had always been purposing to build a Snow-Bomb deck ever since he pulled Fool of a Took in a booster (Alex Tennet hadn&#39;t posted it yet) and realised it was feasible when he read Tennet&#39;s success story. He tried it on me in Apprentice. I laughed my head off as I thrashed it and told him, &quot;Give me 1 day and lend me your Moria rares. I&#39;ll show you.&quot;<br>
<br>
I enclosed myself in a desolate cave in a desert, cut off from the outside world and the very next day emerged with a Snow-Bomb. The Snows part was shamelessly copied from Tennet (copyrights?) but the deck featured a much more efficient and thorough card-draw engine, near-indestructible fellowship (I am the master of building indestructible fellowships) and a more complete shadow half (he would later tailor it to counter Albert Dreary and Secret Sentinels). I, King Finrod Felagund, built him Minas Tirith on Tol Sirion but deep in the dungeons of it, I was backstabbed by Beren, my guts taken and eaten by him for survival. I have fallen to the treachery of a friend, and succumbed to my oath.<br>
<br>
Enough crap, you&#39;ll understand later the sacrifice I made. You will praise me, you fools. You will lament my death, and regret it forever. It was the first MoM-legal tournament, and I entered with my MoM-updated The Men and the Short Men which has been undefeated since 16 February (hands up all you fools who rated it 4-stars and below, you will feel my wrath and feel its power if you ever get to play it). Lan entered with his, uh...I mean *somebody*&#39;s Snow-Bomb deck. He entered too in the last tournament but received the greatest screwjob known to man and unfairly got 2-2.<br>
<br>
And no, not posting my decklist here. Nobody&#39;s gonna replicate the tough SOB known as my deck, heh ;) Seriously now, not wanting anybody I know to read this and rip my deck to shreds when they realise how the great mind of Finrod works. I&#39;ll just say I played a Boromir, LoG/Merry FtS start with rangers and hobbits and the cute little teddy-Uruks for shadow.<br>
<br>
Went to the tournament with just 2 cents in my wallet but emerged with $16 after some trades. Woohoo.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 1</b><br>
vs Loh Mun Kit, Ranger-Elf-Gandalf/Nazgul Tip-Breath<br>
Arwen R/Sam, Son of Hamfast start<br>
<br>
&quot;But Felagund heard his tale in wonder and disquiet; and he knew that the oath he had sworn was come upon him for his death.&quot;<br>
<br>
Kit groaned when he was paired against me. He&#39;s a good player but unfortunately, he&#39;s never won me before, in fact losing all his sanctioned tournament matches to me :X Lan was jumping for joy though. Kit&#39;s deck was really the only competent and effective anti-Snowbomb deck around (gave my friend countless headaches) and if I won him like, uh, I&#39;m so used to (sorry if you&#39;re reading this :P) and relegate him to the FL group, I can prevent him from being paired against Lan. By the way, Kit is renowned for playing 4 ARVs and 4 PATHS.<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 3, he goes first and starts the Pony and pulls Aragorn. He gets the Map out and puts out Breeland Forest. I play 2 Uruks and he accumulates 4 wounds. He backs off. My turn and I too pull Aragorn and play Sting (love that card, check out the look on your opponent&#39;s face when you tailor your card-plays and leave him just *1* twilight short of dropping everything). I saw 2 Bill Fernys and got a heart attack (I never noticed it was unique :P) and Kit was puzzled, but I moved anyhow and I finally see the dot on Ferny. Hmm...<br>
<br>
Due to Ferny and Nelya chasing me and him able to switch Council Courtyard back to Ford of Bruinen after I used Thror&#39;s Map, with Boromir Breathed and Tipped, I stopped.<br>
<br>
He is forced to stop at the sanctuary due to his wounds.<br>
<br>
Due to the TD saying that Ranger&#39;s Sword can be played on Flaming Brand but Flaming Brand could not be played on Ranger&#39;s Sword (which he found out to be untrue after the tournament), I was forced to keep Ranger&#39;s Sword in hand on Turn 1 (grrr) but I draw Flaming Brand on my turn. Aragorn turns into Nazgul-screwjob and after checking he has no funk like All Blades Perish and Beauty is Fading, I pass by the Courtyard...and skip it, Aragorn showing his prowess.<br>
<br>
His turn, he moves to Hollin (and conveniently forgets to change the site with Thror&#39;s Map) and I drop 1 or 2 minions, with Wizard Storm, daring him to overtake me. I achieve the desired effect and on my turn, move to 5 and 6, chopping up every Nazgul which came out. He realises he&#39;s lagging behind and risks the double-move, losing Arwen, Gandalf and Sam in the process.<br>
<br>
I take it slow and stop at 7. Had 2 Wizard Storms in hand and decided to discard 1 and in doing so, totally forgot about Albert Dreary. He gets to Site 8 (his patented ARV-PATHS) but on my turn, ARV at Site 8 with archery and at Site 9, 2 Nazgul was too little to chop past 5 companions, of which one bore the weapons of the Nazgul Middle-Finger.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+3<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Hehe, won Kit again<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
Poor Kit. He deserves to win me once.<br>
<br>
&quot;But when the wolf came for Beren, Felagund put forth all his power, and burst his bonds; and he wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with his hand and teeth...&quot;<br>
<br>
There is uproar elsewhere. The national champion (with a rating of around 1700) had just lost to Fang Wei, a near-newbie (whose deck had been walloped twice over by everybody present, and me blindfolded). Fang Wei would go on an UNBELIEVABLE amazing streak, going 3-0, before saying that he had to go home to watch CARTOONS. ARGH?!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Game 2</b><br>
vs Adrian Goh<br>
Funky Hobbits/Moria Swarm<br>
Sam, Son of Hamfast start<br>
<br>
I bid 1, he bids 7 (crikey!) and makes me go first. Pull Aragorn, play some stuff, and move to Buckleberry Ferry, giving him 10 twilight. He plays a Goblin Armory and passes, leaving me in a dilemna...if I double-moved, 14 twilight was more than enough for a Moria Swarm and I did not have any Stealths/Intuitions/PATHS and Frodo was naked. I don&#39;t take the bait and pass. His turn and he drops his full fellowship hand (ARGH!!!).<br>
<br>
Talking about his fellowship, I was rather surprised at his strategy. He used Hobbit Farmer to turn Site 1 to Green Hill Country (-1 Twilight Cost to every Hobbit) and spotted its text with Farmer and played a barrage of hobbits (4 Bounders, 4 Party Guests, 4 Farmers, Filibert Bolger, Gaffer, Farmer Maggot, Bilbo, Pippin, Merry etc) all for free and later set up a Silinde/Frodo&#39;s Bedroom combo to draw for the hobbits. This was undoubtedly a complement to strengthen his Moria swarm. Nice deck idea which I was rather impressed with.<br>
<br>
Wasn&#39;t pleased with his shuffle though. At one point, he had 3 Scavengers together, and he always drew the Troll and his Hammer together, and at one point, he was playing a hobbit, drawing a card, playing the card he drew which was a hobbit, and repeating the process for TEN BLOODY TIMES (i.e. 10 hobbits shuffled together)<br>
<br>
Back to the game, he was behind me and taking it 1 site a turn (and doing a pretty good job of choking my hand) and I stay with him. As with all Moria decks, the fun came in Site 5. Stealthed the first but Pippin wasn&#39;t stealthy enough for the fierce skirmish. I had Armor out on the 1st turn too which allowed me to neutralise Troll.<br>
<br>
I got out of underground first and moved to Site 6. He plays 4 minions (3 STR 10) to fight my 4 companions and for the first time, I&#39;m getting worried for my fellowship. No Bow out yet and Merry is biting it. Merry got overwhelmed. In a very nice play, I assigned wounded Boromir + Blade to Scavenger + Scimitar and was about to exert Boro to kill him when I realised he could discard armory THEN resolve the skirmish to kill me. So I just took a normal wound. Smirk, I&#39;m good. Frodo bails himself from death with a Hobbit Stealth getting him to 6 STR. But his Swarms were finally out and the Scavengers went there.<br>
<br>
He is in even greater trouble though. Gives me quite some twilight and moves to Site 6, where Lurtz and random Uruk proceed to kill off 3 Hobbits, leaving Frodo alone alive.<br>
<br>
I played Sam, Hobbit Sword, Bow and Sting and removed the twilight with Sting and moved to Anduin Wilderland (and I finally got my Bow out? This sucks) and he unleashes a *huge* swarm (the hobbit card-draw was helping tremendously), complete with Nelya. I assign ARVed Nelya to Frodo 6 STR, and I think he knew what was coming. He did pile on a few 1-vitality minions on Frodo though and when I PATHSed, Nelya died but he sacked 2 Armories to keep 13 STR on Frodo. Saw that coming. Played a Stealth for 8-13 (saved the PATHS, it would eventually save me the game). He left Aragorn and Boromir alone, opting to kill Sam off. Now I am REALLY worried. This is the closest my fellowship has gone to extinction. I know all too well that the 3 companions on the table are all I have and there are no more to play from my draw deck and against Moria, that&#39;s asking for it.<br>
<br>
He moves and Frodo takes a couple of wounds. He stops at Site 7, leaving me to move to 8. Another huge swarm comes out but in the process of doing it, he loses his draw deck and his hand. We both know that if I survive this turn, I can win, even though I cannot immediately go to Site 9 due to Shores&#39; text and more than 8 Orcs he threw at me. I use the Bow to shoot and he prevents 2 with Armories, leaving an exhausted Aragorn and 1 less minion. I divert the Keyward (3-vitality, wink-wink) away and everybody else piles up on Frodo. He was praying that I had no PATHS in hand...sorry dude, game over.<br>
<br>
The dust settled and Boromir and Frodo were still alive. He concedes however, deciding that his Frodo couldn&#39;t run to Site 9 and his shadow was useless now, as he had no draw deck nor hand. Wouldn&#39;t concede so easily if it were me, he had 4 Bounders (though the Uruks&#39; Damage +1 would have piled on the burdens on Isildur&#39;s Bane) and I only had 2 minions in hand (which I hoped to cycle for more if he moved to 9 of course). Ah well, if he has no fighting spirit, so be it.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+6<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
Nice Fellowship combo<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
My fellowship&#39;s never been slaughtered like that<br>
He conceded<br>
<br>
<br>
Lan is also 2-0 and we were speculating about our chances of meeting each other. We both know that the Snow-Bomb is an auto-win against my deck (&#39;cause I built it, HAH!). The ideal scenario of course would be we meet in the final and he get 1st and I get 2nd. Then Frankie the TD came and said that he&#39;ll pair us together. I said, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you.&quot; He laughs and replies that he was just kidding as he stuck his arm into the bag of names and withdrew 2 random tournament slips. David vs Lan. GO TO HELL FRANKIE!!!<br>
<br>
<b>Game 3</b><br>
vs Lan Yihong<br>
Indestructible-Fellowship/Snow-Bomb<br>
Gimli, Dwarf of Erebor/Legolas R start<br>
<br>
&quot;...yet he himself was wounded to the death.&quot; - Continuation of previous quote<br>
<br>
I am a sorry sight as Lan laughs his head off. I could have just conceded. The game turns out even more screwed than I planned, because he purposely outbid me for the Green Dragon Inn. I didn&#39;t mind. I had 3 Aragorns in the deck, but I would later mind when after the game, I realised they were spread nicely in the bottom 10 cards of my draw deck. Know what that means? Yep, Runners+Scimitar were regularly kicking my a$$. My only hope was to run fast, way before he set up any sort of engine, and my Saruman&#39;s Power destroying ALL FOUR of his Shoulder to Shoulder at Site 4 or 5 was helping but it was pathetic. I couldn&#39;t double-move simply because Runner+Scimitar could hit Boromir over the head and overwhelm all my hobbits. ARGH!<br>
<br>
I monkey around a lot in the game, in no mood to play at all. My antics included sleeping during his fellowship phase and taking a lot of shaking to wake up, encouraging somebody who requested a trade with my friend to keep bargaining, and when I looked at his hand every turn via Sting, he would receive the cards back and after a while, exclaim &quot;Why do I only have 6 cards in hand? Where&#39;s my Snows?&quot; (the finger is quicker than the eye, brother). I watched in despair as my potential 4-0 disappeared further and further into the abyss, and shot dirty looks at Frankie whenever he walked by.<br>
<br>
The bomb detonates at Site 7 and I wished for divine help, hoping he would forget to stick some minions on Sam like what happened in the last tourny, but failure is the key to success. He made no mistake.<br>
<br>
Frodo gets killed and the ring passes to Sam. Sam gets killed and I stick the ring on Merry. &quot;FRIEND TO SAM! FRIEND TO SAM DUDE! If Sam dies, only one can bear the ring. Only Merry will have the willpower and fortitude to bear such a burden, and only if his master has really fallen!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;The wind wails, the wolf howls. The ravens flee, The ice mutters in the mouths of the Sea. The captives sad in Angband mourn. Thunder rumbles, the fires burn -- and Finrod fell before the throne.&quot;<br>
<br>
FL +1/+7<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
At least it was fun(ny)<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
My 4-0 record, my 8 booster packs, my rare foil all go up in smoke<br>
&quot;Hey David, that was the easiest match I&#39;ve had in a long time.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was killed by what I created. I am Frankenstein. I am a nuked Einstein. I am Finrod Felagund, killed in the tower he built. Yes, I have unleashed an evil power into the world.<br>
<br>
There were 4 people who were 3-0 at that time, Lan, Aik Seng and 2 suckers (one was Fang Wei, the other Amos, both suckers got 1-3 in the last tournament). With Fang Wei leaving and Lan being paired up with Aik Seng, Amos had to play a 2-1. The implications were clear. The 2-1, if he won, would get 3rd. If I played a fellow 2-1, I was out of the top 4. The name is announced...Adrian Goh. UGH! I HATE THIS TOURNY ENOUGH!<br>
<br>
<b>Game 4</b><br>
vs Aaron Wong<br>
Ranger-Elf-Gandalf/Isengard Beatdown<br>
Arwen R/Legolas R start<br>
<br>
In a bad mood by now, and he sees my terrible face. &quot;Yeah sonny, I&#39;m gonna take out all my anger on you and make this whole trip worthile,&quot; it was saying. He bids 2 to my 1 and makes me go first. &quot;Wow I&#39;m scared,&quot; it said.<br>
<br>
Pull Aragorn, grab Sting and find out he&#39;s playing Uruks. Whoa, Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry, Saruman&#39;s Ambition...7/8 of his hand was black... I play Armor on Boromir. Dig that? I move to Trollshaw and he plays a loser who fails to do anything to Boromir. I move again with 2 Stealths in my hand. <br>
<br>
His turn and he plays Gwemegil, Gandalf&#39;s Cart and some other forgettable stuff and moves. I kept a poker face. Played 2 Uruks. One was gunned down and the other scarred Arwen (think somebody can&#39;t heal her...tsk tsk tsk). Then he stops, I pick Pony up and meaningfully put it back into my adventure deck. Yep, he saw it, and he let loose some four-word expletives which I won&#39;t repeat here. Sorry, might have reminded him if I was in a good mood, but trust me, I was murderous.<br>
<br>
Predicted rightly he was playing Hollin and Boromir getshimmer by Orthanc. I stop, having already built a 2-site advantage.<br>
<br>
For the whole game, I proceed to seriously choke his hand, always giving him 1 twilight short of getting what he needed out (you know the feeling) and maintaining it at around 6/8 shadow. And he futilely held onto the Battle Cry, hoping to catch me, but it never happened. On his side, he was in trouble. The choke meant he wasn&#39;t drawing into companions. He fortunately had Gandalf&#39;s Cart to stack 2 Bows and 2 Ranger&#39;s Swords and a couple of Armors but he still went into Site 5 with just Frodo, Arwen and Legolas. Legolas didn&#39;t make it. On his next turn, Arwen died in her mother&#39;s homeland.<br>
<br>
My fellowship was snailing along without any hurry, waiting for him. He finally drew into something at Site 6, playing Boromir, Pippin and some goodies from the Cart, including Armor and Blade. He moves to Wilderland and I use that generous helping of twilight to drop Lurtz, Troop of Uruk-Hai and Uruk Fighter. 3 companions against 3 minions. Frodo...get your a$$ here.<br>
<br>
FW +3/+10<br>
<br>
Props:<br>
None<br>
<br>
Slops:<br>
His great mistake. His hand would not be so badly choked with Aragorn out (not to mention he would have shuffled his deck, heh) and though I saw traces of Sleep, Caradhras, the fact that I never saw Gandhi justified how unlucky he was.<br>
<br>
Lan wins Aik Seng. Adrian wins Amos and gets 3rd, which is pretty screwed since I beat him, yet finished out of the top 4. <br>
<br>
Standings:<br>
1st: Lan - 12<br>
2nd: Aik Seng - 10<br>
3rd: Adrian Goh - 10<br>
4th: Amos Khoo - 10<br>
<br>
Sigh, luck is never with me. Got 2 boosters. Note that I have not pulled a foil in 30 boosters and I have never pulled a rare foil in my life out of almost 100 boosters. Got Beauty is Fading and Greatest Kingdom of My People. Sigh. Lan got 8 boosters and sold 2 to Leck Koon, a friend. Koon opened them up, Witch-King, Lord of Angmar and Relics of Moria foil, the other pack, O Elbereth and Goblin Man foil (Quote: &quot;You may be the champion but I AM THE WINNER!&quot;). Screwjobs galore. And yeah, I bullied Lan into giving him all the foils he later opened (we had agreed that if he won, he would share, hah) which turned out to be a single Nertëa foil, leaving him with Sting, Fool of a Took (ironic, he was using Snow-Bomb), Ancient Chieftain, Balrog&#39;s Sword, His Terrible Servants and something crap. Poor guy.<br>
<br>
I am a victim of my creation.<br>
<br>
I have destroyed myself with what I have created.<br>
<br>
I am a Fool of a Took.<br>
<br>
&quot;Thus, King Finrod Felagund, fairest and most beloved of the house of Finwë, redeemed his oath; but Beren mourned beside him in despair.&quot;<br>
<br>
I feel better?<br>
