<br>
	Made the short trek out to Time Warp (the coolest gaming store in the area) at around 3ish and met up w/ Doug Faust there.  Bartered for a few uncommons I needed to finish out my nazgul deck, bought some sleeves to protect my deck, and some beads to play with.  There&#39;s a good number of players there even half an hour before the start of the tournament but no tournament director as our favorite Rider of Rohan, Andy Parks, manages to get caught in traffic resulting from no less than 3 accidents.  He does manage to make it though, and we clear space for the 12 participants.  A nice turnout considering I know of atleast 6 players who wanted to attend but were unable due to various reasons.  The &quot;Decipher&#39;s Special Guests&quot; were announced, myself and Doug, having both qualified for Worlds in SW this year.  We get underway a little before 5 PM.<br>
<br>
Decks: I have 2 decks built, the 1st is a gigantic Hobbit/Moria deck that is quite strong, but it&#39;s more of a multi-player deck as playing w/ 90+ cards can lead to some very interesting (read: bad) opening hands.  So instead I resorted to the boring Ranger/Elf fellowship w/ a Nazgul minion side.  Started Arwen and Legolas Greenleaf (borrowed from Doug, thanks go out to him).  Hoped to pull Aragorn w/ the Pony, played 2 stinky Gandalf, 1 Wizard is Never Late, and matching weapons for all my companions (including 2 of each of Aragorn&#39;s weapons).  Events were mainly Defiance, Versatility, 2 Sleeps, and the +2 ranger one.  The nazgul deck had a bunch of nazgul (including 4 Nelya in hopes of going 2nd and using his text to pull my Pony out), 4 Swords, 4 Drawn To It&#39;s Power, 4 Threshold of Shadow.  Basically a nazgul corruption strategy.<br>
<br>
1st game: vs. Karen<br>
<br>
I bid 1 (like I do in all of the games), she bids 3 and makes me go 1st.  She starts Boromir and Merry.  So, I burden to get Aragorn, and move easily hiney he appears to have little minion cards in hand.  She goes and adds a 4th burden to get Aragorn and gives him some armor so my +1 damage nazgul swords aren&#39;t quite that effective anymore.  I do however manage to fetch out an Enquea who wounds Aragorn heavily (3 wounds).  Later Toldea comes out w/ a Nazgul swords and picks his companion to skirmish.  2 companions die and soon there are 8 burdens.  Another Enquea hits the table, Aragorn is down to only 1 wound hiney he was playing pipeweed to heal her guys, but 3 exerts from Enquea and Aragorn hits the lost pile.  Soon thereafter Boromir bites it as well and Frodo turns evil at like site 5!  She never seemed to draw many minions so my fellowship basically walked to site #6.<br>
<br>
2nd game: vs. John (maybe his name was John)<br>
<br>
Another game where he bids high, however he chooses to go 1st.  I&#39;m denied my Pony as I don&#39;t get an early Nelya (maybe 74 cards is too many?).  I do however manage to get 2 Drawn To It&#39;s Powers out.  We move down the site path, me keeping a step behind to keep my sites coming out.  He moves from site 6 to site 7 w/ Aragorn, Boromir, Frodo, Gimli and Pippin I think.  I get out 2 Nazgul (including Enquea), he feeds Pippin to 1 of them, then sends Gimli up when my nazgul come back for more but a Threshold of Shadow means an overwhelmed Gimili and now there are 7 burdens on Frodo!  He pushes to site #8 w/ 1 wound on Aragorn, clearly a mistake w/ Enquea sitting there but he does it anyway.  I drop 1 more nazgul and it&#39;s just Boromir and Frodo against them all!  Boromir bites it, meaning 9 burdens, but Frodo lives thanks to help from bounder in the fierce skirmish.  I stop at site 7, leaving it to my minions to give me the win.  He moves to my site 9, Summit of Amon Hen, I draw 9 cards, come down w/ 2 Morgul Skulkers and a fierce Nazgul.  It&#39;s my power 22 to his Frodo and that&#39;s game.<br>
<br>
3rd game: vs. Bill (ya never know, his name coulda been Bill)<br>
<br>
He bids pretty high again, apparently afraid of me starting the pony.  However he starts w/ just Aragorn, so after I explain to him the pony wouldn&#39;t be bad, as it would let him start w/ 2 companions and just fetch his Aragorn.  Anyway, his fellowship is rather weak and thoroughly slowed down by all my nazgul.  Conversely I get out Aragorn reasonably early and w/ the strength of 2 archers I manage to take a lead this game.  Site 4 I get met by Lurtz and another Uruk though, so I exert to kill Lurtz, and then move on to site #5.  I lose both Arwen and Gandalf at site 5 and next turn I limp into the sanctuary.  He however is having similiar trouble w/ my Nazgul, and I get to heal at site 6.  He draws few minions at site 7 or 8 so I get there relatively uninjured.  When I head to site 9 he can only muster 2 Uruks, and Aragorn and Legolas deal w/ them w/out much trouble.  I get the site 9 win.<br>
<br>
4th game: vs. Doug Faust<br>
<br>
Doug knows my deck (we played an online game the other night where I overwhelmed Aragorn and Gandalf w/ the same nazgul in 1 turn) and I know his deck (he was playing a different deck but I&#39;d seen him play this one).  He knows how bad burdens are against my deck so he bids 0, while I bid 1 and make him go 1st.  He starts Lego and Arwen and burdens to pull Aragorn (just like I do).  He moves to site 2 and I get a nazgul out and he stops.  I move easily to site #2 and stupidly stop so I can get my ford out next.  This keeps me behind in the race, as he makes it through Moria, only losing Arwen.  I make it through Moria a step behind, taking most of my wounds from Orc Bowmen and Under the Watching Eye (he had out 3 Bowmen and 1 UTWE I think) but my archery keeps his Bowmen from doing too much damage.  Only character I lose all game was Gandalf, when I chose to exert him only to have his big Sauron dude exert 3 times to play 3 hates and kill Gandalf before I could find a Sleep Caradhras.  We both stop at site 7, but when I stop I draw mostly fellowship cards.  So he moves to 8 and faces 1 nazgul, who gets quickly dealt w/ through Versatility and archery, I draw more cards, more fellowship.  I don&#39;t manage to get near enough out at site 9 despite plenty of pool cause my minions are hiding from me.  He gets a pretty easy site 9 win, was close though, my fellowship was well setup to run to site 9 the very next turn.<br>
<br>
So, I end the day w/ 6 cans, each worth 2 packs, for 12 packs for me!  However the store never get their boxes from Decipher, so they decide to give out gift certificates to all the players because they don&#39;t have enough packs to cover it all.  Not a big deal for me as it&#39;s close by, but kinda stinks for people who might not be coming back to the store too soon (now they kinda have to! :).  Anyway, I get 2nd over some other guy who went 3-1 cause I had the better &quot;strength of schedule&quot; cause I played Doug who went 4-0 and he didn&#39;t.  I wanted the final duel like it said there would be on the website but apparently all the tournaments said that so I had to settle for getting my revenge later.  We help Andy out to his car as he carries his big hiney box of cans and we carry the rest of his crap.  Stop off at the local Burger King as we&#39;re all starving cause it&#39;s now like 9 PM and we haven&#39;t eaten dinner.  Then we make our way back to Andy&#39;s place for some multi-player action.<br>
<br>
1st game I switch to my Hobbits/Moria deck, Doug sticks w/ his Elves+Rangers/Sauron deck while Andy goes for Elves+Allies/Nazgul.  I get a stinky draw, w/ 2 Bounders and no other support cards, and I&#39;m met by a fierce nazgul at site 2 so it&#39;s dinner time.  He eats Pippin and a Bounder but that&#39;s okay.  I get my Moria swarm going, and Doug getshimer pretty hard early w/ Nazgul/Moria combo.  He gets slowed down, meanwhile his Orc Bowmen hit the table.  Andy is in the lead, me a little behind, while Doug trails.  Andy moves to site 7, and pushes on to site 8 as he knows I&#39;m playing Shores of Nen Hithoel and will drop 5 orcs to stop him there.  Doug and I hit him pretty hard there w/ his big bad Sauron dude, some Hate, and Bowmen while I drop the Orc swarm.  Andy is in a bad situation, he&#39;s got the rare ring so Frodo takes much of the archery damage and is up to 9 burdens, meanwhile everyone else bites it.  Doug is struggling into site 6, while I go to 7 and stop.  He drops Gandalf and Sleeps away all our conditions (Bowmen, UTWE, They Are Coming, Armory, etc.).  He hopes we&#39;ve got bad hands and can sneak the win but it doesn&#39;t matter, hiney ite 9 is mine, and it&#39;s the Summit of Amon Hen.  Doug and I both draw 9 cards, I get another They Are Coming and I have 17 cards.  I drop a ton of stuff, and despite Rumil killing like 3 orcs it&#39;s not enough, I swarm him out.  Next turn Doug is struggling pretty bad and I drop 3 more orcs and it&#39;s game.<br>
<br>
2nd game I go back to my Elves+Ranger/Nazgul, Andy goes to his Gondor/Troll deck and Doug switches his minion half to Saruman&#39;s minions.  I win the bid and choose 2nd, Andy gets next pick and he&#39;s 1st, Doug goes last.  Andy gets a free walk to site 3 as both Doug and I draw 7 fellowship cards in our opening hand.  My turn I drop Aragorn w/ the Pony, then Sting on Frodo and exert to look at Andy&#39;s hand and remove 4 pool!  Then I drop Elrond (draw a few cards), and Gandalf, only to exert Frodo twice more and remove another 8 pool, so I move after spending 14 twilight and there&#39;s 2 pool in there :).  Sting is good.  Andy drops orcs on me, but I&#39;ve got archery to deal w/ them and I cruise into site #3.  Meanwhile Doug getshimer w/ nazgul and he pushes on to site 3 only to end up losing 2 guys to more nazgul.  Basically it&#39;s the same deal as last game, Andy pushes out into the lead, while I trail slightly and Doug limps along.  Andy makes it pretty far, Doug&#39;s minions aren&#39;t doing that much damage to Andy and I never get pool to play with, however Doug gets some damage through at site 7 and Andy is pretty wounded at site 8..  I move on to site #7 as well and I&#39;m pretty well setup to run to site 9 the next turn.  I try to ditch cards to draw as much as I can and I manage to pull up a Relentless Charge as Legolas and Aragorn are both exhausted.  Aragorn gets healed once, and the Sage so he&#39;s okay, but Andy drops a 5th guy and pushes on to site 9 giving us about 20 pool.  Doug drops a bunch of Saruman effects and 2 big Uruks (both fierce) while I drop 2 fierce Nazgul.  Relentless kills Legolas while he&#39;s down to Gandalf, Boromir, Aragorn and Frodo.  Gandalf gets killed off by an Uruk as Doug makes him damage +3 w/ 2 battle cries, Aragorn is overwhelmed as he&#39;s defender +1, and a Bounder saves Frodo from a nazgul.  However they all come back, and Boromir and Frodo are both killed.  I&#39;m well ahead of Doug, so I just walk to site 8 and then site 9 as Doug can&#39;t muster enough to stop me.<br>
