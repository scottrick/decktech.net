This is my first CCG ever played, so this whole deck building and strategy thing is very new to me.  So with the help oeasterlingood (and exp&#39;d CCG player) friend, this is what I have.  Please be honest in your reviews, as I am still trying to get the hang of this crazy game!<br />
<br />
NOTE: This deck was built pre-Realms, although I have recently added both the rare and common Saruman. I do realize tho that some of the cards from Realms can mess with my strategy (ie Old Noakes) so maybe working in a couple of &quot;Memory of Many Things&quot; or Tower Assassins could be a possibility...?<br />
<br />
OK...this is the first deck I&#39;ve had that&#39;s actually held its own in many games.  Even tho my primary strategy is to force the opponent to discard with both my Fellowship AND Shadow (for an increased effect) AND deny them shadow, I&#39;ve found the Fellowship to be plenty strong enough to survive the race.  <br />
<br />
It&#39;s preferable to go second, but no need to stack burdens to do so.  I&#39;ve been playing mostly against Sauron and those burdening conditions can really add up, so I usually bid 0 or 2. <br />
<br />
*If I know my opponent is playing the Pony, I&#39;ll start with either Arwen or Legolas, then pull Aragorn.  If not, then Aragorn is the man. <br />
<br />
Every companion except Greenleaf can be healed by Aragorn.  Basically every fellowship card in here can be used immediately, thus reducing the amount of &quot;stale&quot; cards in hand.  There are enough elves to give Aragorn and Boromir that extra boost.  Boromir LoG is tough to overwhelm, esp with a Last Alliance on him.  I&#39;ve faced the Big Baddies (Balrog, Fluffy, Witch King but not all at once...yet!) and survived quite well.  I have 2 Galadriels so if I don&#39;t get the Mirror on her, I can still exert her to play my elves for free (Hi Elrond!), heal her with maybe another copy and Celeborn, and whaddya know...more free elves!  There are 2 Gwemegil&#39;s and 2 Arwen&#39;s but I usually discard the first Gwemegil I get (if I exert to get my site 2, I have to discard a card or more, so having an extra copy of something I cannot use immediately helps here b/c the way the deck has been playing I haven&#39;t been getting Arwen much before I get to Moria.)<br />
<br />
Ok, so here&#39;s the real kicker...why Asfaloth?  Useless you say? Put in something better?  Possibly....BUT, this idea occurred to me as I was driving to a tournament.  I originally was using The Horn of Boromir, but found it to be useless unless I had Boromir, and with only 1 copy of Boromir, the Horn didn&#39;t seem worth it.  So instead, I swapped it for something I found to be a little more useful...Asfaloth.  I could play Asfaloth almost ANY time, as opposed as to waiting for Boromir to show up...(one can never count on the guy, eh?)  I almost always have an elf or two out within the first couple of turns.  So, since there&#39;s only 1 Asfaloth, why put it on Arwen when I have to discard him when I go thru Moria?  Why not put him on Galadriel (site 6 ally AND elf, or Celeborn) and give Arwen an extra boost when coming out of Moria? Then, at site 6, transfer Asfaloth onto Arwen (for FREE!) provided she&#39;s in play. If no Arwen by now, heck, Galadriel can fight now if needed...site 6 makes her +3, +1 for Mirror, and +2 for Asfaloth!  Or do the same with Celeborn.  Either way you can have a pretty pumped ally when coming out of Moria, making that double move thru Moria a better possibility, but not a necessity.  No need to risk double or triple moving with this deck, but if your Fellowship is relatively established, why not?   There are no pumps in this deck, I just use weapons, so my hand isn&#39;t cluttered with pumps I can&#39;t use yet. Any extra copies of cards are good for pumping Arwen using Gwemegil&#39;s text if needed, and Elrond is there for card drawing....a nice feature, but not a necessity.  The deck cycles pretty well.  Once I get the new Elrond, in he goes!  Ok, if the Asfaloth thing doesn&#39;t work out, I could put in another No Stranger To The Shadows, but then again my hand might get cluttered with them if I don&#39;t have Arwen or Boromir out yet.  Sting is there for shadow removal, and plays for free, so Frodo SHOULDN&#39;T have to fight.  As for Curse Their Foul Feet, 2 for the price of 1...reveal your opponents hand AND discard cards at the same time! BUT....be careful...if you plan to use the Mirror AND Curse Their Foul Feet in the same turn, DON&#39;T discard an orc.  The more orcs your opponent has in hand, the more cards they will have to discard, and possibly end up discarding an orc or 2 anyway!  Secret Sentinels and The Seen and Unseen are for condition removal, and boy they can sure pile on!<br />
<br />
So, now for the shadow.  Pretty straight forward...Ragers, Inquisitors, and Lieutenants all discard, and they are pretty big for a relatively low cost, so chances of winning and discarding are pretty good.  I&#39;ve discarded the Balrog 3 games in a row!  If the discarding thing isn&#39;t doing well, then mess with your opponent&#39;s assignments with Saruman,(both versions are great for that!) and the Uruk Guards.  I like to have Saruman out at site 9 and bring out those trackers!  Either way, with Saruman in play, you can expect the opponent to take some wounds!  Saruman&#39;s Power is good for removing those pesky Fellowship conditions (ie Fearing the Worst, making my trackers cost more!)  The trackers are there for playing Under The Watching Eye, and for swarm potential at site 9!  <br />
<br />
Well, there you have it. I haven&#39;t played any tournaments with this deck yet, just friendly games against a small variety of decks. It could be weak against archery and swarms tho, not sure...I&#39;m hoping the shadow denial would be enough to keep the swarms at bay.  Any ideas, suggestions, or comments are welcome, as this is hopefully a good chance for me to improve my deck building strategy.  Thanks to those who read this far!<br />
<br />
Thanks Steve for all your help and input!  <br />
