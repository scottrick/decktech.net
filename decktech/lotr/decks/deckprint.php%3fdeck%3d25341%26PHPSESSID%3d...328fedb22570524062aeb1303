The Strategy behind the fellowship is pretty darn simple... play what you can... keep the little guys alive... and have fun.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The Shadow is Nazgul w/ some Halloween Moria to help with getting through your deck.  They are Coming gets nazgul out of your hand against choke decks and helps you get runners when you need that 1 twilight.  It also works well with a fellowship with hard to play doubles (3 Stings, 2 Talents, etc.)<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br><br />
Free Peoples:<br />
<br><br />
Rosie: hey... my companions have it tough as it is... having +1 strength on Sam is something I&#39;ll take anywhere I can get it.<br />
<br><br />
Deft in their Movements: Double moving is very plausible with this deck.<br />
<br><br />
Frying Pan: This deck is in trouble against a good swarm, might as well add some protection.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Shadow<br />
<br><br />
Nazgul Events: Nazgul all have such great events... but no obvious ones like Savagery to Match Their Numbers, Hate or Enduring Evil.  Basically for the events in this deck I use 2 Morgul Gates because they always help, 1 Such a Little Thing because it either kills Boromir or does a very Nazgul action (discarding possessions)... Then I decide between 2 of Relentless Charge, Too Great and Terrible and Fear... basically depends what you think you&#39;ll play.  Fear is probably useless in the most games, as archers are much more popular than allies, and Too Great and Terrible will win alot of games by itself<br />
<br><br />
Cave Troll: He&#39;s big... fits the deck well... with Hammer is the best minion in the game...<br />
<br><br />
Ferny: Because he&#39;s always useful... rarely too expensive... fun to use, and more than anything... annoying for your opponent<br />
<br><br />
Scrabblers: Condition removal!  Last Alliance is probably the most underestimated card there is.  Oh yeah... and the Tale of Gil Galad is pretty good too.<br />
<br><br />
Wreathed in Shadow: I am suprised this card is not more popular...<br />
<br><br />
One extra Attea: Most cost effective Nazgul... might as well have one extra... Cantea or the King would be my replacements if I were to choose again.<br />
<br><br />
Another possible change is a Toldea out for a Cantea or Witch King because Toldea&#39;s ability might not be that useful to you... and when it&#39;s not that useful, he&#39;s just not that good... <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Thanks for your reviews!  I don&#39;t think this deck will win you tournaments, but who cares... I am taking it my next one anyways... just to say I did!  :)<br />
