It is currently 9-1 with it&#39;s only loss being the previous version(on my page) and it lost because I never drew Aragorn or Legolas. That situation has since been rectified by adding another Aragorn. Here is how the deck plays:<br />
<br />
Bid 5, you shouldn&#39;t need to bid more, but if you see a patern of people bidding hig to make you go first, bid low and make them feel stupid. Usually, 5 burdens is safe since it takes you out of Nazgul danger on turn one when Sam is pulled, exhausted and then lives to site 3, where you heal him twice and take off 2 more. You should usually move one site at a time, unless you are holding lots of Gandalf cards that will let the arrows fly. This deck will take a while to get fully set up, but once it does absolutely NOTHING can stop it. Your Free Peoples side is designed to be unkillable, and once it has its equipment, it is! You have the possibility for 10 aimed archery a turn, which is usually more than enough against any deck. Since your fellowship is fairly small(4 after Sam gets eaten) there won&#39;t be a whole lot that they can afford that will get by. Moria and Uruks are you worry. You have PATHS for Moria, and Albert Dreary for Uruks so that their Spies won&#39;t be working as often.<br />
Against nazgul, merely equip Aragorn w/ the 2 Brands and burn some Nazgul.<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is simply the best Moria deck I have ever seen, built or used. It is a tweaked version of my decks original Shadow, which concentrated more on numbers than damage. I ran into some problems with big fellowships, mainly that unless I was able to get considerably more Minions out than they had Companions, I would not do any damage. To fix this problem, I eliminated Wallcrawlers and some of the They Are Comings in favor of Moria Axes, another Troll and his Hammers. This seems to help me actually inflict damage on my opponent&#39;s Free Peoples. A Keyward with a Moria Axe is nothing to Balk at, not to mention Flankers with one. Basically, this Shadow deck works well with my Free Peoples because my Free Peoples makes them either double move or die and the Shadow says if they double move, they die. <br />
<br />
Enjoy the deck, hope you like it. If you have any questions d-mail me or e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com I would love to talk about it. The next deck will be posted sometime this week, featuring my new favorite card: Hobbit Swordplay!!!!!!<br />
