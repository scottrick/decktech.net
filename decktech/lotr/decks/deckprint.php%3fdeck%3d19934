I design all of my decks for single or multiplayer formats, and I am a firm believer that you need a larger deck in multiplayer.<br />
<br />
For a single player game I take out the following 10 cards and only play with a 70 card deck.<br />
Relentless Charge<br />
The Witch-king<br />
Ulaire Cantea<br />
Ulaire Enquea<br />
Ulaire Nertea<br />
Valiant Man of the West<br />
Swordarm of the White Tower<br />
Farmer Maggot<br />
Bilbo<br />
Hobbit Sword<br />
<br />
In 1-on-1, bid high and win the opening turn.  Use Bag End to pull The Gaffer.  This gets your healing circle in place.  Exert Sam twice to remove 2 burdens, then heal Sam once.  Pippen will have removed one of your burdens at the begining.  So you can basically bid 3 burdens higher than you are comfortable wearing.<br />
<br />
With any luck you will get a couple of Nazgul in your opening hand.  Move just once and then let them pass you, so you can put down the Ford of Brunien.<br />
<br />
Note: In multi-player, don&#39;t worry about the Gaffer.  Bid enough to try and be 2nd.  You want your sites 2 and 3 out.<br />
<br />
You can keep their Hobbits exerted with The Nine Servants of Sauron.  Try to get a blade tip on the Ring-bearer.  At the least get a Black Breath on him and Sam (if you see him).  Between the Ringwraith&#39;s Wake and these, you should be able to load him up with burdens. Drawn to its Power can also help here.  You WILL be killing plenty of companions with all of these fierce Nazgul.<br />
The Ford is key.  You can take someone out at the Ford, even if they have a tiny fellowship, because you are going to get usually at least 2 Nazgul out.  Most Free Peoples are equipped to handle 2 fierce Nazgul by site 3.  They have to build their characters up, so this is your chance to pounce.  Biggest concern is Gandalf making Caradhras sleepy...this is why there are 3 copies of Blade Tip and Black Breath.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples objective is to load everyone up and survive.  <br />
<br />
Why these fellowship companions?<br />
Arwen....she&#39;s awesome<br />
Legolas...choosing a minion to kill is awesome.<br />
Aragorn....with his bow, he&#39;s the same as Legolas, and you can make him defender +1<br />
Gandalf....Sleep Caradhras, sleep...sleep, sleep<br />
not the rare Merry....he is buff with a sword<br />
The rare Ring?....I don&#39;t put it on unless forced to, so I like having the extra vitality<br />
<br />
Try not to skirmish with the ringbearer until he is with Sting and a tale, or you get one of the Power...Stature cards.  Then he is pretty competitive by himself.<br />
The bounders will keep you alive, and that&#39;s the only goal.  If you get all of your allies out, you can pretty much heal at will all of your hobbits.  The rest can heal at sanctuaries.<br />
<br />
I have played this deck in several games of each multiplayer and 1-on-1.  I haven&#39;t lost with it yet.  Some have been close, but 3-4 Nazgul coming out when an opponent gets to site 9 is too much to handle. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
