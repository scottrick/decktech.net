Going first is not a necessity with this deck.  For the amount of burdens your minions can add, you should be able to stop your opponent before he beats you to site 9.  Plus, going second will give your Mountain Homestead some purpose.  So bid 0 so as not to add too many burdens.  There&#39;s a big enough burden on the fellowship because there are no burden removals for dwarves.  So, I generally use the Ring of Fury for Gimli to help bolster his damage bonus thus his resistance.  Proud and Able will help with this as well.  And Linnar with help if you are holding too many dwarven cards.  You may want to save the Ring of Retribution for Durin III so he can face a dmg+1 minion twice if necessary.  Plus, the Battle to the Last will be more effective with more wounds. <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
For your minions, a little more involved.  The Bound to its Fates have the two-fold effect of eliminating Freeps events or adding burdens.  Use your Isengard Underlings to get these events back and hopefully get to use them more than four times.  Mocking Goblins with scimitars will be tough to defeat, so they&#39;ll do the same thing as Bound will.  If you can keep your Miscreants alive, they&#39;re handy at burden adding. Hill Orc and Cutthroats become powerful as the burdens pile on.  And the Troll is just a big nasty I like to keep around!  I once corrupted a Frodo by site 5 with these minions.  Quite effective!<br />
<br />
I&#39;m definitely open to ideas on burden removal (Gandalf is an obvious option, but I&#39;d like to keep the mono-culture theme going).   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
