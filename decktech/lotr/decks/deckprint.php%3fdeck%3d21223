The start with Sam let you bet at least 5 burden with no considerable danger involved. It let you remove 3 burden. Sometimes I even bid 8, and kill my frodo at the first oportunity, so I have 0 burden. Sam is a great ring bearer you know. Dont underestimate him. <br>
<br>
Most archery deck have 1 weakneses, once the opponent manage to go throught the archery phase they do considerable damage to the fellowship, sometimes knocking off some key character. Now this deck use 4 companion, 7 stealth, and 1 allie. So it dosent matter if they manage to go throught the archery phase you have so much character to suck the damage. <br>
<br>
Right now the most broken card is without doubt a Ranger s Versatility. No deck can be viable without it. This card let you abuse the archery fire. So for you the hardest location to go is 4 and 5. Thats why you have multiple companion and Stealth to cancel fight.The ally Tharin act like a stealth from location 2 to 9. He is great. Then later at location 6 you should have 1 of your 2 thror s Map (stactisticaly). Now that card is really handy as it let you play your own site. From 6 to 9 you have only forest / river. And that card call A Ranger s Versatility let you go so easily to site 9. It exaust 2 minion of your choice at any river or forest if you can spot a ranger. Then legolas and Agarorn use their bow to kill them. Just one arrown and that cave Troll is History <br>
<br>
Now, The sauron deck revolve around doing the most damage. As soon as you have your card, play them... dont wait to have 3 hate to play them, just do the most damage possible. The goal is for them to be force to stop at sanctuary to heal the massive damage... so if you have trouble with the fellowship you can heal at site 6, and take it more slowly. Cause they will always be force to stop there to heal. Remember if you have your 4 Orc Bowman and 2 Under the Watching Eye its a easy 6 damage every turn... And that dosent count the damage your Minion do. You might notice that i use alot of the same card 4 time. Well those card are key. I dont like the luck factor, and this remove it a little. Thats also the reason why there is no fancy combo... Just brutal Strenght... Look at every card in this shadow deck. All those card are made to do at least 1 point of damage. <br>
<br>
You might notice that there is the Nazgul Ulaire Enquea in there. He is there to punish your opponent if he has too much burden or companion. I could be optimistic and tell you that the goal of the sauron deck is to kill everybody, but no, it will not always happen. This is why the Fellowship is optimized so much to be the fastest, dont rely on killing your opponent, it will not always happen. Use the fellowship wisely and Run ! Win the race ! By himself this deck is brutal. Anyone can use it. But anyways, good luck if you use it. <br>
