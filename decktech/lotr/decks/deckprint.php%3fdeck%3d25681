They&#8217;re the last free people on middle-earth, and they need to breed. The minions are all female look-alikes, or drag-minions. Happily for you, I&#8217;ve prepared a little story.<br>
<br>
Frodo: Hey Sam! We&#8217;re the last males on middle-earth! And we have these 10 beautiful females!<br>
Sam: Yeah. Unfortunately, we have to watch out for those evil minions. Let&#8217;s escape to one of the safe and relaxing resorts: Tol Brandir, Wastes of Emyn Muil, Emyn Muil, Slopes of Amon Hen, or Summit of Amon Hen.<br>
Frodo: Yeah. Luckily, we can steal supplies from Lothlorien and Rivendell on our way. It&#8217;s a shame they were swarmed and killed.<br>
Arwen: C&#8217;mon you short little fools! Let&#8217;s go and find the rest of our travellers. Eowyn and I are ready to go!<br>
Eowyn: We have to make Rivendell by dusk. Let&#8217;s move swiftly, but silently!<br>
Sam: Hey! There&#8217;s Rosie Cotton. Ow. My leg hurts. <br>
Rosie stabs herself<br>
Sam: I&#8217;m healed! Thanks Rosie<br>
Rosie: No Problem. (in very much pain)<br>
Eowyn: We&#8217;re at Weatherhills! Let&#8217;s move!<br>
Enter Ulaire Attea, the Easterling<br>
Rosie dies.<br>
Arwen: I have very much defiance. Die, Attea!<br>
Enter Melilot Brandybuck.<br>
Frodo accidentally slips on the ring.<br>
Melilot: NO!!!<br>
Melilot drinks some toxic fluid.<br>
Frodo: Thanks. What a small burden I have now.<br>
Eowyn: We made it to Rivendell Waterfall.<br>
Arwen: Let&#8217;s keep moving!<br>
The group makes it to Hollin. Lorien Elf appears and comes along with them. <br>
Enter Lurtz. <br>
Without thinking, Melilot pushes Lorien Elf into Lurtz and everyone runs.<br>
Arwen: I&#8217;m glad we found this nice hiding place. Let&#8217;s rest.<br>
The next day.<br>
Sam: Hey! Look! It&#8217;s three Lorien Elves!<br>
The group walks over the Bridge.<br>
Enter Balrog, Flame of Udun and Goblin Runner.<br>
Arwen Kills the runner, and Frodo pushes the two lorien elves into the balrog, and everyone runs.<br>
The group makes it to Lothlorien.<br>
Enter Galadriel and Uruviel.<br>
Eowyn: We&#8217;re making great progress! Awww&#8230; CRAP!!! There&#8217;s a Tower Assassin!<br>
Melilot dies. Galadriel sings a song with her horrible voice of Nimrodel and they escape due to the monster being scared of ppl being off-tune.<br>
They rest for a day, and then move to Anduin Wilderland.<br>
Galadriel: Look! Demons!<br>
Enter Moria Archer Troop, Archer Commander, and a Cave Troll.<br>
Everyone pushes a Lorien Elf into the group and run. The demon&#8217;s bows get swept away by a tidal wave. Massive amounts of Goblin Runners appear. Only Eowyn, Uruviel, Arwen, Frodo, and Sam survive.<br>
Uruviel: We luckily made it to Anduin Banks!<br>
Two Arrows come out of nowhere and seriously hurt Arwen.<br>
Enter Isengard Smith.<br>
Eowyn: Arwen, you&#8217;re almost dead, so die!<br>
Eowyn pushes Arwen into the smith and everyone once again dies.<br>
The small group makes it to Slopes of Amon Hen.<br>
Sam taking Eowyn aside:<br>
Sam: Will you marry me?<br>
Eowyn: Well&#8230; I guess&#8230; You ARE more of a man than Frodo&#8230;<br>
All of a sudden, a huge Troop of Uruk-hai comes in.<br>
Frodo: Sam, please sacrifice yourself for me!!!<br>
Sam: Master Frodo, I made a vow; a vow to marry Eowyn&#8230;<br>
Sam shoves Frodo into the troop. The 3 remaining people run, only to find a MAD Orthanc Berserker, with a big, hafling, purple face. Uruviel escapes. The rest do not.<br>
Uruviel sits on a rock and starts crying. When out of the bushes, comes an Uruk Soldier&#8230;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Uruk Soldier (in a very rough voice): You&#8217;re so cute. Will you go out with me?<br>
Uruviel: Awww&#8230; So you and I are meant to be? I&#8217;m so happy! <br>
10 years later, they have 18 beautiful Urkings. And by the Supreme Uruk court, Uruviel had her name changed to Urukiel. Thanks for reading.<br>
