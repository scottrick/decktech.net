<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The new card, Sudden Fury is a 2 cost condition that says when a Hobbit loses a skirmish, add a token here and then you can remove a token to make a Hobbit +1 strength.<br />
<br /><br />
An important strategy is the use of Pippin and Make Haste. Make Haste returns an unbound hobbit, preferably Pippin to your hand so the opponent has to discard a minion if he can&#39;t use 2 twilight to prevent it. Play Pip at the next side to remove a wound or burden.<br />
<br /><br />
Here is the catch- Sudden Fury is non-unique and without the benefit of mass condition removal, this card can really get out of hand quickly.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The idea is to let the opponent go first so you can hopefully play your forest and dwelling sites which work with Farmer Maggot and some of your pump cards and also with Cantea and Echo of Hooves on the shadow side. Get out a Sudden Fury or 2 early and watch the tokens build up. Ideally, at site 7 or 8 you will have a couple of these loaded with tokens and can easily move to 9 with no worries. If site 9 is The Cavern Entrance, then you are probably in trouble but the deck does feature some huge late game pumps like Chance Observation and +1 for every forest or dwelling site you spot which late game, means there will be about 6 or 7 on the board. A Promise and weapons make Frodo very big anyway, he is a hard little bugger to kill.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The shadow is straight forward Nazgul beats and corruption. Against any alternate ring bearers, go all out for the corrupt. Against this gay 12 resistance Frodo with the horrible +2 resistance ring, go for the beatdowns. The shadow has good condition removal and can be very sneaky.<br />
<br />
The minion count is low, I admit, but typically, all you will need is one minion per site and the support cards. Anymore minions you can play is a bonus. The Angle helps tremendously against big fellowships and Morgul Squealer is HUGE at the right time, don&#39;t waste him.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
This is an online version of this deck so if I had 4 of everything, I would play 1-2 more Between Nazgul of Prey and another Witch King but I am forced to play with what I have.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Rosie is in the deck for Sam only, obviously. She sucks as a companion but it is what I have to use. :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
It&#39;s a very fun and competetive deck so far. Give it a whirl.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
