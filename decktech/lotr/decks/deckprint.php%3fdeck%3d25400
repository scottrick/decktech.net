I decided to test that theory.<br>
<br>
This deck tries to win primarily through corrupting an opponent&#39;s ring-bearer. The shadow side is focused solely on that, and the free peoples side is focused solely on setting up the shadow side and surviving. It may be better to instead have a strong fellowship, so you can win with the free peoples as a plan B, but there are two reasons I did it this way: 1) it&#39;s better for you if your opponent moves slowly (more time to corrupt them), so why pressure them to move? 2) I can&#39;t build a strong fellowship to save my life! Seriously, while other people were laying down smack with Masticores, I was playing a Thallid deck. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here&#39;s the free peoples&#39; strategy. Bid zero. If you go second, the Streets and Ford may allow turns 1 and 2 burdens. If you go first, you can fetch the Cart to cycle through your deck. Move *only once a turn* so your sites get played and you give the opponent fewer chances to reconcile. Gandalf and Elrond get cards, and you should be able to play every other card as soon as you get it. Play only so that you have no free peoples&#39; cards at the end of your turn, and you don&#39;t die. For bonus points, pretend you are a newbie with a pipeweed deck while you save 3 Must Do Without Hope for the Bridge.<br>
<br>
The shadow strategy is simple too. Discard like it&#39;s going out of style in turns 1-3 to get Must Do Without Hope, play them at site 5. Play It Wants to be Found whenever you can, and recycle it with Morgul Skulkers. This is the best burden card because there&#39;s really nothing an opponent can do about it, except discarding your Nazgul as their first Maneuver action (Last I checked, "What Are They?" wasn&#39;t seeing much play). Play Gleaming in the Snow if you can, the Sauron minions (except the Skulker) are chosen to be able to live to the regroup phase with vitality left over.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s the sites strats:<br>
[1] Shire Lookout Point:<br>
If you go first, fetch your Cart. Remember that you can put a Cart inside a Cart! Recursive Carts!<br>
<br>
[2] Bree Streets:<br>
Twilight Nazgul don&#39;t roam here.<br>
<br>
[3] Ford of Bruinen:<br>
Free Ringwraiths!<br>
<br>
[4] Eregion Hills:<br>
Free burden!<br>
<br>
[5] The Bridge of Khazad-dûm:<br>
Balrog time... Must Do Without Archery Phase. Oh, and Hope too.<br>
<br>
[6] Valley of the Silverlode:<br>
I can never pick a good site 6, y&#39;know?<br>
<br>
[7] Anduin Wilderland<br>
No archery, sure why not?<br>
<br>
[8] Shores of Nen Hithoel<br>
Here for the 9 Twilight - so you can play some minions and leave twilight for the burden-adders.<br>
<br>
[9] Summit of Amon Hen<br>
This is the game winner: You may draw the rest of your deck here, there&#39;s got to be another It Wants To Be Found in there somewhere!<br>
<br>
So far, this deck has worked well for me. Obviously it would have problems against an early Narya or a Shire Countryside deck... but for each of those you play, there&#39;ll probably be another deck that likes to bid 6 or 7, and that&#39;s game. Sam is probably the biggest threat, but there&#39;s Helpless for him.<br>
<br>
Have fun trying this... who knows, maybe at the next big con Phial of Galadriel will be tech. Okay, probably not, but it&#39;s fun to play unconventional decks. Feedback is welcome!<br>
