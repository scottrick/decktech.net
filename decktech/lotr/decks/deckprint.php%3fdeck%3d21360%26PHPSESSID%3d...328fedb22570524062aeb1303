The key to this deck is to go first.  Bid enough burdens to go first, usually around five.  Pull out Sam, get them burdens off, and along you go.  If you have the cards to, try to get to site 3 first turn.  If not, no worries.  This deck mainly focuses on the Shadow to kill your opponent, but can also reach site 9.  Now, for the Shadow, listen up.  It is best to attack your opponent when you know that a) they have no archery, b) you can defend against it, or c) you have many uruk-hai to beat them down with.  Many people like to attack the fellowship on site 2 when you have a lot of pool.  I suggest that unless you know you can kill a companion, just let them keep movin.  There&#39;s no point to waste minions when the next site is a sanctuary.  My advice is to soften them up at site 4 and let them waste their archery, then hammer em on your home site.  Also, if you do feel the need to throw down on site 2, be sure to use Wariness.  This card has ended so many games its not funny.   Key sites to pay attention to are sites 5, 7, and 9.  Site 9 is very nasty, letting you make all of your minions fierce.  This is a great site to use with the Uruk Shamans and Lurtz.  The shamans will heal your guys who exerted and Lurtz, well, is just a wrecking crew in himself.  Here are the key cards to look at:<br />
<br />
Wariness: cancels stealth events.  VERY useful<br />
<br />
Troop of Uruk-hai: the best uruk-hai there are.  makes weapon bonuses useless and can put the hurt on people when fierce.  <br />
<br />
Spies of Saruman: no archery whenever you feel like it.  such a great card.<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power: better than sleep, carahdras and cheaper too.  gets rid of all conditions.<br />
<br />
Worry: gives the ring bearer burdens or he exerts for you winning, which will happen many times.<br />
<br />
There you have it.  Also, Bred for Battle I feel is a good card and if you wish to add it, feel free.  This deck is very solid and just rocks in multiplayer.  Give it a try and I know it will grow on you like it has me.  Thanks a bunch. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
