Plus I really wanted to know if anybody had any suggestions for this deck. Here is the strategy for it.<br />
<br />
Snows makes where your guys fight there guys with whats on the board. Troop of Uruk-hai is a must in this deck, rarely loosing the fight. I will explain why I play 4 Orthancs in a second. The Messanger is good for 2 things. First off, he goes large under snows. Second, he is great for swarming them at site 9 where everybody is -1 to deploy. The Warrior is just an all around good card, and the Goblin Runner is to make sure you have enough twilight for everything you need. Spies of Saruman is for getting around A Ranger&#39;s Versatility decks (Spies is actually one of the few counters to that card, making it extra happy), and the archery pahse in general. Uruk-hai Rampage is one of the most important cards in the deck. That card alone makes Orthanc Assassin better than Lurtz in this deck. Because of the Assassins 10 power, he will beat most companions in a straight up fight under snows, and if you have a rampage out and the choice between playing a warrior or messanger or making the Assassin fierce (the ability on Rampage says Response, so it can be used under snows), always go with making the Assassin fierce unless they only have 1 companion other than Frodo. Usually you play Messangers and Warriors early for getting the Rampages onto the table. Once you get that you can just play a Troop a turn, make it fierce, and go about beating them down. A fierce Troop is almost always better than playing 2 guys for 8 as well. The rule I use for Snows is to not play it until site 5, so you can afford to make them pay for it. The best Free Peoples deck to use in combination with this deck would be one that is slow, but resilient, allowing them to get to the later sites first so your Uruk-hai and Snows can kill them. The deck has done pretty well for me so far, and it is quite fun. The only problem I&#39;m having is deciding on the Messangers. Sometimes there great, other times they are terrible. Let me know what you think.<br />

Thanks for looking,<br />
