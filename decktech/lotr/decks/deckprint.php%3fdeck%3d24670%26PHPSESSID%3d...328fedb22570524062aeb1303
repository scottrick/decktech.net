<br />
A Nazgul Discard Deck?  That&#39;s right... I read an article some time ago that challenged someone to build a deck around Gleaming in the Snow... so I tried... and I think you&#39;ll agree that the deck doesn&#39;t revolve around that one card, but it is a small piece to a big puzzle.<br />
<br />
First the Fellowship... you&#39;ve seen something like it before... the Elven Discard deck... only we have some Gandalf Cards... wtf?  <br />
<br />
The Reason Gandalf is in this deck along with Trust Me As You Once Did is because I believe the major weakness of the Elven D/C deck is any Minion that gets through the trials, is going to overwhelm whoever you got out there (eg. that Cave Troll/Witch King you must have missed with the Mirror... oh crap!) ... I try to remedy this with Gandalf and TMAYOD... With 4 Gandalf Signets in the deck, no one in your party except Merry should get overwhelmed, and with shoulder to shoulder, you shouldn&#39;t really care about wounds, because you can heal almost unlimited wounds every turn.<br />
<br />
Now for the Shadow... like I said... The Gleaming in the Snow/It Wants to Be Found/Get off the Road discard deck... how does it work?<br />
<br />
Add Burdens with Gleaming in the Snow/It Wants to be Found, and then spot those burdens to do evil things... like what? Well, Enduring Evil is always nice, Enquea&#39;s ability too, Toldea can win games with his special ability, and most importantly Get Off the Road... okay so it&#39;s not a nazgul card, but it still makes this a nazgul discard deck doesn&#39;t it :)<br />
<br />
Anyways...<br />
<br />
Early Game:<br />
Bid Relatively High (3-5), that way either you start first and pull Aragorn or they outbid you and pull Sam... in this case try not to play your burden cards until they have sacrificed Sam... or try and kill Sam somehow because he is the bane of this shadow side.  Stop at site 2 if your hand has an excess of Nazgul, hoping they will double move into the Ford (you can get them to do this by just playing a Sauron orc, and making them think you just play Sauron)<br />
<br />
Midgame:<br />
Hopefully by now you have Gandalf... so worry not about a common Balrog destroying you, or about a swarm destroying you.  Use the mirror twice a turn! It&#39;s only the best card in the game when used...  Ally hate will not hurt you too much because you can spread the wounds around, but look out for the Sauron Galadriel Killer... Dump Events as you get them if you can so you don&#39;t get clogged with them, but save Enduring Evils for the &quot;right&quot; time, i.e. when you want to overwhelm an important companion like Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf, Frodo, or even Boromir.<br />
<br />
Late Game:<br />
If you haven&#39;t decked your opponent by site 7, then you are probably in trouble... this deck still has the capacity to triple move through minions, but it is going to be a risk... Your shadow side is not going to win the game for you, so make sure by site 6 or 7 you have at least kept up with your opponent if not ahead of him.  If their deck is dwindling and you have yet to draw Gift of Boats, start Mirroring once a turn with Galadriel and using Celeborn to facilitate more Elrond draws...<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
Fellowship:<br />
Deep in Thought over Sentinals: with gandalf in this deck it is a much better choice: 1) spots Gandalf rather than exerting an elf ally 2) removes ALL shadow conditions and 3) spotting 4 twilight in the maneuver phase with a shoulder to shoulder healing circle is about as easy as getting indigestion from a double quarter pounder...  <br />
<br />
No Stealth/Intuition/PATHS:  I don&#39;t need swarm protection very bad with the Gandalf/Trust me as you once did combo, the super fellowship (9 companions), and condition removal... swarms are the least of my worries.  A Swarms deck will also be easily decked by site 6 making this a much easier win.<br />
<br />
Boromir: Lord of Gondor is definately the best Boromir, but I wanted another Gandalf Signet in the deck.<br />
<br />
Narya over Gandalf&#39;s Staff: Costs 0 and gives me some condition removal, whereas I am not worried about Gandalf getting overwhelmed and don&#39;t use that many spells so Narya seems the better choice.  If I were to add one more card it would be Gandalf&#39;s Staff though.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
My choices for the Sauron orcs:  All High Vitality so they&#39;ll last to exert for Gleaming in the Snow... They are all pretty tough to beat in skirmishes, and once your opponent sees 1 enduring evil, they are not going to want to assign any of these guys anywhere...<br />
<br />
only 2 enduring evils:  Do you think this deck could use more?  I am not sure... trade off between adding burdens and using them... adding one more would be up to you.<br />
<br />
Our List of Allies Grows Thin/The Ring Draws Them:  No Secret... Nazgul and Sauron need twilight to function... these two cards should add anywhere from 5-10 a turn... think of it this way... if they play a deck like this they have from 4-7 allies out by site 4, and they have 4-6 burdens... that&#39;s another 2 nazgul you can play if you have both condition out.  That is MASSIVE!  This deck is not reliant upon this though, so don&#39;t worry too much about sleeps/sentinals<br />
<br />
Ulaire Otsea:  okay... this guy does suck, much more than the Witch King in twilight... but he&#39;s cheap, and he fits the bill for It Wants to be found... I can get 2 of him out for the price of the Witch King... That sold me...<br />
<br />
Ulaire Nertea:  Need a Sauron orc for Get off the Road?  Need Enquea to kill off a couple exhausted companions?  Need Toldea to overwhelm a couple companions?  Attea to kill off an exhausted Galadriel/Elrond? This guy is awesome, because his special ability comes into play so often, and it is such a great ability...<br />
<br />
