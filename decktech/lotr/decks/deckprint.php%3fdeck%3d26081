This deck basically looks to deny your oppenent enough twilight to do anything to you, while still being able to put up a decent fight. As for the shadow, its your almost-extinct moria to throw off those other mini-fellowship decks.<br />
<br />
As for your starting bids, just go for the nice bid of 0, maybe 1 if you suspect they wont bid anything. Go first if you can, but going second doesn&#39;t really have much effect on this deck. if you go first, obviously you should exert frodo to get out your site 2, otherwise, it should already be out. if you dont think you can make it to site 4 on the first turn, and you didnt draw a gandalf&#39;s wisdom, try to keep the number of possession you play on the low side, then play them at site 3 where you will get to remove 2 (assuming you went second and your site 3 is out, otherwise, just play it by ear). but generally, the movement is 1-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-9.<br />
<br />
for the shadow, hold what you can in your hand early on, yet try to get down a cave troll at site 4 if you can, to make them think twice about double moving to site 6. all you need is six twilight at site 4 in order to bust out the runner/troll combo, and if you have an armory or two out, play a scimitar in hopes of snagging a hammer, another minion, or just to add a few twilight to further prevent their double moving. after site 6, just play it as it comes, and try to work up an effective swarm on them, but that doesnt always work with archery/frying pans/paths.<br />
<br />
now for card choices...<br />
<br />
rAragorn- defender +1 can save the day at site 8 or 9. gandalf&#39;s wisdom often works better than HttWC&#39;s text anyway.<br />
<br />
Ara&#39;s gear- its free with wisdom, and it just makes him so beefy that the puny nazgul or uruk they throw at you will be no problem.<br />
<br />
athelas- heals wounds, gets rid of black breath/blade tip, its all good!<br />
<br />
gondor&#39;s vengance- perhaps my favorite FOTR common, just because its so handy.<br />
<br />
swordarm- its always fun to have aragorn take on 3 guys, then have him win.<br />
<br />
dagger strike- works for frodo and aragorn, so its versatility can help in a pinch.<br />
<br />
O Elbereth!- helps vs overwhelming, and against those pesky nazgul.<br />
<br />
might of numenor- i dont know why, but i always get lucky with this card.<br />
<br />
old noakes- helps fight back against that random sauron deck.<br />
<br />
gandalf&#39;s wisdom- whats that? the toy store is having a sale? im there!<br />
<br />
and the shadow is pretty self explanatory, so i think ill spare you the pain of reading card choices for that.<br />
<br />
well, thats it, thanks for taking the time to read this deck, and any helpful advice will be accepted!<br />
