The Free People side merges Gondor twilight denial with Gandalf’s condition removal ability and Trust me / Servant of the Secret Fire skirmish capabilities. The Moria shadow side enables fast cycling of cards, helping the fellowship set up faster and at the same time takes advantage of the choke and goes for the kill.<br />
<br />
Gandalf – based decks have two big strengths. One is that with the help of Trust Me and Servants of the Secret Fire Frodo can participate in skirmishes and survive them. The other one, even more important is that Gandalf has a strong condition removal (and a possession removal, too), which makes a Gandalf based deck virtually invincible against Moria or Sauron. Majority of Gandalf decks out there have a major flaw, that they usually give away too much twilight, which can make them vulnerable against a Shadow side that needs a substantial twilight pool to function (Dunland, Nazgul, and especially all variants of the Uruk-hai, including the Uruk-hai archers). This impedes the complementary shadow, since the opponent is able to use all his shadow cards on his shadow turn and thus more easily cycle his cards and prepare his fellowship. So, it is imperative to implement some kind of twilight denial in a Gandalf based deck.<br />
Gondor based decks’ major ability is twilight denial. It causes the opponent’s hand to be clogged with shadow cards (unless he plays with Moria). However, Gondor has no condition removal whatsoever and it is a certainty that it will fall to Moria and in majority of the cases against the Uruk archery and Sauron (but it takes a while against them, so the shadow has a chance of destroying the opponent’s fellowship before that happens). So, it is imperative to produce some kind of condition removal in a Gondor twilight denial deck.<br />
Enter the Gandalf (Trust Me) - Gondor (Twilight) fellowship with Moria as a shadow side. This deck is universal: it has twilight denial (Aragorn HTTWC, No Strangers, Bill the Pony, Betrayal of Isengard) it deals maneuver and archery damage (Betrayal of Isengard, Defend it and Hope, Aragorn’s Bow), the companions, including Frodo can fight in skirmishes (Servant of the Secret Fire, Trust me as You Once Did), and there is an effective possession and condition removal (Roll of Thunder – Deep in Thought combo).<br />
Game tactics:<br />
I bid 4 and choose to go first. I start Boromir, DoMT and Pippin. I start Boromir because he has a Gandalf signet. Pippin is in the starting fellowship so that Gandalf and Aragorn (if played from hand) come into play for two twilight tokens, thus denying the twilight from the beginning. Although I have 4 copies of Aragorn in my deck, I play the Riddermark. That prevents my hand from clogging, if I don’t pull neither Gandalf nor Aragorn, and that is the peril because I have a lot of Gandalf and Aragorn based cards in my deck. Besides, that gives me a choice which Aragorn to play. If I saw that the opponent has a large deck, which means that he plays Moria, I would play Ranger of the North. Otherwise, I go with the Heir to the White City. I want to get one of my four copies of Gandalf, or one of my four copies of Aragorn in my opening hand, or at least three free people’s cards I can play (preferably No Strangers and Bill so I can start choking early), or at least one of my four copies of They Are Coming, which would enable me to get Gandalf fast. If I get none of the above (e.g. if I get six minions and 2 Servants of the Secret Fire), I will mulligan. It is my tactics to kill Pippin at the 2nd site, especially if the opponent plays the Uruk-hai. Only in the case of the opponent playing an indirect damage deck such as Sauron or Uruk archery I will keep Pippin alive as he is an ideal pin cushion thanks to his high vitality. The deck removes burdens via Frodo’s game text by playing Faramir and Sam, and also by Sam’s game text. Thus at least five burdens can be removed, so I have no fear of corruption. I almost always stop at the site two, because it takes a while for a Gandalf deck to prepare and if the opponent outruns me, there is a high probability that he will arrive at the Cavern Entrance &#61514;. I run to the site three only if the opponent plays Gandalf/Moria (or if I had amazing luck to pull everything I need at the site one), because these decks can devastate my shadow side with their powerful condition removal cards, which the opponent will surely get because the twilight denial doesn’t choke Moria. I move to the site three and stop at the sanctuary. The following movement sequence depends on the opponent’s fellowship and shadow.<br />
If an opponent plays anything other than Moria, I single move, trying to choke the opponent and run if the opportunity presents itself. If he plays Moria, I try to run, but not blindly, just trying to stay ahead of the opponent. If the opponent manages to outrun me, he will certainly have a hard time with my shadow, especially at the site seven. If I arrive at the sanctuary at the site 6 first, it is almost a certain victory for me, as my fellowship is usually well equipped for the last run from 7-9.<br />
Usual sequence of moves:<br />
Against the Uruk-hai: 1-2-3-4-5-6-8-9.<br />
Against Sauron: 1-2-3-5-6-7-9. (I may move 3-4-6 or opt to single move and thus choke)<br />
Against Moria: 1-2-3-4-6-7-9 (I may run more if the opponent plays Gandalf fellowship, or less if the opponent plays the fellowship with no condition removal abilities).<br />
Against the Nazgul: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-9<br />
Against Dunland: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-9 (possibly double move 4-6)<br />
<br />
Breakdown of the particular cards and their contribution to the strategy:<br />
Twilight denial cards – Aragorn HTTWC, No stranger to the Shadows, Bill the Pony, Pippin, Betrayal of Isengard, all are useful against almost every shadow. Only Moria is immune to choke (with Betrayal hurting it the most).<br />
Indirect damage cards – Betrayal of Isengard (deals with Saruman), Defend it and Hope, Aragorn’s Bow. All three are a must against the Uruk-hai, Dunland and Moria.<br />
Skirmish strength boosting cards – Trust Me as You Once Did, Servant of the Secret Fire<br />
Possession removal – Roll of Thunder (also provides 3 tokens for Gandalf to spot and for Deep in Thought), useful against the Nazgul, Dunland and Uruk-hai (Trackers especially)<br />
Condition removal – Deep in Thought, must be used against Moria, Sauron and Uruk archery, should be discarded against others<br />
Gandalf Signet Companions – Gandalf, Boromir, Frodo. All must be kept alive.<br />
Ring bound companions – common Faramir and Sam. For removing burdens. Faramir can also fight (Uruk-hai, Nazgul, Dunland and Easterlings hate him)<br />
Ally – Barliman Butterbur. He will return what is needed from the discard pile, whether it is Roll of Thunder, Deep in Thought or Servant of the Secret Fire. <br />
The rest of the cards are normal strength enhancing possessions or artifacts for the companions.<br />

FAQ<br />
Q: Why use The White Wizard, and not the Friend of the Shirefolk? A: Because he has the Gandalf signet.<br />
Q: Why use The White Wizard, and not the Grey Wizard? A: Because all the companions with the Gandalf signet except Gandalf are in the starting fellowship. Besides, Roll of thunder can make him strong.<br />
Q: How can you spot 4 twilight tokens needed for Deep in Thought? A: The shadow player only needs to leave one. I add 3 via Roll of Thunder. Sometimes I use two Rolls of Thunder (one fetched by Barliman).<br />
Q: Why do you give so much twilight to the pool during the maneuver phase in a twilight denial deck? A: Because I won’t move during the regroup phase, unless it’s against Moria or Sauron, who have just been destroyed by the condition removal.<br />
Q: What if an opponent plays Saruman’s Power? A: There are three copies of No Stranger, two copies of Betrayal and three copies of Trust me. Besides, there are enough other anti-Uruk cards helping the fellowship’s survival. And the opponent will almost never manage to draw two Saruman’s Powers because of the choke.<br />
Q: Why do you play a lot of plains sites? A: Because I don’t want to play Battleground sites that help the Uruk-hai. Very few people play the Nazgul, and I can take out Black Steeds with Roll of Thunder. <br />
Q: Why Wizard’s Vale when you play choke? A: I usually give nine on Wizard’s vale. Other sites explicitly help other shadow cultures.<br />
Q: Where is your Frodo protection (PATHS)? A: Sting, Trust me and Servants are enough. Defend it and Hope and/or Aragorn’s Bow and the timely condition removal help Frodo survive the Cavern Entrance.<br />
Q: How do you deal with Uruk Archery or Sauron? A: Twilight denial, Multiple copies of Gandalf and Aragorn to heal themselves, Boromir DoMT heals himself, condition removal <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
As far as shadow is concerned, Gondor decks are dominant in the current playing environment. The obvious choice for the shadow against Gondor is Moria. The choice is made easy by the fact that almost no Gandalf decks are played. Moria provides the best hand cycling, enabling the fellowship to set up faster than any other shadow, despite of a large deck. The crucial card for that ability is They are Coming (also essential for setting up the swarm), and that’s why I have four of them in my deck. Moria is a shadow that kills. It can easily use the advantage that the fellowship side of my deck provides i.e. the opponent has trouble cycling cards and setting up the fellowship, making it harder for him to draw the much needed Frodo protection and condition removal, which in turn makes Frodo an easy target. It works very well, since 70% of the games I won with this deck were kills. There are a few metagame induced changes with respect to the standard Moria deck. There are no expensive Cave Trolls. There are three Goblin Wallcrawlers in the deck, which I put in as a response to the domination of the Gondor choke-archery decks (and most of the decks played today have at least some archery). There is no Ulaire Enquea in the deck. Instead there are two copies of Ulaire Nertea, and the play testing has shown that it was more than enough, even against the nine companion fellowships that included Eomer bearing Firefoot, Aragorn ROTN and Sam. Grima, Chief Counselor is here to deal with the rainbow fellowships, particularly having Gandalf in mind.<br />
<br />
I constantly make some minor changes to the deck to respond to the shifts in the metagame. The deck has so far performed extraordinarily in the casual and tournament play. About 70% of the games I win by killing the opponent’s Ringbearer and the remaining 30% by surviving at the site Nine. My tournament record with this deck so far (after 3 tournaments) is 15-0, which included games against two top 100 world ranked players and some international players. I must add that playing with this deck is both fun and challenge for me, especially thanks to my Moria shadow with its twilight pool and discard pile manipulation. Also playing the Trust me deck is always a challenge because it’s all about making the right decisions. <br />
