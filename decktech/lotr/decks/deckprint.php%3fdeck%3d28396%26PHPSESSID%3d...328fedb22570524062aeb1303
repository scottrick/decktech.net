It was in Two Towers Block Format, so thats why I&#39;m not using cool cards like Enquea and etc.<br />
<br />
Beautiful Letdown is the name of a song and album from a wicked cool band called Switchfoot. Check &#39;em out if you get a chance, they&#39;re really great.<br />
<br />
Well, this deck handles shadow sides very well. In fact, there was only one game all weekend where I did not double from 1-3 then 3-5. Between Defend it and Hope, 2 undirected archery, fortification, stealths, Wingfoot, Dauntless Hunter, Escape and Farmir there isn&#39;t a Shadow strategy that gives you too much trouble, barring of course poor draws on your part. <br />
<br />
Bid High. I bid 4-5 all day, mainly because going first and getting Wingfoot with the Riddermark is essential. This also gives you the upper hand against Site Control, since they can&#39;t control any sites till you move to 4, assuming you doubled to 3, which should be quite easy. The burdens can be an issue against another burden deck, but with stealths and Faramir, they will need to get out 3 Burden adder Easterlings to add one burden before site 6(since you&#39;ll always assing one to Frodo and hide if nescessary). Play stuff and move, it&#39;s not very complicated, but try to save the DiaH&#39;s for the second move if possible. The Fortifications, in combo with Faramir, own Dunland and Dauntless Hunter makes Trackers less intimidating(not to mention DiaH). <br />
Thats about all the strategy.....oh yeah.<br />
<br />
Pathfinder.<br />
<br />
This card should be saved for sites 3, 5, 7 and 8. I know there are only 2 Finders in the deck, but do you really think you&#39;ll always have one when you want it? HA!<br />
<br />
Why the Ruling Ring?<br />
<br />
see description of Southron Commander.<br />
<br />
The shadow complements the Free Peoples because it can either add burdens like a MoFo against unbound decks (HiDaN, Valiant Rohan) or morph into stop mode against Ringbound decks. <br />
<br />
The way this is accomplished is through the pimp of the deck, Gollum. Via Evil Smelling Fens Gollum can always pull out the big fat minion you need to put the Fellowship on it&#39;s Butt. Against Ringbound decks, the key is to continue to recur Easterling Captain. Because he is a big boy, Fierce and can pump himself(not to mention other Easterlings) your opponent will be reluctant to double move if they cannot kill him. Against an unbound deck, use Gollum to recur the Lt.&#39;s and Guards to keep up the burdens. This in turn makes Gollum bigger, and with We Must Have It he should win a fight, and therefore add a burden, every time he shows up. <br />
<br />
The Desert Legion is for flavor. He is big, mean and dressed like a bunch of Ninja&#39;s. Fear him.<br />
<br />
Discovered is essential against HiDaN, that way you can win some fights, and in a roundabout way make it easier for your fellowship to win.<br />
<br />
Gathering to the Summons is essential in Towers Block because without it Ringbound is almost an auto loss. Also, in combo with Saouthron Commander it can result in multiple burdens.<br />
<br />
Southron Commander is SOOOO good. He is the closest thing that Towers has to Enquea, but in this deck he is almost better. Spot 6 companions and assign him to the Ringbearer, unless they discard an unbound dude. If they have 9 companions, continue to do it until they have only 5, or they ley you assign him. The big cool thing comes in if they have ATAR(Mr. Bubbles). Frodo with a Hobbit Sword, or Sting, and Mr. Bubbles is still overwhelmed by the Commander. this means that in order to avoid discarding a companion the opponent must add 2 burdens. One for putting on the ring and another for losing a fight. Also, another burden for each copy of Gathering to the Summons I happen to drop on them. That is the one reason I use The Ruling Ring, simply because that way I can go above 5 companions after Frodo has a sword and not add 2 burdens every time Southron Commander comes a calling. <br />
<br />
I can&#39;t really think of anything more to say about this deck, other than that it was very good. I wouldn&#39;t try the Shadow in Standard/Open, simply because of the existance of directed archery/Sam, SoH/Choke, but in Towers it definitely stands a chance. Also, what beats the fun factor of a 14 strength Gollum, who somehow causes Frodo to run off with the Ring by punching Faramir in the mouth?<br />
