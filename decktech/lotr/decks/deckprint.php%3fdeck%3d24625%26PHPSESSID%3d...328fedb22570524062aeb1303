<br />
With ARV and Thror&#39;s Map getting hit, shadow side themed decks are much more viable.  This deck uses worry and hitherto unknown Evil Afoot to construct an unbeatable minion hand at Site 9.  This hand consists of any minions you want from your graveyard, and generally consists of Saruman + 4 lts + another couple guys.  All go down -1, and saruman puts the kibosh on things like Archery and Power According to his Stature.  Oh yeah, he also makes them all Fierce did I mention that?<br />
<br />
So let&#39;s get down to it.  Bid one or two, and if you by any chance win, have the opponent go first.<br />
<br />
Fellowship<br />
<br />
The fellowship is designed to do two things.  <br />
<br />
1) draw cards.  Card drawer gandalf is a wuss at fighting, but draws big time.  That combined with Elrond and Ottar, and the fact that everything in the deck stacks on Shards or plays means you will WHIP through your deck at warp speed.<br />
<br />
2) Not die.  It sets up fast enough where these guys can actually skirmish effectively.  Sam is great for a pinch when you put out too much twilight, and Filbert?  He&#39;s the best ally ever.  By the mid to end, your fellowship is actually fairly buff<br />
<br />
So start drawing and pitching and stacking.  Watch your twilight.  Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll get through your deck fast.  The one Sleep seems odd, but you can&#39;t get swarmed.  Get it back later with Barliman when needed.  You can pitch minions, but be careful not to go crazy, you need to win some skirmishes. <br />
<br />
REMEMBER, Gandalf DOES NOT count towards rule of 4!<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
This is what wins you the game.  Worry is potentially, IMHO, one of the most powerful cards in the game.  Not only does it stack you wounds and burdens on Frodo, it keeps PATHS off your back.  You need at least three burdens on Frodo at site 8 to make the combo go off, so make sure you use your Savageries and Ambitions to win skirmishes at the right times.  You can also save the Ambitions for the final kill too.<br />
<br />
So just proceed normally.  Deck yourself by site 8, slow down or speed up as appropriate.  Now at site 8, here&#39;s the deal.  Make sure you have a guy or two for the motor of the deck, Evil Afoot.  Exert your guys and pick your hand for next turn.  Yep, anyone you want!  The "god hand".  Always get the 4 lts and saruman.  Tower Assasin is a good choice, just in case of Filibert.  Enquea and/or Berzerker if they have 5 burdens.  Captain is a great choice too.<br />
<br />
Now they move to the slopes (-1 for almost everybody!), where before they thought the game won.  Drop your Saruman, 4 lts, and whatever other cheapies you need.  The lts are generally about 13 and fierce.  They will kill everyone.  If Worry is out, and generally is, opponent will die right here to corruption.  If they still live, bring everyone around again, using Saruman as need to keep the lts maxed.  They will be overwhelmed for sure.<br />
<br />
Further info <br />
<br />
Discard.  This deck is problematic against certain discard strategies.  But I don&#39;t care.  I think this is a very creative, powerful and very fun deck, and it&#39;s quite clear discard is getting reamed in Two Towers.  You can safely put in another no biz if you&#39;d like, and still easily deck yourself. Or scrabblers or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Does this kill work?  Yes, it works everytime as long as opponent has enough burdens.  You can on your fellowship side use ottar to pick your hand in the case you shuffled in more than 8 cards.<br />
<br />
If you sense a 4 path deck, make sure you kill everyone else first. This should get you enough burdens where there&#39;s no way they can get enough paths through saruman without getting corrupted.<br />
<br />
One guy who barely didn&#39;t make the cut was Ravager X 1.  Yeah, he deploys for 1 last turn!!<br />
<br />
Use this idea in your own way too create your own God Hand.  Just remember where you saw it first!  Have fun and thanks for reading!<br />
