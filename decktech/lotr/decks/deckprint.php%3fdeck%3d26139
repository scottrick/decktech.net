It originally came right off DechTech as something for me to play around with.  I tested it with Alex Tennant on the Friday before D-con, altering the deck slightly based on Alex&#8217;s suggestions.  Since I generally suck at this game, I opted to try Sealed and Multi-Player on day 1 rather than constructed.  After what happened on Saturday, that turned out to be a really dumb idea.  The deck went undefeated with wins over at least three world class players.  I felt like I was in Bizarro Universe, because everything was backwards (I was winning!) and whoever possessed my body that day and played this deck did a great job.  It couldn&#8217;t have been me, because I SUCK AT THIS GAME!!!!. (and of course, since it was a team tourney, there was NO prize support for the highest individual score, which was someone who looked a lot like me but couldn&#8217;t have been me because I SUCK AT THIS GAME!!)<br />
 <br />
General Strategy:  This deck is built to run.  Bid 1 to go first.  If you win, go first.  If not, you double move to 3.  If shadow gets the job done at 2 (a troop stops them almost all the time) you should now pull ahead.  If you get to 3 second, you have the possiblilty of a triple move to six if you have some elves waiting with open arms.  Once you have the lead, keep it to the point of idiocy, double moving every time you can, and sometimes when you can&#8217;t.  The shadow side is designed to make it suicidal for your opponent to double move through Moria.  You run with five fellowship members at a time, Aragorn and Boromir pumped up with all their toys.  Once you have the lead, the idea is to dump every shadow card and weapon dupes you have with Gwemegil, Evenstar, and Abandoning until everything you need is where you need it to be.<br />
<br />
Specfics: <br />
Vs. Nazgul:  Shouldn&#8217;t be a problem, provided the brands show up.  Keep to 5 companions, try to keep the pool under 11 so you never have to look at 3 Nazgul.  Once you get through the fords, a fully loaded Gorn and Boromir will be able to swat most of the Black Riders out of the way.  The only time you might get into trouble is if you double move unnecessarily and allow 4 to show up.  Then you&#8217;re dead.<br />
<br />
Vs. Moria:  Get to six and you should be home free.  If you face a Troll at 4, take the hits, save the archery for the bridge, sacrificing somebody if necessary.  Odds are if you burn archery at four, you will die at 5.  Be prepared for no archery at 7.  If you lose your allies, so what?  They did their job, and your archery is more important.  Heal Legolas and Gorn as your top priorities.  Keep the pool small and burn conditions with Sentinels, USUALLY burning They are Coming first, then the armories, then the swarms.  At the high sites, nothing with Orc in the name should win a skirmish anyway.  If you get Paths early, keep them.  Play them only to have Frodo survive, no matter how painful.    <br />
<br />
Vs. Sauron:  Who the hell plays Sauron anyway?<br />
<br />
Vs. Uruk:  Now you&#8217;re playing Candyland.  Whoever gets the right cards wins.  Be prepared for a bloody as hell, single site moving game.  Hope Gandalf shows up in time to neutralize Saruman, and hope that you can dodge the Power.  Never place both betrayals on the table at the same time, and hope you see his Tower assassins go by before you need to play Filbert.  This is absolutely the most difficult matchup for this deck.<br />
<br />
So that&#8217;s it.  I really should have played this on Day 1, but who knew?  Now that I have finally found my deck, let&#8217;s change all the rules.  Oh, well&#8230;<br />
