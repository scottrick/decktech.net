There is only one Ring-Bound (Frodo) - every one else in unbound. <br />
ROHAN - Eomer and the Elite Rider are to be mounted at all costs. This gives them their strenght bonuses. Plus if you get them with a Spear/Sword and Bow, they are pretty hard to beat. The Lorien Swordsmen are your back up fighters along with Arwen. Leggy is for point and shoot. Haldir is mostly for liberation...unless you need to fight. If you lose with this FP I would be surprized.   (((Helm! Helm! - is easier to use then Sword-wall, plus it helps keep sites liberated)))<br />
ELVES - Archery keeps those powerful Uruks from using their powerful (But conditional) gametexts...so there...(so do the mounts)<br />
<br />
***IMPORTANT*** - I have been told that Archery and Mounts are Redundant - I don&#39;t think so.  Especially if the Shadow has archery protection - the mounts are set as a backup.  Hope this clears that up...<br />
<br />
***I haven&#39;t played very many games with this deck - Dunland seems to be better off - because of their low vitality - Uruks, Isenorcs and Raiders have to exert when assigned, if they don&#39;t they use their game text and give my Riders their strength bonuses anyway...*** <br />
<br />
Minions <br />
I don&#39;t know what they are supposed to do. But Ferny takes away, for the most part, Gondorian Rangers game texts. SO THERE. I didn&#39;t give the Nazgul much thought - but I am positive they are pretty tough. HAHA. Sides&#39; they are Nazgul. <br />
I added some Morgul Gates...just cause...haha<br />
I kept most of everything else the way it is...<br />
- - - - Added another Nelya, keep my path running<br />
- - - - Switch Steeds for Sword or whatever floats your boat.<br />
<br />
SITES: <br />
Play them as they come....Hopefully you will be able to play to your sites....<br />
<br />
BIDDING: It just depends on who or what you are playing against and whether you want to play to your opponents site or yours... <br />
