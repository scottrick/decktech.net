Settle in with some coffe while I spin a tale of strategy and adventure (paths).<br />
<br />
First, a note about the enviroment this should be played in. Trully new players would do well to skip this, and come back to it later.<br />
<br />
Gullecram posted a tournament report where no rares were allowed. I thought this a really cool idea, so I decided to build a deck with the same restrictions. However, because it is designed for a no rare enviroment, I took some things in too mind. There are two main problems if you wanted to play this in a normal tournament.<br />
<br />
1.	GRIMA: Actually, this is probably two problems, as both Wormtongue and Chief Counsellor will hurt you. Wormtongue is easier to get around; all you need to do is choose which pieces of gimli’s equipment you want to use. Even then it’s not a terrible problem, as you can discard everything but dwarven axe. Chief Counsellor, however, will cause major problems. The fact is this deck plays every single FP culture created, 7 in total. Grima will just kill you. Obviously, Grima isn’t an issue in a no rare enviroment. Well, I guess there’s always son of galamond......:)<br />
<br />
2.  OPEN: Ok, so obviusly it’s an open deck. This could expose you to some of the very <br />
	powerful strats out there. It’s also loses alot when switched into standard: Filibert (no <br />
biggie, everyone loses him), Nertea (ouch! Enquea MIGHT do...) and most importantly, the Regular (well there goes the swarm). Still, it might be worth trying, just for fun.<br />
<br />
There are of course other things to keep in mind, such as Filibert exposes you to ally kill, but those are the biggies.<br />
<br />
Right. So assuming you’ve found a tournament (or a group of friends) who will play no rares, or you make up in balls won’t you don’t have in cash, here then is the strategy, which is divided into two parts: Beginner startegy, and advanced strategy. ADVANCED PLAYERS CAN SKIP THIS SECTION (though they might learn some thing if they read it.)<br />
<br />
BEGGINERS STRAT:<br />
<br />
If you are a new player, it is quite likely you may not have heard of the deck archetype “Trust”. This is a deck based around Gandalf and companions with the Gandalf Signet, and using the power of the Condition “Trust Me as You Once Did”. This allows you to have a constant “pump” (slang for skirmish event which adds to strength) on the table (in play), which is very powerful. You can also use Gimli and Legolas’s abilties to help people who might be losing. Dn’t forget to draw a card each turn with ganadalf, and don’t hesitate to discard each turn when you reconcile; you need to to cycle your deck (draw cards efficently). You should play comapnions and then suit them up with their weapons, and then try to make it to site 9 as fast you can. Be  wary of playing a sixth companion however, otherwise Ulaire Enquea will be able to come and destroy Gandalf (who is the key to your deck). Only play more companions if you are sure they are not playing Enquea, or it is Eown, who can prevent the wounds. Sometimes it is a good idea to kill off comapnions to make way for new ones; Smeagol can be used to double move to three, and then nobly sacrficed.<br />
<br />
A quick note if you’ve recently convereted from another card game. Only one of a certain card is very common in LOTR, particullarily for unique possesions and characters. This is too avoid hand clog with all those waepons you already have out, or a comapnion who’s dead and is in your hand again.<br />
<br />
Your shadow side is no slouch either, and can esaily win you the game as well. The trick is too simply play as many minions as you possibly can. Hate and Anger, as well as Abandoning Reason for Madness, allow you draw absurd amounts of cards, which will set up your swarm. However, if you choose to try and win through the fellowship, they can also set up your hand.<br />
<br />
Build this deck and try it out. It should be very fu. Two quick notes if you want to modify it, or build a deck similar: First, try and make it a lot smaller; 38 cards a side is only viasible with all the card draw. Second, you may want to focus more heavily on one side or the other, with the other side supporting it. For example, if you plan on running (double moving alot, trying to get to site 9 first), you could consider a shadow which is good at stopping your opponent. While flexibility is good, first decks might want to have a more focused goal.<br />
<br />
Here is a list telling what set each card is from. All cards are common unless otherwise noted. The “premium” ganadalf means it can only be found in the mines of moria gandalf starter. You automatically recive two, so you would need to buy 2 copies, or trade/borrow then. <br />
<br />
And yes, it took a He££ of a long time to format this so nicely and type out all the set names, so I hope your happy. I also realized that I could have used tab (which what I DID do for the shadow) instead of space all those times. Erg. Wait, it didn’t actually WORK on deck tech. I had every set name lined up. Double ergh.<br />
<br />
All sites are from the Two Towers. Frodo is from Towers as well, The Ring, well, you do have The One Ring, right?<br />

Quick note: Though you might be tempted to buy Mines of Moria, as it seeems there are a fair few cards here from that set, I’d not reccomend it. It’s widely considered the worst set yet, and most of the owerful rares have banned (O Elbereth, Flaming Brand) or rendered useless (Tower assassin, Secret Sentinels) for standard play, thus decreasing thier value. Maybe a couple boosters, plus the two starters if no one is willing to give you thier Gandalfs. Seee if people can donate Tidings of Erebor for instance, it’s not a heavily played card and Mines isn’t very popular, so people might have extra’s floating around.<br />

Whew. Well there you have it. Below is a more advanced strat. You might want to try playing the deck first, but I’m sure it wouldn’t hurt to look at. Happy Gaming, and welcome to LOTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANCED STRATEGY:<br />
<br />
If you’ve stuck with me this long (or even just scrolled down to here). Here then is the basic strat.<br />
<br />
Bid 1-3 which means you’ll have two to four burdens including smeagol. Sam and Faramir will be able to remove some of those, so your all set. If you win, choose to go first, from where you can grab gorn. If not, it means your opponent will hit the cavern entrenace and deep of helm. I’d bid 3 normally, but I’m not sure.<br />
<br />
I would reccomend NOT doubling to 3, unless your opponent went first and did. The reason is that it will give you more time to suit up the fellowship and stack your hand with shadow. After that you can run with reckelles abandon, or try to swarm. Or do both &#61514;<br />
<br />
Why no boromir? I simply judged that Smeagol, Sam, and Eown in particular were all more genreally useful. Why 2 aragorn and 3 faramir? I figured that faramir was actually better, plus it is important to get him so the bow can be played (can’t be played on aragorn). As well, there is a chance to get gorn anyways.<br />
<br />
Tidings of erebor is power. I used to have delving and search far and wide to cycle the deck better, but I din’t like the exertion of delving or the discard of search far and wide (it isn’t actaully moria). I then stumbled upon this. Most of the time they won’t have 3, so you get your cards, which can help you either double or set up the shadow hand a lttile. If they do, minus 3 twilight means an easier double move. I’d reccomend playing it even if you want to stop and they have 3, as you can’t afford to clog your hand.<br />
<br />
Shoulder to shoulder will probably primarilly be used to heal Gimli. In conjuction with Legolas’s sword it’s really good. You can also use it to fill up the pool for deep in thought, but just remeber Tidings won’t work effectively that turn.<br />
<br />
The shadow is rather simple. Draw mass amounts of cards with Abandoning and “Hate and Anger” (spot uruk and a moria orc to draw 3), and use ambition to reduce the costs. I considered Saruman’s power to deal with trust, but judging by Gullecram’s report, Rohan and RBR were the most popular, and I also didn’t want to get rid of my ambitions.<br />
<br />
Hope you liked it!<br />
