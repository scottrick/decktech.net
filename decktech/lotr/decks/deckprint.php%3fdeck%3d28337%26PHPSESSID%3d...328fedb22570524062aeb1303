Use your Sappers and Engineers to start loading up you machines. It&#39;s a good idea to only put 1 token each on Scaling Ladder, two on Weapons, and 8 on DEvilry, because these will be discarded. I generally put most token on one of Battering Rams, and if he&#39;s playing super-fellowship, one on each of the others. Remember, once you have Siege Engine out, Sappers and Engineers deal 3 tokens each, game text, Siege Engine, and a exertion. Don&#39;t be scared of you can&#39;t do anything for the first 4 sites. THis deck doesn&#39;t et rolling until about site 7, although if you&#39;re lucky, the damage starts at Deep of Helm. <br />
YOur Slayers can deal two damage to everyone. Exert him twice and remove 5 tokens, heal him up with your Scaling Ladders, then do it again! Combined on one site with Devilry of Orthanc, Weapons of Isengard, and Hornburg Causeway, his fellowship is no more. I&#39;ve killed 8 companions at one site with him - twice. <br />
You may notice that the Fellowship doesn&#39;t seem to be really, &#39;rough and dirty fighters&#39;. The best thing is to try to avoid skirmsihes, with Stone Tower, Citadel, Men of Numenor, and Defend It. Also, you can put two huge guys on Aragorn and use the gauntlets to cancel. <br />
Bid medium, about 1-4. It doesn&#39;t really matter whether you go first or second, because getting Aragorn out isn&#39;t mandatory. I often go second because my Shadow side wins more than my Fellowship. <br />
Boromir also works good in this deck. YOu can pack him with his Blade instead of Knight of Gondor, if you want. Also, if you have several Nazgul decks, stick a Flaming Brand in. <br />
Healing can be a problem. YOu&#39;ll notice that about site 8-9, your fortifications are running low, and wounds are mounting, especially after the Causeway. If this gets to be a problem, pop a couple Might of Numenors in there, or maybe a Herald to Gil-galad. However, healing isn&#39;t that much of a problem for me. (maybe that&#39;s because there&#39;s no archery decks where I play!) <br />
THere&#39;s no condition removal, but Gondor doesn&#39;t have much anyway. Athelas can take care of a Blade Tip. I tried running some Elf allies with Secret Sentinels, but it doesn&#39;t work very well. And I&#39;&#39;ve played and won against several bona fide conditions decks.  <br />
THis is a very fast-playing deck, hence the 78-card deck. A mean card to watch out for is Legolas, Dauntless Hunter. Two unbound hobbits and your sixteen free conditions suddenly cost 2 apiece. If that&#39;s the case, start pitching one every turn. YOur strategy will still work and it saves pool. <br />
Also, PLAY THIS AT HOME BEFORE TAKING IT TO A TOURNEMENT!!!! It takes some getting use to, and a little while to nail down all the strategy. <br />
So have fun playing it, and watching your opponent weep when you cut down his 9-companion fellowship at site 9 with one minion. Also, you have the pleasure of having the largest support area of the tourney, topping out at about 25 cards!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
