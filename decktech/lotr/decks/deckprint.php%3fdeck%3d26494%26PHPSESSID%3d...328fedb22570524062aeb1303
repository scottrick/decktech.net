<br />
The strategy is pretty simple:<br />
1.  Bid Low (1 or 2) and go second if you win... the reasoning behind this is that you want your sites, and once you get set up, you will be able to pass them easily.  Although it&#39;s not really hard to double move past Uruk Archery, if can be kind of stupid.  Especially if my minions are still around.<br />
2.  Dump as much archery and exertions as possible to build up a massive collage of red tokens.  When you run out of red tokens use your fancy colored ones or dice... you will need them...<br />
3.  Run fast with the fellowship and put on pressure from behind.  Losing companions does not hurt you too much, so don&#39;t be afraid to sacrifice Eomer, Theoden or Aragorn when the going gets tough.  The fellowship is versatile, so just adapt to the situation.<br />
4. Although I say you can pass them if you want, you should stay behind if they are playing anything without Rohan, because your site 7 (if they get there) will definitely end the game if you haven&#39;t by that time.<br />
5.  If by some fluke you haven&#39;t wounded them to death by site 9, it should only be Frodo and maybe one or two exhausted scrubs, so use his burdens to get enough minions for the overwhelm.<br />
6.  Use savageries only when you know they will win you a skirmish and put on extra wounds, and try to only use them on damage +1 Uruks... This is why I use Band of Uruk Bowmen... bad strength to twilight ratio, but with Savagery he does 5 wounds... that&#39;s a better ratio.<br />
7.  Servants are so gosh darnit good, but only if you use them at the right times.  Eomer can take ANYONE if you play it right.<br />
<br />
Sites:<br />
1.  I use the site that gets Legolas because he&#39;s the best remedy to a bad draw.  If I am forced to start and I don&#39;t draw a companion, it sucks to exert two of my big guys to get Aragorn who probably won&#39;t win or wound anything I face... instead I get Legolas who is cheaper and will most likely be able to kill whatever I would have faced, thus saving Theoden and Eomer... I am kind of vulnerable without possessions, so having a companion to throw away early is important.<br />
2. This site helps out Gandalf, plus can stop someone from double moving to 3 against my archers.  I generally save the nasty stuff for after the sanctuary so double moving pre-sanctuary is easy.<br />
3. The stables with Theoden is great... exert Eomer, get Firefoot, Theoden heals Eomer... you just go Firefoot for free... do the same for Brego with Theoden and then transfer him to Aragorn or Gandalf who can make better use out of him.<br />
4. 2 exertions hurts a lot against my deck... I am not a big fan of exerting a 2 vitality guy myself, but you got to do what you got to do.<br />
5.  no explanation necessary<br />
6.  I play possessions, and the other sites don&#39;t really help.<br />
7.  OUCH!  This is usually the last stand for non-Rohan decks (Rohan decks are usually dead by this point)<br />
8.  Wizards Vale has no text, but who cares?<br />
9.  Just in case it gets to this point, you can pull Nertea or Lurtz or whatever you need to make sure you win.<br />
<br />
Cards:<br />
Boromir, DOMT:  Has a Gandalf signet, is a strong companion, and can absorb 2 archery wounds a turn.<br />
<br />
Eowyn, Lady of Rohan:  This Eowyn is much better in a support role, and besides being able to absorb Enquea she can add twilight for Gandalf.<br />
<br />
Faramir, SOD:  Doesn&#39;t die unless you want him to.  Avoids the Savageries that can plague a Trust Me deck.<br />
<br />
Legolas, Greenleaf:  He&#39;s like Thrarin &#39;cept he takes out a minion or two before dying... also hurts Dunland decks.<br />
<br />
Thrarin: He&#39;s like Thrarin, &#39;cept he ... is ... Thrarin...<br />
<br />
Al:  Don&#39;t call him Betty... that&#39;s all I can say...<br />
<br />
Fortress Never Fallen:  My favourite source of condition removal... &#39;specially when Eomer beats Everything...<br />
<br />
Weapon Store:  To get my possessions back after they been turfed by them gosh darnit wild men...  Man exerts to get weapon... plays on himself... Theoden heals him... works for me.<br />
<br />
Brego:  She lets anyone ride her and she&#39;s cheap...<br />
<br />
Ranger Sword:  Easily replaced by a Sword of Gondor if you want the versatility of putting it on Faramir or Boromir.<br />
<br />
Before I get into the archers I&#39;ll invent a TPW value that is just an average Twilight per Wound ratio so you can see about how much you pay for those wounds... it might explain why I use some of these guys better.<br />
<br />
Band of Uruk Bowmen:  Can do 5 possible wounds (with a savagery)... most likely does 1-3, for 5 twilight (averages about 2 wounds for 5 twilight for a 2.5 TPW)<br />
<br />
Elite Crossbowman:  Can do 6 possible wounds (averages 3.5 for a 1.5 TPW), but he&#39;s unique.<br />
<br />
Lurtz:  Can Do 5 possible wounds (usually does 5 for a 1.4 TPW) but he&#39;s also unique... he also usually will kill one or two companions... definitely the best of the Uruk archers.<br />
<br />
Orthanc Assassin:  Can Do 5 possible wounds (averages 2.5 for a 2.0 TPW), also unique<br />
<br />
Orthanc Champion:  Takes out who he wants, and if not, usually adds 3 wounds (for a TPW of 1.67), he is also unique but essential, and many times I will use 2 instead of 1...<br />
<br />
Ranged Commander:  He is very important because twilight can be an issue... but he&#39;s also unique... (averages 1.5 wounds for a 2.67 TPW which is comparatively the worst of all)<br />
<br />
Ulaire Enquea:  His ability will be very useful in this deck as you pack burdens fast, and the best counter is a huge fellowship.  Enquea usually does 5 wounds when his ability comes into effect, but 2 when it doesn&#39;t.  If Eomer is out, he might only do 3 etc... so we&#39;ll round all that down to 3 wounds (for a 2.0 TPW)<br />
<br />
Ulaire Nertea:  Gets who you want... He&#39;s gud.<br />
<br />
Crossbow Troop:  Averages 2 wounds because of his adding an extra token and possibly winning a skirmish (for a 2.0 TPW)<br />
<br />
Crossbowman:  Averages 1.2 wounds (he sometimes wins...) for a 2.5 TPW.  But he&#39;s cheap, and he&#39;s an archer...<br />
<br />
Keep in mind all of these guys add 1 token to a machine which is essentially another 8 wounds a game, and each could cost less when you play a Ranged Commander... Plus each can exert to use One of You Must Do This which is another 0-4 red tokens.  <br />
<br />
Savageries not only keep your guys around, but they increase the amount of red tokens they are trying to heal off, they will also usually kill off a companion or two.  I will stress though that using them on a crappy little Crossbowman is not worth it at all... hold them for the big guys. (i.e. anyone who is Damage +1)<br />
<br />
The last card to talk about is Greed...  This card is a monster now, and should be used very wisely.  That means if they have six companions, add wounds rather than kill guys.  If you are low on minions, don&#39;t play anyone, instead, just start shooting.  The downside of the card is it&#39;s easily countered or discarded, but it&#39;s definitely worth a slot.  Tower is also easily discarded so I only included 1, mostly because Tower = an extra wound with Greed or an extra minion in some cases.<br />
