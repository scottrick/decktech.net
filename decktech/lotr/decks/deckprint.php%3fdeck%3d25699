<br>
Free Peoples<br>
<br>
Your main guns are Aragorn and Boromir with Gandalf serving as backup. Legolas is there for archery support (as is Aragorn&#39;s Bow) and Sam is around just in case you are outbid and your opponent starts the GDI.<br>
<br>
Shards is great for cycling through any Gondor based deck, and the Grey Pilgrim nets you an extra card... again from the no @$#! department. Put the two together and you have a pretty good method of getting through your deck.<br>
<br>
Besides, Still Sharp is just an awesome card. Along with that pump is Servant, a multi-purpose tool used to win skirmishes, thwart foes, and sometimes keep someone alive.<br>
<br>
Gandalf&#39;s Staff is good for keeping Gandalf alive in case there is something that you can&#39;t handle. Hence, two in the deck. This little toy gives you options, and that&#39;s what&#39;s important in a small fellowship.<br>
<br>
Run when you can, walk in most cases. The idea is to go second so that your Shadow can play. Just keep up with them until site 4, then double to 6. Move or stay, just use your judgement. With 3 Still Sharps and 4 Servants, you should be just fine.<br>
<br>
This fellowship is designed with Uruks in mind, although it hassles Nazgul as well. With Moria, well, you just have to have the right cards at the right times, and a well-played Sleep works miracles. The same holds true for Sauron.<br>
<br>
Shadow<br>
<br>
Nazgul may not be as efficient as Uruks at wearing down your opponent, but in my book they&#39;re many times more entertaining and significantly more difficult to play effectively.<br>
<br>
Besides, they just look cooler.<br>
<br>
The strategy here is to wear your opponent down with a constant barrage of the best of the wraiths.<br>
<br>
Not many people will move with a Witch-King following them, and not many fellowships surive 3 consecutive visits from the Lord of Angmar, especially with his Pale Blade.<br>
<br>
Cantea is good for screwing up assignments, and Nelya is there for a little site management. Attea is a beast, especially when your opponent gives you a lot of twilight.<br>
<br>
The focus of the deck, however, is the Gates of the Dead City/Drawn to its Power combo.<br>
<br>
If someone checks out, then the rest of the fellowship feels the impact. I don&#39;t know how many times my opponent has thrown Sam or Pippin in front of the Witch-King only to have Frodo take 4 burdens while the fellowship exerts like mad.<br>
<br>
And once that happens, it gets easier of the Nazgul to kill again... and again... and again.<br>
<br>
If you get 4 burdens on Frodo, then Toldea gets to pick his adversary. Five and it&#39;s hunting season for Enquea. Besides, he&#39;s good against those large fellowships and with 11/4 fierce as stats, there&#39;s not much more you can ask for.<br>
<br>
The Skulkers are around to recycle Morgul Gates, Nazgul, or your conditions (should they be the victim of Sleep or other condition removal).<br>
<br>
Often overlooked, The Ring Draws Them gives the deck a nice touch. At the very least it will net you a couple of twilight (one for each burden you can spot when the fellowship moves). When the burden count gets up there, thanks to Drawn to its Power or Eregion Hills, then so does the pool added.<br>
<br>
More pool is good for Nazgul. More pool for any shadow culture is good.<br>
<br>
The deck is different, yes, and it may not win every time, but the concepts are sure to catch your opponent off-guard.. Give it a try, and let me know what you think.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
