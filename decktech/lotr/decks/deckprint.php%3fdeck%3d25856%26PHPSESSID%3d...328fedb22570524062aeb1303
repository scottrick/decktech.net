Fellowship:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Take Frodo and the best three companions in your deck, and give them all the tools they need to destroy a shadow deck and this is what you get.  Bid 1 or 2 and go first if you win.  You should be able to easily double move against everything but Moria.  The simplicity of the fellowship is what makes it so good.  No hard to set up combos, very little hand clog, and a great compliment to a simple shadow.  <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Most of the Card choices are pretty easy, but I&#39;ll explain some, because getting a 32 card fellowship w/ 10 events is a tough-decision making process.<br />
<br><br />
 <br />
<br><br />
All Frodo Signets:  Heal Frodo, and reduces hand clog if you have extra companions and Sting...<br />
<br><br />
Betrayal: Saruman hurts direct archery decks, Betrayal makes Saruman a lot less effective.  It also hurts Moria (a bit)... card efficiency-wise it is just a great card.  It is the only condition I use because it is an affordable loss against everything except Isengard... 2 Sleeps makes playing Tale or Saga a lot less effective.  I don&#39;t mind losing it vs. Moria because the Sleep will hurt them a lot more.<br />
<br><br />
Stealth and Servants:  2 best skirmish events period... not-losing skirmishes is the same as winning, and both are SO important.<br />
<br><br />
1 Armor: 2 would be nice, but not worth going to 33 cards for.<br />
<br><br />
Flaming Brand: Although Nazgul is on the decline, and is hard-pressed against this deck, I find it especially useful to keep Goblin Scavengers w/ Scimitar off Goblin Swarms.<br />
<br><br />
Lego&#39;s Weapons:  it&#39;s so much easier to get your eggo back when you are holding a Bow and a knife...  it&#39;s also nice against Moria and big exhausted minions.<br />
<br><br />
Narya: Mostly for a free 1 vitality... withstanding 2 losses to Uruk-hai is key.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The Shadow is pretty standard unfortunately... been played a million times... so why am I bothering posting this?  Basically because this Uruk-hai deck does the job... all the time.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s played by everyone... it&#39;s solid.  I don&#39;t like inconsistency, and other decks can work much better but not half as consistently as Uruks.  They are just always good.  Even against choke... I don&#39;t care what you say.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Cards:<br />
<br><br />
Tower of Orthanc:  Just deadly if it starts adding twilight.  Also plays cheaply early, and will draw that Sleep that your couple of Ambitions won&#39;t.<br />
<br><br />
Battle Cry:  Kills guys all the time... always useful... whereas other Uruk events (i.e. Saruman&#39;s Power, Beyond the Height, Abandoning Reason) are not always useful.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Remember... simplicity is the key... The more simple you keep things, the more consistent your deck will be.  And yes, maybe you won&#39;t surprise anyone, but you will beat them instead.  Thanks for reading and thanks for your reviews!  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
