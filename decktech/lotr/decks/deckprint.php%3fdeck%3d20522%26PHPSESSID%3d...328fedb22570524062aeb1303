Enduring Evil is really a bummer for a deck like this with only four companions. In fact, I&#39;d bid zero most of the time unluss you know you&#39;re opponent&#39;s preference from a previous game and want to thwart their strategy.<br />
<br />
Companions: I&#39;m a big believer that Friend to Sam is the only way to go in the Merry department. The trouble I kept running into is that the two exertions mean he only gets to help out three times max. After he&#39;s exerted, he just sits around and waits until the next sanctuary to heal. So, I decided the deck needed a touch o&#39; Hobbit Healing Power. Once Farmer Maggot hits the table, Merry can use his text pretty much every turn - a big improvement.<br />
<br />
The four Hobbit Stealths are especially nice in this deck since they allow Merry to take on a big bad dude, and then still get away with helping somebody else.<br />
<br />
Boromir is, of course, able to take on almost anybody, especially if he&#39;s got Armor. He can just take a wound and be healed the next turn. <br />
<br />
And I was forced to include everybody&#39;s favorite: Ranger&#39;s Versatility. Even with only one bow, it&#39;s worth including. If you&#39;re exhausting Orcs or Uruk-Hai, you can finish them off with Blade of Gondor (and laugh in their face &#39;cuz they thought Spies of Saruman shut down Versatility). Against Nazgul you can stop any exertions, and, with the help of Merry, stop them from attacking twice. If you feel it&#39;s some sort of sin to have only one Bow and two ARV then feel free to switch out A Talent For Not Being Seen for a second bow. <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Pretty standard, Scimitar-based Moria. Goblin Armories are so huge. They provide the much-needed edge against Legolas/Aragorn&#39;s Bow. And while they&#39;re waitng they add massive amounts of twilight with the ever-present Scimitars. <br />
<br />
Frenzy is a nice card that I haven&#39;t seen used much. After Legolas has exhausted snipering my minions, I can assign a leftover Moria Scout to polish him off. Also works nicely with Goblin Domain, a cool card in its own right (no dropping Sam to remove three burdens).<br />
<br />
The adventure path isn&#39;t anything terribly exciting. I tried to go with low-twilight sites for the most part since my Goblins don&#39;t require much to get going. The one exception is site 8. Stopping the double-move to nine is too cool to pass up. It does make it a litte tougher to double-move myself due to the 8 twilight number, but I think it&#39;s a worthwile trade-off.<br />
<br />
So, um, there it is, dudes. <br />
