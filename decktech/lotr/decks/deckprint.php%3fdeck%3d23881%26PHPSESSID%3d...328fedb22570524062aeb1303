<br />
This is a slight twist of what I consider to be the best kinds of decks out there... the huge fellowship that is suited for any match-up, and those Uruks, who are almost everybody&#39;s worst match-up.  The main strategy behind decks like Gabe Alonso&#39;s deck is to play everything you can now to get to the best stuff faster.  Mine plays alot like this but I have added a couple twists so at least I can pretend it&#39;s a deck &quot;of my own&quot;.  10 in fact.<br />
<br />
1. Note no Arwen, rather Gimli as starting member.  Gimli was meant to be with Legolas! He is a better skirmisher (in combo w/ Merry, Servant, or Merry w/ Boromir chaser).  Sucks up wounds better w/ Helm.  Gandalf str + 1 faster.  Good swarm protector w/ Axe!<br />
<br />
2. Pippin!  He&#39;s here to keep twilight at a minimum if possible, but most importantly, to come into play cheap and die quickly!<br />
<br />
3. Ottar!  Much better ally than Rumil in this case.  Can at least use his skill more than twice...<br />
<br />
4. Conditions: I always thought Sleeps and Tale of Gil Galad were counter strategic.  I don&#39;t want to think twice about discarding Armories / Ambitions / Relics / Swarms, etc.<br />
<br />
5. One whom men would follow... 11th companion... Elrond can take Balrog for the team.<br />
<br />
On to shadow differences<br />
<br />
6. No Orthanc Assassin.  I hate this guy... the only thing he does well is clog your hand up.  If you are going to cost 5 points at least be half as good as the Troop next time...<br />
<br />
7. Tower Assassin... why not?<br />
<br />
8. More of the 3 twilight guys... The 3 twilight Uruk-hai are quite possibly the best minions in the game (after the Troop!).  Scout is not as good, but can really help get rid of minions at the beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
9. Conditions: Traitors Voice!?!?!  Works very well with Worry, as does Uruk-hai rampage... why try to slow them when you can do it for sure.  5 burdens with Worry is no problem.  The Witch King works great with Worry, and it will make your opponents scratch their head real hard...<br />
<br />
10. Events: Beyond the Height is too crucial to the Uruk strategy to only have 1 and Saruman&#39;s power is a very underated card that is great for a little surprise when Legolas/Gandalf/Aragorn are relying too much on those Vitality adders or Aragorn&#39;s just plain kicking your @$$ with Last Alliance.<br />
<br />
I think this deck is a pretty good adaptation of some of those great decks out there, but I wouldn&#39;t be posting it if I didn&#39;t value your opinion.  I ask for your most constructive criticism... I would like to play this deck in a tourney at the end of the week and want any help I can get.  Oh, last note... only 3 Savageries and 3 Troops?  Both are cards that tend to sit in your hand longer than they should, but yet both are sooooooo powerful, so I think 3 rather than 4 is a good balance.<br />
