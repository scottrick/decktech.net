I was talking with a friend yesterday about LOTR and how much I miss playing it regularly. Unfortunately, with the holidays and all, LOTR is not going to be played for another week or two. I need to keep the flame alive, so I thought I&#39;d post the deck I&#39;ve had so much fun with over the last month or so.<br />
<br />
The fellowship is insane. It practically auto-wins against anything thats not corruption and has a chance against most corruption with the right draws. You give a little more pool early game than Dwarf is used to giving, since Gandalf comes down and his Sword is expensive, plus at some point you may need to Sleep away some stuff vs. Besiegers and Ninja Gollum. The trade off is an even BIGGER Durin and an unkillable fellowship guaranteeing the double to 3 without much damage. Gandalf provides the reliable condition removal, burden removal(albeit expensive) and a solid companion in the late game. <br />
The rest of the fellowship plays just like Dwarf always does. Play a lot of stuff for free, have 1 HUGE companion, 1 slightly smaller companion and a HUGE ringbearer who can wear any of the gear your other companions tote going into 9. You have a solid pumper which is recurrable via Guile, healing via Fury, wound prevention via Bracers and Swarm protection via Here Lies Balin. <br />
<br />
The fun part is the shadow side. The roaming orcs are pretty cool and have the potential for some pretty busted plays at site 2 before the fellowship is set up. If you can play Advance Captain, Advance Marauder and Advance Regular, I would expect a kill or 2. Gollum provides protection against big Legs through Final Strike and gives pump to anyone when he doesn&#39;t need to distract an Elf. Since possessions are coming back full force, MIKE the Troll can be insane and is relatively cheap. It&#39;s a bonus that he gets a damage bonus/pump from the Advance fellas. <br />
Ithil Stone is obvious, but whats less obvious is the Barren Land which has turned out to be rather good. It&#39;s the only card in the deck that Galadriel can kill but should it stick around for a turn it is better than a third Ithil Stone since you can have it out WITH an Ithil Stone. <br />
<br />
I hope this was interesting, but keep in mind: If you decide to play this shadow and your opponent is decimating you just smile and remember &quot;My guy has a skull hat on!&quot;<br />
