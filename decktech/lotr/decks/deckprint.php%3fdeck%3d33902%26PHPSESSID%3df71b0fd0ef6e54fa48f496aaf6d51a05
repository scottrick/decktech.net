You use Sam to get 4 cards in hand, one of them being servant of the secret fire or get 3 cards in hand if you dont have a servant in your hand.  Then if you have erland gandalf, sam, a light on his mind, 2 TSCs, and a servant of the secret fire in your discard pile.  If these conditions are met you can use erland to get a servant, regaining initiative, then use it to heal 2x and remove a burden.  You can keep playing this until all minions are overwhelmed and all companions are fully healed.  You could do this as much as you want but ur screwed if u move to cavern enterance or they have a sarmuns power.  The new gandlaf event final account is to get bound to its fate from your discard pile.<br />
<br />
The shadow is built off of the best orc card in this set, bound to its fate.  if they do not have a burden u can add a burden for one twilight and replay it with isengard underlings.  Isengard underlings can be replayed with goblin hordes and evil smelling fens.  if your not playing elvent you can add 2-4 burdens realisticly every turn.  If you are playing elvent, you need to run with your fellowship.  If your playing elvent/uruks you have to grab some sand, throw it in your opponents eyes and bolt out of there.  Mocking goblin and Gollum can also occasionaly add burdens.  Last night in playtesting i was able to corrupt a shire country side deck that used frodo RH and the ring of rings.  No sam makes this deck very deadly. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
