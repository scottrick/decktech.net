This is basically the deck I took to the Washington State TOC.  Versions of it have gone 9-7, including the 4-2 finish at the TOC.  It&#39;s a bit of a surprise deck, fooling most people who haven&#39;t seen the cardlist or have no experience with the deck&#39;s strategy.  It especially fooled people in my area since I constructed it out of a direct damage sauron deck i had previously built, so they didn&#39;t know what to expect.  And by the way, I like to build crazy kinda decks because I&#39;m the local Product Champion, so people could get upset if I always win...so I kinda let people roll over me sometimes, give them a fun game and play odd strategies that don&#39;t see much play.<br />
<br />
The basic point of this deck is to win with the Shadow side.  Sometimes you&#39;ll find yourself within easy reach of site 9, in which case you can probably handle it because you have all the tools to keep Frodo alive: Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Greenleaf to kill off excess minions, Raragorn for Defender +3, Boromir SOD to pump up Frodo, and the obligatory Bounder and PATHS.  Plus Frodo is usually about 7 strength on his own, with a Mithril Coat limiting the damage he&#39;ll take from Uruks and negating Moria weapons bonuses, two very necessary things IMHO.  I also focus heavily on Arwen with her power-ups, because she rocks and Nazgul are kind of popular where I play.<br />
<br />
But the Shadow side is the real beauty.  Desperate Defenses add burdens, especially when the Inquisitors knock cards out of the opponent&#39;s hand.  This strategy sometimes leads people to believe I&#39;m playing a discard deck, so they choose to add the burdens more often (which is very very good).  Twilight Witchkings also add burdens by over-wounding Frodo since many people over-exert him with Sting and other stuff that exerts companions.  So I rack up some burdens on Frodo...usually about 4 is enough.  To take advantage of those burdens, i&#39;ve got guys like Toldea and Enquea, and of course Enduring Evil.  I patiently wait for the chance as I whittle away at my opponent&#39;s companions, until he assigns a Sauron orc to the Ringbearer.  Thin and Stretched often helps with this...players see burdens racking up because Frodo isn&#39;t fighting, so they try to assign him to something he can beat, only with Enduring Evil, he can&#39;t beat them because his power is suddenly less than half my orc&#39;s, and Frodo dies.  3 out of my 4 wins at the TOC were due to a surprise Enduring Evil.  It&#39;s a great way to win, especially when some people haven&#39;t even seen the card before.  Unfortunately, once people see the deck, they immediately know how to beat it, and i&#39;ve noticed that knowing the strategy really hurts the deck; i can hardly beat my brother with it anymore.  So this thing doesn&#39;t have much of a shelf-life.  but it&#39;s a hell of a lot of fun to play when it works.<br />

Thanks for reading, try it out and suggest any helpful improvements.<br />
