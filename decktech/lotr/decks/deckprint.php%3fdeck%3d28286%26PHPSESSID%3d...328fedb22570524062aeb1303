"FP: Not bad, but it&#39;d only take a few extra slots to work in the Horn which would make it considerably better IMO (and it fits the x-list theme). I can see running multiples of some really important cards here, since you&#39;ve got the cycling capabilites, but this deck isn&#39;t all that big @ 72, so you might swap out a few duplicates. <br />
<br />
Shadow: Flankers seem out of place as nobody should be double-moving into seven, the site that matters, unless they&#39;re pulling some wacky Deft in Their Movements stunt (which I suspect some people will try in standard). The second Relics is redundant, switch to third Scavenger since all you&#39;ve got are the Scimitars. Tower Assassin and Grima not as good as Warrior + Forger/Shaman. (+10 tp, Double-Edged Sword)"<br />

Hey, I&#39;m not mad, but this is absolutely wrong. It&#39;s not a Boromir&#39;s Horn deck largely because it doesn&#39;t play Boromir. Were I to play Boromir and his Horn, I would likely start Boromir (to make sure I had him before the Horn). Then, maybe, I&#39;d be inclined to pair him with Merry and search for Aragorn--but that would be *dead* wrong. The goal of the deck is to use the proven synergy between choke and swarm. I give almost nothing when I move to site 2. Typically less than 5 twilight. If I had Boromir and Merry, I&#39;d work with, most likely, 9 or so twilight on my first move. What&#39;s the difference? 9 twilight enables *anyone* to play shadow cards. If you give only 4 twilight, you&#39;ll see NO uruks or nazgul. And only a total possible 2 Runners or 1 Sauron orc.<br />
<br />
Flankers are definitely not out of place. Read my tournament report if you doubt their efficacy. Flankers are the backbone of a good swarm deck. No other orc can count on winning skirmishes. Flankers have strength and, with 3 vitality, some staying power. True, the deck is about the swarm, but there&#39;s no reason to give your opponent any free double-moves.<br />
<br />
Grima didn&#39;t prove too useful in the tournament, but only because most players put less than 2 cards on their companions. Or, in the game against Andy Kimmes where he put 3 and eventually 4 cards on Aragorn, I raced first to site 9. Otherwise, I would have pulled Grima from my discard (either with the site or Nertea) to get rid of Aragorn&#39;s Bow. I can&#39;t tell you how vital it is for a swarm deck to get rid of directed archery.<br />
****END RESPONSE****<br />
<br />
****BEGIN ORIGINAL STRATEGY****<br />
This is the ultimate choke early but still has the potential to run to site 9 (I could hardly believe it myself; read more for details).<br />
<br />
Bid 0, maybe 1. Why give your opponent his or her choice of minion at site 9? No reason. Bid low.<br />
<br />
Go second if you can, first if you have to. Either way.<br />
<br />
This is a lot like the Choke/Swarm deck that people were playing back in Fellowship days, so I guess I almost have to give props to Alex Tennet.<br />
<br />
The idea is to stack orcs on your swarms and eventually overwhelm Frodo, aiming for site 7. Of course, that doesn&#39;t always work, so you have the ability to stay in the race, too. But, um, if you&#39;re wondering how, the deck&#39;s probably not for you. (Essentially, you keep your fellowship a wee, tiny thing until site 6 and then explode by playing up to 7 or 8 companions and just deal with Enquea one turn and take some deaths and get to 9 anyway.)<br />
<br />
The twilight choke clogs your opponent&#39;s hand, giving him or her few to no options during his or her fellowship turns. More and more orcs come down, stack on the swarms. The Cave Troll kills a companion here, a companion there, and you find yourself playing 7 orcs against 5 companions. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
Gandalf and Sentinels give the deck problems, but don&#39;t kill it outright. If you see Gandalf, expect your swarm only to slow your opponent. This means that you have to win the race. Not so hard since the choke is so effective, with directed archery and a strength 7 Frodo who only takes one wound per skirmish, that you can typically double-move from 1 to 3 (if you have to), 4 to 6, 7 to 9.<br />
<br />
But it&#39;s a choke deck, and if your opponent isn&#39;t taking a big lead in the race, then move only one site per turn.<br />
<br />
The Uruk Bomb plays maybe 5 minions against you. Tops. During the course of the game. You want an Uruk player to move to your site 5, of course, and then, typically, they&#39;ll have a maximum of 7 twilight with which to bomb your 4 companions (which is about the right number by then). No bomb.<br />
<br />
Use Sting often. Look at your opponent&#39;s minions and their twilight costs. Do the math. Don&#39;t add enough into the pool for them to play them.<br />
<br />
Nenya recycles 2 cards every regroup phase. I can&#39;t say how wonderful it is to ditch two fellowship cards for your upcoming shadow turn. Mind you, this is before you reconcile. You then ditch a *third* card with your discard. It&#39;s a TAC for the "light side."<br />
<br />
This deck lost one game only at MN Territorials, during the final confrontation, as I was checking my watch, late to meet with my brother, and played stupidly, failing to read the game text of Mitch Kimmes&#39; site 7, which was the same as my own. So... instead of killing Pippin and Merry, I killed Frodo and lost.<br />
<br />
The deck beat Mitch during the open, though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it&#39;s the X-List Special, because when I designed the friggin&#39; thing in desperation at 3 AM the night before the tourney, I just decided to assemble all the X-List cards I felt like using. This was the result, and it&#39;s absolutely beautiful.<br />
<br />
(If you like your friends, don&#39;t play this against them.)<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
