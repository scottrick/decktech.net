Bid 3 and go first. If your opponent wants to bid more than that the shadow should stop them. This deck should be able hopefully to double move pretty easily. I would get out Dammed Gate Stream for site 1 and pull Follow Smeagol to see many of your sites. Pull Aragorn from a site 3 Prancing Pony. Kill Quickbeam off as he is only there to protect the hobbits early. Make Merry as strong as possible first and then strengthen the other hobbits. Get out Kept Safe to prevent wounds to hobbits and Tom to cancel skirmishes. Every time that you want to double move play Narrow Escape to discard 2 minions and Aragorn will kill another because you can spot 3 unbound hobbits. That makes doubling pretty easy when you can get rid of 3 minions in the regroup. On the second move, use Smeagol&#39;s text to exhaust minions and then use Don&#39;t Look at Them to kill. Once Smeagol wins that skirmish, play Don&#39;t Follow the Lights to get rid of another minion. Pull Caras Galadhon for site 9 and no matter how many companions you have left, Frodo will have a hard time dying.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
It&#39;s pretty straight foward. Get a polearm on a captain whenever possible. There is some great overwhelming potential. If they use Cirdan to try and kill the captain, slap down a suprising Red Wrath. With Surging Up, they will either have to stop and not double or add 2 burdens which bumps up the strenth bracket on the captain. With polearm on blademaster, he can exert to make himself damage +1 and use agressor to heal him and repeat. Have Fun<br />

Any Suggestionas Appreciated<br />
