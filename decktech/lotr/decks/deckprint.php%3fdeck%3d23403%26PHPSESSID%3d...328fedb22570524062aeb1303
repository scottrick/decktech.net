The Uruk-hai add burdens for a corruption of either 10 burdens or through Irrisistable Shadow.<br />
<br />
First off, this deck is made of up only cards I own. (I don&#39;t like to borrow cards!) There are a few cards I&#39;d like to add to the deck (Savagery to Match Their Numbers, Uruk Guard) but for now, here it is.<br />
<br />
Bid 1 token. If you win, make the opponent go first to use your Sites 2, 3, and 4. (Probably using all of your sites.) If you lose, assume they bid high to go first. In that case you&#39;ll still use your sites.<br />
<br />
The fellowship strategy is to keep the twilight pool as low as possible. Normally you can handle anything as long as you move slowly, and keep it below 10 twilight tokens. Rare Gimli is a beast. Avoid using your Hobbit Stealths unless you have to.<br />
<br />
Nazgul - Keep the twilight low to keep these expensive baddies off the table. Gimli should be able to handle one and Farin can handle the other with a little help and luck. In a pinch use the Hobbit Stealth to avoid wounds. Watch out for Black Breath and Blade Tip!!!! That combo will kill this deck.<br />
<br />
Moria - Especially difficult to keep the twilight low enough with, but you have to try. Be prepared for a big battle at Site 5. Don&#39;t let them win skirmishes at all costs! Move slowly to avoid swarms. Generally Moria swarm is helping you our by discarding cards themselves. Play patiently, and by site 6 you&#39;ll have almost no opposition. If they play &quot;big Moria&quot; (without swarms) play it like you play against Nazgul.<br />
<br />
Isengard - Keep the twilight low and you&#39;ll face 2-3 at the most early on. Watch out for Saruman&#39;s Snows and take it like a man. (= Lurtz might be nasty, but Gimli likes the way he tastes with eggs and toast. Fror is great for getting around a Troop of Uruk-hai&#39;s gametext.<br />
<br />
Sauron - They are expensive, and you&#39;re keeping the twilight low. (= Watch out for the minions that wound during a skirmish. Orc Bowmen and Hate will not be appreciated. <br />
<br />
Save Boromir and Sam until you&#39;re ready to move to Site 6. The new Sam is great for this deck. Exert him twice to take 2 minions and Discontent of Our People will let a Dwarf handle 2 or 3. If your strategy is working, your fellowship is moving along fine, making your opponent discard as often as possible. <br />
<br />
The shadow half of the deck is designed to make the opponent discard some and add burdens. Get Worry out as soon as possible. Save Hate for an unsuspecting Legolas or Aragorn. Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re unable to play a lot of minions early on, just get those conditions out and do your damage. You&#39;ll be surprise how quickly the damage +1 and burdens start to hurt your opponent. Consider Uruk Ragers, Uruk-hai Swords and Bred for Battle is you think it&#39;ll help.<br />
<br />
And finally, this deck is designed primarially for one-on-one play. However I have come to learn that it is also an excellent deck for multiplayer. Those extra shadow phases really hurt your opponent&#39;s decks. Also, after you get Greatest Kingdom of My People out, and you hit a Goblin Runner with a Dwarven Axe and add 2 Nobody Tosses a Dwarf, you&#39;ll find your opponents prefer to play their minions against the other players, rather than you. (= It is also designed to not be rare intensive. Many of the rares in this deck can be replaced with commons and uncommons. The only rares I think are necessary are Gimli x1, Nobody Tosses a Dwarf x3, The One Ring x1, and Irrisistable Shadow x2. Everything else can be replaced.<br />
<br />
Look at the following non-rare cards to fill in if needed:<br />
Orc Hunter<br />
Orc Soldier<br />
Tower Lieutentant<br />
Uruk Rager<br />
Urak-hai Raiding Party<br />
Urak-hai Sword<br />
<br />
I hope you all enjoy the deck. (=<br />
