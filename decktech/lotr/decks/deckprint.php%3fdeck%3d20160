   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK the goal is to win the bid, and make your opponent go first.  Now if for some reason your opponent wins the bid, and then chooses you to go first, then you will do something different with your starting guys.  Start Legolas instead of Sam, and then get him with your starting site.  Some of you may want to play this deck that way anyway, not me, I really like my site 2 and 3 it gets them on the defense right away.  Keep your hobbits alive by using Stealth..you have enough in this deck.. And when you can pick them off with Dagger strike, then do it.<br />
<br />
Personally I like to save all of my stealth cards until after site 5 and use them for power bonuses to win battles, because that is better, but when you have to, you have to.  Not to mention Boromir, with the power cards you will win battles, I have, and I still can&#39;t believe people put, this deck doesn&#39;t win battles...HA<br />
<br />
THIS DECK HAS NOT LOST YET. Against swarm you have many options, first this Deck has a talent for not being seen, and that card is money... <br />
<br />
Also Archer&#39;s and a Power according to his Stature is money when they think they have it. All of the sites chosen were done well, and were tested, so I wouldn&#39;t change any except maybe site 2, but I will leave that to you. <br />
<br />
As far as the Shadow part, well it is Nazgul, and Nazgul slow the Opponent down the best IMO. Which means you will either kill them sooner... OR beat them to Site 9. The condition chosen on the Shadow deck was chosen with care and tested, <br />
<br />
It beats Archer deck&#39;s, and handles itself good against anything they can do.  Relentless Charge will kill them more times than they can handle. Everycard is important.<br />
<br />
If you like All blades perish then add another and take out Bent on Discorvery, that is there, because I just like it OK :)  This deck is already built for multi or single, in either style you will shine and smile at site 9 before your opponent.<br />
<br />
Have fun and enjoy,<br />
