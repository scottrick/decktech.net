By using The Prancing Pony as the first site you will be able to get Aragorn out in the first instance as well, given that you are going first. This deck is mainly designed as an archery deck with shadow cards that when used correctly will slow down your opponent and pick off a few members of their Fellowship if things go your way.<br>
<br>
Ensure you fellowship remains at four members unless you need to play a Lorien Elf to absorb an inevitable amount of wounds or your getting swamped. However, if you reach site 7 with more than four companions the extra archery fire will set you back. Save all your other companions for cases of death only.<br>
<br>
Use the allies to your advantage; they are the best resource you have. Elrond can help you get more cards out of your draw deck quickly, whilst Celeborn will increase Elrond&#8217;s usefulness by healing him during the Fellowship phase. Galadriel too will help you play your Elven Allies and companions for free. With both Galadriel and Elrond in play all of your allies will be healed at the start of every turn. When you reach site 6, Uruviel will take on the game text and you can exert her each fellowship phase to check out what the opponent has in store for you. This is useful when deciding to make a dash for site 9 or not.<br>
<br>
The rest of the free people cards are there for extra umph! Double Shot will add that extra 1 to the archery total and the Elven Bows will also allow non-Archer Elves to jump in on the fun. Bounder will prevent Frodo from being Overwhelmed in those desperate times and What are they is best used early to get rid of that annoying roaming minion.<br>
<br>
The shadow cards are not there to kill off a fellowship but rather annoy your opponent so you can slip away. Save your Wicth Kings for moments when you know they will be assigned to a strong member of the Fellowship like Arwen and then pump him up with All Veils removed to make it impossible for him to lose the skirmish. <br>
<br>
All Blades perish will assist in getting rid of wounds from that annoying archery fire so your Nazgul are still around for the Skirmish phase, and the same goes for Relentless charge except this helps to get rid of those archers all together, and really annoy another archery deck. Their Power is in Terror will also reduce the usefulness of any pesky allies.<br>
<br>
Morgul Gates will get more of the Nazgul out with more Shadow to play with whilst Morgul Skulker will come in handy at later sites where most of your Nazgul may be in the discard pile.<br>
Playing Black Breath and Blade Tip together will mean that when a Nazgul (Best used for the Witch King who should win his skirmish) wins a skirmish the effect is felt more strongly by your opponent, which will give you the upper hand again at the later sites.<br>
<br>
If you can, play Attea when the twilight cost is low and use the saved tokens to beef him up in a skirmish. Neyla is also useful early and don&#8217;t forget to use him to change the sites over if you need to and can afford to exert him. Save Lemenya for when Blade Tip of Black Breath has been placed onto a Free Peoples player, as they will be strength &#8211;2. Cantea, Ostea, Nertea and Toldea are mainly to make up the numbers with more Minions but can be useful if the current situation permits. <br>
