<br />
Since everyone plays prancing pony, it doesnt matter too much if you go first or not, but if you think they arent playing the pony, bid what you must to go first, as aragorn is pretty nice to start with.<br />
<br />
the free peoples is pretty much standard. use elves/rangers/archers with the stupidly broken rangers versatility to kill the oppenents minions, as moving at a cautious pace. this deck is more shadow oriented than free peoples oriented. try to move twice a turn if you can, but use common sense and dont move if someone is gonna die.<br />
<br />
ok, now for the shadow strat section.<br />
<br />
enquea is the man, why else play four of him. use your other nazgul, with morgul gates for cheapness, to get out and win some skirmishes, and use ringwraith&#39;s wake to burden frodo like crazy. after frodo has 5 burdens on him, start dropping enqueas left and right, every turn. read him again, he can exert to wound, and has 4 vitality.. whaaat? yea, so use him to put 3 wounds on a companion each turn, which gets pretty unnerving if you are playing against this. witch-king, enquea and the others are nice all around, even if they manage to keep the burdens off of frodo. I think the rest of the cards are self-explanatory, morgul guys for recycling, blades for power, yada yada yada<br />
<br />
why no blade tips/black breaths? lets face it, that stuff is cute, but everyone and their gay uncle plays 4 athelas, and thats just not cool vs tips/breaths<br />
<br />
ok, keep in mind this is my first LOTR submission, and im pretty new to LOTR, so i dont care if you give this a one star or whatever, i would just really appriciate it if you gave me some cards to take out and some to put in to make the deck not suck. also, if someone did the enquea thing before me, im sorry, didnt mean to copy you, but i seriously thought enquea/wake combo on my own..<br />
<br />
thanks for reading<br />
