The best Elf Gondor by Stefanos Kehagias    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok many of you will say that this deck is a very common sight.However i have not seen this deck somewhere else so i post it.The fellowship in my opinion is one of the strongest i have seen.It is very effective against many shadows.Arwen and Aragorn can win almost everything-even the Balrog!And not only win but kill!Two cards are the keys of the fellowship:Elrond and agility.Elrond offers you healing condition removal and he can even stack your opponent&#39;s hand.Agility on the other hand is horribly powerful...It is a &quot;Servant&quot; for the Elves and 2 &quot;Servants&quot; for Aragorn...I must admit i have some problems with swarming(moria+Isengard minions) that&#39;s why i have two curse their foul feet,Boromir,Severed his bonds and a second ring bearer.I will write now what form should the fellowship have according tto the opposite shadow.<br />
against moria swarm:Arwen Leg Arag Boromir<br />
against dunlads:Arwen Arag Leg Faramir<br />
against Nazgul:Arwen Aragorn(Boromir for7-9)<br />
against uruk hai:Arwen Aragorn and Faramir<br />
against Sauron:Arwen Arag Leg Faramir(replace him with Boromir at site 6,7)<br />
against Easterlings:Arwen Aragorn Faramir Sam<br />
Generally if i am carefull i will not have  any problem with any shadow(exept warg riders...)<br />
I believe my Sauron minion is a very good and solid shadow.The Desert lord-Hate combo is sth that many people fear.Before threat come up to the game this shadow was much.People killed companions that they didn&#39;t need to prevent the main fellowship from being damaged.There i played Sauron&#39;s defenses(If you can spot 3 companions in the dead pile the move limit is -1 for this turn).Some people here in Greece know how powerful this card is...I will only say that when the top Greek player and top player of the world Thanassis Kanouris at Day 1 world cup last year underestimated this shadow lost his two hobbits(DH deck)at site 3!<br />
With this minion at the last PSQ i managed 4 shadow kills totally in 6 games.Finally when decipher banned frying pan i had no more doubts of my shadow&#39;s strength... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
