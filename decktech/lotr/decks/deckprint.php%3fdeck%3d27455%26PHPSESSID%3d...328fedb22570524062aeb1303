 I typically rely on my shadow to do serious damage at site 5 where I usually own at least one if not two sites by then.  Pulling saruman to make them fierce and playing the Mob/Horde/Marauder for -2 makes it easy to get 3-5 minions out. <br />
<br />
Burning of Westfold is pretty self explanatory - kill trust me, last alliance, etc..<br />
<br />
Broad bladed sword Try to use with the Orthanc Champion when I get one of their key companions exhausted or near death if they dont have armor ( str 14 +1 damage and you cant wound it during archery with the sword allowing it to exert to assign itself to a companion)<br />
<br />
Savageries are what I prefer to use. Friends keep telling me to use Sarumans ambition so as not to clog your hand but I like the ambush nature of the savageries so they never know whats coming.<br />
<br />
Nertea is great against big fellowships especially in the late game when most of my site control minions are coming out for free or maybe 2 shadow. <br />
<br />
Fellowship<br />
<br />
I wanted to try something different.  Sometimes it works well, others <shrug> pretty crappy.  Was hoping to post and get some good advice on that side of it.<br />
<br />
Defend it and Hope is such a key card to the fellowship making up for lack of archery and if I go to 6 or more companions can save me from Enquea killing a healthy Eomer or Eowyn. Also good againt Uruk archery decks.<br />
<br />
Hope in Doubt and Need, An honorable charge are there to help me win skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Armor Keep thinking about adding it in but usually have done ok so far without it. <br />
<br />
Helm Helm there to recap sites and if they arent using site control who cant use another 3 cards in the regroup phase possibly allowing you to double move when you didnt have much in your hand. <br />
<br />
I look forward to hearing your comments and suggestions.<br />
