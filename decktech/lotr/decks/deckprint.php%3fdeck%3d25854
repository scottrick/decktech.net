<br>
First, the free peoples. The free peoples are meant to survive, help your deck flow, and add a little to the discard. They are solid and can beat most shadow sides in many ways. You want to go first and pull your Aragorn. Bid 5 or 6, but if you don&#39;t get him its Ok. The deck is stocked with 9 companions. Once you start, go one site a turn. You may feel you can move ahead of your opponent but it is most wise not to. You need to get set up in the beginning. Your sites are nice (Eregion Hills, Valley of the Silverlode for Gift of Boats). Oh yeah, before I go on I must say every companion is sacrificial if it is a necessary time.<br>
<br>
Once again survive with your free peoples. How do you do this. First off, Frodo protection. I believe PATHS and Sting are adequate with 8 other companions waiting to pop up. Secondly is healing. I do this with the unique method of Shoulder to Shoulder. Let your Dwarves soak up the wounds and heal them next maneuver phase with your Elven allies. This tactic becomes really factory-like with Galadriel and Elrond. They heal everyone including themselves at the start of turn so those wounds just transfered to them will be gone at the start of next turn. Shoulder to Shoulder works with every companion except the Hobbits, Aragorn, and Gandalf so try to heal them at the sanctuaries. Gandalf is not really key at all, but I figured might as well throw him in since he would likely be power 9 or 10 all the time.<br>
<br>
Another feature of the people is throughput. Different sources of card drawing are abundant through Elrond, Delving, and the Book of Marzabul. Aragorn is handy keeping you from flooding the pool if you have the luxury of starting him.<br>
<br>
Finally, discardation is on the side for the free peoples. Use What Are We Waiting For to make the opponent draw up more cards are get rid of them. Only 1 Nobody Tosses is necessary because the dwarves aren&#39;t meant to win but to survive. Greatest Kingdom is massive against Orcs. Finally, check out the classic Gift of Boats ploy. If your opponent has no deck or only eight cards (a likely occurance), you can triple from 6 to 9.<br>
<br>
On to the shadow where discardation is hardcore. Orc Inquisitors and Uruk Soldiers cause instant discards while Tower Assassins and Uruk Ragers have triggered discards that can be done. I include lots of trackers because I want to play minions early and often. You may not be impressed with the quality of the minions but they discard and there are a whole swarm (27) of them. Orc Butchers are beautiful and are usually something like power 10 most of the game.<br>
<br>
Other discarding cards that are amazing are Desperate Defense of the Ring, Desperate Measures, and Tower of Dur. I like desperate defense because lots of minions = lots of triggers. If they don&#39;t discard, burdens activate Desperate Measures. Desperate Measures = 5 dead cards. Excellent card. Finally, Tower of Barad-dur works for me. Two out in the late game is annoying for the opponent because they can&#39;t save their whole nice hand. The Irrestible Shadow is instant win so it should be there if the opportunity arises (often does). Last bit of strategy on the shadow: Make sure you have the orcs for the site 8 stop.<br>
<br>
Overall, keep it safe with your free peoples and bring down a discard chainsaw with your shadow. Pull off Gift of Boats-Site 8 Orc Stop or Irrestible Shadow if possible, but otherwise just outrun the opponent at the later sites, your deck will be better stocked at that time, and win solidly.<br>
<br>
Rebuttals and Refutations:<br>
If you think Old Noakes is wicked, I will tell you the Tower Assassin is even more wicked. Sleep hurts but it can&#39;t stop Desperate Measures. For the Free Peoples, Enquea and the Tower Assassin like to invite me to their parties, but I tend to give them the cold Shoulder to Shoulder. If Uruks are about to get savage I will throw them meat before they get fierce. (Stay to 4 companions if you have more in your hand, maybe intentionally kill some off). I have tested this deck. It can discard 82 card decks by site 7.<br>

Have fun playing LOTR and try out different decks all the time. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
