Adventure deck<br />
   You can really mix it up how you want.  Basically, just fit however many battlegrounds, then forests as work with your metagame.  I go with the battlegrounds first to hopefully not help out those forest-nazgul decks any more than they need.<br />

   Quelled    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, the fellowship is not extremely strong when it comes to skirmishing, I&#39;ll give you that.  But, I have rarely had to fight more than one minion at a time once site 4 and higher rolls around.  There are so many ways to wound minions in this deck it&#39;s crazy.  You&#39;ll have less headaches too over those silly cards that let minions only take wounds in the skirmish phase, because plenty of it happens there.  The best way I can explain the synergy here is to just go card by card, as there is no linear game plan to the gunning.  I always try to go first to get out the dammed gate stream for whatever smeagol card you need most, then just run from there.<br />
<br />
Frodo - muster to cycle through faster and maybe lose initiative one more time.<br />
Faramir and faramir&#39;s sword - makes those minions forget where their home is for pippin to sneak in and bushwhack &#39;em.<br />
Aragorn and anduril - basically just a solid fighter who can switch a couple sites and be the second gondorian for hardy garrison.<br />
Pippin and Merry - these sneaky little hobbits will soak up lots of archery, shoot a lot of bad guys, remove burdens when you play them back down, and possibly make you gain and lose initiative 3 times in one phase.  Oh yeah, merry can get you back them rohirrim helms too.<br />
Gandalf - plain and simple : lose initiative<br />
Rohirrim guard - initiative play and some extra wounding<br />
Eowyn - have her fight the minion who started play with the highest vitality and she&#39;ll clean up shop.<br />
Smeagol, Don&#39;t look at them, Follow smeagol - These three cards will wipe out a minion for you, lose initiative, help cycle, and get out a battleground when you need it.  works for me.<br />
Unheeded, Shadowplay, Hardy Garrison - these are your main weapons in the deck.  They will throw down a lot of wounds.<br />
Home and hearth, A light in his mind - Removes those burdens that get your undeededs back, and whatever the shadow throws at you.<br />
Birthday present - recurring unheededs is good, especially when those wounds just slip right off as those hobbits hide in your hand.<br />
Rohirrim helm - an extra source for exerting, or just cancel that skirmish with the big nasty guy that you just can&#39;t seem to kill.  <br />
Brooding on tomorrow - straightforward.  kill some conditions.<br />
Sting - just in case frodo or smeagol find themselves in a scrap.<br />
<br />
The only minion that comes to mind that I really worry about is Shelob.  Eight vitality is hard to knock down.  Fortunately you have some dudes with high vitalities to eat some fighting for a while.  I dunno maybe some room for make hastes would be good, but I don&#39;t know what to cut.  Elsewise, this fellowship holds pretty good against a lot of shadows.  Enduring nazgul never get a chance to do anything.  Archery gets soaked up everywhere.  Swarms usually have vitalities you can deal with easily, and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
As for the shadow side, the main idea is to get Castamir a little damage +1 action.  I&#39;ll admit, for the first 2-4 sites, you do nothing but set up, but after that you can chew up a lot of stuff.  The best thing I can say is that you just throw away a bunch of cards at the beginning, knowing your Ships of great draught will get the important ones back.  The shadow side doesn&#39;t need a lot of explanation, it just packs a punch.<br />
