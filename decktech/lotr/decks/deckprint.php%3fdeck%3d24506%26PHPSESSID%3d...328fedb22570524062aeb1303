<br />
i try and get as much stuff as i can out fast,  so i draw as many cards as possible with elrond and mirror twice everyturn i can with galadrial  and i heal the elf allies respctably with celeborn who i forgot to put on the side.  i also try to move as quickly as possible form site to site.  to keep them back.  or try to keep up so when they one step you can double step and then go for the win that way.<br />
<br />
or let them step to your site 6 and move to 9 with gift of boats,  by that time they should be out of if not almost out of cards.<br />
<br />
just remeber the mirror and galadrial are cruicial for pulling minion out and then playing what are we waitng for to try and get them to skip their shadow phase.<br />
<br />
SHADOW SIDE<br />
<br />
 the whole piont for this side is to do what the fellowship doeas also is to mill and stop them from double stepping as much as possible.  i use the desperate defense of the ring early to add burdens quickly.  but then i take them off with the desperate measuers which mills 5 cards form their draw deck.  band of the eye is huge he does a wound and also makes them discard cards at random from their hand.  you must hate sam off as soon as possible because he is annoying when you are trying to add burdens and he keeps taking them off.  but that is generally how the deck works.<br />
<br />
forgot to say that you need to add <br />
<br />
1 gift of boats<br />
1 celeborn<br />
<br />
and<br />
2 tower assassins </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
