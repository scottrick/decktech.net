It recently went 5-0 at a PSQ with four Shadow kills and one Free Peoples win, and it could have won every single game both ways.  Here is a record of how the Shadow did in each game.<br />
<br />
Game 1: Shadow kill, site 7 (15 burdens added)<br />
Game 2: Shadow kill, site 4 (7 burdens added)<br />
Game 3: Shadow kill, site 7 (9 burdens added, bad draws)<br />
Game 4: Shadow kill, site 4 (8 burdens added)<br />
Game 5: Free peoples win (8 burdens added with him at site 6)<br />
<br />
The shadow is just a regular old Enquea deck with two additions: Toldea MoM and Sense of Obligation.  Sense of Obligation gives you a repeating burden engine, which greatly improves a problem the old Enquea deck had—it could very easily run out of velocity once the Enqueas and BNAPs had been mostly used up.  Sense of Obligation also makes the rest of the deck more versatile at adding burdens.  BNAP gets burdens even when not used with Enquea—Nelya + BNAP is a sweet combo that allows you to exert for Keening Wail/Bent then heal back up and use BNAP in the fierce to trigger Sense with the pool you just added.  The addition of Toldea MoM means that once you get four burdens on them the burdens keep coming at a rate that is impossible to stop.  With most of these shadow kills, given more sites, a total of 25 or more burdens would be possible.  With three Sense of Obligations out Toldea adds six burdens a turn, as does Enquea + BNAP.  If the FP lets the combo get going there isn’t anything they can do to slow down the burden onslaught.<br />
<br />
The way to combat this shadow is to remove the Sense of Obligations by any methods necessary.  This either involves either using condition removal against them or just killing off any comp that gets Sensed.  One of the side effects of playing so many burden cards is that the deck is TERRIBLE at skirmishing.  I got one kill of a companion all day, and that was an accident with Nelya and BNAP killing Boromir SoD while I was triggering Senses.  The key for stopping the burden engine is keeping the number of unbound companions down.  Because there is really isn’t a way to win with strength, if the fellowship can run off three comps, it should, because that means Toldea, BNAP, and such will only generate one extra burden.  Also, killing down the comps will help choke the Nazgul out, which isn’t terribly effective (the shadow runs on one minion at a time) but it can help hold off BNAP and Keening Wail to a degree.  Burden removal isn’t an effective method against this deck, as it will either be removed with Buckland Homestead, or, in the case of events, it won’t be enough.  Same holds true for Proud and Able.<br />
<br />
The fellowship is just a standard dwarf/Smeagol build that everyone uses—if you need help with it there are better people to ask than me.<br />
