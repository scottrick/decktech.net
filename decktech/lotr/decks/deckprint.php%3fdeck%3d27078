<br />
The sites, these may need a little tweeking - but for right now they play nicely into the Nazgul theme.  And as I see it, many players use Uruk-hai so these sights may or may not affect the depending on how you or your opponent move.<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
<br />
Bid no more than 3.  Because your opponent won&#39;t bid high if he/she knows you have lots&#39;o Nazgul.  Those Silly Nazgul will lay waste to FP.  Anyway -If you bid 3 and go first. pull out Aragorn.  This is not key, but it helps get you deck going.  And you have a fighter.  <br />
<br />
ELVES (COMPANIONS)- there are not many companions.  And you really don&#39;t too many.  You have a lot of support cards, which beef up your Companions.  If you must, use the Lorien Elves as fodder.  That way you save Haldir, Aragorn, Leggy, and Arwen.<br />
<br />
ALLIES - Play them as you pull them.  You have &quot;Point and Shoot&quot; Legolas.  And Aragorn can heal Arwen, Galadriel can heal any Elf.  Elrond can heal anyone (even himself at Fellowship time).  There are a lot of ALLIES, because ALLIES help you win.  <br />
<br />
BURDENS - There is nothing you can do about removing burdens.  SO don&#39;t take many.  You can do that...Frodo has a Vitality of 5...use that.<br />
<br />
MINIONS - Nazgul.  Expensive.  However they stop roaming very early on.  And you can play at least one a site.  Plus you have some nasty conditions and events that will make you opponent pull his/her hair.  These guys have so far been know to overwhelm not burdenize.  But it can be done.  Especially if you are playing some one that cannot remove Shadow Conditions.  Those are not key Shadow cards, but they do help - especially at Sites 7,8 and 9. 9 most of all (draw a card for each burden).<br />
<br />
MOVING - This sounds conditionalm, however once you get at least 2 companions, including Frodo armed only the Balrog will slow you down.  (((Lurtz, who?)))  Site 5 will make you or break you.  {{I made it out and to site 7 with just Frodo - I lost Arwen and Legolas - but my Allies kept me alive.}}  If your opponent has a Balrog - fight it or just give up.  It is the biggest and meanest, there for hardest to beat - unless its the rare Balrog, you can shoot it up a bit.  But I wouldn&#39;t was that on him, unless you can kill him.  Other then Site 5 you can almost always double move.  No worries.<br />
<br />
I would like to state - This deck has not lost a game yet.  Not to Sauron, Nazgul, Uruks/Ocs or Moria.  <br />
<br />
That&#39;s pretty much it.  I have been using this deck for months.  It has not let me down yet.  If you have any questions feel free to D-mail me.  Good Luck and have Fun. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
