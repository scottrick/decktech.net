<br />
Fellowship: Moving twice on the first turn is a no-no. Especially against Nazgul and Moria. Even against Uruk/Sauron decks, you need the goods out so you can double-move later. <br />
<br />
The four copies of Galadriel may seem excessive, but you need to get the other fools out for free. You can always heal her with extra copies, so they&#39;ll rarely clog the hand. It&#39;s good to have her at full health anyway, to keep her safe from a double-dose of &quot;wound every ally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thror&#39;s Map is very, very important: do not attempt to play this deck without two copies (unless you really want to run four Pathfinders). Getting your site six out is, of course, nice, but it is really in there for site seven. Two of the three site sevens will cause serious problems, so the Banks needs to be out there.<br />
<br />
Moria: Seen & Unseen can get rid of the nasty conditions. Rumil is manning the machine gun. Cave Troll is the biggest problem. If you&#39;re lucky, archery can kill it, otherwise you may have to bring in an expendable ally to &quot;assist.&quot; Consider mapping out your site four to avoid multiple Cave Troll visits. Also consider double moving from six to eight to avoid being stopped by Nen Hithoel.<br />
<br />
Uruks: Ditch Haldir, as he&#39;s the all important (for them) fifth man. Shoot, and fight whoever is left. Spies is nasty, but not game-ending. Pretty much proceed as planned. Check the hand with Sting to time double-moves well.<br />
<br />
Sauron:<br />
Seen & Unseen should alleviate condition-based damage. Archery helps with exert-to-wound texts. Site six isn&#39;t much of a problem, since all of your allies are in the mix for free. <br />
<br />
Nazgul:<br />
Well, Arwen can do her thing as usual. Seen & Unseen is once again a factor. This is obviously, where Defiance would be nice, but there&#39;s no room. Don&#39;t supply five tokens at site three lest you be introduced to the Nelya/Ford combo. <br />
<br />
-Shadow-<br />
Pretty baisc. Drop minions as possible. You&#39;ll probably be discarding minions quite often, but that&#39;s okay. You need a handful at the key sites. Quantity over Quality reduces damage from Versatility. <br />
<br />
Gandalf/Archery/Strength of Spirit/Dreary decks will cause some problems. Against everything else, you should be able to muster some stopping power at the very least. Ranger Choke decks will probably do well, but will have a tough time double-moving late with espionage shutting down the Bow. Hobbits will be contained to their usual pace. Elf/Big Archery Total will obviously be fairly easy to stop.  <br />
<br />
That&#39;s about it... <br />
