Its the deck I used in Vegas, where Siege was not yet legal.<br />
<br />
So there it is, a tight 60 card deck.  Everyone says add this and that, but hey, I want a 60 card deck so I draw my Aragorns and Faramirs.  Its certainly not a typical nazgul deck, with the cornucopia of nazgul.  There&#39;s one of nearly every nazgul in the deck.  Toldea, Winged Sentry wasn&#39;t very big though, so I might take him out for another new Toldea.<br />
<br />
The Isengard Men help balance the deck out.  They definitely came up big against Ryan Powell&#39;s Smeagol deck on Day 2.  A normal nazgul deck probably would have lost that matchup.  But Saruman&#39;s Power and Desertions (for Merry) and Wounded (for Boromir) were all big cards.  The Men were big for me on Day 1 against Slaked thirsts decks.  I had a great hand vs Matt Olsen&#39;s Slaked Thirsts deck at site 2, dropped 2 Agents, Grima, Power, with 5 cultures out.  Agents killed 2 guys at site 2.  Grima slapped Desertion on Gimli and sent stuff back to hand.   The same happened to Arwen and Eomer countless times in other games.  Deor helps get over Grima, but Fear takes out Deor.<br />
<br />
Grima even gets around Mike French&#39;s Deruvin tech.  He had 4 cards in hand at site 8, so he&#39;d be able to use Deruvin&#39;s text to discard a minion during regroup.  I had Grima and Desertion to slap on Arwen (who had her horse and sword), so that would go back to hand and he wouldn&#39;t have 4 cards anymore.  But he had Elrond and Vilya, which would take off Desertion.  Darn.  If I had 2 Desertions I could have done it.  So instead I had to play Attea and Fear at site 8, kill Elrond, then Attea gets discarded, and he doubles to site 9 where I drop my hand of Nazgul.  Grima bounces Arwen&#39;s stuff away, and I kill everyone but Frodo.  That was in game 3.<br />
<br />
In game 1 Frenchie killed me in 5 minutes since I doubled to 3 thinking I&#39;d be ok, but he had gates for another nazgul.  I died at 5 because of that.  Game 2 was close, but my fellowship stayed ahead of his nazgul and I won.  My shadow got the key stops on him.  Game 3 his nazgul weren&#39;t touching me but I drew only 1 desertion before site 8.  So my shadow wasn&#39;t as effective.  Thats not good for anybody, except Frenchie.<br />
<br />
On day 1 I lost to Tyler&#39;s Isengard Orc deck because I didn&#39;t play my 6th companion at site 8, which I should have done.  He didn&#39;t have Enquea, and I knew I was going to die anyway with only 5 guys.  It was my first game of Day 1, and I just made a mental mistake.  The deck normally does fine vs Isengard orcs.  I had the condition removal when he dropped bombs at 5 and 7.  And PATHS saved me as well from surviving site 8, but I died during the regroup phase (because I needed just ONE extra wound from that 6th companion, then my threats wouldn&#39;t have triggered).<br />
<br />
Of course the fellowship is so easy to play.  Stock PATHS up in your hand for late game heroics, and focus on setting up Arwen vs Nazgul.  Drawing healing allies and Shadow Between early always helps the double moves.  Faramir is good vs easterlings, and Arwen is good vs nazgul.  Aragorn is good vs swarms.  Legolas works with the PATHS.  Unlike many elf/man decks, Saruman&#39;s Power does very little against this one.<br />
<br />
Now then, what I need is advice on if this deck is playable after Siege.  How to deal with Corsairs and Shelob?   Is this deck finished now?  I don&#39;t know.  It is NOT a post-Siege deck.  Its just the deck I used in Vegas.  Thanks for reading. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
