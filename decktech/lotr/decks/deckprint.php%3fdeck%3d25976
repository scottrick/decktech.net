The most effective (and annoying) strategy ive found yet is something called the manuver phase. When you kill a few people before arrows start flying, its a great feeling. The combonation of the Sauron orcs Hate and the wounding capability of Blade Tip and Relentless charge is just excellent. The fellowship here is basically designed to survive while the minions do the work. Definitely not the type to move multiple times.<br>
<br>
Shadow - Minions are standard Nazgul with a few Sauron orcs, Blade Tips, Black Breaths, and then there are all the events in the deck. Since Nazgul are very expensive, I try to use pretty cheap orcs that still have a useful ability. The tower assassin is somewhat of a staple, and he also conveniently has two possible exertions. Relentless Charge and Hate tend to work very well together, and their both free events too. Some of the card choices in the deck might not be what most other people would play, but everything I have in there is there for a reason. The excessive amount of Too Great and Terribles are a local thing, Gandalf is real big where Im from. Skulkers shuffle in Ringwraith cards, but there are definitely more skirmish effective orcs out there. I just like them cause theyre cheap<br>
<br>
Fellowship - The objective here is to keep minions off with aimed archery, and prevent exertions with Strength of Spirit. Servant of The Secret fire is just a great card, and deserves to be in any Gandalf using deck. Ive been thinking about using doubles of all the possessions for Gandalf and I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s necessary. Still have to try it with singles someday. I&#39;ve got Elrond and Ottar in there because of the lack of Nazguls ability to cycle cards. Betrayal of Isengard and Sleep are both against Moria, which is the local top deck.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions greatly appreciated, been trying to perfect Nazgul for a long time, I think that this is one of the best ways to play them, but theres always better. If your going to tell me that it sucks, explain why and what i can do. Thanks for checking out my deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
