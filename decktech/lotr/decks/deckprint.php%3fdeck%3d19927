<br />
LOCATIONS (9): <br />
1: Westfarthing <br />
-Using Westfarthing, you can safely play very many hobbits for a low cost. This site&#39;s virtue is in the fact that you&#39;re able to play hobbits with exertion very early in the game. I&#39;ve been lucky in several games so far, and been able to draw several hobbits in my opening hand... so for next to no shadow, I get a strong fellowship and support of allies! The exertion done to the hobbits will be healed mostly by Rivendell. <br />
<br />
2: Midgewater Marshes <br />
-The Midgewater Marshes require Hobbits to exert, namely Frodo and whatever other hobbits might be in my opponent&#39;s fellowship by the time he moves. I could care less about what it does to my fellowship: see tactics below, Aragorn, and Frodo. <br />
<br />
3: Frodo&#39;s Bedroom <br />
-Any leftover hobbits I did not get out at Westfarthing will be saved through my second turn to play here so I can draw a card. Healing five points of damage is the main purpose of this site, but I used Frodo&#39;s bedroom over the others because it&#39;s the only one with some bearing on my deck. <br />
<br />
4: Moria Lake <br />
-Much like Midgewater Marshes, I want to catch my opponent out of the sanctuary with more exertion. If the Ringbearer is exhausted or in danger of exhaustion by site 5, he must put on the ring if he is matched, and that&#39;s where the corruption begins. <br />
<br />
5: The Bridge of Khazad-dum <br />
-What other choice do I have? It&#39;s no bearing on my deck, other than it&#39;s high shadow cost which gives me the chance to play lots of Uruks, really quickly. <br />
<br />
6: Galadriel&#39;s Glade <br />
-Again, no bearing on my deck. Just a site to generate shadow for my war machine. <br />
<br />
7: Silverlode Banks <br />
-Up to this point, I play very hard on any rangers my opponent may have. Hopefully none are left by this site, which would make every companion exert, before I began to beat on them with as much as 15 shadow available. This exertion will help corrupt Frodo at sites 8 and 9. <br />
<br />
8: Anduin Banks <br />
-Ideally this has no bearing on me, unless the fellowship is over 4 in size, which would only increase the number of wounds dealt... up to 10. <br />
<br />
9: Summit of Amon Hen <br />
-Finally, the pinnacle of my game. If my opponent has made it this far, up to 17 shadow, and drawing between 0 and 9 cards for the number of burdens on the bearer, I will be able to play my worst cards throughout the game. Large shadow helps with Worry! <br />
<br />
STARTING (2): <br />
Frodo: Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir <br />
-Old Bilbo&#39;s heir helps me heal my fighting companions, along with Aragorn. Between the two, I can heal any two companions that I wish (1 with the Aragorn signet, the other a Hobbit), each turn, without adding burdens or exerting them. Very valuable cards! <br />
The One Ring: The Ruling Ring (Isildur&#39;s Bane, if I can pick it up by then.) <br />
<br />
STARTING FELLOWSHIP (1): <br />
Aragorn: King in Exile <br />
-See Frodo: Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir. Aragorn&#39;s high Strength is used to pick off the weaker minions that may get thrown at me. <br />
<br />
DRAW DECK (72): <br />
<br />
FREE PEOPLES (36): <br />
Pippin: Hobbit of Some Intelligence x1 <br />
-This Pippin is preferable to play because of the fact that he furthers my low shadow, low exertion healing theme when he comes into play. Afterwards he can be healed by Frodo each turn, while bearing a sword and doing considerable damage to Moria type minions (these having lower strengths). <br />
<br />
Pippin: Friend to Frodo x2 <br />
-This Pippin is secondary, to be played at site 3 if I cannot get my rare. He is only helpful for soaking up damage, being healed, and keeping &quot;There and Back Again&quot; in play. <br />
<br />
Merry: Friend to Sam x2 <br />
-This Merry is also preferable to the common Merry in my deck because of his ability to add his strength in skirmishes. Because of the low shadow provided by the nature of this deck, I can leave Merry unmatched and use him with Frodo, Sam, or Pippin, a Hobbit Sword, and other cards to get a total strength of 3+2+3+2+2+3+2 in the best case scenerio... a total of 17. That&#39;s enough to finish off the Cave Troll. <br />
<br />
Merry: From O&#39;er the Brandywine x1 <br />
-This Merry is also helpful because of his having the Aragorn signet (thus, able to be healed by Aragorn), and the Strength +2 bit also helps. It&#39;s not a bad compromise. <br />
<br />
Sam: Son of Hamfast x3 <br />
-With the Aragorn Signet, this Sam can be healed by Aragorn at the start of every turn. In the event that Frodo is killed, I make Sam the backup ringbearer to hope to stall off until I can corrupt or kill my opponent&#39;s. <br />
<br />
Aragorn: King in Exile x2 <br />
-Aragorn can heal the uncommon Merry and my Sam, making him a powerful force to be reckoned with. He also makes passage safe at site seven, so I don&#39;t have to worry about exhausting much of my fellowship in the following skirmish phase. His large strength makes him ideal for destroying lesser strength minions, while placing stronger minions against Sam and Merry, then healing them with Frodo and Aragorn the next turn. <br />
<br />
The Gaffer: Sam&#39;s Father x1 <br />
-Almost seeming an afterthought, the Gaffer is a card that helps me through the tough times every once in a while, by healing Frodo or Sam, and in turn being healed by a Hobbit Party Guest. <br />
<br />
Rosie Cotton: Hobbiton Lass x1 <br />
-Like the Gaffer, Rosie is in the deck for the positive effect on Sam. Not only can he be healed every turn (with HPGs refreshing Rosie), he is also STR +1. <br />
<br />
Hobbit Party Guest x2 <br />
-The Hobbit Party Guest is used to heal the Gaffer whenever possible, or Rosie, if the Gaffer is unavailable. <br />
<br />
Sting x1 <br />
-This is rather self-evident. Duh. I want Frodo to whip anyone who would -dare- come near him... and... maybe get rid of a little shadow in the process, especially right before moving to a sanctuary (where Frodo can be healed). <br />
<br />
Bounder x2 <br />
-Used in only the most dire circumstances, the Bounder is meant to keep Frodo (or other companions, if Worry is on the table) from being overwhelmed. Best to prepare for contingencies... <br />
<br />
Hobbit Intuition x2 <br />
-The Strength bonus of +3 at other sites is nice, but canceling a skirmish can be a lifesaver if Nazgul manage to get out at early sites. <br />
<br />
Hobbit Stealth x2 <br />
-See Hobbit Intuition. <br />
<br />
Hobbit Sword x4 <br />
-Strength Bonuses to the Hobbit companions, so I can hope to take out some Moria Orcs if challenged. <br />
<br />
There and Back Again x2 <br />
-Need those Strength bonuses. <br />
<br />
Swordsman of the North Kingdom x4 <br />
-If necessary, I can use this card to boost Aragorn over offensive Uruk-hai, or Orcs. The Trolls or Nazgul might be a problem, however, which is why I&#39;ve included (and am presently looking for more)... <br />
<br />
Gondor&#39;s Vengeance x1 <br />
-&quot;Exert a ranger companion to discard a minion&quot;. Now if that isn&#39;t just the &quot;Limited Resources&quot; of Lord of the Rings TCG. <br />
<br />
Dagger Strike x3 <br />
-Not only can these cards affect their own type, they&#39;re in this deck because they can affect hobbits. With an advantage of STR +2 and DAM +1, this could push my hobbits up above even some Mordor Orcs or Uruk-hai. <br />
<br />
MINIONS (36): <br />
Lurtz: Servant of Isengard x2<br />
-Lurtz&#39;s high strength, fierce characteristic, and archer status all level out for a character that does irreparable damage to the fellowship. This, aside from the Spies and Worry, causes the most distress for people I&#39;ve played against, because of the damage he does to anyone they match him against.<br />
<br />
Uruk Lieutenant x1 <br />
-The Strength bonus this guy could get with four or five minions out is just sick. An overall good card, advantagous at almost any time. <br />
<br />
Uruk Spy x4 <br />
-The single most horrifying card to see in my deck. With one or two of these, I could corrupt the Ring-bearer if he makes the mistake of putting it on. With the other Uruk-hai in this deck, it becomes suicide to NOT put it on... so we&#39;re in a paradox. Don&#39;t... WORRY about it. Hahaha... <br />
<br />
Worry x2 (Looking for more.) <br />
-Just behind that pesky spy. Adding a burden each time a companion is killed (Hobbits are easily overwhelmed by STR 7, 8, and 9 Uruks), or exerting the Ringbearer, it makes for a nightmare of a game for my opponent. <br />
<br />
Uruk-hai Armory x2 <br />
-Cut down on that archery total. I hate archers. If they make a hole in my deck, or make it impossible for me to exert my spies, my fights are without purpose. <br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Ambition x3 <br />
-A very underappreciated card. Though my events are currently underdone, this still gives me the chance to add 2 to the Strength of an Uruk-hai at any point that I wish, for free. <br />
<br />
Uruk-hai Raiding Party x2 <br />
-Eh. It&#39;s strong. It&#39;s got power to absorb two archery shots and still skirmish. I figured... why the heck not? <br />
<br />
Uruk Warrior x1 <br />
-A decent, powerful minion who can become fierce if my opponent is foolhardy enough to have a large fellowship. <br />
<br />
Uruk Soldier x3 <br />
-This card allows me to make the FP player discard card after card as more of these fairly powerful Uruks hit the table. <br />
<br />
Their Arrows Enrage x1 <br />
-Another, essentially PARTING SHOT at Archers. If I am able to hit those Archers hard, I don&#39;t have to worry about their arrows. By making any Archer Strength minus 1, I make it nearly impossible for them to deal with high power Uruk-hai. <br />
<br />
Bred for Battle x3 <br />
-In the unlikely event that my Uruks should get overpowered or outflanked or something of the sort... *vague hand gestures*... this lets me boost their power to hit companions once more. Did I mention how nasty DAM +1 hits are when Worry is on the table, and Uruk Spies are handy? Kill a companion... attack at the Ringbearer... it&#39;s just disgusting. <br />
<br />
Uruk-hai Sword x2 <br />
-Again, to boost power. Also, it&#39;s a way to make the FP player discard cards that might hurt me later on. <br />
<br />
Uruk Bloodlust x2 <br />
-Evil, evil card. It really makes moving more than 1 site per turn impractical, since archery seems to have less of an effect... and minions will just continue to stack up. <br />
<br />
Uruk Slayer x2 <br />
-Strong, and able to be made stronger, if the need be. Hopefully can help with Worry or the Uruk Spies. <br />
<br />
Uruk Rager x3 <br />
-Yep. A combination of an Uruk Slayer and an Uruk-hai Sword. Discard and hit hard. <br />
<br />
Troop of Uruk-hai x1 <br />
-Weapons, beware. This card will kill a Hobbit if matched against it. <br />
<br />
Traitor&#39;s Voice x1 <br />
-This prevents the FP player from getting ahead of me. <br />
<br />
Uruk-hai Rampage x1 <br />
-Fierce is just a pretty word... with DAM +1, I revel in how it makes my opponents WRITHE. <br />
