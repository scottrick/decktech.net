<br />
to the guy who thinks I don&#39;t know how to READ:<br />
<br />
I KNOW that I cannot exert Sam and Eowyn to pull Legolas, which is one of the reasons I bid high to go SECOND, so I don&#39;t get my site 1 and it&#39;s not an issue. However, if by some stretch of the imagination I DO go first, I will get Legolas IF I get another companion. Is that to your satisfaction?<br />
<br />
END RESPONSE.<br />
<br />
OOPS! Forgot the Sites! Here they are:<br />
<br />
1) Eastemnet Gullies (pull Legolas, which can mean an easy double move to 3 in needed)<br />
2) Uruk Camp (makes like a bit easier on my Freeples, also I am not really going for easrly kills. Ideally, I should be playing a Tower Assassin here)<br />
3) Golden Hall (makes it easier for my Uruks to win fights, plus my Freeples has ONE weapon in it)<br />
4) White Rocks (Rohan can be a bad matchup for Uruks)<br />
5) Deep of Helm (this is where you should start to kill the opponent)<br />
6) Caves oeasterlinglarond (sometimes usefull...gets rid of Bill the Pony?)<br />
7) Cavern Entrance (I know what you&#39;re thinkin...you play 4 Savageries! yes I do, but this is the only site 7 that doesn&#39;t hurt my fellowship, plus by 7 I should have strong Uruks that win fights without pumps, OR I should have a large group of them, so I can double-team the biggies)<br />
8) Wizard&#39;s Vale ( I don&#39;t play Choke, nor do I play Dunland)<br />
9) Orthanc Balcony (makes killing at 9 pretty easy, since I am guaranteed a Sid the Fish at 9)<br />
<br />
Alright, so NOW I can do strategy.<br />
<br />
This is a Shadow kill deck, therefore your Free Peoples is designed to draw cards and survive, allowing your Shadow to be much more efficient at killing the opponent. <br />
<br />
Heres how.<br />
<br />
Every card in this deck is playable right away, except for Elrond, LoR, since I start with neither an elf nor Gandalf. I know that this apears stupid, but I have 3 Elf Companions in the deck, as well as 6 other allies that, if drawn before Elrond, will allow me to play him. If you do not draw an Elf besides Elrond in your hand, Mulligan. <br />
<br />
The point is to be able to empty your hand of Free Peoples card EVERY TURN, which facilitates mostly Shadow hands when your opponent goes to move.<br />
<br />
How many times have you watched you opponent play companion after companion and then move, only to be greated by a condition?<br />
<br />
Never more!<br />
<br />
Since no cards in your Free Peoples side get held onto, you should, barring AWFUL luck, have at LEAST 6 Shadow cards in your hand on your opponent&#39;s turn.<br />
<br />
SO, here how you play the Free Peoples:<br />
<br />
Bid 0-6, depending on what you know about the opponent. The default should be 6, cause you do NOT wantr to go first. If you win the bid, go second.<br />
<br />
When you get to go, play everything in you hand, withing reason. If you draw Sting early, check to see what is safe to play, but if you have a Stealth or two, dump ridiculous amounts in the pool, as NOTHING can hurt you....okay, well mostly nothing. <br />
<br />
move, get ALL the Stealths out, even if you have to move twice, and make sure that you discard a card when you stop.<br />
<br />
Thats all there is to it.<br />
<br />
Important cards!<br />
<br />
Horn: I only play 2 Horn and 2 Boromir because it&#39;s not the point of the deck, it&#39;s just a nice surprise that can make the deck survive even better. If it gets set up, great! if not, oh well.<br />
<br />
Frodo&#39;s Kit: I put in every card that can make Frodo bigger, which makes it even harder for your opponent to kill Frodo, even if they DO get to him. Beware of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
Thror&#39;s Map: if you don&#39;t keep Eowyn alive, save it for 7. If you think you can kill your opponent before you have to move to 7, use it at 5 to guarantee the Deep of Helm. This is, of course, assuming that they bid 7 and made you go first, but it never hurts to be safe.<br />
<br />
Companion Selection:<br />
<br />
Gorn- saves me at the Cavern Entrance vs. Moria, just a great companion<br />
<br />
Legolas - able to handle as many as 3 minions, which means they need that many more to get to Frodo.<br />
<br />
Boromir - since I&#39;m using the Cavern Entrance, AND the Horn, I figure my default Boro, that is SoD, isn&#39;t gonna do a whole lot, so why not be able to heal?<br />
<br />
Eowyn - makes it easy to go over 5 companions, which is cool, plus she can fake out an opponent into letting someone live who shouldn&#39;t. (right Josh?)<br />
<br />
Merry, LG - lets me have 10 companions, as long as he gets discarded<br />
<br />
Pippin - target for Stealths, heals or Burden takes when I play him. great bargain.<br />
<br />
Sam, SoH - lets me bid high to go second<br />
<br />
Haldir - site control can mess me over big time, plus he&#39;s a 7 strength companion for 2 pool, who can play for free with Galadriel.<br />
<br />
Arwen, DoE - able to survive against a Witch King, which can be pretty important.<br />
<br />
well, after all that explanation, the Free Peoples isn&#39;w whats important. The Shadow is the real show here. And heres how it works:<br />
<br />
The trick here is to kill an Ally, preferably someone important, but anyone will do. After that happens, you get acces to the 2 most Twilight efficient Minions in the game.<br />
<br />
Uruk Stalker - 3 Pool for an 11 Strength Minion who is naturally Fierce. Nasty.<br />
<br />
Uruk Raider - 2 Pool for a 9 strength minion who is Naturally Fierce. Dirty!<br />
<br />
These guys will literally chew up a fellowship even in small doses. Watch what happens when you get out as many as 7 Uruks and Saruman at the Deep of Helm. Heres how it works.<br />
<br />
Uruk Regular - 3 pool for 8 strength. meh, not bad right? but watch what happens when him and a few of his buddies start throwing free Uruks around.<br />
<br />
Shadow - exert this minion to play an Uruk-Hai. That Uruk-Hai&#39;s twilight cost is -1 for each other Uruk you can spot. <br />
<br />
Using this minion and a decent amount of Twilight, you can kill, kill, kill even the Strongest Fellowship.<br />
<br />
Weaknesses?<br />
<br />
Denial. Unfortunately, Uruks have taken a bit of a hit this set after losing Hollin. This means that they have to wait till site 5 to have ANY impact at all on a denial deck. <br />
<br />
In order to deal with denial, you get 2 copies of the best condition removal card in the game.<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power - 2 Twilight, exert a Hand Minion to ditch ALL conditions.<br />
<br />
Wipe Away ALL No Strangers, A Talent, Last Alliance, Trust Me, whatever your opponent is relying on, in ONE FELL SWOOP. <br />
<br />
The one thing that can knock this shadow side on it rump is if your opponent plays not one ally. I know this sounds like a problem, but honestly, find me a deck that doesn&#39;t run Filibert Bolger!<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, the deck can still win without Ally&#39;s to kill, you just have to be smarter about where to use your pumps. This deck is not really about overwhelming, it just is able to shell out so much damage that even a Freeples running 4 Armors will not survive long, especially if you Grima their Armor :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking, and if you have any questions, D-Mail me and I&#39;ll answer ASAP.<br />
