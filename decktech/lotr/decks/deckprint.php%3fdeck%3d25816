<br>
Bid:<br>
----<br>
I normally bid 1, just in case opponent bids 0.<br>
<br>
If I win, I choose to go second because initial sites are really important for Nazgul.<br>
If I loose, and opponent chooses to go second, I don&#39;t worry too much because I have a Pathfinder and 3 Nelyas. Besides, you go in front and already putting pressure in your opponent.<br>
<br>
Starting Fellowship:<br>
--------------------<br>
If you suspect Nazgul (for instance if opponent wins bet and chooses to go second) start Arwen, otherwise start Legolas.<br>
<br>
Free Peoples:<br>
-------------<br>
This Fellowship is really strong, has answers against all cultures and if you play carefully, is easy to choke your opponent. Gimli, No Strangers to the Shadows and Sting/Glamdring really help in this task.<br>
<br>
Shadow:<br>
-------<br>
The shadow part of this deck was build with the intention of slowing down your opponent and if possible (lots of times happens) create big damage on opponents fellowship at the initial sites. Normally when this happens, you kill your opponent by site 4/5.<br>
<br>
Strategy:<br>
---------<br>
The main focus of this deck is to controll the twilight pool. For you to accomplish this, you have to master your play, dont play unnecessary cards that give twilight and control your fellowship size.<br>
<br>
Let your opponent go in front till site 3, after you have played your site 4 (Dwarrowdelf Chamber), you have to decide to go for the race or for the kill.<br>
<br>
Although Moria is hard to choke, sometimes it can be done. Dont forget, at underground sites Gimli takes 2 Twilight and Aragorn/Boromir/Arwen/No Strangers takes one each.<br>
<br>
Specific answers for Shadow Match-Ups:<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Nazgul:<br>
2 x Flaming Brands<br>
3 x Hard to Kill Boromirs, Aragorns and Arwen<br>
4 x Big Strong Gandalf (Power 12 with Glamdring)<br>
1 x Sleep for those nasty conditions (Tips and Breaths)<br>
Strong Choke, you will normally fight against only one Nazgul, maximum 2.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hais:<br>
Dont forget to not go over 4 companions.<br>
2 x Armors<br>
4 x Big Strong Gandalf (Power 12 with Glamdring), overpower most Uruks<br>
1 x Sleep + Dreary for those nasty conditions (Ambitions, Worry, Palanthir, ...)<br>
Strong Choke insures you that you won&#39;t have to match against a lot of uruks.<br>
<br>
Moria:<br>
4 x Big Strong Gandalf (Power 12 with Glamdring)<br>
1 x Sleep + Dreary for those nasty conditions (Armorys, Relics, Swarms, They are coming)<br>
Legolas + Aragorn&#39;s Bow too kill those vitality 1 minions<br>
2 x Armor for Balrog and Troll<br>
Gimli + Ax helps to kill vitality 1 minions<br>
Strong Twilight Denial, helped by Stings and Glamdrins can sometimes accomplish to choke even Moria!<br>
<br>
Sauron Orcs:<br>
I think Sauron Orcs will have big trouble against a strong Choke Deck. They are roaming till site 6 and Sting/Glamdring works against them.<br>
Use carefully your Sleep to kill the really nasty conditions that this culture has.<br>
<br>
Isengard Orcs:<br>
I think these minions will have a hard time to kill a strong fellowship like this. Save your condition removal for Trapped and Alone, so your weapons damage bonus work against them, not allowing your opponent to exert their minions in order to wound your companions.<br>
These orcs also suffer a lot with the twilight denial strategy.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think this deck has a really strong fellowship that can fight against any culture, backed up by a solid Nazgul force.<br>
<br>
Thats It!<br>
Please be constructive when reviewing the deck.<br>
See ya,<br>
