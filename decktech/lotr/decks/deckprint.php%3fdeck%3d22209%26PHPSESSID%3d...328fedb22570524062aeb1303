<br />
bid high and go first, use sam to get burdens off (but don&#39;t sacrifice him too soon, you need someone to take a hit when the &#39;rog rears his ugly head). you need to be able to make it so site 9 first. so whenever it&#39;s possible, you need to play all the shadow cards in your hand. this ensures that you&#39;ll have a good deal of free peoples cards for your fellowship to use as you run. of course, swarming the opponent&#39;s fellowship isn&#39;t a bad idea either. as a matter of standard procedure, you should run from sites 1 to 3, and from 7 to 9. you should really only need to double jump a third time if your opponent tries to out run you. but because that means you get more twilight to work with and the  possibly of overwhelming more than one character, the chances of that seem pretty slim (especially when the goblins don&#39;t have to roam anymore). <br />
<br />
so now you understand the basics of the deck, and what you&#39;re supposed to do when you take this tank out for a test drive. let&#39;s take a look at some particular cards and i&#39;ll explain why i chose them.<br />
<br />
thrarin - we all know and love this goofy looking dwarf. what&#39;s neat is if you happen to draw him before you get to site 5. he takes the first hit from the balrog or other big baddie, and sam takes the next one. hooray for the ultimate phone-a-friend.<br />
<br />
gandalf&#39;s staff - have you read this card recently? it&#39;s the shiznit. now servant plays for free, sleep plays for 2. that&#39;s as smooth as a baby&#39;s bottom.<br />
<br />
goblin flankers - these doods are stout. they can efficiently use a moria axe, they can take an archery hit or two, and if the opponent feels like they really need to run, they play for 2 twilight. how cool is that?<br />
<br />
ulaire enquea - he&#39;s good in almost every deck. if your opponent thinks he needs a ton of companions, show him the error of his ways. good for outright eliminating that confounded legolas greenleaf. opponent not playing very many companions? who cares? he&#39;s a big fierce minion for 6 twilight. good enough for me.<br />
<br />
the balrog - and the rare one at that. sure he costs a little more, but he also lets you keep all those other minions you want to have out at his side. oooooh, scary. <br />
<br />
cave troll&#39;s chain - &quot;where does he get all those wonderful toys?&quot; remember batman? the wise words of the joker apply here as well. the chain beefs up the already big cave troll, and gives you the opportunity to take care of heavy archery decks. wonderful toy indeed.<br />
<br />
that about sums it up. enjoy, kids!<br />
<br />
love,<br />
<br />
