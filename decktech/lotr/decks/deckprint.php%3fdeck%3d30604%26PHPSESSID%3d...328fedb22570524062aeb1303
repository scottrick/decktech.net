<br />
Do you need a deck that wins?<br />
<br />
Do you not give a rat&#39;s behonkus whether your opponent enjoys their game or not?<br />
<br />
Then this is the deck for you!<br />
<br />
The latest version of the non-fun that is Legolas, Dauntless Hunter is a fellowship that, barring truly awful draws (such as no Aragorn until site 5), kills anything. <br />
<br />
How, you say, is this possible?<br />
<br />
ARCHERY + CHOKE(sort of) + SKIRMISH WOUNDING + HEALING.<br />
<br />
This fellowship laughs at the following shadow sides:<br />
<br />
Nazgul - one minion per site dies and you move again. no questions asked. if fact, beyond site 2, you should never have to skirmish a nazgul if you don&#39;t want to. their only wound prevention costs pool, and you can see how many the have coming. auto-win.<br />
<br />
Moria - believe it or not, the shadow that most Dauntless decks have the most trouble with loses to you IF, and only IF, you MOVE MOVE MOVE. early game, they MUST use the pool to set up conditions, otherwise they cause little to no damage later. In most Moria matchups, assuming you go second, you should often triple move through Derndingle to prevent hands being setup.<br />
Curse Their Foul Feel gives an almost auto-win against site 7 bomb, assuming you hold one until then, and Bilbo kills Armories vs. normal swarms and They Are Coming vs. Archery to give the win. <br />
<br />
Easterlings - since you bid nothing or 1, their Polearms do nothing, and since they must make it through Archery they will rarely add any burdens to get ANYTHING going. Choke hurts more than you&#39;d think, and Dauntless makes Vision From Afar and Gathering to the Summons less apealing. Gollum won&#39;t be showing up as much, since We Must Have It costs 2 pool, but when he does you&#39;ll need to make sure he dies. Make sure Frodo gets the first hobbit weapon, as he&#39;ll need to fight most of the Easterlings that DO make it through. <br />
<br />
Sauron - early game is a cakewalk vs. Sauron, as they are insanely expensive. Even the first Tracker can be enough to drain the pool, when all there is is 8 in the first place. Late game gets sketchy since Sauron is undercosted for the vitality they have, but if you run early, which should be easy, you will win. <br />
<br />
The only truly bad matchup is non-Archery Uruks, as they have access to, and will play, Broad Bladed Sword. A fatty with a Sword can play havok, and if you expect to see lots of these guys, switch out both Curse Their Foul Feet for 2 Something Draws Near to kill those cards. Luckily, most Uruk decks will be choked enough for your Shadow to get a foothold and either slow of kill. Once the Broad Bladed Swords go, you win just as easily as vs. Nazgul, if not easier. <br />
<br />
Alright, enough of the matchups, this post has been backwards!<br />
Here&#39;s how this deck wins.<br />
<br />
CHOKE<br />
<br />
Bill the Pony and A Talent both reduce the twilight number of sites by 1, and while 2 pool doesn&#39;t seem like much you&#39;ll be surprised how big a difference it makes. Add onto that the fact that most of the cards the fellowship plays cost little or nothing and you&#39;ll have an opponent unable to play more than 1 or 2 minions per site. <br />
<br />
Legolas adds to the frustration by charging your opponent 2 extra for his conditions and events. While many popular decks have evolved to get around Legolas&#39; power, you&#39;ll find that almost every single shadow side in the game is affected in at least some way, and even that can make all the difference. Legolas also gives you the advantage vs. Moria, as the choke will make them choose between stopping you and getting set up.<br />
<br />
ARCHERY<br />
<br />
Who likes to skirmish? I know I don&#39;t. Combining the twilight denial aspects with the ability to crank out more wounds than ANY shadow side can absorb leaves you with a rather easy move site 9.<br />
<br />
Splendor - legolas already adds one archery, and as long as I&#39;m not using Greenleaf, I might as well benefit from the Poof as much as possible. Combned with KiE&#39;s healing, Legs can throw up at least one extra Arrow every turn.<br />
<br />
Gondor Bowmen - aside from being tales to use with Bilbo and being Free drops to get of my hand, these cards add the final nail in Nazgul&#39;s Coffins, which is ironic since they are already dead :)<br />
<br />
Double Shot - while I personally feel that the &quot;o&quot; in Shot should be swicthed with an &quot;i&quot;, this card can make a difference in the long run, and it doesn&#39;t cost anything to play. better to drop a card from hand to do an extra wound than exert Aragorn and have one too many. not good enough to merrit 4.<br />
<br />
SKIRMISH WOUNDING<br />
<br />
Cliffs, PATHS and Frying Pan all give my Hobbits a pseudo skirmishing ability. Fryig Pans on both supporting Hobbits are actually MUCH better than having it on Frodo, since you can then kill minions that would have otherwise stacked on swarms, and in some occassions killed a Hobbit. Cliffs is versatile in that it can wound someone on Merry to allow him a pump on someone else, but since it is unique I only find room for 1.<br />
PATHS is sort of self explanatory in a small fellowship based around wounds, but this card if drawn at the right time can provide solutions against Uruks that would not have existed otherwise. <br />
<br />
HEALING<br />
<br />
This is what puts this deck over other Dauntless Decks. While most Dauntless/Foot decks can run their butts off in a favored match, if something goes wrong it often goes horribly wrong. With no copies of ANY of the companions in the deck, and no healing, a Dauntless deck that takes a beating and stops anywhere OTHER than a Sanctuary is in for some pain when they move again. The following cards make recovering from a beating, or even passing a sanctuary, much easier.<br />
<br />
Hard Choice - healing Frodo, Legolas, Aragorn or even Pippin up to twice for one pool is just huge. Against Twilight Nazgul, recovering from a Twitch King is as easy as healing Frodo at the start of turn and then dropping a Hard Choice. Need more archery> Heal Legs. Bowmen exertions? Heal Gorn. Pan Whacks? heal Frodo or Pipp. My only regret is Merry&#39;s signet, but that would indeed be broken.<br />
<br />
Athelas - while Bilbo is nice for killing Armories and such, Black Breath or, heaven forbid, a Blade Tip can spell trouble so I dropped in this card to remedy the situation. Also a mini, portable Hard Choice. <br />
<br />
Aragorn, KiE - while I know Wingfoot is the standard choice for Dauntless, in this kind of Fellowship that is relying on NOT skirmishing to win, I find Wingfoot is often a waste. In most situations, if a minion is still alive after archery and skirmishes, it&#39;s because I let it OR it has a Broad Bladed Sword. In these two situations, I should not be double moving anyway. The only time that this deck EVER needs Wingfoot is occassionaly at site 2 vs. Nazgul, and thats SUCH an advantage matchup that moving 2-5 is not out of the question (via Derndingle). The healing provided by KiE is what makes Naz and Uruks such a fin match, since Legolas is GUARANTEED to be hitting to archery EVERY MOVE (barring some freak occurenses(sp?) I just say, before you poo-poo it, try it and you&#39;ll see.<br />
<br />
So, hopefully you&#39;ve been convinced on the Fellowhship. If not, please D-mail me and I&#39;ll answer ANY questions you&#39;ve got.<br />
<br />
The Shadow is something of a connundrum. I began to think about Moria Archery immediatley after hearing tha Peter Sundholm and at least one other were doing well with it at the Spokane DPC. After Dalton won Dragon Con with it, I was convinced it could win, obviously.<br />
<br />
The thing thats odd about Moria Archery is that there haven&#39;t been any cards, aside from Southron Archer Legion, made that help it since Mines of Moria! Why does it work so well? Take what works so well for Uruk Archery, which is the fact that you do wounds in the archery phase AND in the skirmish phase and tack on minion recursion, wound prevention and pool generation. Sound good?<br />
<br />
The thing is, Moria Archery isn&#39;t the same as Swarms. Sometimes, you&#39;ll get a Swarm, but often times your best move is to drop an Archer Troop and a Commander and wound them up, knowing that they won&#39;t be able to kill the Troop, and dare them to move again. They Are Coming is key, as you&#39;ll be able to pitch unneeded cards AND recurr those Archer Troops. <br />
<br />
How does 4-8 wounds a site sound? How about twice that, which is what this deck does when it starts winning fights?<br />
<br />
The Runners may not seem to fit with the theme of Archery, but they add much needed twilight, as this deck&#39;s minions are not exactly cheap for what they do. <br />
<br />
The key to winning with this deck is knowing when to stop trying to kill with the shadow and run with the fellowship. If you see Boromir, DoMT, it&#39;s often time to start running, though the 4 pool given every turn can often times result in more than 2 wounds. Gandalf + GST can spell trouble, but is killable providing you can keep a TAC on table. GST followed by Dreary played by a good player is often impossible to recover from, as that&#39;ll mean 2 sites where you do very little.<br />
<br />
I guess the best advice to give on the shadow is to test it out against everything before you give up on it, as it is not for everyone. The shadow DOES, though, give the fellowship a little liscense to be gay, as Moria Archery is indeed fun.<br />
<br />
Questionable cards?<br />
<br />
Hmm, I guess Southron Archer Troop could be one, but he wins the game versus a large fellowship. Ents in particular are the matchup he was designed for, as not only will he cause 5-6 wounds but even IF they win the fight he will likely stick around to cause that many wounds again. Just huge, and worth the slot.<br />
<br />
No Desert Lord? I too am shocked, but it isn&#39;t worth paying 6 for the convinience of deciding where the wounds go. As long as they are taking wounds, I am happy :)<br />
<br />
# of They Are Coming is as many as I am allowed because the card is key to not only making sure you always have archers, but to keeping the deck flowing smoothly. <br />
<br />
I think thats about the best I can do for strategy. Obviously the shadow will lose if it&#39;s teched against heavily (Rohirrim Shield, Mithril Coat, Elven Cloak, etc.) but it&#39;s a nice change of pace AND surprising in many Metas. If theres any questions I can answer, by all means let me know. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Last of all, MEGA props to Chris Tubman for getting me thinking about the fellowship in time for the PSQ I played it in. Thanks man.<br />
