<br />
theme 1: Burdens<br />
The object of this deck is to go second, as sites 2 and 3 are crucial against archery, so bid high. There are many cards that remove burdens. With Sam coming out, 1 burden is automatically gone. Also, he can remove 3 or however many you wish to remove. Brace of Coneys is also good for this. This is the smallest theme, as it isn&#39;t the most important.<br />
<br />
theme 2: Power<br />
Elves were always weak. Not anymore, with big power-ups they can do what dwarves once did. This is not a tournament deck, so it won&#39;t win professional games, but it will get you through tight spots if you are a beginner. Power-ups will helps your companions to survive.<br />
<br />
theme 3: Discard<br />
Pippin and Merry discard are the newest things out. Knocked on the Head you may need 4 copies of, and Treebeard rare would help. This is the main theme in the fellowship, as it survives big minions.<br />
<br />
The shadow is also divided into 3 themes, but they all back each other up.<br />
<br />
theme 1: Ally-murdering<br />
This combo has been popular ever since realms, but with Uruk Stalker and Ravager, this could do more damage. Also this set introduces good rohan allies and Treebeard, so this will be very useful.<br />
<br />
theme 2: Archery? Savage - Suck it up!<br />
Dunland has problems with archery. Spies of Saruman is good for people who have it, but if not, get out cheap minions to suck up wounds. Savage is the best at this technique, plus he&#39;s there for spies in case.<br />
<br />
theme 3: Moria - No. Dunland.<br />
Dunland may be the spitting image of Moria, but look closer. Moria minions are weak. Dunland has few weak minions. The ability to kill possessions works well too. Secret Folk is my favourite Dunland card, but if you get it, try Hides. 4 of these will guarantee your dunland health, and you won&#39;t need uruk savages or spies.<br />
