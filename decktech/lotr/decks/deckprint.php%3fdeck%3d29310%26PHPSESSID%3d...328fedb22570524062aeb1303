This deck I used to win Australian Continental Championships. Basically turbo hobbits race against anything while dunlend wreck the opponent. Bid about 5 to go first and remove some burdens with Sam soh. This helps to win the race and helps your dunlend take sites. Its most important for dunlend decks to go first. Basically I have found this deck to walk over any minion side around. Nazgul, dunlend, uruks, sauron are all every easy matches. Moria is prolly the most difficult match-up since I ran no condition removal, but I expected Naz and hairy guys to be dominate and I was right. Still Direct damage from Legolas and paths can deal with orcs and trolls. You have thrors map to avoid bad sites like the cavern entrance. If the moria player runs dark places u better have TABA and Aragorn out.<br />
 Smeagol is the key to this deck, as he is almost impossible to kill. Sting and smeagols text pump him and he takes no wounds so he never dies until you want him too. As one of my opponents said at the continentals- &#8220;shimmer you got your value out of smeagol.&#8221;<br />
Some card explanatations.<br />
Aragorn rotn- save this guys till the last few sites and he chump blocks a bunch of minions at 9.<br />
Boromir- still the hobbit buddy<br />
Legolas- easily shoots down dunlenders, trackers, moria orcs, sauron orcs even the occasional fierce mumak. Combined with PATHS you can handle most big minions. Be aware of all blade perish though.<br />
Arwen- solid companion I use her mainly cause of her skills against big nazgul.<br />
Merry and pippin- main stay companions in most decks. Help with A Talent For Not Being Seen.<br />
Smeagol-  with him and stealth cards your opponent cant touch your before site 6. eventually he dies but he does a good job in life. Against trackers with worry he gets expensive tho.<br />
Brace o coney- not such a bad card, removes some burdens that sam cant handle if Smeagol gets into to many fights. Costs zero on frodo anyway.<br />
Frodos cloak- same as coneys but more versatile in its uses.<br />
Sting- duh<br />
Thrors Map- avoid bad sites like kings room and cavern entrance<br />
Bill the pony- this deck has a semi choke aspect to it, if you play you&#8217;ll see what I mean. Bill was a last minute addition to the deck but proved invaluable to the cause.<br />
PATHS- now Saruman koi is banned most minion sides have very limited protection from DD. Try to save a couple for site 9 and its pretty well GG. Combine with legolas to handle big baddies like lurtz and cave troll. Owns dunlend.<br />
Stealth cards- stealths are still really broken.<br />
Hobbit appetite- heal some sting exertions of burdens from sam.<br />
A talent for not being seen- obviously increased the choke factor.<br />
yes its potentially vulnerable to Grima CC but usually Smeagol has died before the gondor guys come out anyway.<br />
<br />
Im convinced that Dunlend is the best Shadow atm. They are cheap strong and versatile.<br />
I play the site control guys so most of the choices are obvious. Wulf, tribes, hordes, warrioirs and hill chiefs are all standard choices. The band is good strength and can deter a double move. I don&#8217;t want to hear anyone tell me that the ransacker is bad. He maybe less strength but his cheapness makes him gold. The rest is obvious except I don&#8217;t play No Retreat cause its one of those cards that only really works when your gonna win anyway. Constantly threatening is best to deter double moves.<br />
That about covers it. Any questions just ask.<br />
O yeah and I name this deck after the mage knights site marker I have used since mines of moria<br />
