The Free Peoples side is just one of the many incarnations of DH.  <br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
Fryin Pan x2 and hobbit sword x1:  See Dalton’s day 2 deck and see what he expected.<br />
BOA:  One of DH worst matchups is uruk-hai, this helps with that match<br />
Legolas toys:  Helps with uruk-hai, and can kill stupid minions on Frodo (even at the cavern entrance since it is not a skirmish special abilityJ<br />
Curse:  Another hate card for moria.<br />
Elrond x3 and Vilya x2:  Are you getting that feeling that I don’t like the moria matchup?<br />
<br />
This deck is extremely versatile and can be altered to handle about any meta game.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
“There is no obviously dominant deck type here today. Players have brought everything from Moria Archery and Sauron to Sam/Gimli choke and Dwarves. Dan Bojanowski was overheard saying, &quot;There&#39;s alot of goofy stuff.&quot;<br />

My shadow choice was to counteract what I had seen at the PSQ on Thursday, Rohan.  Sauron is a bad matchup for rohan in general.  Yes it can soak up some wounds, but only so many.  I think I played against Rohan 3 or 4 games and killed Eomer at site 5 or 6 every game.  The key to this is to draw your conditions (If I had to do this again, I would find a way to cut it to a 60 card deck) and hope they don’t draw 3 Fortress Never Fallen.  Gandalf is bad.  Don’t forget to hold the Dead Marshes against this crazy wizard fellow.  The enqueas and sarumans are there to deal with problematic cards like Fearing the Worst, and Just plain old super fellowship.  Desert Lord will be your MVP in this deck by far.  Let’s explain.<br />
Site 4: Desert Lord, exhaust DH<br />
Site 5: Oh Dh how do I hate you, let me count the waysJ<br />
<br />
Then you get to exchange Dh with quite a few other companions in other decks and do the same thing. <br />
But one thing to remember with this shadow, it can kill before site 9, but usually doesn’t.  Don’t worry if you haven’t killed like 6 companions before site 7, it will be ok.<br />
<br />
One note on the adventure path, The wold should probably not be a plains site, use something like Derendingle (Black Steed Bad).<br />

Thanks for reading!<br />
