<br />
The fellowship strategy is pretty simple…kill things with Dwarves.  Bid 0 burdens to begin the game.  On your first turn, add two burdens to play a ring from your draw deck.  I get either Retribution for Durin, or Fury for Gimli.  If I already have a Lord of Moria on the table, I will add two more to get another ring…usually for Durin.  Play your first weapons on Durin.  As soon as you have Here is Good Rock, start stacking force bumps on it to both cycle your hand and to make dwarves damage +whatever.  Use Disquiets on Durin.  As soon as you get Sam, get rid of some burdens, and go get another ring…if you haven&#39;t pulled them already.  MANAGE YOUR BURDENS WISELY!!!!  Gimli is not capable of taking many burdens, so be smart!  (This deck is susceptible to burden adding, swarms, and shadow conditions on companions.)  However, for the most part, you should generate very little shadow, and consequently be able to DESTROY most minions an opponent can throw at you.  (I had Durin at defender +2, strength 36, damage +8…NOTHING can stop that.)<br />
<br />
The shadow is a basic Easterling deck.  Add some burdens, then add a few more, and to finishimmer off, add a couple more burdens.  I made this deck just to punish people for using the new Reflections ring-bearers.  Add burdens with Vision from Afar, Lieutenants, Guards, and Gatherings.  Then use those burdens to make polearms ridiculous, Heavy Axeman, and Captains stupid strong, and to blow up conditions that may be giving you fits.  Enquea is a must in this deck…dead companions EVERY time you play him if your Easterlings have been doing their job.  Finally, against large fellowships, not only can Enquea hurt fellowships, but also New Fear will allow you to add more burdens or give you discarded companions.<br />
<br />
All in all, I think this is a fun deck to play.  It may not win many tournaments, but it&#39;s fun to corrupt your friends when they least expect it.<br />
