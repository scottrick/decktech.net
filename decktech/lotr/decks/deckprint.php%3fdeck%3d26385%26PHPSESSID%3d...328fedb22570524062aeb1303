This is the deck I played both days at DecipherCon, finishing with an 11-3 record over players like Steven Lewis, Chris Schuat and William Cruse. I made this deck ovecloberriod of 4 weeks of playtesting at local tournaments, and filled it with cards that counter every popular Shadow strategy, some more than others. I usually bid 3, because with Nazgul, going second is hardly a disadvantage, but if I know what my opponent is playing, I generally WANT to go second and let my Nazgul work him over until Im set to run. <br />
<br />
This is your classic Gandalf Super Fellowship deck, with all the usual tricks like Servants and Boromir to keep Frodo alive at 9. The actual deck I played at Dcon I ended up cutting Rumil for something I cannot remember for the life of me. I chose 3 Servants over the full 4 because in playtesting I have drawn multiples of that before seeing Gandalf, and I heard that loses games. In retrospect I SHOULDVE moded my deck for Day 2 with more anti-Uruk stuff, another Armor, the fourth Servants, the second Betrayal, and maybe even Orophin. <br />
<br />
The deck is paired with Nazgul because, well, I guess I am renowned for playing them. I found them to be my choice because of a few reasons. One was that the meta was totally on Moria and Uruk-hai, and this proved huge on Day 1, where 5 of my 6 wins were Shadow. Another was that with Nazgul, providing I dont get LOTRed, the conditions in the deck kill you unless you were running Gandalf, and even then it doesnt help too much. The most basic way to prevent it is by winning skirmishes, and since I never roam, unless you were set up with a god draw at site 1 with 2 Brands on Aragorn, you were usually going to eat conditions, your biggest guys would die, and I would eat up everyone else. Nazgul, like Uruks also have massive stopping power from the start, allowing me to double on my opponents easily with the uber Fellowship. Not roaming also attributes to my drawing through the deck faster, and thus less chance of LOTR. One card I cut last minute that mightve won me a game or 2 is Relentless Charge. At the time I didnt see it being any good in the deck, and it usually clogs your hand until the moment arises, sometimes which it never does. <br />
<br />
<br />
Match-ups as follows:<br />
<br />
<br />
Moria: ...doesnt touch this deck, unless, appearantly, you play Moria ARCHERY with White Arrows. Between 2 Sleeps and Albert to clean house on thier conditions, Aragorn/Glamdring/Sting for twilight control, directed archery, Betrayal and the 9 man fellowship, they will lose. Against most Moria decks I usually had 7-8 companions going into 9 and they came nowhere close to touching Frodo. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uruks: Uruk-hai hurts this deck a bit, like they do most decks. Theyre probably your toughest match-up, but you have enough countermeasures for them. Armor, Servants, Betrayal, and hand weapons all have a place here. Albert is in to pop Ambitions as they come out, and generally if you draw thier pumps out fast, late game you can run on them. Boromir and Filbert at site 9 usually does it for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nazgul: You should be able to give Nazzies a big run for thier money. 2 Flaming Brands and Servants are there to win you skirmishes and double on them. Sleep thier conditions away with Gandalf, and Filbert more or less ruins thier entire day. Having O Elbereth and Filbert at 9 is auto-win for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sauron: I dont even know if there was a single Sauron deck the entire weekend, much less any that qualified I think. Against Sauron you can twilight choke them with Sting and Glamdring, and just make sure you dont exhaust your guys or the Hates will sting like a mofo. Grab Sam ASAP and pull the burdens to make sure his Enduring Evils are useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So thats it. Like a moron I chose not to mod this deck for Day 2 and got enough losses to keep me from Day 3 because of it, but oh well, live and learn. This deck can handle most anything thrown at it, because, well, its made to. And I am well aware that this deck is obsolete now with Towers out, but it doesnt mean you cant mod it with Towers, because cards from Towers makes this deck even meaner. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy, give me a 5, and until Vegas I think.....<br />
