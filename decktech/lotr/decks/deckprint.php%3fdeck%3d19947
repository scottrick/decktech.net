Look into your opponents eyes and probe his mind.  Is he playing enduring evil?  Nazgul with swords?  Probe deeper and you may find out how much he bids.  A little deeper and you will know if he is starting the Prancing Pony.  Ok not really, but sometimes you can get a feeling like that in your gut so that will all affect your bid.  Now I bid a different amount every time, and it really depends on the player, so I wont say how much to bid, but obviously I like to go first.  Three or four is usually sufficient, if he outbids you he&#146;s probably starting Prancing Pony and then Enduring Evil will rip him apart.  Either way, I win.<br />
<br />
Second things Second, the adventure path:<br />
(IMPORTANT:  these choices are not that big a deal, usually I play on opponent&#146;s sites ANYWAY)<br />
<br />
Adventure Path<br />
[1] Prancing Pony: This for Aragorn, obviously.<br />
<br />
[2] Breeland Forest: I don&#146;t play stealth events.  My opponents might, though.  At first I was using Midgewater Moors, but this is a horrible idea if you happen to play against a Moria deck (read: double-edged sword).  A high or low twilight number is not important on this site because the first move is when the opponent will be adding the most twilight.<br />
<br />
[3] Council Courtyard:  This is to aid me in getting from site three to site five all at once.  It is important to get ahead of the opponent early because then they are forced to move twice making it far easier to damage them.<br />
<br />
[4] Balin&#146;s Tomb:  This is because all the other site fours hurt me a lot and this one is just kind of . . . neutral.<br />
<br />
[5] Bridge of Khazad-Dum: Hmm, a lot of choice here.<br />
<br />
[6] Lothlorien Woods:  Forest for A Ranger&#146;s Versatility is the sole reason here.  If my opponent is playing elves and has strength +3 allies, it wont matter because I&#146;ll already be at site eight anyway.<br />
<br />
[7] Anduin Confluence: I know I might have to discard Butterbur or Dreary, but they should be completely exhausted by now anyway.  Butterbur is mainly a one or two use guy.  This CAN be FAR more damaging to my opponent should they be playing elves or hobbits.<br />
<br />
[8] Shores of Nen Hithoel:  I like the twilight pool nine.<br />
<br />
[9] Summit of Amon Hen:  If by some cruel twist of fate, my opponent has survived and beaten me to the ninth site then this is the one that kills him.  Even two or three extra cards is deadly, usually i get between five and eight though.  I have killed several frodos with an enduring evil at this site.<br />
<br />
Deck Credentials:  4-0 in tournament play, undefeated in casual play.  More than half the time, this deck makes it to site nine.  I have made it there against many strong decks of every kind (especially Nazgul and Uruk-hai, those are quite popular in my area).  The shadow half has won games in as little as three minutes with Enduring Evil.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples Strategy:<br />
     The most important thing to remember about this deck is that with exactly sixty cards, you should be able to use close to everything in your deck, which means near the end of the game, you should have almost all the companions and weapons out.  Six companions (when all are out) is, admittedly, a large fellowship, but the benefits far outweigh the risks.  Even just one legolas is worth it because he can kill someone with his text (he can kill two VERY large minions with A Ranger&#146;s Versatility) and he can be assigned to a minion that otherwise might have killed Frodo.  Frodo should almost NEVER be assigned to a skirmish.  First turn, take out Aragorn, play any companions and weapons then move on.  Under all but the most dire circumstances you should move to site three first turn!  Glamdring or Sting can greatly aid you in doing this, (first you get to see there hand, second you may get to remove twilight pool).  Also valiant man of the west will greatly help, because these are the sites at which you can afford to lose skirmishes.  After that try to get from three to five all in one shot, but if not stop at four and the next turn move from four to six.  From there go to eight, if you must stop at seven then by all means do it.  Unless the opponent is far behind at this point, the next move should definitely be all the way to nine.  Dont worry about people dying, if noone but Frodo lives, you still win.  This has happened several times to me.  There are enough companions in here to take the minions, also aragorn with his bow, boromir with his sword, and legolas will exert until they are exhausted at these last two sites.  ANYTHING to get rid of the minions now because it doesn&#146;t matter what happens to your companions now.  Albeit, it does look better if you make it site nine with no cards in the dead pile, but this is not going to happen against a skilled player.  This deck is meant to, and WILL kill the minions (some decks try and sneak by, or take damage and heal) this is just straight up fighting.<br />
<br />
Card Choices and Explanation (just ones that I think need explaining):<br />
<br />
Aragorn, King in Exile:  This is important because he heals Boromir or Arwen.  This way you can use the text of their swords, or let them lose skirmishes, and still be able to heal them.<br />
<br />
Boromir, Lord of Gondor:  This one is far better than the uncommon one because the not being overwhelmed text is great.  Just put armor on Boromir and you have the ultimate punching bag.  He takes the witch-king, cave troll, or lurtz, and just takes one hit.  Easy as pie.  His sword is fantastic too.<br />
<br />
Albert Dreary:  This card is fantastic.  Uruk-hai Rampage, Greed, Worry, Goblin Swarms, and any other annoying conditions are gone.  Try and use him twice before site seven because it will be annoying if he dies with vitality left.<br />
<br />
Barliman Butterbur:  You can play Servant of the Secret fire six times, or you can play Sleep, Caradhras three times, if needs be.  &#146;Nuff said.<br />
<br />
A Ranger&#146;s Versatility:  Save this one to kill two BIG, NASTY minions.  Legolas or Aragorn&#146;s bow can take care of them.  If you have both Legolas and Aragorn with his bow (which does happen a lot), you may not even have to exert, because of the archery total!<br />
<br />
The rest of the fellowship card choices should be self-explanatory.<br />
<br />
Shadow Strategy:<br />
The shadow strategy is quite simple.  Put Desperate Defense of the Ring on the most important companions and Thin and Stretched on Frodo and watch the burdens stack up.  Enduring Evil will overwhelm someone every time you play it, and if Frodo is assigned to a skirmish, you will win the game.  Use the trackers and Forces of Mordor in order to be able to put out lots of minions.  Many of the minions can exert to wound a character they are skirmishing, this will help the wounds to stack up.  Desperate Defense of the Ring, the Orc Inquisitors, the Tower Lieutenant, and the Bands of the Eye will deny your opponent cards, the most important resource in the game (more important than twilight pool), and make it VERY difficult for your opponent to win skirmishes.  Aragorn and Frodo, deck?  Put three desperate defense of the Rings on Aragorn and one on Frodo.  The burdens will add up fast and the game will end quickly.  Sauron minions have generally high vitality compared to other cultures (except nazgul), which means that they do well against archery without help.  I cannot stress enough the power of enduring evil.  I have killed Aragorn at site two with this card, Frodo at site three, Frodo at site nine.  As long as your opponent has any burdens, you should be able to overwhelm someone every time you play it. <br />
<br />
Forces of Mordor:  this seems like a bad card, but sauron minions are expensive due to roaming costs and this is one of the best ways to get twilight.  play it as soon as you get it (unless there are zero minions) in order to open up a card slot in the hand.<br />
<br />
Enduring Evil:  even if opponent bids zero burdens, dont worry because the burdens will add up.  play it as soon as you get it, no matter how many burdens (even zero), having an extra card slot is worth the sacrifice.  I cannot stress enough that against anyone who bids three or more (most people), this card WILL overwhelm someone EVERY TIME if played properly.  Power According to His Stature will only help you.<br />
<br />
Band of the Eye:  This card has almost the best strength for twilight pool available.  Plus the special ability, while expensive can be ultra useful.<br />
<br />
Orc Assassin:  While ultra-wimpy, the tracking ability helps to get out your other minions quickly.  Also the text is great because then they get assigned to companions who are more well, their size.<br />
<br />
Ok those are all the cards  that I feel need explaining. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
