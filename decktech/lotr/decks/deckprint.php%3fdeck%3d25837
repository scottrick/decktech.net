Wai Bien Wong (Gemsword)&#39;s &quot;Madness 1.0&quot; deck gave me a lot to think about in terms of fellowships.  in my general area (Washington state), the meta is incredibly varied.  there has been a huge uprising of moria in my local area, in addition to the expected prevalence of uruk-hai.  also, some of the better players throw out some nazgul black breaths/blade tips on occasion.  so how does a fellowship survive this?  kill nazgul and uruk-hai by going with super-choke, but then die horribly to moria.  kill moria and uruk-hai by going gandalf super-power, but then die to the morgul blades of nazgul.  i was doing fine with my shadow sides, always changing and mixing up my uruks or moria, but my fellowship wasnt cutting it.  when i read the Madness deck, something clicked.  with a few revisions, i took a powerful fellowship and sided it with a powerful shadow, and i havent looked back.<br>
<br>
fellowship:  made to beat anything.  you have strong gondor companions with armor to beat uruk-hai.  you have elf allies and secret sentinels for anti-moria and sauron conditions.  you have flaming brands and last alliances for nazgul.  you have directed archery.  you have frodo protection.  its all there.  you dont clog your hand, you have shards to help flow, you have elrond for some healing.<br>
<br>
card choices: <br>
<br>
PATHS is for all those moria players out there.  burn through their armories with secret sentinels, or force them to waste them with aragorn&#39;s bow and greenleaf, then save your behind with PATHS.  also good against anything else in conjunction with directed archery.  witch-king on your case?  throw 3 shots at him with aragorn and legolas, then throw him at frodo.<br>
<br>
Elrond, Herald is for that extra healing that you need.  i dont find that fellowship elrond is needed in this deck.<br>
<br>
2x galadriel is for playing all those elves for free.  twilight conservation is a big part of this deck.  uruk-hai will ream you if you give them 3 or 4 twilight each fellowship phase.  3 less twilight means one less minion.<br>
<br>
Shadow: standard uruk-hai, with a twist.  2x worry to get some extra wounds (and burdens) out there, and 2x can you protect me to make them have lots of stress, cause they know that worry is gonna put on some burdens, but they cant just exhaust aragorn cause he could die but....and so on.<br>
<br>
card choices:<br>
<br>
i love uruk ravagers.<br>
<br>
orthanc berserker is in here to capitalize on burdens.  if you like enquea better, use him.<br>
<br>
not much else to explain about shadow.<br>
<br>
recommended subsitutions:  if you dont like worry/can you protect, then throw in 2 or 3x beyond the height and another saruman&#39;s power or 2.  if you dont like Shards of Narsil, use Gandalf&#39;s Cart instead.  or maybe both.  one thing i would like to put in the shadow is abandoning reason for madness.  but i like the trim 70 card deck.<br>
<br>
well, i hope you enjoyed the strat, if you have any questions, d-mail me and i&#39;d be glad to discuss the strategy behind the deck.<br>
<br>
rate nicely, i usually do.<br>
