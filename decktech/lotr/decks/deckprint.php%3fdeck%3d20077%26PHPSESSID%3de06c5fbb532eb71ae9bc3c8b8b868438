It&#39;s my style to be aggressive like that, so that&#39;s what the deck does.  You bid 4.  5 if you think they know you bid 4.  You win, and start the Green Dragon Inn.  This is key for 2 reasons.  1) It screws with decks that are reliant on the Prancing Pony site, and 2) it allows you to get out Sam, Sucker of Burdens.  Yay!  You get to go first every game and it&#39;s like you only bid one or two burdens!<br />
<br />
In the Beginning...<br />
So you&#39;re off.  Don&#39;t deploy Aragorn yet (unless you have his bow), and whatever else you can.  The whole premis of this side of the deck is that you don&#39;t want to give your opponent any more pool than you have to, hence the double Sting, the small party, and the No Strangers to the Shadows.  You&#39;ll want to move twice off the bat.  Now that you&#39;re at site 3 you can deploy some more stuff, but don&#39;t EVER double move into site 5, unless you got a good look with sting and know they have crap in their hand.  Site 4, again never deploy anything, then double move to 6.  You can usually take it pretty easy from now on, if your Shadow, AKA the Cave Troll, has done it&#39;s job...<br />
<br />
And when doesn&#39;t the Cave Troll get the job done?  It&#39;s the biggest, baddest baddie out there!  Damage +1 and fierce and power 15 all in one card!  So why not abuse him?  The sole purpose of the Moria part of the deck is to creat a reoccuring Cave Troll, specifically at sites 4, 5, and 6, to slow them down enough to make sites 7, 8 and 9 a breeze for you.  Basically, the Moria activate like fiends- over half the Moria Orcs you have are free or give add to the pool, and then there is the whole Armory/Scimitar combo, so getting the pool for the Troll is a non issue.  While a site 4 Troll isn&#39;t usually devastating, it will usually stop your opponent, if not exhaust their archers.  If site 4 doesn&#39;t do it, then site 5 will.  And if not site 5, then site 6.  Then what?  There is the Nazgul part of the deck.  Originally I was playing 4 of the cheapest Nazgul just for the sake of Relentless Charge (to kill Aragorn and Legolas in one fell swoop), but then I discovered how useful they can be early game and so the Nazgul in here became utility characters.  Ostea was the original cheapo with 3 vitality, Nelya is great for getting my site when I need it, Nertea brings back the Cave Troll late game when I have TONS of pool, and Enquea is there for when they think I have no way of punishing you for taking burdens (this is a Moria deck... isn&#39;t it?).<br />
<br />
This is the End...<br />
So I&#39;ve made it to site 6, and they&#39;re usually back at site 5.  This is good.  Now I can double move again if I feel like my hand is good enough to handle it, or I can just force them to do so, thus allowing major beatings.  Double moving against the Troll is just bad for them.  There are only 2 Ranger&#39;s Versatility&#39;s in the deck because site 8 (and possibly site 7) is the only time you really need it.  And don&#39;t worry, the other benefit to Moria is that they deploy and let you draw ALOT every turn, so you will have at least one ARV by now.  So run to the end archery-ing off what you need, or just let your Cave Troll do your dirty work for you.  Pie.<br />
<br />
One last thing I should mention: the deck is only 64 because I NEED to get various cards into hand early, like Aragorn, the Troll, the Armorys, and the Scimitars.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
