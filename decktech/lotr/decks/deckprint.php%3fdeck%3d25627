If you get outbid thats ok, you have 2x gandalf and boromir + gimli and not to mention 4 aragorn so you should be alright; and the proven legolas arwen start should guarantee a safe passage to site three if you play smart with arwen countering the only extremely aggressive shadow right of the bat (ahem...). At least in the decks that i have seen i dont seem to see any no strangers which i feel is a real shame; for atleast in my experience they are great flow, reduce the number of minions you face and clog you opponents hand with minions indirectly affecting their fellowship draws which can severely hinder them against an aggressive nazgul deck. the two gandalfs i added a while ago for i was just trying to get some good use out of aragorn&#39;s new kick a$$ text and so far it has worked out, for he comes out as a 9-4 and if you get glamdring and 11-4 and w/ gimli a 12/4 which is not to be taken lightly, especially if he is suplementing a potential strength 14 and 13 aragorn and boromir. The two elronds help with the flow and the calaglin and orophin i felt were the two most useful elven allies besides elrond. the choke helps v uruk although a sarumans power can get a little messy. This deck does have its weaknesses but if played right should win the majority of its games (atleast so far it has...). As for the shadow side the reason that im playing four canteas is that he compliments the four relentless charges, let me explain: in my playing experience whenever cantea is put out and the opposing fellowship has weapons they want to keep they are forced to wound cantea twice to prevent his kick- a$$ text from taking effect; so eventually as the archery exertions take their toll; -baam- there goes relentless charge to finish the job; good stuff... the witch king does a lot of work killin those last alliances and what not. I am not sure whether or not a stricken dumb would be a good addition to kill a last alliance, o!elbereth, flaming brand or gwemegil. I also play one fear b/c it is cheap and good flowage and gets rid of annoying allies. The ones worth killing: calaglin, elrond, galadriel, filibert; most of the time they either run only one or you dont care if they spend the pool for another! I do have four morgul gates but only play 3 bc i found that recently i have been playin them more for flow rather than necessity although they are nice v new aragorn and the popular choke. Well anyways thats the basic jist of it; this is my first posted deck on decktech and i am very open to suggestions; this is a fairly generic deck but i am always interested in new ideas and suggestions; thanks a lot for reading this far! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
