<br />
This is a Movment deck that relies on &#39;regroup&#39; cards and Durin&#39;s Secret.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll notice that there are only 2 of most cards in this deck and you&#39;ll be saying well 2&#39;s not enough but it is. The outcome of drawing and playing is equal I can play almost everything that I get in my hands and most often get rid of the things that I don&#39;t need.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll enlighten you as to why I used certain cards in a moment please bear with me while I type it out so that you may read it.<br />
<br />
First off the characters, well I need Gandalf, Gimli and Legolas so that Durin&#39;s Secret works - they usually do. I normally bid 4 to start so that I can go first and get Aragorn, King in Exile then I&#39;ll eventually get Sam and discard the burdens, sacrificing Sam to someone or something big because he&#39;s not needed.<br />
<br />
Then after that you have your Regroup cards:<br />
Tidings of Erebor - Draw 3 during the Regroup phase. Opponent can spend 3 to cancel.<br />
<br />
An Able Guide - Regroup - Spot a Ranger remove 4<br />
<br />
Pursuit Just Behind - Regroup - Ping the opponent. :)<br />
<br />
The other balance of the Fellowship cards are pretty self explanatory.<br />
<br />
As for the minions you&#39;ll see that there are differnt minions and some cards that your probably not used to seeing for example. Dark Places doesn&#39;t usually make the cut into a Moria deck and there aren&#39;t any Goblin Scavengers... WHAT?!?!? No Scavengers... yes true believer there are NO Scavengers in the deck, however I do have Relics of Moria in the deck so that I can get back the lost weapons (granted it costs) but I do have 4 Armories in the deck to make it worth while. <br />
<br />
Back to the Dark Places - that makes my Unique Moria Minions Strength +1, there are 4 that make +4 Mmm yummm Whoever thought that a Guard Commander would hit a 12 (or more pending on the pool) and the Archer Commander well he&#39;s a 12 as well and then there&#39;s the Keyward who&#39;ll become 13 and then finally there&#39;s the Chieftian he&#39;ll be a 13 plus... And of course there&#39;s the Cave Troll who without his Hammer is a 19 and the Balrog whose going to be a 21.<br />
<br />
So with that the deck is somewhat understood and then there&#39;s the sites. I chose basically Forests and Rivers for the Fellowship so that I can use my A Ranger&#39;s Versatility (at key moments). I like to save them usually for site 8 and 9 but sometimes I use them earlier that&#39;s just the way that it happens. <br />
<br />
I also find that when I dump cards I like to make sure that I have double in my hand for later use or if I have one like ARV and I am heading into site 4 I discard it becuase I usually get the other later on.<br />
<br />
Well that&#39;s the deck enjoy in good health.<br />
