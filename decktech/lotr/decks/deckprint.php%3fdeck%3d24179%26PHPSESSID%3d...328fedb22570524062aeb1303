It does this in two ways 1)Far seeing eyes 2)Galadriels Mirror. Both cards are powerful in the fact they limit your opponent on what he can play. You start lego and arwen and you can play any sites you want. Going first does not matter with this deck you eventually take the lead.<br />
   This deck is 120 cards in total hence the reason it is a fun deck. It has won the first tournament it was played in but I would not run it now it just is way to competetive out there these days.<br />
   The fellowship side is easy to get set up get out the mirror and galadriel and celeborn this makes sure that you heal two wounds a turn. 1 wound on Celeborn the other on Galadriel. This means that you can exert to use mirror twice and beleive me this the most annoying thing about this deck is the fact that doing the mirror twice and then playing 2 elvez and now the shadow player has 4 cards in hand.<br />
   The shadow side is meant to play every thing you can by using either the TAC or foul things which is not limited to just orcs. Try the deck against a choke deck and your opponent will be in trouble.<br />
   The deck has 4 ways of drawing cards 1)Elrond 2)scimatars 3)using relics to get the scimatars back 4)plundered armories help to and they also help keep the little guy&#39;s alive to.<br />
   Well that is all and if you do not like my grammer I do not want to here any complaints and besides this is only a fun deck and it works really good in multi-player games have fun with the deck the next deck I post will be Wizardz &quot;R&quot; Us </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
