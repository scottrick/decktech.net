So, fellowship block will be allowed those weeks. <br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
It does not really matter if you go first or not so bid 0. If you somehow manage to get the option, then by all means, go first. If you go first, start with Dammed Gate-Stream to draw out Don&#39;t Look at Them. If you go second, use it for site 3 as Gandalf will make the double from 1-3 easy enough. I have 3 copies of Don&#39;t Look at Them in there in case it&#39;s discarded or you are playing a ranger deck with pathfinders and Well Travelled. It is a VERY important card. Get Consorting With Wizards on Bilbo ASAP. There are many strength boosters for Bilbo as the whole idea is for him to fight as much as possible on the second move of a double after Smeagol has taken care of whatever big nasty came out on your first move. Smeagol, Always Helps text is, &quot;Assignment: Assign a minion to Smeagol and add 2 threats to exhaust that minion&quot; (paraphrased). Then, discard 3 cards from hand with Don&#39;t Look at Them to finish it off. The threats  can then be removed via Nine-Fingered Frodo. <br />
<br />
Card Choices -<br />
<br />
Hobbit Intuition - +3 pump for Bilbo<br />
Red Book of WestMarch - I play so many tales that this is very useful for cycling and to retain initiative and have enough cards in hand for Don&#39;t Look at Them<br />
Ghan-Buri-Ghan - He can take one for the Team against a swarm deck<br />
Hobbit Swords and Farmer Maggot - Maggot can also take one for the team, plus the hobbit swords can be transferred between hobbits to satisfy Bilbo&#39;s text (&quot;every time the fellowship moves, if the  twilight pool has 2 or fewer tokens in it, add (3) or2 budens&quot;).<br />
<br />
Good matchups - <br />
ANY Sauron. Wounding, Besiegers, any at all. This deck has no problems with.<br />
Uruk Hai. Damage bonuses mean nothing to a guy who can not take wounds.<br />
Any possession hate, ie - Dunland. Bilbo has enough non-possession strength to keep on trucking.<br />
Corsairs. This deck is great against Corsairs. Smeagol makes sure Castamir never lays a hand on Bilbo.<br />
Raider Wounding. Pointless.<br />
<br />
Bad matchups-<br />
Beasterlings. Polearms are Smeagol-Bane. Coruption of any kind could be very bad. It negates G for Grand and Bilbo is only a base 8 resistance. Salt From the Shire helps some.<br />
<br />
Any comments or suggestions would be most welcome.
