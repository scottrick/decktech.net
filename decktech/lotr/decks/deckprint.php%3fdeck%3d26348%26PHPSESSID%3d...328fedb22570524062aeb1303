1. there is not a good site for a ring bound ranger deck really so i chose the least used one i believe. <br />
2. this is the least hurtful and it can deny treebeard or the tracker move card this deck likes to move. <br />
3. i like this card play out your free peoples cards and just stack all your shadow below and draw four cards it helps with hand clogs. <br />
4.rohan is a popular thing around here so i use this to get out alot of beefy uruk hai. <br />
5. again to get out alot of beefy uruk-hai since most all my minions should have some kindof minus to there cost by this site it can make it a death zone hehe. <br />
6. again an uruk-hai site your uruks should be playing for fairly cheap by now you should have an extra 2-4 lying around so use it. <br />
7.doesnt hurt me at all thats why i like it and possibly screws them up hehe. <br />
8.i dont play dunlend enough said. <br />
9.this one is the most user friendly i think hopefully lets you play a couple brusiers at the end. <br />
<br />
<br />
Free peoples <br />
First off i have lots and lots of fun with this deck because i can pretty much take care of anything. the cliffs are there to take some burdens, and you will be playing a few ring bound companions so bid high close to 4-6 if you wish. the deck can move down the site path at blazing speeds just make sure you get those gondorian rangers down early they are great, and try not to get them killed if you can help it. Mablung is not a must have but he can easily kill a vanguard or saruman with a staff with a bow and two exertions. play your event cards smartly and you shouldnt have too much trouble. 2.0 stuff i changed a few cards because i have them now namely it has a site liberation card and i found that the forbidden pools didnt help all that much and faramirs cloak is just awesome. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow <br />
I now have some of the rares i want like the uruk hai horde and one trooper. this shadow site is very tight and you should have very little problems cycling now. This deck now has shadow condition removal in burning of the westfold but just remember you have to play an uruk with this card so you cant place a token on attack on helms deep if you want to get rid of a condition. Remember to take control of those sites and dont forget about putting on tokens. gl and have fun with this deck i know i do.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
