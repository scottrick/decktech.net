I&#39;ve been playing decks that have 40-50 rares and I got tired of it, and thought to myself, what works without rares?  Easy, hobbits and moria.  To my surprise this deck can easily hold its own while you murder the opponent with arrows.  I&#39;ve even won a few running to site 9.<br>
  Strategy?  Run...  Don&#39;t worry about bidding anything.  Its better if you go second, but not all that important.<br>
   For shadow, get They Are Coming in play, and as many minions in the discard pile as soon as possible, especially the Goblin Bowmen.  These guys are so easy to get back into play later.  Scimitars and Scavengers are here to help you cycle through your deck quickly.  You also want your opponent to lead, so he can step into Brown Lands at Site 8.  It&#39;s not hard to throw out 10-15 archery here.  (Each Moria Troop can add three each here, or those Bowmen can add two, which is not too bad for 2 twilight!)  As a bonus you have the three pumpers to see that a archer wins a skirmish everynow and then, which is always a surprise.<br>
   For Free Peoples...  This is the tricky part.  Get swords on all the hobbits asap.  Hold all stealths and intuitions, don&#39;t discard them until you absolutely have to.  Try to keep Sam from skirmishing until 5 if possible.  You should be giving so little twilight that you won&#39;t see too many minions.  At 5, Sam can go Def+1, or +2(with a stout and sturdy), and stealth the balrog and whatever else he throws at you.  If worst comes to worst, you should be able to pump sam up with Merry to keep him from getting overwhelmed.  Bilbo is here for condition removal, mainly for nasty sauron conditions, or a Goblin Swarms.  Bounders help keep you alive, as does Filibert.  Don&#39;t forget that the bounders can be healed with Stout and Sturdy too.  Its also a skirmish event, so you can always wait until the last moment to decide.  The last couple of sites can be hard, but if you get lucky and draw Deft in their Movements and a few pumpers(Intuit. and Stealths) you should survive.<br>
  Another note... look for your opponent to be overconfident... encourage it.  Your free peoples will be taking a beating, and he will win all of his free peoples skirmishes.  Luckily he wont realize how much damage he is taking from archery until Brown Lands (I&#39;ve had two games where I&#39;ve killed 6 companions, including Frodo here)  Occasionaly your shadow pumper will kill a companion, i.e. Bowman vs. Arwen 4-6, then pumper, Bowman wins.  Ouch.<br>
  If you want to add rares to this, i reccommend Goblin Armories, Swarms, Relics.  For Free Peeps I reccommend PATHS and maybe a Raragorn.<br>
  The games with this deck are always very close...  that is what makes this so much bloody fun.  And after your done you can just throw the deck away... its good for a laugh, especially when you ask your opponent to trash the deck that HE just lost with....  Let me know what you think. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
