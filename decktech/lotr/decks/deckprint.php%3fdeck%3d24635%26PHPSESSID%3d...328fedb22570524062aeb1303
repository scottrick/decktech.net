I didn&#39;t notice it in the FAQs.  Oh well.<br />
<br />
READ THE STRATEGY OR DO NOT REVIEW THIS DECK.  It is long as anything.  This means that it was carefully planned out - at 5:30 in the morning, I might add.  The Fellowship side adds 0 shadow total throughout the game, aside from Companions and the Site Numbers, so the shadow screw is in effect.<br />
<br />
Bidding:<br />
<br />
Bid 4.  The only ones that will bid higher are Frodo Suicide, Sam Burden Removal, and Nazgul.  You are nice and safe going second, and your opponent won&#39;t have the time or the necessary Shadow to add the burdens.  Sam Burden Removal only works with the Green Dragon Inn, so you go second anyway.  No higher than 4 - Enquea is bad.<br />
<br />
First Turn:<br />
Your shadow side won&#39;t be able to do much on this, because, well, Lurtz just doesn&#39;t happen at site 2 that often.  If you can play him, don&#39;t bother, just play cheapies and get them out of your hand for card cycling (especially if you don&#39;t see Aragorn).  Your opponent will move up to site 3 and stop.<br />
<br />
If you drew Aragorn or if your opponent uses the Pony (his cost is not -2 then), play him immediately using Pippin&#39;s game text, and if you have them, The Shards of Narasil.  Aragorn removes the remaining 2 and you shuffle forward to site 2, giving your opponent 4 shadow.  If you get reaaaaly lucky, you&#39;ll be holding An Able Guide and 2 copies of We Must Go Warily, or your opponent played a useless minion. If you are such a lucky bastard, play Warily, move on to council courtyard, giving your opponent 7 shadow.  Kill Pip with whatever minion they play.  Spot Bree Street&#39;s game text to play your second Warily and the Able Guide (if you have it and need it), and move again, removing another 2, and with the 2-3 twilight of site 4, you gave them 1+3+3 = max 7.  And their minions are cost +4.  You really don&#39;t need the sanctuary now, as all you have to do is navigate the bridge, and you&#39;re at another one.  8-9 shadow is a small problem, however, the deck is full of boosties.<br />
<br />
If you are not so lucky, stop at site 2, and then next turn, use the same process, so as to get all the way up to the Bridge without taking a very large dent.  It goes like this:  Play your swords on Aragorn and Boromir now - at most totaling 2, which is removed.  Pull a Defender +1s and boostie stuff you need off of Shards, if you have it and didn&#39;t play both weapons.  Council = 3 shadow.  Remove 2, Warily, move.  Hollin is out, so 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.  Their minions are cost +2, so if they play anything, it won&#39;t be serious.  Aragorn should be able smack it down - if you can&#39;t kill it, though, feed Pippin to it.  Able Guide if there is any shadow left, and Warily if you have it.  Minions are now either +2 or +4, and the pool is very low - 7 - 4 = 3, + 6 + 3 = 12 total for site 5.  And did I mention that the balrog would cost 10, and the Cave Troll 9?  Heck, a runner costs 3, so getting swarmed is probably not happening.  Uruk-Hai are 8 apiece, Lurtz, Witch-King, etc. all ring true at 11 and 12.  Sauron orcs are 10, and Isengard Orcs die fairly quickly under your blade.  You should survive this turn with ease.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is fairly straightforward.  Play alot of Lurtz.  Use the Captain to play Lurtz from the grave and make him fierce.  Play Lurtz&#39;s sword.  Remove Armors and Mithrils with Beyond the Height of Men.  Lurtz w/sword is power 15, and is doing 7 wounds a turn if fierce, 4 if not.  Nobody will chase your running fellowship with superLurtz on the table.  Savagery can be used to help your other minions against large fellowships, and cycles cards fairly well.  Your minons exist for the sole purpose of making Lurtz fierce, and then dying from archery or something.  Common Sarumon is included to put Lurtz against the people he can kill if you are giving large doses of twilight, instead of putting Lurtz on Pippin (like the fellowship side of this deck is prone to do).  Use the Battle Cry to kill everything that doesn&#39;t die from Lurtz to begin with.<br />
<br />
Against a shadow choke, you might be in trouble - here&#39;s how to get out of it: Stack fellowship cards on Shards, reconcile, and then the next turn, draw them all again, and don&#39;t play them.  You may now discard your choice of useless shadow cards, like Saruman (you&#39;ll never play him).<br />
<br />
After site 5, things start to get tricky.  If you couldn&#39;t pull off your 1-4/2-5 move due to lack of cards, don&#39;t fret!  Lurtz will slow your opponent and just pummel him to crap, and you can catch up later.  Your site 6 is great - you can easily double from 4-6 if it&#39;s out and a weak minion is out to put on Frodo.<br />
<br />
One last thing.  Aragorn is Frodo signet - if you pull one too many copies of him at once, do some wound transfering and heal.<br />
<br />
Other notes:<br />
<br />
Valley of the Silverlode ROCKS with Lurtz&#39;s Damage +2ness!  If no Ranger is to be spotted, then everyone dies from Lurtz!<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
Nazgul:  Cost too much to really threaten, but you have to watch for BB/BTs.  You shouldn&#39;t lose companions to them, but be wary.<br />
<br />
Moria:  Defender +1?  Check.  Minions cost +2?  Check.  Spend a total of 10 seconds in Moria? Check.<br />
<br />
Uruk-Hai:  Too easy.  Aragorn and Boromir both kill them all with the massive amounts of pumps hanging around.  At sites 8 and 9, they&#39;ll be seeing 11 shadow - barely enough to get a guy on Frodo, and he&#39;ll be weak.  Armor is uneccesary, because you&#39;re not losing skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Sauron:  They die pretty quick, but Desperate Defense and Thin and Stretched + Enduring Evil.  With DD, discard cards instead of taking burdens.<br />
<br />
Isengard Orcs:  Aragorn and Boromir do 2 wounds apiece and overwhelm half of them, so no exert-to-wounds in regroup, really.  Plus, Citadels heal them right after putting the wounds on.<br />
<br />
SuperFellowship:  Lurtz was made for this!  Kill them one at a time, and send best wishes with Savagery on your puny power 5 guy.  They only have so many ARVs, and Aragorn can only gun down the beast so many times.<br />
<br />
Rangers:  See Superfellowship.<br />
<br />
Elves:  That&#39;s why there are all the vitality 3 power five weaklings in the deck.  Lego can&#39;t drop 3 directed archery on Lurtz without a Tale.  Orophin can be a problem, but not very serious, as he can only be used effectively once every 2 turns (Galadriel healing).<br />
<br />
Dwarves:  Die with one shot against Lurtz and Sword.  Fierce Lurtz and Sword means that 2 dwarves die.<br />
<br />
Hobbits:  Don&#39;t really stand much of a chance.  The Hobbit Hospital can&#39;t heal 7 wounds a turn, and Stealths become scant with fierceness.  If Boromir is out, Savagery can be incredibly devastating.<br />
<br />
Shadow Denial:  Tricky.  Use the Shards to cycle cards, and from it draw stacked fellowship cards in bunches to discard shadow in bunches.  If you get a Lurtz out, they&#39;re in trouble, because you now have a hand full of shadow to support him - Savageries and Battle Cries and Swords kill alot of things very quickly, especially when alot of the support cards are shadow denial cards.<br />
