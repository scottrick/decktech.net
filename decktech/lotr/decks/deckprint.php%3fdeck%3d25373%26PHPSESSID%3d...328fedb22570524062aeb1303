The deck was a machine before it came out, and still is w/ 1 use per skirmish. In addition, if you have 2 Trusts out, you CAN do it twice according to Enrique Huerta, the TD @ DragonCon. <BR>Thrain 4: Not to be rude, but you&#39;re an idiot. Gandalf&#39;s staff is a decent consideration, but 2 pool usually means 1 extra bad Uruk, when I could just play Narya for free or 2 pool that actually does me something (ie Long Knives + Bow Of Galadrhim). <br />
<br><br />
Filbert does rock, but with the Confluence and only one Hobbit who likes to take random archery and Sting, I find him to be unworthy of the card space. I would also like to say one more thing about everyone who says Saruman&#39;s Power owns Trust Me.... I understand that Saruman&#39;s Power does get rid of Trust Me, HOWEVER, Trust Me costs 2 pool, Saruman&#39;s Power costs 2 pool and an exertion, so at the VERY least, you&#39;ve used a card to cause an exertion, which isn&#39;t terribly bad. In addition, it gets rid of all Shadow Conditions, so they can say goodbye to Ambitions or Tower Of Orthanc or No Business or whatever, so it&#39;s not a total waste.<br />
<br><br />
<BR>End strategy update.<BR><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Well, what can I say, I love this deck so much I can&#39;t even begin to stress it. I&#39;ve been playing nearly the exact same thing since the game came out with the theory that when you have 4 Servants, a 12 power Gandalf, a 10 (or 11 now) power Aragorn you won&#39;t win a lot of skirmishes, and it sure is easy to move on dead minions (believe me). When I read Trust Me As You Once Did I just about nutted my pants... Swap the Frodo to Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir, and BAM!<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
This deck does great against Sauron, awesome vs. Uruks, bends Moria over a table and beats Nazgul if you get a half decent draw. It went 14-2 Origins (before Trust Me) at 14-2 at GenCon and 7-1 to win the DragonCon day 1 event. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
You basically play every game the same, get Gandalf out, kill minions and double or triple move every turn forever (within reason). Most games you won&#39;t even play Boromir for fear of Enquea, but if a companion dies, Boromir&#39;s very nice to step in and take some wounds, and he&#39;s much better than Gimli against Nazgul. You won&#39;t be able to believe what this deck can double (and triple)move on. Once I faced a site 4 Balrog and my friend said "well at least that will stop you." However, with a little help from Servants, Trust Me, Moria Stairway, archery and Bow Of The Galadhrim, he was toast and I was easily able to move to 5. At 5 he played Cave Troll w/ Hammer, and he perished in a similar manner giving me an easy move to site 6 with the boost of the Waterfall. At day 1 DragonCon a guy got out Saruman and 5 Uruks on me at site 5, 2 of which were Troops and made a little comment about "Heh, that&#39;ll stop you..." So I killed 3 of them, exhausted Saruman, moved again and talked smack the rest of the game :-)<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Other than that you have everything you need to deal with every culture. Sleep x2 should keep conditions from hurting you too badly, and Dreary picks up any stragglers (Ambitions, Tower Of Orthanc etc). I know that Sleep hoses your own Trust Me, but you need Trust Me against Uruks and Nazgul and Sleep against Moria and Sauron, so you should be good to go either way. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
As for the Shadow, I went with Moria because most games it stops people at site 4 for fear of Cave Troll/Balrog at 5, and that&#39;s all you need. It sets up your fellowship like no man&#39;s business cycling your deck better and making it bigger, letting me leave all those crucial events and possessions in the deck. It can also stop them with Orcs at site 8, which is crucial. It also sets up an insane swarm against decks without Condition removal, and that Cave Troll&#39;s bada$$ for stopping people (even if you have no conditions). Enquea punishes big fellowships, though I may swap one for a Nertea, because he&#39;s almost as effective, and better against 5 companions. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
In my opinion this is the best deck ever built, including the Mirror/White arrows POS in its prime, and I enjoy playing it much more than any other deck I&#39;ve ever played. It also helps that my version of this deck is completely foiled, but that&#39;s a matter of preference :-)<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Hope you all enjoy, and check back for a DragonCon TR soon (though I won&#39;t cover day 1 in much detail beacuse my loss was gay and my wins were pretty standard). <br />
