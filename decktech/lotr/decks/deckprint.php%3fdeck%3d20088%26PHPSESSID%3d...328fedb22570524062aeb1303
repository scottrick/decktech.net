This deck is centered around setting up Elrond with the two home 3 dwarves and Shoulder to Shoulder. The turn after you play Shoulder to Shoulder, you will be able to draw 3 extra cards a turn with those 3 guys alone. Also, the 2 dwarves can heal Arwen and more importantly Legolas. This makes it where Legolas can shoot down 2 guys after you play A Ranger&#39;s Versatility. The amount of healing that can take place once you play Shoulder to Shoulder is insane. Once you get The Choice of Luthien, even Aragorn can join in the healing fun. The Celeborn - Galadriel combo is for drawing even more cards with Elrond, which is essential to setting up a good beatdown hand with the Shadow half of the deck. Aragorn does most of the fighting if there are any minions left after you use his bow and Legolas combined with Versatility. Arwen can fight when she needs to because she is a ranger, therefore getting the benefit from Swordsman. I also included her sword, and the fact that the 2 dwarf allies can heal her make her pretty resilient. If you get The Choice of Luthien you can exert her to heal Aragorn, then exert a dwarf to heal her. There are also a lot of little combos you find to when playing this deck. The deck wants the opponent to play first, so you can bid zero and hope they choose to play, or bid about 4-5 and make them play. The deck doesn&#39;t give away much twilight after site 1, and the deck can play two entirely different ways. If your combo gives you what you need to run, do so. Site 6 is especially easy to make it through if you draw Celeborn and/or Galadriel. The other way to play the deck is of you get a really good swarm hand you should move 1 site at a time so that they have to go through your site 7 (no archery phase) then you can kill most of their guys with a good shadow hand, then stack all your minions on a swarm you are more than likely to have drawn by then, and just kill Frodo at the next site. <br />

Shadow - <br />
<br />
One of the simpliest of decks. Just play runners and Scimitars early to get a few goblins in your discard pile for Host of Thousanding back later and drawing cards. You will try to either win or hurt them really badly in on big turn. Use They Are Coming to get back dudes as well as thin your deck out and go through it faster. Don&#39;t worry about running out of cards, because if you get to see every card you need, you should be able to swarm them at site 7, and you usually want it to be yours, so your fellowship should have only moved 1 site at a time if your hand shows you can swarm (and it should after drawing so many cards). Some key points to remember is that if you have minions left over to assign, and you usually will, assign only the Moria Scouts that are left over to Frodo and double or triple up on other people with every other minion. You want to do this so that they will no Power According to His Stature all your dudes, and you will probably kill most everybody else. After you have killed their archers, taking out Frodo is simple, just dump Moria Scouts on him and make him use 2 more power according to his stature to survive. This will probably be at site 8, so even if he does double PATHS, he will probably die at site 9, especially if you have Goblin Swarm or They Are Coming on the table so that your Scouts will make a return visit. Play this deck smart and you can beat archery decks, like hold on until you can play multiple wallcrawlers, or Scouts to soak up the archery, or just wait until site 7 and win there.<br />

Overview - <br />
<br />
This deck is not for everybody, it takes patience and a quite a few rares for the Free Peoples half, but once you get Shoulder to Shoulder running, you should be able to see what you need to survive and win.<br />
