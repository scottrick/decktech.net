point in Amiens (France) by finishing at the third place (4/2, with a defeat against the best french player : JB Laroche) <br />
<br />
About the strategy, you have just to make your opponent start by bidding 0 or 3 max.<br />
In fact, for 18 victories with this deck, i only won twice with my Free People, that&#39;s why i prefer let my opponent be in front.<br />
<br />
As for the Free People, it&#39;s a big denial deck based on Faramir skills and Aragorn twilight removal ability. I don&#39;t play elf in this deck because of moria, it&#39;s right that i can deal with that, but Moria Scout is really dangerous for a free people with only four companions.<br />
Against Nazgul,Sauron,Dunlend and Raider, my archery and fighting skills are enough to win skirmishes and heal with Citadel.<br />
The only one shadow which disturbed me is the Uruk Beatdown, that&#39;s why i added 2 Banners to win key Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
For the shadow side, uruk archers with raiders is a real good combo. I explain : When you arrive at the last sites,every companions are wounded or exhaust, so you can use raider aimed archery and then uruk woun ability to slaughter your opponent ;-)<br />
Seriously, this deck is able to kill at site 7 but most of the time it&#39;s for site 8 or 9 (Palanthir Chamber!!!!!!!!)<br />
In the first sites,try to settle down your conditions and begin the show at site 4!<br />
It&#39;s not important to play lots of minions before deep, the only one important thing is to make most damages you can thanks to site 5.<br />
Except that, this deck is quite easy to play with such nasty tricks like Gatling Enquea, Tower Assassin and Discovered!!<br />
I imagine you&#39;re trying to remember what is the interest of this card. Manage to kill an aragorn and a legolas in maneuver and you sure agree with me ;-)<br />
<br />
In short, Archery is able to do something in big tournament but be careful to Sam SoH, or Boromir DoMT!<br />
<br />
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy playing this deck :-)<br />
I&#39;m waiting for your reviews...<br />
