But after I got spanked by Josh C-M there, I realized that the deck had a huge weakness to Dauntless Hunter.  I tried using Dalton&#39;s Trackers for a while, which was decent, but in regular tournament play I decided there were just way too many close calls on time, since there were double the assignment actions.  And plus, people would be teching against it, since it did win Worlds and all.<br />
<br />
I wanted to stay with Uruks though, because being able to have both Spears and Powers is very good in the environment.  Otherwise, you just tend to get run over by Rohan.  So I liked the way that the archery deck performed, so I just basically took out all the stuff that got screwed by Dauntless, and added in more archers, preferably cheap ones so I get get a lot of them out.  And it worked out, going 5-3 at DragonCon to place 10th, with the second highest SoS out of the 5-3&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
One Ring, ATAR-- I had no idea there would be so much archery (and crap like Snows), so this was likely a bad choice.  I played ATAR in the tournament, but I&#39;d go IB if I had to do it again.<br />
<br />
Dendingle-- I could play the Wold, but I&#39;m really not interested in stopping at 2 if I have to go second.  I&#39;d rather play something smaller and be able to double than try to wreck them early, which doesn&#39;t always work.<br />
<br />
Ranger of the North x2-- I expected to see a lot of swarmy decks, especially since this was Atlanta.  If I don&#39;t get RotN against swarm, I lose.  This turned out to be a great meta choice.<br />
<br />
Horses x4-- Even with Arrow-Slits x3, I still got screwed by Uruk Spears at GenCon.  I hate getting screwed.<br />
<br />
Ranged Commander x4-- With as many minions as are in my deck, getting them down cheaper meant more minions almost every time.  There was much more potential for hand clog from too many minions, that having 4 copies of a unique to mitigate that was worth it.<br />
<br />
Archers that aren&#39;t Uruks x5-- I ran out of Uruk Archers that don&#39;t suck.  Wanted to go cheap here, so I would be able to play them in addition to the Uruks, and not instead of.<br />
<br />
Desert Lord x0-- Sure he&#39;s cool, but he&#39;s just too expensive.  The limiting factor in this deck was how many guys I could put down per turn, and I could play 2-3 guys for the cost of a Lord.<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
FP vs. Nazgul.  Kill all the Nazgul and then move again.  Use Arrow-Slits to get rid of their stuff if you need to.  This is your ideal matchup.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Cave Troll Moria.  Kill the Cave Troll and/or Balrog, then double.  No sweat.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Moria Swarm.  Tough, but winnable.  Use your mojo to try to not get screwed by Black Traitor, and remember that he can be pulled from deck at 5.  Try to run as quickly as possible, the less they get set up, the better.  Letting them deck out with the sneak loop is game-ending.  Drop RotN before you move to the Cavern Entrance, but make sure Legolas is dead first, Chief Counselor is game over.  Once you get past 7, the Frying Pan is golden.  If they play Snows, pray.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Moria Archery.  Take your wounds, then beat all of their minions.  This is a tough matchup, but you should be able to kill their minions easily enough.  Don&#39;t skip any sanctuaries, and if you get to a plains site (which is unlikely), that&#39;s where you want to burn all your hosts.  Don&#39;t forget to take archery on Hlafwine and Leod at 4.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Big Uruks.  If you can keep your horses around, you should be able to kill the Uruks.  Arrow-Slits is key here.  Be smart with your horses, if you suspect they&#39;re going to spear you, don&#39;t play all of them at once.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Uruk Trackers.  This matchup is a lot like Big Uruks, if you can keep your horses around, you shouldn&#39;t have any problem winning.  Fierce actually works to your advantage, because you have more chances to kill them.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Uruk Archery.  Horrible matchup if they&#39;re playing Spears.  I&#39;d rather hold on to the Slits for Spears, but in a jam you can use them to burn the Weapons.  This one is winnable, but you&#39;re going to have to play smart.<br />
<br />
FP vs. Dunland.  Legolas and We Left None Alive are money in this matchup.  If you go first, try to keep Legolas alive past the no-archery sites.  Don&#39;t burn your Arrow-Slits on Hides right away, you usually want to save them for the War Clubs.  Rule of thumb is to only burn Slits on Hides if that allows Legolas to shoot the guy with the Club.  Getting rid of Clubs should be your first priority, since your deck relies on possessions.<br />
<br />
Shadow vs. Rohan.  Rohan has very little healing, so this is a good matchup.  Be smart with your Spears, if they have Slits out, either Power first or play two Spears at once.  If you can get rid of their horses, that stops any Thundering Host healing, and it allows your bigger Uruks to win skirmishes.  Winning skirmishes + archery wounds + no heals should = win.<br />
<br />
Shadow vs. HIDAN or Trust.  Well, if they want to exert a lot to do stuff, that&#39;s perfectly fine with any archery deck.  Just use your Spear to kill their mounts (or Shadowfax), and you should be fine.<br />
<br />
Shadow vs. Elves and Men.  They typically have a good amount of healing, so you might want to try and stay ahead with your FP.  Use your Spears and Powers to keep Asfaloth and Last Alliance off the table, winning skirmishes is vital.  Site 8 getting rid of all of their allies is pretty huge.<br />
<br />
Shadow vs. Dauntless Hunter.  The only card in the deck affected by Dauntless is Saruman&#39;s Power, which is good against DH even if you do have to pay 4 for it.  Since they only have 5 guys, the archery wounds will build up fast, especially if they&#39;re exerting for Aragorn&#39;s Bow or Gondor Bowman.  Discard Lurtz because you&#39;re not going to get that much pool; try to play as many little archers as you can, because Merry and Pippin lose even against these.<br />
<br />
Shadow vs. Ents.  Use Power and Spears to make sure Lurtz and the Assassin still win fights.  Enquea is key here.  Don&#39;t bother going after Treebeard, your first targets are Merry and Pippin, especially the discarding variety.  Without hobbits, Treebeard doesn&#39;t fight anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s about it.  FYI I didn&#39;t play this deck on Day 2, I played Tennet&#39;s Wingfoot/Gandalf/Dunland deck, which turned out to work much better against the opponents I played than this deck would have.  I think, at least.  But this was a fairly solid day 1 choice. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
