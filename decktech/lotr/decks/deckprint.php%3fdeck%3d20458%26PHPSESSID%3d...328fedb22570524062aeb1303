It was once all Nazgul but that got tiring anyhow I decided to make something with differnet and here it is.<br />
<br />
The thought behind the deck is moving down the path somewhat quickly you should in a 1 on 1 player game move down to site 3 in the first turn and then from 4 to 6 in the second pending on your hand of course. I find that 70 cards, the deck size, is quite sufficient for it&#39;s goal. I was trying to keep it to 60 but this works well with the ability to play most everything when you get it.<br />
<br />
The first thing to do is bid about 4 burdens (that way you get to go first and get The Prancing Pony) (like that&#39;s something new to you all) then get your site 2 out (that&#39;s key so you can move +1) Then after that it&#39;s not that important for your locations.<br />
<br />
Get the Tale of Gil-Galad on Legolas, and the Tale of Elindil on Aragorn to make use of the Bow/Archery skills to pluck off the Minions then beat them down. If there is anything left then you move with Pursuit Just Behind to finish of what&#39;s left and then A Noble Guide to remove whatever tokens may be left. When you hit a River or Forest (which will happen) play A Rangers Versatility to exhaust the biggies then pluck them off and kill the smaller ones.<br />
<br />
As for the Shadow that&#39;s simple get out your Conditions and don&#39;t worry so much about them dying exert them to use Deserperte Defense and Hates and then use the Blade Tip/Black Breath for the Nazgul. When the Nazgul die, of course play a Morgul Skulker to get 2 of them back and repeat the process 4 times. That way you will have Minions by the end of your deck that you can drop on them. (Although I have never gotten to the end cause usually by the 4th turn this deck has won)<br />
<br />
Comments are excepted but please when you reiview the deck please tell me why you are giving me what you give me if.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
P.S. - Yes, I know it&#39;s 70 cards, it cycles quickly and yes there are only 6 Nazgul, remember the Skulkers and Blade Tip/Black Breath you DON&#39;T need to spot a Nazgul to play them just drop them then when you get them go from there. It works. Trust me. ~smirk~<br />
