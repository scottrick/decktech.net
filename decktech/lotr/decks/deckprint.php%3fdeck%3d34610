<br />
I built this deck for the TN December PSQ, just looking for something that would give me a chance against anything on FP side.  A local player had been playing Twitch King and it was working pretty well, and I decided to add Enquea in the mix.  (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one, but usually I play decks I find online, just because I work three jobs in addition to being a DAgent, and don&#39;t have much time to playtest).<br />
<br />
<br />
For the December PSQ, we had 22 and the deck went 5-1, coming in 2nd place.  The competition was rough, and I got my biggest win against Michael Holloway, who finished top 8 at Worlds last year, and beating Sullivan to get to day 3(how&#39;s that for circuitous name-dropping?)  To be fair, he was playing the grass ring, which obviously is a bad match-up, but then so was my Fellowship giving 40 twilight a turn on his Beasterlings.  If i hadn&#39;t corrupted him when I did, he would have killed me on the next site. <br />
<br />
The one game I lost was against Dwarf choke, but I only needed one more burden to get Gimli, before I made a stupid mistake and killed myself. <br />
<br />
Then I was playing Final Accounts, and setting up Enquea/BNAP or WK/FB combo depending on whatever was working the best.  The beauty of this deck is that even if one of those isn&#39;t working, the other one should, and you can just shuffle in whichever with Skulkers.<br />
<br />
Since then, I&#39;ve played this deck in one local (16 people), going 4-0, and another PSQ with 18 people, so the deck is 15-1.  <br />
<br />
Ents just survive against almost anything, allowing you the time to corrupt, or in a good matchup, run like the wind.<br />
<br />
For Saturday&#39;s PSQ, I had to change it up with the Final Accounts being gone.  I now had room for LOTC instead of Leader of Men, which was fine with me.<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
<br />
FP<br />
<br />
Forest Gaurdian<br />
<br />
Probably the best choice I could have made for this deck.  He allowed me to cycle like crazy, especially in the Solo Smeagol match-up ditching every Shadow card I drew and running to nine.  <br />
<br />
Gandalf&#39;s Staff<br />
<br />
I know two is a lot, but I have an emotional attachment to this card, as it&#39;s saved my butt so many times.  Cancelling a skirmish helps against so many deck types, and it&#39;s extra vitality for Terrible and Evil.<br />
<br />
Enraged<br />
<br />
I might take out one of these for Out of High Airs, just because I find I rarely need to run with this deck, and Out of High Airs might be more useful as a one-time triple.<br />
<br />
Speak &quot;Friend&quot;<br />
<br />
The Speak &quot;Friend&quot; and Caras Galadhon combo.  I didnt&#39; pull it off Sat., but my friend did, twice, and once against me at Friday nights local, winning him the game each time.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Wormtongue <br />
<br />
Durin eats Twilight Witch-king, so let&#39;s make it a fair fight.<br />
<br />
Too Great and Terrible  <br />
<br />
Gandalf should be wounded up with Terrible and Evil, so this might take him (and Foe-hammer) out.<br />
<br />
Wraith-World<br />
<br />
How I was able to add 11 burdens in one site. :)<br />
<br />
The Ring Draws Them<br />
<br />
Can&#39;t remember if I&#39;ve seen people using this card, but a friend played it on me last week, and never was lacking twilight.  If it comes out early, can win the game for you early.  You can corrupt at site four with this deck, which I have done.<br />
<br />
Cantea, Thrall of the One<br />
<br />
Gets rid of nasty possessions like Gorn&#39;s Bow, Foe-Hammer, Gandalf&#39;s Staff, etc.  Also another use for your BNAP, if your Enquea is not working, or coming up in your draws.<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty basic.  I plan on getting a tournament report up soon, so look for that. <br />
