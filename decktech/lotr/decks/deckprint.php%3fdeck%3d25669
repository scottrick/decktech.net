Ulaire Enquea    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First of all, you have less companions(obviously), which means all the rest of your cards are going to be focused on what few companions you have. You also have more card slots to focus on your companions with. Also, you have greater potential for not giving your oponent any twilight, although some give just as much twilight as usuall.<br>
<br>
Now I will get specific to my deck as I can&#39;t type much more of a catch all than that. This deck is one of those decks that doesn&#39;t give twilight. If you have read my previous deck &quot;The big and the small,&quot; you&#39;ll understand the whole math behind the hand choke or &quot;throughput choke&quot; as its commonly called and can skip the math paragragh.<br>
<br>
First of all, you bid to go second (which is not bidding at all in some places) and start Aragorn RANGER OF THE NORTH. If you do not play RANGER OF THE NORTH, you will slaughtered by even a sickly swarm. RANGER OF THE NORTH (I think I have enough repetition) can make himself defender +1, therfore making multiples of himself in which to block minions with. Move one site at a time unless you MUST move twice. This would be moving to site 9 for the win (very rare in this deck).<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s how the math works. Since you started Aragorn, you didn&#39;t pay 4 twilight. Since you play with 4 No Stranger to the shadows you will probably get one by the time you have fought with your minions and recycled your hand. This means you have the potential of moving to YOUR site 2, Trollshaw Forest, for only 2 twilight. What can you play for 2 twilight (3 if you didn&#39;t pull No Stranger)? Bill Ferny and conditions. (or one moria minion or the cheap sauron tracker with 3 twilight). What does this do besides piss off your opponent? It clogs his hand. Lets start back at the beginning. For averaging purposes, lets assume your opponent has a perfectly evenly shuffled deck, drawing one shadow card for every Free card. His first hand has 4 Free and 4 Shadow. He goes first and plays all his free cards (we&#39;ll say all his free cards are deployable). He survives your swarm, stays and reconciles. He now has 2 Free cards and 6 Shadow cards comming into his Shadow phase. You move to site 2. He can&#39;t play much. We&#39;ll give him credit and say he played a condition or something (usually they play one or discard one anyway). He reconciles again with 3 Free (he gets lucky now) and 5 Shadow. He goes into his Free Peoples phase, plays all free cards, kills your swarm and stays to heal. His hand now is 1 Free card (not lucky this time) and 7 Shadow. Your Fellowship phase. You move to site 3 with minnimal twilight. He gets rid of one card again by some means and you stay. He comes into his Fellowship phase holding 2 Free and 6 shadow again, plays the free and moves on. Sometimes at this point you have a cavetroll, sometimes you don&#39;t. Its a quicker win if you do, but not a have-to-have card. The basic idea is this: Your opponent has played a random 9 cards from his fellowship half. Thats not quite set up in my book. It doesn&#39;t look much better when he hits the Balrog.<br>
<br>
Site 5 is where a lot of things come together for a &quot;filtering session.&quot; You filter out the companions and other cards you don&#39;t like while your opponent cries about it. If they fought the Cavetroll at site 4, the filter session can be rather devestating. First of all, I changed from Balrog Swords in my last version to Whips in this version so I could play Final Cry. This card rules! Take off their armor and then wound them twice before you end the skirmish, which damages them another 2 times because of damage +1. Thats an Aragorn out of the way for you. Another card I like is Fill with Fear. This filters out the Ranged Weapon Quotient of you opponents companions. It also gives you another haven from archery besides site 7. Something you will notice is that you are getting a bit of twilight from your opponent playing things on his companions, or just playing more companions. This is because he never got the chance to in the early game, so it will be raining possesions from here on out. With this extra twilight, you could get a sizable swarm at site 5. After site 5, your opponent will be down a companion or 3 and you exersize a swarm deck, using TAC to convert all the Card multiples and extra Balrog/cavetroll cards into swarming minions. The sneak/Underdeeps of Moria combo is a favorite of mine also.<br>
<br>
Now, most of you don&#39;t understand how 2 companions (or 3 with merry) could possibly stand to fight against a 5 minion swarm. First of all, you opponent won&#39;t swarm 5 minions, its more like 8. Regardless, you can repulse such attacks. The obvious solution would be PATHS, but that isn&#39;t exactly in your hand on command. When your Fellowship moves to site 4, you will probably give them 4 twilight. If your against an Uruk, most sauron, or nazgul deck, they probably can&#39;t play anything still. If you get the &quot;pleasure&quot; of playing against Moria, you will be swarmed by all the minions that have been accumulating in your opponent&#39;s hand since site 1. You have to make a choice, namely because there is so much you can do. You could 1) make Aragorn defender +x and play Swardarm of the White Tower to overpower the opposition, 2) put Thrarin in the skirmish phase, 3) use a Gondor Bowmen or Aragorns Bow, 4) PATHS as usuall, 5) let your opponent assign them all to Frodo and Stealth it, or 6) let your opponent assign a lot of them to Frodo and use a bounder which will be healed next turn by Frodo (Max power against Frodo with no pump cards = 17, much more if Merry out). Against the Balrog, I usually save a couple Stealths or use Filbert Bolger. If merry is out, assign to him for stealthing. This way, if your opponent cancells the stealth, no harm done to Frodo (sorry Merry, your expendable). Thats about how you survive. Moving to your sites helps keep wild curve balls from comming your way.<br>
<br>
Card choices:<br>
<br>
Aragorn, RANGER OF THE NORTH- been explained<br>
<br>
Dark places - Makes all powerfull minions into minions with even numbered strength numbers. This makes your opponent work harder to keep from loosing their head.<br>
<br>
They Are Coming - Your hand will get a bit clogged when its not on the table. Don&#39;t put one out and discard the rest, your opponent could cancel it.<br>
<br>
Gobblin Scrabblers - gets rid of last alliance, tale of gil galad and other fun elf conditions.<br>
<br>
Gobblin Warrior - Gets rid of Song of Durin, Greatest kingdom of my people and other dwarwen conditions.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Enquea - Big fellowships and big starting bids. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
