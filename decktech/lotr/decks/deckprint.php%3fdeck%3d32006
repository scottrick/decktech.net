<br />
I make this strat selection in two parts :<br />
<br />
One for the Croa ppl , and then for the ppl interested in the deck itself.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Hi peepz ,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say I&#39;m kinda embarrased I let myself trick into this :/ <br />
I build alot of decks and for other ppl too around the world.And so it happens i go off to msn chatting with this lotr player and i give him some decks to test.Later on ( 1st of april ) , he<br />
mailed me that he won the TOC and the PSQ with brilliant results haha.<br />
<br />
Ive couldv known that the TOC wasn&#39;t held yet , but I was so pleased the deck did so well after all the testing efforts , I just didn&#39;t think about that -).<br />
<br />
Soz sorry to whom I offended with this ,<br />
I didn&#39;t mean too and I&#39;m actualy quite a nice and fair guy , and not a LAIR , that REALY made me feel awfull.<br />
<br />
Cya All and Gl on your games.<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ok so I took time to look at your reviews and what couldv been added or not be.<br />
<br />
Ive taken notice that somethimes I come in burden trouble , so I took the step to toss out a Resolute hobbit for the SOH.<br />
<br />
Ive made also place for some Quick As may be&#39;s as some ppl suggested , making the package of wounds quite heavy.I&#39;ll see how it turns out by testing this week.<br />
<br />
Ive been getting alot of things like : Corsair loses to Rohan fast.Well I must say Ive played quite some testers vs Rohan and that wasn&#39;t the case.Key is to have your marauders out fast and start ditching their nice little gear :]]<br />
Once that happens Eomyr looks like a fool and a castamir with 9 strenght can overwhelm using a ships.The ally discarders also greatly help in taking down MR Deor the Evil One.<br />
<br />
Ok what you say about Shelob is a realy nicely thought out comment and indeed I might have some trouble facing her.It then just comes down to either shoot all the rest or never put down your bow and try facing Shelob with gandalf.<br />
Remember you have your ROLL OF THUNDER to discard tbeir webs and such , which could come off as a tricky blow.More playtesting is required for me in this area cse I haven&#39;t seen it realy :/<br />
( btw Shelob decks get auto lossed vs What are they decks , soz I don&#39;t know if its that tour consistant all that in this new meta :] )<br />
<br />
About this review of 4 Castamirs : <br />
Since i like cycling and tossing cards + I can use the underground to fetch Castaman , I only play 3. 4 War Gallies realy seem to much to me , cse if you go too techy with this deck you spend half of your game setting it up and then either you might win or Mr.Gandalf gives you a loss , Or their felowships are so beefy you cant stick a finger trough it :./.By then you should have taken the lead and use Gorn for a run to 9.<br />
<br />
THNX ALOT FOR ALL thE PPL who made such good reviews , I was realy happy with them.<br />
-----End review ---<br />
<br />
<br />
So now that you have wresteld your way trough this boring text , i would like to present you this wonderfull piece of tech. <br />
<br />
I see you wondering : WHAAT IS THIS PILE? <br />
<br />
Slaked Preps set up real fast to kill minions together with focused legolas and aragorn , or a path once in a while. <br />
<br />
Why combine it with Corsair? <br />
Well with corsair you can toss away your entire minion side and still realise a stop using your possesion trick : black sails + ships of great draught.So Legolas realy gives an edge. <br />
<br />
Why does this deck work? <br />
<br />
Well lets see the counters : <br />
<br />
1.Threat Nazgul / Casual : <br />
HAHAHAHAHAHA , so you want to discard my imaginary possesions cantea : Go right ahead. <br />
After your setup , u hardy give off pool and have the ability to take down minions real nice using ur super tech DARK WAYS + slaked , meaning two dual exerts each turn , the rest of those pritty nazgul plainly die to the archery. <br />
<br />
2.Corsairs : Taking care of castamir and preventing its return by discarding possesions is usualy auto win vs it :] <br />
<br />
3.Dunland : Here&#39;s a good joke.What are dunland without hides? Worth Nothing , thats what they are.Hence 3 Possesion Remove cards + Barliman who can take them back. <br />
<br />
4.Swarm : 4 Paths , Aragorn ROTN , Huge amout of Archery vs legolas (splendor + 2 focused = auch) , slaked to take the bigger ones. <br />
<br />
5.Sauron Grinder : Yeah this is prolly one of the harder ones , but using your slaked at keen times to kill them off and your sam to keep stacking wounds and healing simply results in a win. <br />
<br />
6.Burdenising Sauron : Ok here is where my deck fails often : If i can&#39;t get rid of those pesky burden adders soon i have probs.However I nor my friend haven&#39;t seen a game without the deck being depleted at site 9 , wether the fellowship or the minion side does it. <br />
<br />
7.Isenguard Bomb = Each deck can lose from it , soz so can mine , but using slaked at right times , gimli&#39;s dge bonus , gandalf&#39;s overwelm ability , aragorn Rotn , i stand a fair chance of 50 */* vs it.However when they come vs a 4 curse their foul feet deck , they stand way less chance and so this deck can promote to the finals. <br />
<br />
<br />
Fellowship you should set up your slaked fast and use your dark ways to ensure double moves :] <br />
Legolas is realy a pîmp being able to set up 5 archery in one turn , turing potenial slaughter in a win for your behalf. <br />
<br />
For the minion side : Set up your conditions and let Castamir man do his job : overwhelming after corsair mar. have taken care of their possesions. <br />
Then use boosts as a suprise +6 to do 2-3 overwhelmes a turn.You don&#39;t have to be affraid to ditch minions or stuff , they come back. <br />
<br />
ok I hope you enjoyed , my friend did even more :] <br />
(naturaly he gave me some of his &#39;decipher dolars&#39; <br />
so im a happy man aswell) <br />
<br />
THNX FOR READING AND PEACE ALL <br />
