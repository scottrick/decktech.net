But anyway in a two player game, bid nothing, because site two, and three are key.  But if they bid nothing as well then when the toss up happens, don&#39;t worry you can still use site one.<br />
<br />
Now the goal here is to keep your hobbits alive by using Stealth..you have enough in this deck..<br />
<br />
At the later sites use, Boromir, or Sac some person not important, to keep moving.  THIS DECK HAS NOT LOST YET.  Against swarm you have many options, first this Deck has a talent for not being seen, and that card is money...<br />
<br />
Also Archer&#39;s and a Power according to his Stature is money when they think they have it.  All of the sites chosen were done well, and were tested, so I wouldn&#39;t change any except maybe site 2, but I will leave that to you.<br />
<br />
As far as the Shadow part, well it is Nazgul, and Nazgul slow the Opponent down the best IMO.  Which means you will either kill them sooner... OR beat them to Site 9.  The condition chosen on the Shadow deck was chosen with care and tested, It beats Archer deck&#39;s, and handles itself good against anything they can do.  Everycard is important, but I might add one more to both side, but some Nazgul are so tempting to have two of... anyway...I know this strat section wasn&#39;t much help, or maybe it was, but this is my first deck posted for this game..so what can I say.  Enjoy this deck it rocks, trust me.<br />
