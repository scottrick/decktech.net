<br />
AND HERE START:<br />
I usually bid 2 and go second. <br />
<br />
Freepeople: <br />
<br />
Sleep, Caradras are really important since Moria make a big return with the Site 7 bomb. That&#39;s another reason you want to go second, to get your site 7. <br />
<br />
Servent Of The Secret Fire: to help my unbound hobbits to not be discarted too soon like against fierce guys. To hlep Frodo, Lego and Gandi too. <br />
<br />
Sam: Usually, if I took him early i the game, I discard him. I wait till he got no more Enquea or later at site 8 and bring him back with Gandi. So I can remove burden before Palantir Chamber and to get more choke with the -1 of A Talent For Not Being Seen <br />
<br />
Choke: They ban Sting, Aragron, HTTWC and No Stranger because it was too much choke, but A Talent For Not Being Seen, Bill The Pony as well as Legolas, Dauntless Hunter are others way to choke. Fearing The Worst is another great way since Uruk Trakers and Sauron Trakers will get more popular in this format. And Glamdring for Moria or Sauron or Isengard Orc. <br />
<br />
Shadow: <br />
<br />
Twiligth: No more HTTWC, great, no more No Stranger To The Shadow, great. That usually mean more pool for me againt any deck. Tower Of Orthanc are really great in this deck because my archery do so much wound that almost everytime I will be able to spot an exausted companion. <br />
<br />
Weakness: Horn Deck, that was before, becasue now no more Horn Of Boromir. Big Fellowship, Enquea will help me get rid of this since it&#39;s sure that many people will have wounds on them so I will be able to kill 2-3 guys with Enquea. One Of You Must Do This and Grima, Chief Councilor can be a really good allies too. Dauntless Choke, yes, my FP side is pretty good against Uruk Archery. You know, you can&#39;t beat a perfect FP side :). So I have to run and try to get to site 9 before him. <br />
<br />
Secret Sentinels and such cards: I bad card, destroy my Weapon Of Isengard AFTER my shadow phase. That mean allies elfs. So mabye that mean elfs deck or archery deck. Against such deck, I have to have others way to add wounds. So I have Cloud Of Arrows is great, +1 for me and -1 for him. One Of Yu Must Do This can be really helfull too. Elfs deck and archers deck many times mean lesser strong companions. So I can decl others wounds in skirmish phase. Orthanc Assassin and Lurtz are great minions for that. <br />
<br />
Grima: People seem to come back to big tank companions. So I added 2 Grima, Wormtoungue so in critical moment I can do much damage with my archery and by winning skirmish. <br />
<br />
Foul Creation: With no more Saruman, Keeper Of Isengard and Savagery TO Match Their Number people wont play with them as much as in Open. So That&#39;s a good point for my deck. <br />
<br />
Site: <br />
2- To get my helpfull Treebead, at site to, to kill minion and be able to double move to 4 if I&#39;m playing againt Dauntless Choke and I have to go for a running win. <br />
4- More exerction, more wounds, faster win. <br />
5- Who dont like it. <br />
7- I like archery. <br />
9- Playing with Isildur&#39;s Bane and had to add burdens becasue of my arrows, no problem, my Enquea or nasty minion can come back :) <br />
