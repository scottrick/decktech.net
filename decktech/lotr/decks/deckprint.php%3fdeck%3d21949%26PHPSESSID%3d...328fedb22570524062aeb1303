Ah crap, there should be a Sting in there, so go ahead and throw that in. <br />
<br />
The great thing about my start is that you get to go first by bidding high and you have archery, and you get Aragorn.  Gets you off to a nice setup already.  If you have the cards to, try to get to site 3 first turn. If not, no worries. This deck mainly focuses on the Shadow to kill your opponent, but can also reach site 9. Now, for the Shadow, listen up. It is best to attack your opponent when you know that a) they have no archery, b) you can defend against it, or c) you have many uruk-hai to beat them down with. Many people like to attack the fellowship on site 2 when you have a lot of pool. I suggest that unless you know you can kill a companion, just let them keep movin. There&#39;s no point to waste minions when the next site is a sanctuary. Now that sites 4 and 5 are home sites, you can double the pain put on them in consecutive turns.  Also, if you do feel the need to throw down on site 2, be sure to use Wariness. This card has ended so many games its not funny. Key sites to pay attention to are sites 5, 7, and 9. Site 9 is very nasty, letting you make all of your minions fierce. This is a great site to use with the Uruk Shamans and Lurtz. The shamans will heal your guys who exerted and Lurtz, well, is just a wrecking crew in himself. Here are the key cards to look at: <br />
<br />
Wariness: cancels stealth events. VERY useful <br />
<br />
Troop of Uruk-hai: the best uruk-hai there are. makes weapon bonuses useless and can put the hurt on people when fierce. <br />
<br />
Spies of Saruman: no archery whenever you feel like it. such a great card. <br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power: better than sleep, carahdras and cheaper too. gets rid of all conditions. <br />
<br />
Beyond the Height of Men:  Finally you can get rid of armor and Gimli&#39;s Helm.  Nice card especially with six companions.<br />
<br />
Uruk Captain:  This fool can pull back Lurtz!!!  How big is that?  Its frickin HUGE!!!<br />
<br />
Flaming Brand:  Rather pack two weapons that I can help beat down Nazgul with than Arwen.  She&#39;s another companion, and bad things happen when you have a high number of companions.  <br />
<br />
The Witch-king, Lord of the Nazgul:  If played at the exact right time, you can win a game with this hoe.  It&#39;s not even right how powerful his game text is.  <br />
<br />
Worry: gives the ring bearer burdens or he exerts for you winning, which will happen many times. <br />
<br />
There you have it. Also, Bred for Battle I feel is a good card and if you wish to add it, feel free. This deck is very solid and just rocks in multiplayer. Give it a try and I know it will grow on you like it has me. Thanks a bunch.  <br />
