   I believe this deck is something different to see.You need very fiew rare cards to build it and if you have a good strategy you can win even a big tounament.However it is a fun deck and I &#39;m sure most of you laughed when you saw it.Well here is how the whole thing works.You bid nothing and if you win the bet you go second.Your basic purpose is overwhelming the opponent&#39;s Frodo.you start placing cards with Gimli under your draw deck.With Gaffer&#39;s pipe and the pipeweed possesions you place as much cards as you can in one fellowship phase.To be more specific.You add 2 to place a card beneath your draw deck.Discard a pipeweed possesion and spot X pipes to remove X(Gaffer&#39;s pipe).You add 2 to place another card and so on.If you play against orcs use your Glamdring wisely! <br />
    <br />
    The shadow strategy is simplier than it looks.With Goblin Sneak you place Moria minions-Runners or Scouts-under your draw deck.The trick now ,lies behind the card hate and anger(Shadow:Spot a moria minion and an Uruk hai to draw 3 cards)At site 7,8 or 9when your deck is over you must have in your hand 1 Uruk hai 1 moria minion and 1 hate and anger.Start drawing cards and play as much minions as you can.Of cource the difficulty in this deck is in which order you must place the cards beneath your draw deck.Here is how i do it:If Hate and anger comes early i put it first or third card.Then i place minions in an order that will allow me to control the twillight cost.First runners and forgers then warrior and scouts.Somewhere in the middle there is a Saruman&#39;s snows.I usually manage to play 13-14 minions but i haven&#39;t perfected my strategy yet.Try before swarming your opponent to play &quot;Memory of many things&quot;to get rid of Elrond-You want the Saruman&#39;s snows to be safe...If your opponent plays a big fellowship try to swarm him at site 7.If you see he has threats or his fellowship is a DH choke wait until site 9.Finally you can try at site 8 where you might be able to play Gollum.<br />
 <br />
  I think this deck offers you a very controlled game.I have lost only by a nine companion Gandalf deck how played 2 terrible and Evil and deep in thought...I hane managed to play 17 minions maximum at site 9!You ll enjoy very much playing but in my opinion you could make a surprise in a tour also.I post it again cause not many people saw it.Thx for reading!  <br />
