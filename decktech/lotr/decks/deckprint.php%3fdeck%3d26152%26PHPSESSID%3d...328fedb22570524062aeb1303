Since the deck&#39;s visible now, I figure I&#39;ll change it a bit to what I&#39;ve been throwing around.<br />
<br />
Out<br />
<br />
Ranger of Ithilien<br />
Celeborn<br />
Rumil<br />
Ranger&#39;s Bow<br />
Boromir My Brother<br />
Cliffs of Emyn Muil<br />

O Elbereth!<br />
<br />
In<br />
<br />
Pathfinder<br />
Galadriel, LoL<br />
Elrond, HtGG<br />
ARMOR x 2 (geez...how&#39;d I forget this!)<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Out<br />
<br />
Ulaire Toldea (he just seems wrong)<br />
Easterling Infantry x 2<br />
Easterling Trooper<br />
<br />
In <br />
<br />
Easterling Captain (this guy is MONEY)<br />
<br />
soooo, basically I figured Ranger of Ithilien just isn&#39;t worth it, so I&#39;ll start a Gondorian Ranger with Faramir. The Ranger can still be a decent fighter (13, I think) and another Pathfinder lets me skip the Dunland sites if I need to. Another Galadriel lets Orophin fire more, and Elrond is healing. Armo.....geez. On the shadow I got rid of the more expensive guys that don&#39;t add burdens and added a Captian cause he just rules. <br />
<br />
END EDIT!<br />
<br />
alright, well this is the deck that I designed AFTER I went "undefeated" in the first ever Two Towers only Open format Tourney. I wanted to play soemthing that used as many of the new cards as possible, and since I had been trading for lots of the new cards, I decided to go with RingBound Rangers and Easterlings, and I was NOT dissapointed. <br />
<br><br />

FREE PEOPLES<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
First of all, just in case any of you are thinking "Grima will WRECK this deck", Grima CANNOT target my fighting companions. Faramir and the Ranger of Ithilien are both Ringbound, and therefore IMMUNE to Grima, Wormtongue. AHEM. Anyways, Faramir is a Friggin Tank, you can pile like 8 possession and such on him and he is actually bigger than Aragorn has ever been. Look:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
7<br />
<br><br />
+1 Flaming Brand<br />
<br><br />
+2 Sword of Gondor<br />
<br><br />
+3 Last Alliance<br />
<br><br />
+3 Against Roaming(Cloak and his Gametext)<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
thats a total of 16, and he&#39;s 18 against Nazgul, which makes up for the fact that they are harder to keep roaming. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
At the tourney I made the mistake of playing only ONE Gondorian Ranger, which meant that, at the most, my opponent&#39;s guys were roaming &#39;till site 7, which was all well and good, but prevented me from Double Moving. Because of this, I have decided to start my other fighter, Namely the Ranger of Ithilien. He is a base of 6, but has the same bons as Faramir against Roamers, which means he can be a 15. Boromir, eat your heart out. Most minions will be roaming at 2, which gives me AT LEAST one turn to get out one of my 4 Gondorian Rangers. I am able to cycle quickly thanks to Boromir, My Brother, which is why I use 3 of it. Gwemegil can go lick a barrel, I&#39;ll take this card any day. I know it cannot pitch Shadow cards, but my guys are cheap enough, and Choke decks will absolutely DIE to some of the new sites, so I don&#39;t really see those being all that effective. Some card choices/explanations<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Ranger&#39;s Bow - I did not like this cards when I first read it. I mean, c&#39;mon, whats the point? They don&#39;t get to be an archer, and they can only wound Men or Roaming Minons. Whats that you say? 2/3 of the Minions in this set are Men? And the Ranger&#39;s can make ANY minion roaming with ease? This card is the answer to Dunland, which would otherwise be a bit of a problem for these guys.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Boromir, My Brother x 3 - this is a GREAT card. I originaly intended to run 4 of these, but found that I get it early anyways. It makes it easy to cycle with the Rangers, so I get to the cards I need, and it also allows me to win the key skirmishes, and helps my wussy Gondorian Rangers to win their Skirmishes<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Faramir&#39;s Cloak - essentially a +1 bonus for all my Companions. I don&#39;t see how this isn&#39;t one of the best cards I&#39;ve seen yet.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Cliffs of Emyn Muil - my best Frodo protection. Could be PATHS, but that can clog your hand. I only wishimmer wasn&#39;t unique.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Frodo, Tired Traveler - wait till you see the Shadow side of this deck, and then you&#39;ll understand why I prefer to remove burdens instead of do ANYTHING that any other Frodo can do. HUGE.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
New Ring - I just wanted to use it, plus it&#39;s really cool to Sting AND use Filbert twice, all without healing. NICE.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
SHADOW<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Easterlings are all about burdens, and they are simply AMAZING. There are 2 Minions that add burdens simply by being assigned to an Unbound Companion, which is most companions. If they happen to assign it to someone like Faramir, I have 3 copies of Gathering to the Summons, which adds a burden without the exertion. I also have 2 copies of the card Vision From Afar, which lets me assign an Easterling to the Ringbearer or Add a Burden. Most players will avaoid assigning to the Ringbearer when I have 3 Wrath of Harad on the table, and if the add the burden it makes all the cards in my deck all that much more effective. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
MINIONS and what they do:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Easterling Skirmisher - A Runner on CRACK. ususally adds 3 Twilight when I play, and at the worst it&#39;s a cheap minion who can win Skirmishes with all the pumps in the deck.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Easterling Guard/Lieutenant - adds burdens, and cheap/strong minion for the pool<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Easterling Infantry/Trooper - not GREAT, but can do some real damage with the pumps, also mildly aggravating to possession light decks.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Easterling Axeman -simply an incredible minion. Against most decks, you will have 2 burdens on turn one, which means a possible swarm of 9 strength minions, who are fierce, and site 4. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Nazgul - Nertea brings back the burden adders, Toldea is where you need him and Enquea simply wins games once the 5 burdens show up.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Desert Legion - the fatty of the deck, and a burritto none the less. This guy is a 6 cost Balrog in the right circumstances. He will almost ALWAYS be 18 strength, simply becuase of the deck. He doesn&#39;t always do a lot, but he makes certain decks think. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
I won all 4 of my game due to the Shadow of this deck, thats just how tought these Easterlings are. If you have any questions, or suggestions, D-Mail me and I&#39;ll try and get back ASAP. Thanks for any constructive criticism, and yes Peacecraft, the common ring OWNS.<br />
