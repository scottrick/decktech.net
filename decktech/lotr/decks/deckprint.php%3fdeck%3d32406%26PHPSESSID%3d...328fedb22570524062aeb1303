<br />
I mean, Decipher releases a few good Dwarf companions and some tougher to get rid of possessions, and all of a sudden Dwarves look NICE, right?<br />
<br />
So, the idea here is that with the right support cards, Gimli is a Ring bearer with a rather light drawback, considering how strong he can be. Using Gimli not only gives us a big Ring holder, but we also get to start Durin III with another Dwarf AND have a pincusion to take any exertions for some of our better Dwarf support cards.<br />
<br />
Blood Runs Chill - ideally, this card should pretty be a clean sweep of shadow cards, even against a support card heavy Shadow side like Moria or Besiegers. Gimli is usually going to be Damage +5, and can be as much as +7 in the regroup phase. Thats tasty! Since our Dwarves are more than likely to kill anything they skirmish, BRC should only be targeting the cards its in to deal with. Possessions, Artifacts, Conditions, whatever. Could probably be trimmed down to 2, but the deck is big and these cards are likely to be cycled out.<br />
<br />
Preparations - this card + Sindri means a practically never ending supply of Honed. Basically, play Honed to kill someone large. Then, in the regroup phase, exert Gimli to stack it on Preparations. Now, whenever you need to, you&#39;ve got a FREE STORED PUMPER that comes back every regroup pase as long as both Sindri and Preparations are around. <br />
<br />
Loyalty Unshaken - this card is a SWEET storable pumper that helps cycling. In fact, imagine playing this card and then stacking 2 Honed on it. Draw 2 cards. Then, whenever you move, you can use Sindri to play those Honed right off the Loyalty Unsaken. AWESOME!<br />
<br />
Defending the Keep - this card alone makes this deck VERY versatile. At it&#39;s worst, DTK will simply Draw a card. This means that it&#39;s never a dead card in your hand. At it&#39;s best, though, DTK will fetch whichever condition you need back to keep on winning. Need to cycle out some cards? Get Loyalty Unshaken and stack &#39;em. Need to draw or have more Damage +? get Aggresion! I think you see the point.<br />
<br />
Aggresion - the prune that makes the deck regular! Damage + X is what the Dwarves love. Uri is a pumping machine, Gimli gets harder and harder to corrupt, Blood RUns Chill sweeps the board and best of all, your Dwarves don&#39;t need matching weapons to KILL STUFF. Being able to pitch the Aggros to draw 4 cards ever turn is the sweet, short, hairy icing on the short-cake.<br />
<br />
The shadow is a stopper Moria shadow. Ive found in testing that most decks do not like a site 2 Cave Troll a whole lot :)<br />
this shadow will rarely get your kills for you, but in the right circumtances it&#39;ll get the stops often enough to win the game with the Gnomes. Host of Moria makes the cut just case it&#39;s new and fun, but I can see the right sitations where he&#39;d be money. <br />
In the future I&#39;ll likely run this with Besegers, but right now I wanted to focus more on the fellowship, get it posted, and see what everyone thought of it.<br />
