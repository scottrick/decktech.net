<br>
Bid as many as you can to be first and to look for Aragorn. With Pippin and Sam in the starting fellowship, you can bid 5 or 6 if you want (with seven or more some Nazgûl would put you in trouble) <br>
<br>
Pippin is absolutely dispensable (especially when your opponent plays uruk-hai) and you could try to protect Sam when playing against corruption decks. The main companions are Frodo, Aragorn, Merry and Boromir. <br>
<br>
Playing this deck you draw cards very fast, because of two things: it doesn&#39;t have any events (except might of numenor for massive-damage decks like Sauron or Isengard orcs) and Moria (is the fastest shadow culture in the game) In this way, you don&#39;t have to wait too much to get the card you were waiting for. <br>
<br>
Notice that you won&#39;t give any extra pool to your opponent, because of the Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom (Aragorn and Boromir possessions are played for free) and, when the game is advanced, two no stranger to the shadows, Bill the pony and talent for not being seen. When you have played most of these cards, and your Boromir and Aragorn are strong enough (always helped by Merry, who heals every turn with Farmer Maggot), it is very hard for your opponent to kill Frodo when you go through place 8 or 9 and give only 9 or 10 twilight tokens. <br>
<br>
I&#39;ve tried to make a free peoples deck protected from the four hazard cultures you can find in the game: <br>
<br>
Isengard: When playing uruk, your opponent will probably find problems with your armors, the little pool you give, and, of course, Merry, who never stops exerting and healing. Isengard orcs can cause several wounds, but your four athelas, two might of numenor, farmer maggot and frying pans will play a good part. Saruman snows (oh no!) are a serious problem, so that&#39;s why I include Boromir&#39;s cloak. <br>
<br>
Moria: This is the culture that has caused me more damage, especially when Boromir doesn&#39;t appear and goblins win skirmishes, so they&#39;re packed in goblin swarms. Notice that you don&#39;t have anything to remove goblin swarms or they are coming, and goblin armories will increase the twilight pool, doesn&#39;t matter how many pool you don&#39;t give. In this case, two frying pans, Aragorn&#39;s bow, Aragorn defender +1, blade of Gondor will play an special part. <br>
<br>
Nazgûl: Being the most expensive creatures all over the world, Nazgûl are not a real threat because of the little pool you generate. But the problem appears when your opponent plays Ulaire Cantea: in this case, Frodo can be assigned (he could lose his pan, but it&#39;s not a shame) and helped by Merry, Filibert or the Bounder. It is really hard for a Nazgûl deck to kill Frodo when you have your Aragorn and Boromir with their flaming brands and swords and Merry helping them, not even the Witch-King. Black breath and blade tips doesn&#39;t make much damage with 4 athelas and 2 might of numenor. When trying to corrupt Frodo, you can always protect Sam and heal him a lot of times with athelas and might of numenor. <br>
<br>
Sauron: Massive-damage decks (hate, orc bowmen...) are contrarested as explained before, and Enduring Evils are useless when you have no burdens (Sam) or conditions on your companions (athelas) <br>
<br>
About the shadow side, there&#39;s nothing new that I can say, it&#39;s a typical Moria swarms deck, with two Nelya for large fellowships, throw in yourself next time to avoid frying pan and sting, a goblin warrior for greatest kingdom of my people, tharin, and all dwarven conditions, a troll, balrog, a scrabbler... and the final offensive in Tol Brandir with three ambushers from the discard pile (I took this idea from another decktech&#39;s player, it is great and I hope he&#39;s not annoyed about that)<br>
<br>
The choice of Moria was beacuse it lets you draw free peoples cards very quickly, and it also can kill the opponent. <br>
The deck is giving me great results and it&#39;s funny to play with it, please let me know what you think about it<br>
