What I had forgotten was that I meant to include Arwen&#39;s Fate. With Arwen&#39;s Fate, you can bump Aragorn up to 16 strength. That&#39;s pretty good. If you need to get higher than that, you&#39;ll just have to discard 16 or so cards from your hand to add 8 to Arwen to make her 16 and exert Aragorn once or twice to make her 19 or 22. Obviously, you&#39;ll have to take out something for Arwen&#39;s Fate. Here, you can take creative liberties, but I&#39;d probably remove an Elven Bow or two for Arwen&#39;s Fate. Enjoy.)<br />

INTRODUCTION:<br />
<br>At first glance, the deck may seem unwieldy at 90 cards, but it cycles like nothing else in existence! With Durin&#39;s Secret and a bit of luck, it gives you the potential to move to Site 9 on your second turn! The Dwarven draw cards are the key, and Grimir is the Dwarf that best knows how to dig through your deck.<br />
<br><br />
<br>TOP CARDS:<br />
<br>Delving and Wealth of Moria let you rip through your deck while The Last Alliance of Elves and Men will create supermen out of Aragorn and Boromir.<br />
<br><br />
<br>HOW IT BEATS YOU:<br />
<br>Most decks set up their companies at a leisurely pace, getting 4 to 6 characters by site 4 or 5, moving along the site path 1 or 2 sites per turn. This deck has the potential to run to Lorien (site 6) on the first turn and win on the second. It won&#39;t likely come together that quickly, but getting to site 9 on even the 3rd or 4th turn will typically win you the game.<br />
<br><br />
<br>Bid low since you don&#39;t much care if you go first or second, though second is better as it allows you to put out your sites 2 and, most likely, 3. Your Shadow cards are designed to be extremely low cost and can potentially set up a swarm; however, slowing down your opponent is a secondary concern. Immediately, you only have cause to worry if they try to run to site 5 on the first turn, forcing you to catch up. Ulaire Nelya and the Cave Troll help punish audacious opponents. Use They Are Coming to discard as much useless Shadow as possible.<br />
<br><br />
<br>On your turn, the fun begins. Delving lets you draw 3. Wealth of Moria lets you draw 3. Ottar lets you draw 3. Elrond can exert to draw 3. Grimir can exert to recycle Delving or Wealth of Moria. With all the cards available to draw other cards, you have the potential to draw up to 54 cards on your first turn! But what does that do for you? It lets you draw the cards you need for your Fellowship. When fully decked-out, your Fellowship will have an archery total of 4, and 3 characters at strength 12 or higher. Additionally, Arwen can discard 2 cards with Gwemegil to increase her strength. With all the extra cards you&#39;re certain to have in your hand, she can become an unstoppable juggernaut. Durin&#39;s Secret will let you spot Gandalf, an Elf and a Dwarf to make your move limit +1. With the additional move limit from Bree Gate and Rivendell Waterfall, you can run to Lorien on the first turn!<br />
<br><br />
<br>Yeah, but if you don&#39;t draw the Cave Troll, don&#39;t the weak minions fail to slow your opponent? Sure, but that&#39;s good. You want your opponent to have Free Peoples cards clogging his or her hand. The more reason you give them to play Defiance or Hobbit Stealth, the more cards they cycle. If you truly need to slow down your opponent, you should have drawn at least one Cave Troll by your second turn.<br />
<br><br />
<br>THE NUMBER ONE CARD?<br />
<br>Grimir, Dwarven Elder is a wonder in this deck. He can exert twice to get back your Delvings and Wealth of Moria. Elrond will heal him at the beginning of your turn, and so will discarding extra copies of Grimir. If everything goes your way, by the second turn, Grimir can help you cycle through 18 cards. He&#39;s a machine.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
