All Veils Removed  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So probably the first thing you&#39;re wondering is where I got the deck title.  Well, me and my friends were going through the cards that go with each memeber of the Fellowship and what cards were the strongest.  We came across the card &#39;Valiant Man of the West&#39; and nearly died.  &quot;This turns Aragorn into Superman!&quot; and so we gave it the name, Superman of the west.  And since the deck kind of revolves around him (Aragorn), it was and is a fitting title.<br />
<br />
Next you look at the overall card list and see 90 cards posted.  This, for many, may seem like too many cards for one deck.  I think it is not.  With a 90 card deck it gives you the versatility you need with the characters, while still allowing you to draw the cards you need in a timely fashion.  It has lost only 1 sanctioned game, making me the number 22 player in the world.  I see a lot of decks that are similiar, but they limit themselves to 60 cards which makes the deck not flow as smoothly.  With less cards you are always wanting to hold the cards in your hand instead of pitching them and drawing other useful cards.  This is a problem as you allow your hand to fill up with cards you don&#39;t need now, opposed to cards you could use now and still have some left to draw later.  Trust me, 90 is big, but apparently size does matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that we&#39;re done with my explanations for the deck, let&#39;s take a look at some individual cards and why they were selected.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, King in Exile vs. Aragorn, Ranger of the North:  Plaguing your mind as you ponder the deck list is why all these rares and then use the fixed Aragorn.  The answer is simple, he heals Arwen or Boramir at the beginning of your turn.  This is butter.  The defender +1 is nice, but this ability has saved me more, especially combined with The Choice of Luthien and Aragorns Bow.  Exerting him to use his bow is more effective than exerting him to make him defender +1.  The biggest thing in the game right now is directed archery.  Aragorn with his bow combined with Legolas = No minions to worry about.  It also doesn&#39;t hurt that he works with Valiant Man of the West.  That card is a beast and turns him into Superman.  If you don&#39;t believe me, try it out for yourself and see.<br />
<br />
Gwemegil:  With a 90 card deck, sometimes you find yourself with a few extra cards in your hand that you don&#39;t need, or you are unable to play those cards for one reason or another.  That is why this sword is so good.  You can throw away your whole hand to the sword, making Arwen strength +1 for every 2 that you pitch plus you get to throw away any useless cards you may have in your hand.  This is one of the best features in the deck, especially when you need that one card for next turn.  They&#39;re on site 8 and going to move in next turn?  Throw all of your Fellowship cards away to make Arwen huge and draw up your Shadow cards to stomp them next turn.  There are so many uses for this sword I can&#39;t even list them all.  Just believe me that this weapon is the bread and butter of the deck, it makes it smooth and easy to slide through.<br />
<br />
Orc Inquisitor:  This guy is great and I have at least 2 in every deck I build.  When he comes down he makes them discard a card out of their hand.  I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve gotten a groan from my opponent as I pull the card that they had been saving or that they needed for a battle this turn.  He is great and I reccommend him in any deck.<br />
<br />
Elven Cloak:  This card is the bomb!  You can put it on any companion and it reduces the minion archery by 1.  Stick it on Frodo and never take an archery wound again from you opponent.  Especially since its on Frodo, it won&#39;t go anywhere the entire game unless he dies, which if that happens, it won&#39; t matter anyways as the game is already over.  Highly playable overlooked card that can totally own and help out in any game.<br />
<br />
Superman of the West:  I loved this card from the first time I saw it.  Make Aragorn Defender +1 and he only takes 1 damage in each skirmish.  This card is awesome, and can really get you out of a bind.  If he has on his Sword, send him up against 2 minions and play any adder card and he will live and only take 1 wound.  This card combined with the archery this deck is capable of literally turns Aragorn into Superman.  Both he, and the deck, are near impossible to beat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now on to the strategy of the deck.  <br />
<br />
This is pretty simple.  Get out Aragorn and roll to site 9.  You have a ton of archery in the deck which is designed to take care of the larger minions leaving the smaller ones left to be eaten alive by Aragorn and Arwen.  With the big Nazgul that you will be throwing in front of your opponent, there is no way that he will be able to run as fast as you can.  Gwemegil owns in this deck, so try to keep Arwen alive for as long as possible.  Don&#39;t be afraid to take some wounds as they get healed throughout the game, especially when you have Aragorn healing Arwen every turn.  There really are no specific deck types to tell you what to go around so I will talk about each minion group separately, and if you have any questions about anything else, just D-mail me and I will be happy to respond.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deck Matchups:<br />
<br />
vs. Moria Swarm:   This seems to be popular right now with these minions giving you the deck capability to sift through your deck quickly allowing you to get the cards you need to make your Fellowship function better.  This is probably the easiest matchup for this deck.  With the majority of the minions only having 1 vitality, you are usually able to pick off up to 4 minions with your archery fire on any given turn.  You can run as fast as you like against this deck and you won&#39;t have to worry for the most part.  Just don&#39;t get too over zealous otherwise you might find your way into the lair with a Cave Troll and his keeper.  You can beat them, but you need to play smart to do it.  As long as you keep your head on you should be able to walk through this deck.<br />
<br />
vs. Nazgul:   The majority of the players who have cards are using these minions due to the Black Breath/Blade Tip combo.  While this combo is effective and does work (which is why I&#39;m playing them), but against this deck You should make quicker work of them than most will.  Archery is the key against this deck as is Arwen.  Her being an automatic power of 9 is beautiful, especially if she has either Gwemegil or Asfaloth with her.  She is virtually unstopable.  You have 3 Athleas&#39; to get rid of any BB&#39;s or BT&#39;s,  it should be enough.  Just remember to kill the Nazgul with the Morgul Blade and you shoudl be able to run though these guys too.<br />
<br />
vs.  Uruk-Hai:  These minions can be tricky if you don&#39;t know how to work around them.  Usually Aragorn and Boramir can handle these guys with their armor, but watch out for that +1 Damage, it can be a killer.  The archery in this will eliminate most of their characters and just leave you with just a few to skirmish with.  With all of the archery you shoulnd&#39;t even have to worry about Bred for Battle.  Just watch out also for Savgery to Match Their Numbers.  That can kill you, especially if you have out all 5 of your companions.  Play smart and you will win this game too.<br />
<br />
vs.  Sauron Orcs.  With little vitality and roaming until site 6, these are your easiest foes yet.  What hurts is if they get out multiple orc bowmen.  The elven cloak is nice against this, but There is no guarentee that with only one in the deck that you will get it.  If this style of deck is prevelant in your area, I would suggest taking out the Bounder for another Elven Cloak.  It can be a life saver if you are facing multiple archery shots from their minions.  Also watch out for hate.  It comes during the maneuver phase and so try not to have your guys exhausted at that time.  Sounds hard, but it really isn&#39;t.  Multiple hates in the same turn, sorry, nothing will really stand up to that so if it happens to you, just remember, you were that one in a million guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can&#39;t think of anything else about the deck other than have fun with it and I hope it works for you as well as it has for me. 9-0.  Always remember to shake your opponents hand at the end of the game too, it shows you&#39;re a good sport, even if you just annihalated them. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
