    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The Freeps side is pretty standard Firewall Gondor and seems to set up well against about anything.  At your first opportunity, burn Madril and get some combination of Aragorn, Denethor, Noble Leaders, Anduril, and Faramir, depending on what you&#39;ve already drawn.  I like Elessar because of his healing and higher strength, but Heir of Elendil works fine too if you see a lot of orcs/swarm.  At the second opportunity burn Denethor and get some combination of Elendil, Narsil, Scroll of Isildur and Saplings.  The free peoples sets up really fast and you should have no problem having a fully loaded fellowship by site 4-5.  At this point, you can sacrifice Faramir if you&#39;re worried about 6 comps and play Radagast and just triple.  This deck handles anything well, including annoying orc burden decks (lots of events), removes conditions fairly well and filters like crazy.  If you play it right, by site 7 you will have pretty much nothing in your draw deck but shadow and then the fun starts.<br />
<br />
Shadow.  The bid is important with this deck as you want to go second, but with Nelya and Anduril it is not critical.  Get down as many forest sites as possible and let Lost In the Woods and Dark Approach go to work.  It is not unusual to drop 6 fierce nazzies on someone at site 7 or 8.  It is also really nice to bring back a free WK with Out of Sight and Shot and Lost makes him huge, and really nasty with his Beast.  I like A Shadow Rises a lot because a) it helps with card flow and b) it helps in case you have a bad draw since Lost works with it.  Grima is in here basically to tech for dwarves and he is good at that.  <br />
<br />
Please let me know what you think.  I hope the rumors I&#39;m hearing about Nelya and Radagast being x-ed are just that, but Nelya is just way too good at manipulating the site path, I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll last.  I love playing out Trollshaw Forest for the extra pool and then exerting him to switch it to The Angle so I don&#39;t get the extra pool.  That seems to be a bit unfair and might be why they&#39;re watching him.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
