I&#39;d played Uruks before Mines of Moria, but they&#39;re much more powerful now. This is the Aragorn-less Elf/Man deck you&#39;ve seen before that looks like it&#39;s already crippled itself by that choice. It&#39;s true that running only Boromir is a crutch, and that I leave Aragorn out for pure novelty, to test myself. But I&#39;ve taken down some serious opponents with this and racing is definitely not out of the question. It&#39;s in the Advanced decks because it uses MANY rares. Some plays I&#39;ve made with this deck:<br />
<br />
* Running 3 times to the goal in multiplayer, killing the Witch King in one skirmish to do so.<br />
* Surviving Such a Little Thing, AND seven minions at the Bridge, with 4 companions, getting Blade Tip/Black Breathed on Boromir, and triple moving to site 9 with Boromir alive. Whew!<br />
* Overwhelming Gandalf, Friend of the Shirefolk with ONE Uruk!<br />
<br />
Just Bragging. =P Anyhow, using Aragorn just would mean I&#39;d have to buy a bunch more cards. =D<br />
<br />
That said, the strategy:<br />
<br />
Bid one burden which will be removed by House of Elrond. Going first is nice, but I have no Hamfast trick to take off burdens.<br />
<br />
This deck MUST draw Boromir, with either Armor or Sam (to sacrifice) before the Bridge. You CANNOT survive the Balrog and even so you&#39;d probably be sucker bait anyway. Repeat, you MUST draw Boromir or you CANNOT win!<br />
<br />
Frodo/Sam: Not a lot of goodies, just good &#39;ole Frying Pans. Noone should be able to reach the Ring Bearer but Orcs, and this gives you some insurance against swarms.<br />
<br />
Legolas: Greenleaf is always a plus, particularly against Wallcrawlers, Uruk-hai Armories and the like. Greenleaf needs Tale of Gil-galad, it is his food! Other than that, the only junk he gets is Long Knives and his Bow. With both, he can take down a 9 STR minion, and then wound somebody about to face, say, Frodo. Woot!<br />
<br />
Arwen: Whether or not you can make use of Asfaloth is mostly luck. It really helps at Hollin when you haven&#39;t got the rest of your team&#39;s gear together. Gwemegil is beatings. She&#39;s still only an 8, until you Swordsman or pump. Built-in pump helps, and Asfaloth can make her more of a powerhouse. Mostly, though, you just really need another sword arm since Boromir is your only heavy skirmisher. Arwen being able to take down an 8-10 STR minion is often life or death with this deck! Arwen also has a little archery mini-game in the deck. 2 Elven Bows are present, but not for the Archery point but for the Tales which allow her to exert to do crippling things. IF she has an Elven Bow. To avoid redundancy, I have ONE each of Splendor of Their Banners and White Arrows of Lorien. You all know what White Arrows does. Splendor is less played, but it&#39;s good stuff. With Legolas, one exertion means 3 points of Archery. That often REALLY helps. Or you could aim one and send 2 untargeted, but that&#39;s a little risky.<br />
<br />
Boromir: The &quot;meat&quot; of the deck. You all know about Blade of Gondor, Flaming Brand, Armor, Athelas, and No Stranger so I won&#39;t waste your time. But it&#39;s all the more vital that he get and use this junk without Aragorn or Gandalf. And hey, he can use Saga of Elendil for a change!<br />
<br />
<br />
Uruks: You all know how this works, too, so let me just explain the less-used cards:<br />
<br />
Uruk Warrior: 9 STR for 3. All the other 9 STRs are either 4 cost or Unique. Need more?<br />
<br />
Uruk Slayer: A lot of Uruk decks are &quot;filler&quot; grunts, and IMO these do a better job than Uruk Fighters etc. Rager is another good choice but I feel that 2 minions with discard in the whole deck will prove less beneficial than having those 2 be possibly able to beat a Man in a skirmish without playing a card.<br />
<br />
Bred for Battle: Every minion in the deck can exert, but alot of them are on the more expensive side. I feel this is a safer call than a Sword or a Weather condition. Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry is too risky, especially when the Men you&#39;re trying so desperatly to beat have Armor anyway.<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power: Sleep for Isengard! Yay! Let&#39;s see... Last Alliance? Gone! Tale of Gil-galad? Gone! White Arrows, There and Back Again, and even Book of Mazarbul get axed in one swipe with this card. Remember, your only active conditions when you play this will be Saruman&#39;s Ambitions you foolishly didn&#39;t use beforehand! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
