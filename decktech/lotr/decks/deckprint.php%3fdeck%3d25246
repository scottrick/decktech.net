It&#39;s a Dashboard song, and it rocks, plus it makes me think of Ender&#39;s Game, which is an incredible book, matter of fact just about everything Orson Scott Card has done is pretty amazing....but I digress. this deck is pretty amazing, not to toot my own horn, because I didn&#39;t come up with this. it would be really hard to say who did actually, but the most recent person to use this archetype is Hayes Hunter, and while his deck, obviously, is good, I feel it had some holes, and this deck fills them all, to best of my knowledge.<br />

Free Peoples.<br />
<br />
You ideal setup is Frodo, Arwen, Aragorn and Boromir. Legolas should USUALLY be pitched early, since you&#39;re not really reliant on archery, and he can&#39;t tote a No Stranger. This way you have 3 sturdy fighters who can all survive just about anything your opponent sends your way. Against Moria your strategy should change a bit, since legolas is more useful than Arwen, and the denial isn&#39;t going to matter a whole lot. You also want Gandalf, just in case your Sleep shows up, but if it doesn&#39;t don&#39;t sweat. 4 PATHS makes Moria a very non-threatening subject. Sauron can pose a threat, but we don&#39;t see a lot around here, AND I don&#39;t expect to see a whole lot of it at any of the Cons. If you have a lot of Sauron in your area, sub out the Athelas or an Armor for another Sleep. Nazgul are not a problem, you have the Brands and Arwen, and you should definitely get rid of Legolas in favor of Boromir and promptly add Gandalf. Sam is purely for the purpose of going first. Bid anywhere from 2-6 and kill Sam off early. The PATHS allow you to double move early, and you shouldn&#39;t feel like you need to save them, except against Moria, since as long as they have armories, you need to hold 2 PATHS. The only Shadow you should beware of is Nazgul, since they have the perfect counter to PATHS, namely All Blades Perish. Finnally, the most important matchup, and the reason I feel so strongly about this deck. It does EXCEPTIONALLY well against Uruks. The two Armors make this an easy game, besides your denial. Stay under 5 companions, especially after site 3 and before 8. Boromir w/ Armor becomes your victory condition, since he won&#39;t die easilly, and if they DO commit enough pumps to overwhelm him, then all the better, cause you don&#39;t have to worry too much about pumps. You have PATHS, which does very well against Uruks, just watch out for the old man. I think thats about all I can think of for the Freeples. <br />

Shadow<br />
<br />
This is a regular old Uruk stop or die deck. It runs three Saruman because he almost ALWAYS gets a stop, even alone. If they DON&#39;T stop, then they most likely will die. The Ravagers are frakin awesome, especially at the slopes, where they come down for 1 with Saruman. Basically, play your minions and stop your opponent, and know when to play Saruman alone, for intimidation. The Saruman&#39;s Powers are for denial decks, which are en vouge. Get rid of No Stranger/A Talent and those small fellowships come tumbling down. They also do well against Trust, denying their pumps when they need them most. This deck shines against large fellowship though, where Savagery is a good card. Troop beats heavy weapon decks, and is one of the best minions in the game, and I run 2 Lurtz because, even though everyone seems down on him right now, he DOES kill. I know he has low vitality for his cost, but combined with Saruman, he has a potential for 6, and that ain&#39;t bad! The key is knowing when to save minions who have lost their skirmishes, preventing their wounds with Saruman. Even if every companion they have will win against it, having minions on the table is intimidating, especially when you&#39;ll be moving somewhere like the Bridge, where the twilight number is already daunting. <br />
