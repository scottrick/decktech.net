I bid either 2-3 because you have enough burden removal with Pippin and Sam to get rid of all of it.  If you don&#39;t go first though, it&#39;s not that big of a deal.  Mainly all you need to do is get Eomer set up and Gandalf out ASAP and you&#39;re good to go.  I use 8 pumps in the deck instead of trust me because the pumps are just a more reliable source of power than condition.  Use the AHC&#39;s before using the SotSF&#39;s becasue they can be used to keep frodo alive when necessary, but don&#39;t hold on to too many of them as the deck needs to cycle as much as possible to ensure that your shadow does well.  This FP&#39;s side is easily able to handle any shadow side, but you have to play it slightly differently for each shadow.  <br />
<br />
Here are some quick match-ups:<br />
<br />
Uruk Archery: Play your 4 main guys (frodo, eowyn, eomer, and gandalf) and one fifth companion.  Use the fifth companion to soak up all the archery and then replace it when it dies. Put any extra archery on either frodo or gandalf (in that order) as gandalf has multiple copies to heal.  If you do it this way, archery is an easy game.<br />
<br />
Nazgul:  Can be tough if you don&#39;t set up quick and they get an early beat on you.  Basically just stick to 5 companions and use eomer and gandalf to beat the black riders with pumps.  Once you are set up you should be able to move through just about anything they throw out.  Eowyn is crucial in this match-up as she prevents tip wounds.<br />
<br />
Moria:  If they use Palantir then you should have Erland out to prevent it.  The two GST&#39;s give moria a very tough time.  Make sure to save one for when you are moving to site 7 to clear out all of their conditions.  Take your time to set up because in the late game you will be able to double like a mad man.<br />
<br />
Uruk Trackers: Again, this can be a tough match-up.  The main thing to do here is manage your pumps and only use them when you need to.  Don&#39;t double into the deep as it is much easier to double through it.  Move slowly at the start and then finish fast in the end.  Set-up is key here.<br />
<br />
Dunlend: An easy match-up.  Make sure to beat the guys that take sites.  War clubs don&#39;t matter as much as not letting them have a site, so if it comes to a choice then lose the possessions and prevent the site.  The horses help against wulf, but that&#39;s about it.  A pretty easy game to win.<br />
<br />
Sauron:  Again, not too hard of a match-up.  I can&#39;t stress the importance of Eowyn enough in this match-up.  She is Hate protection.  Save your GST&#39;s and use them once they get about 4 or more conditions out on you and you will be set.  Eomer cleans house against any orcs that come out.<br />
<br />
Those are the only cultures I faced, so they are the only ones I feel I should discuss.  Anything else would probably not be too difficult... except maybe easterling, but again I didn&#39;t see them.  Oh, I did see wargs but that one was way too easy so no explanation needed.  On to the shadow side.<br />
<br />
This shadow is fairly complex and not too be taken lightly.  All but two of my games on both days were with shadow kills so this deck has definately proven itself.  The main thing to focus on is wound maximization.  Try to get more than 5 wounds on them before site 3 (usually by playing lurtz + another uruk at 2) so that they cannont heal everything.  Use the Desert lord and the southron bowman to exhaust companions (preferaby the starting ones as they don&#39;t usually have extra copies to ditch to heal) in order to activate your towers.  Make sure that when you play a weapons of isengard that you use it on that same turn to prevent them from being discarded during the next turn.  The crossbowmen can be huge at site nine when they have all exhausted unbounds.  If they play aragorn then the CYPMFY&#39;s will be a huge factor in the end.  Just be smart about playing your minions and make sure to score as many wounds as possible before each sanctuary.  This deck has very good stop power providing you don&#39;t get a ballz draw like I did all day in Continnentals (you got off easy in our rematch Dalton... Gen-Con buddy ;) ).  That&#39;s pretty much it.  This shadow does very well against any non-dauntless hunter deck and will kill everything.  Against DH you want to just throw away your weapons and cloud&#39;s (unless u can kill DH or the hobbits early) and just use the towers of orthanc to generate pool once someone becomes exhaustes.  The king&#39;s room does a good job of this btw ;).  Anyway, there you have it.  I&#39;m retiring the deck and working on something new from EoF for Gen-Con.  So far it&#39;s looking good, but I guess only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Origins kicked @$$.  There were so many wonderful people there.  Patrick Sullivan is the coolest person alive (thanks for all the support, guess we&#39;ll have to wait til worlds to play huh?)  I hope everyone had as good a time as I did.  Oh, btw Yannick I found the gangsta Yoda, so I&#39;ll get it to you at gen-con.  See you all in a month.<br />
