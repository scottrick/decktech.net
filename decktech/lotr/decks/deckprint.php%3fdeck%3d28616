Strategy<br />
<br />
Fellowship<br />
It is a Hobbit deck with some severe choke happening. There is almost nothing you will be playing that has any cost at all. If you played EVERYTHING in one fellowship phase it would total 8 twilight. Mostly you will be spending nothing and hopefully taking 3 from the sites twilight cost with Bill and A Talent. <br />
<br />
The Hobbits are remarkably good at getting through the first six sites and you should have no problems with your combinations of Aragorn blocking minion no 1,  stealth and choke. Moria can be a problem but you have two frying pans so you can whack selected Orcs to keep them off the swarms. Don’t forget to move them around but watch out for how many armories your opponent has although a Frying pan and a stealth combined can be a good way to trick your opponent into wasting some armories.<br />
<br />
Site 6 is usually no problem with the choke but 7, 8 and 9 can be really hard. If you have some There and Back Again and Hobbit Intuitions you can survive quite a big minion and the Hobbits have heaps of health. <br />
<br />
Mind your own Affairs is your poor mans directed wounding. A berserker who takes too many risks, Uruk captain, many Moria Orcs and Southrons or a Dunlending (watch out for Hides) can be heading to the discard pile due to one of these. Be careful as they only work for Smeagol (this is your only way to protect him) and Pippen. <br />
<br />
Smeagol has a star next to his name because it depends on site one whether or not you play him. If you have The Riddermark as site 1 play Aragorn, if not start Smeagol. Don’t go to six companions, it is too risky to allow Enquea to come down and kill Merry or Pippen. Smeagol does allow a double move that would otherwise be impossible and his other function is to allow you to play Follow Smeagol to avoid Deep of Helm, Cavern Entrance, Ring of Isengard and Palantir Chamber.<br />
<br />
If you could add one rare: It would actually be a premium not a rare, Aragorn Wingfoot makes double moving much easier. Easy to get hold of and cheap card, nice. See I told you the deck needs no rares. If you had heaps of money A Promise x 4 would also be nice.<br />
<br />
Shadow <br />
Your key card here is Advance Uruk Patrol. Fierce at battlegrounds and potentially STR 16 (once you control a battleground and with a broad bladed sword) they will destroy your opponents. Only 3 of your sites are not battlegrounds so they should be fierce a lot. They will be BIG targets for your opponents so I highly recommend holding onto your broad bladed swords for them, but naturally everything depends on the in game situation.<br />
<br />
The Band is big and the Mob and Marauder start getting very cheap once you take a few sites. The Beseiger may seem like a waste but try him, he is fantastic. First of all he is cheap and so helps you get tokens on Attack on Helm’s Deep. Secondly once you have a site he is awesome. A cost 1 Uruk hai is always great. He may be only strength 6 but usually gets to fight someone very weak and sometimes wins. Even if he loses so what? He rarely takes 2 wounds and jumps back on the site ready for next turn. Get a couple out and you can produce a mini swarm.<br />
<br />
Ulaire Nelya may seem strange but you want your battlegrounds especially your first one under your control, so he can swap them if you went first.<br />
<br />
Saruman SotE may not seem to everyone’s taste but he really produces the kills. Legolas always dies, “unkillable” common Faramir finds his Achilles heel and you can also get rid of Eowyn. People usually use him to direct a strong Uruk to a weak companion but don’t forget the strategic possibilities of sending a weak minion (Beseiger) to a strong companion (Eomer) leaving your strong ones with good matchups. If Saruman doesn’t cause a death you are not playing him right – or they are playing a Hobbit deck!<br />
<br />
Broad Bladed Sword is still fantastic, directed archery is still the no 1 tactic and wounding maneuver events are also becoming ever more popular. Not only that it is +2 to strength for the life of the minion, often as good as 3 or 4 pump cards. The Advance Uruk Patrols really like these.<br />
<br />
No Business of Ours is still worth a card slot. Foul Creations are still around. Some people like to have a look with Glamdring. Might of Numenor is seeing a little play and I have even had Meant to be Alone used against me, one player at the tournament on Sunday had 4 in his deck.<br />
<br />
Uruk-Hai Rampage makes your Uruks fierce and as there are lots of decks now that add to the pool in the maneuver or skirmish phases it can often come in handy.<br />
<br />
We are the Fighting Uruk-Hai doesn’t see much play but I think it is a great card and now that savagery is gone it will be used a lot more. The +2 pump is average but the damage +1 when you control a site can often spell death for a companion. +3 better than Lurtz Battle Cry.<br />
<br />
If you could add one rare: the choices are infinite, Grima would be nice, Uruk Assault Bands really work well in this deck ( best circumstances, fierce, STR 20, dam +1 and can’t take wounds!) but in the end a nice easy to get card is Burning of Westfold, this one card will utterly destroy a Knight, Help in Need and Doubt or Trust Me deck. <br />
<br />
Sites<br />
<br />
The Riddermark gets Aragorn. Uruk Camp is a battleground. Barrows of Edoras might be needed to set up your Hobbit hand for the long trip to site 6. White Rocks is a battleground. Hornburg Courtyard is a battleground and while Deep of Helm may be better for your Uruks your Hobbits just can’t afford it, another Uruk can mean a dead Hobbit. Caves of Aglarond make your other Uruks fierce but if you are using your site path keep your spare Bill the Pony. Hornburn Causeway is a battleground and you only have 3 unbound companions. Nan Curunir may seem odd but do you really want Ring of Isengard or Wizard’s Vale? Fortress of Orthanc is a battleground and if you have Smeagol and Follow Smeagol out denies your opponent the Palantir Chamber possibly winning you the game and the extra twilight can always be used on Uruk-Hai Rampage.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
This deck is very fun to play with the Hobbits constantly seeming on the edge of death. The choke also helps your minions by reducing your opponents card cycling. The Uruks are very strong even if you never take a site, but take 1 and especially 2 and your opponent is in all sorts of trouble. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
