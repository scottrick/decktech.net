Shadow- to do it right u gotta no when to play stuff.  ya sure ul say &quot;all decks work like that&quot; but in this deck it REALLY matters.  Remmember that Trees woundes an equal amount of people to the number of orcs u discard.  the opponent CAN NOT wound 1 person more than 1ce.  make sure to save the trees so u can use them to their full extent.<br />
   Saruman&#39;s ambition- plays trees and other events free (REALLY REALLY COOL) this help because u dont have to make sure that u save pool room.<br />
   Trapped and alone- take less wounds to exert more. thats about it but it helps ALOT.<br />
   Tower of Orthanc- adds to the pool.  people are allways exhausted.<br />
   Coming for the ring- heal more, exert more, wound more.<br />
   No Buisnes of Ours- Stops Sting, might of numenor, and so on...<br />
   One of You Must Do This- more wounds, even one helps.<br />
   Shamen- prevent wounds, more exerts. also plays for 1 so he helps to get more people out with trees.<br />
   Warrior- No Arigorn&#39;s Bow, Greenleaf, or Rumil.<br />
   Smith- Get rid of those pesky possessions.<br />
   Saruman- assign your own people to a companion lettem exhaust their people to try to stop you, they never will.<br />
   Commander- keep em healthy<br />
<br />
Fellowship-<br />
   k easy enough-  so meny adders!  HA nothins gettin through, not even the killer nazgul, a common problem for dwarves.<br />
   if you know what the oponent is running for shadow then start the according dwarf.  if u dont then start gloin (Gimli is always started).<br />
   Gimli gets 1 of every possession (except dwarven axes) equip him first.  give gimli the book too.  gimli gets 2 endurence&#39;s and gloin gets the others.<br />
   if gimli has his helm then if u need to u can easly discard those bracers to prevent that one wound (I&#39;ve only had to against nazgul).<br />
   Remmember that till durin wakes again is not unique and u can stack them.  also dont be stupid like me and forget to use them to heal<br />
   dont be stupid like me and forget to draw your cards with the book either.<br />
   dwarven weapons transfer for free so be sure to give them to either the person who needs them most or from the person who is going to die.<br />
   O and 1 last thing don&#39;t be stingy with the adders, use them when ever u need them or even sometimes when u don&#39;t just so u can cycle through your deck faster.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve played this deck mostly against the dwarves most feared enemy, the nazgul and i beat people that i cant usualy beat.  and i think that if i can beat the nazgul easly i can beat those pushovers the orcs or the urks.<br />
<br />
thats all that i can think of for now so...<br />
