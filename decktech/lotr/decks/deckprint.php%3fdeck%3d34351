FP: <br />
I have chosen this because it seems that every one else has stopped in my area. <br />
With Shadows out, every one is trying something new. This is a nice surprise when you<br />
play this against your opponent. <br />
      This deck gets rid of possessions and conditions with Galadreil (duh). Cirdan can overwhelm Witch-kings and Castamirs (with quite a few events in discard). If not that, he can at least win a skirmish! I play That is No Orc Horn because I like a lot of healing. <br />
You also have Shadow Between. Aragorn is for swarm protection (which isn’t dead yet).<br />
Elf Song is for a couple reasons. Some play corruption (since the new Attea came out) and Elf song coul;d help. Not to mention you want to bid 2-3 to go first. You need to go first if possible. If not, you minions should rip them apart.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
I know the lot of you will say this isn’t a smart shadow. But it is. Like I said, a lot of people have dropped Lady Redeemed (even if they didn’t, Terrible is a good way to get rid of her). Since most people are playing Noble Leaders and things with not that much condition removal, this shadow should be a beast. Even if they play Gandalf with Sleep or Grow Suddenly tall, just target him first.<br />
    This is standard grind. Get set up and kill with your conditions and events. It really is a beast.<br />
<br />
I also want to play this because rotation will take almost all of it out! L<br />
<br />
Happy Playing<br />
