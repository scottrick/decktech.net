Strategy<br />
<br />
This deck, like most that I build, is geared for multiplayer games rather than tournaments!  To make it tournament ready, drop 2 Harsh Tongues, 2 Voice of Rauros, Shadow Host, 1 Aragorn, 1 Ships of Great Draught, and 1 Wind that Sped Ships to get down to 78 cards total.  <br />
<br />
Strategy for the deck, bid 1 or 0 burdens: It is more important to see your site 3 than to go first. Try for a Stronger of a Swept Away along with an Aragorn in your opening hand…if not, you may want to mulligan.  Play an Aragorn ASAP and then kill Pippin and put the threats on a wraith, or two…one companion dies to make the others stronger.  Use Banners of Westernesse on wraiths to keep them healed if you need to (i.e. if you lose initiative).  You can also heal Aragorn and Isildur with them.  If Isildur needs to fight, or if you just want to make your wraiths stronger, be sure to do Isildur&#39;s skirmish first.  Move as quickly as you can once you have Aragorn on the table.  Be sure to use Anduril&#39;s ability to replace sites for your sanctuaries. (Especially site 6!)<br />
<br />
On the shadow side, it&#39;s a straightforward corsair deck.  Add lots and lots and lots and lots of tokens; keep recycling Marauders, Black Numenorean&#39;s, and Castamir&#39;s from your discard pile.  I think the deck would work with 30 shadow cards total, but I can&#39;t trim my fellowship down that much!  All of my friends in town HATE this deck.  I have only lost 2 of about 25 games with it, so it must be doing something right.  I&#39;ve even had several opponents concede at site 4 because they could do nothing to stop the token adding madness.<br />
