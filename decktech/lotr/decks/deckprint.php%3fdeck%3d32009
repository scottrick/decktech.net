While opening the fridge a Bolt of light flashed me and everything went blurry :]<br />
<br />
I all the suddon envisioned a deck that could well run , had good strenght to kill opponents , and was reasonably orriginal aswell.<br />
<br />
Strange enough I found my answer in the fridge.<br />
Seeing The big diversity of food , i Knew DIVERSITY would be my key to succes.It had To be!<br />
<br />
Well I thought about a deck i played against at my TOC , kinda a sniper deck that realy crippled me hard cse i once forgot to remove my burdens.But what If I could add them myself?<br />
Wouldn&#39;t that be Leet.<br />
<br />
I answerd to myself with a confident smile (app. still under the effect of the light beam) :<br />
YES!<br />
<br />
So I saw mr Gollem guy could add threats as nice as Mr Smeagol , both to my advantage.<br />
It&#39;s like my grandfather always said :<br />
No pain , no gain !<br />
<br />
So Mr Gollem and the Sniper deck was formed.<br />
focusing well on the targets i wanted and finishing them off when my threats where big enough to burst , i knew this had a good shot.<br />
<br />
But it had to pressure my opponent!<br />
In other words a deck that could move.<br />
<br />
Then Galf was the first guy that popped into my bedazzled head.For Was this Light Bolt not a Sign?<br />
Did it not indicate i had to use no less then Wizardy? I had to!<br />
<br />
So Gandalf and Smeagol on a powertrip , yeah , that had to be it.But with such bad looking guys I couldn&#39;t possibly hope to win alone.<br />
It missed something!<br />
So I added the lovers Arwen and Aragorn , and Boromir , Protector Of Frodo.<br />
<br />
Being All satisfied with this great brainstorm , the effect of the light was fading.Somehow i was drawn to my pc and write it down for other ppl to read.<br />
<br />
It was obvious for me now : <br />
I had been dreaming with the music of Weird Al Y. in my backhead running over and over again.<br />
<br />
Again , with my renewed energy , I did my happy dance and pressed the finish button.<br />
<br />
For that it was : Finished !<br />
<br />
(gosh I&#39;ve prolly never brabbled more in my entire life - but take a look at the deck anyhow -<br />
Ty Fery Mush :D )<br />
