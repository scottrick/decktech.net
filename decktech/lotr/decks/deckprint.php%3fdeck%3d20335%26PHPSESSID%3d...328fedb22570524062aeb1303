  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The theory:  This is probably my most consistent deck.  Using a small fellowship with pool control chokes the opponent, giving you two benefits:  you don&#8217;t have to face many minions, and they don&#8217;t get to play their hand, slowing both sides of their deck by hurting their play-through.  That helps you both ways - their fellowship suffers along with their minion strategy.  Meanwhile, the Moria minions play quickly, allowing you to dump your hand quickly and get to your own fellowship combos.<br />
<br />
Starting bid &#8211; usually 4-5 &#8211; since you pull Sam, this quickly goes down.  Try to deny the opponent the Prancing Pony if that&#8217;s what they wanted.  No Stranger goes on Aragorn and Boromir, and A Talent works with Frodo and Sam.  The idea is to have most of your combos in place before the second half of the game &#8211; beyond the Bridge.  By that time, you should have a site or two lead (and that&#39;s all it takes).<br />
<br />
The shadow side is a pretty standard Moria swarm.  It goes the middle ground &#8211; plenty of weenies with a few beefy minions for the occasional beatings.  The main thing is to play minions quickly in the early game to get to your fellowship combos before things get dangerous.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll mention a few specific card choices:<br />
<br />
Bounder and PATHS:  some things to help Frodo in case the opponent manages to dump a bunch of minions (ie, if you&#8217;re playing against swarm yourself).  Elendil&#8217;s Valor and Valiant Man help out in a pinch, too.<br />
<br />
Versatility and no archery?  It works with PATHS and Blade of Gondor, and also limits minions that need to exert.<br />
<br />
Boromir usually gets the Armor, since it makes him a tank and Aragorn heals him each turn, anyway<br />
<br />
They Are Coming:  At some point, you&#8217;ll have redundant fellowship cards in hand &#8211; extra No Strangers, items, that kind of stuff &#8211; this card is great for maintaining deck speed by letting you dump the crap.  One of the best cards in the game.  Of course, it lets you set up some beatings in the late game, too.<br />
<br />
This deck wins by slowing the opponent down with the Moria minions, while the Rangers get ahead and survive at Site 9.<br />
