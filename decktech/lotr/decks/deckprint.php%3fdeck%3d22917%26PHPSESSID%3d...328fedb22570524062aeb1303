ta da!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well, this deck is, in my opinion, the best deck in today&#39;s metagame. it gives up minimal twilight, usually not more than 7, and is able to fend off absolutely any minion that the opponent cares to send your way. Against Nazgul and Uruk-Hai, they will not be able to get out more than 2 minions, or one large one. You will be able to handle them. Sauron needs twilight to get set up, which leaves them the option of setting up their conditions(bowmen, etc.) OR playing minions. If they manage to get out multiple conditions before you get set up, they can be a problem, but otherwise no prob. Moria is the only deck that can present a problem, but they shouldn&#39;t be able to mount enough of an offensive to matter. <br />
<br />
Card choices<br />
<br />
No Stranger/ A Talent : I use 4 of stranger because i want it early, A Talent I use less of because it is not as essential, and I will never play more than 1.<br />
<br />
Weapons: 2 of each bacause I would rather have permanent stregth boosts than temporary.<br />
<br />
Mithril Coat/ Shield : this is a metagame choice, since Moria Archery is popular here. Also, against Moria, this makes their weapons a little less effective.<br />
<br />
Stealths: hide from the Balrog, hide from early Nazgul, hide from big Goblin Swarm underground. These cards never fail to be useful, and I think any deck with even a slight hobbit focus should use them.<br />
<br />
Armor: I use only one because I can usually win the fights, between Merry with a sword, etc. if Uruk hai are popular switch out the Valiant Man for another Armor.<br />
<br />
Moria Axe: helps to weaken those large fellowships, and often catches people unawares. Flankers with a Moria Axe tends to be a pretty scary sight.<br />
<br />
Enquea: gotta have him, plain and simple. large fellowships hurt Moria, Enquea hurts large fellowships.<br />
<br />
the rest of the shadow side is failry standard Moria. Wins many games for me, if I get behind.<br />
<br />
<br />
EARLY GAME: Bid 2, no more, ever. It doesn&#39;t matter if you go first, you really don&#39;t care. If you go first, pull Aragorn w/ the Pony. If you go second, try to cycle you Shadow and get a good Fellowship hand for your turn. A First turn Cave Troll is not out of the question against Gandalf decks, which should guarantee you getting ahead.<br />
<br />
MID GAME: this is where you start to kick it. The Great Chasm gives you a lot of twilight, enabling you to pull out a Troll with ease. At the Bridge, the Balrog should be priority, since later he is useless. Against archery decks, do not use his ability. They will shoot. him. Since most decks have a way to deal with the Balrog by now, don&#39;t rely on him. If it seems like they can handle him and another minion, play a swarm. Don&#39;t be narrow minded about the Bridge. <br />
<br />
LATE GAME: if they are ahead, the way to play is to get to seven before they move to 8. When they move to 8, stop them from moving and then double move into 9. You should be able to handle it. If you are ahead, take it slow. Your shadow is reliable enough to stop them from moving again, especially if you have out some armories.<br />
<br />
well, thats pretty much how you play this deck. It is very possible to win with either side. I find that against a larger fellowship(aka Gandalf decks) I have to rely on my Free Peoples to win for me. Against smaller fellowships(rangers, dwarves) I can rely on my Shadow to overwhelm early(sometimes by site 6). If you have any questions, e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com<br />
