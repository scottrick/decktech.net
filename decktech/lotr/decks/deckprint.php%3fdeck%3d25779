He&#39;s always had innovative, fun designs based on specific themes, and I just had to try this particular one out.<br>
<br>
The Lord of the Rings TCG is a game about decision-making: Is it better to keep the twilight pool low, or will it be better if I equip my Fellowship? Do I go or do I stay? What strategies should I meta against?<br>
<br>
This deck is designed to make the decision-making process more tedious and frustrating for your opponent. The more frustrated he gets, the greater the chance that he&#39;ll make a mistake and leave himself open.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s look at the site choices first.<br>
<br>
Sites<br>
1. Pull Aragorn by adding a burden.<br>
2. Exert to add +2 STR. Troops love it there!<br>
3. Enquea for 1. Nice touch after that Troop.<br>
4. Uruk-Hai play earlier.<br>
5. No choice.<br>
6. No swarm.<br>
7. No Moria discard pile abuse.<br>
8. Pincushioned Super Fellowships.<br>
9. Cheap Isengard Minions.<br>
<br>
Free Peoples<br>
The basic goal is to use Gandalf, Aragorn, and Boromir to win skirmishes and move quickly through the site path. Obviously this cannot be done without getting equipped. <br>
<br>
Elrond and Ottar are there to help cycle faster, while Dreary takes care of some Shadow conditions that were just played: Goblin Armory, Goblin Swarms, Relics of Moria, Saruman&#39;s Ambition, Spies of Saruman, Worry, etc. Sleep is in there to mop up all the rest, or to level a condition-dependent Shadow side.<br>
<br>
Betrayal of Isengard provides minimal protection from Armories and serves as a means of discouraging any inteference from Saruman.<br>
<br>
Servants and PATHS help make the journey easier while the primary companions get their toys. Legolas doesn&#39;t get his simply because he&#39;s there to shoot and die when necessary. Sam makes the cut in case you are outbid and your opponent plays GDI. Removing burdens is nice too, just don&#39;t forget to do it.<br>
<br>
Shadow<br>
With the advent of Trust decks and the buzz of the next installment of LoTR, Gandalf has become more and more prevalent in decks. Most use FotS, which means that a well-timed One of You Must Do This rails four companions. In series, this can be nasty, especially when a lowly Uruk Savage effectively wounds four people for 3 twilight (or 2 with a Saruman&#39;s Ambition out).<br>
<br>
Uruk Savages are there for cheap exertion material. Uruk Spies back up plays when Saruman&#39;s Reach is played.<br>
<br>
Enquea was chosen because he has good stats at 11/4/3 fierce for 6 and his text is useful enough at times.<br>
<br>
Saruman screws with the assignments and is especially helpful when he is accompanied by a big minon (like Lurtz, Berserker, Troop, or Enquea) and a Savage. There&#39;s nothing more satisfying than watching Aragorn exert three times because he doesn&#39;t want Frodo to face the big, bad Lurtz.<br>
<br>
The Ambition/Savagery package is there to ensure victory in skirmishes as well as punish anyone bold enough to play 5 or more companions at once against your Uruks. The Shadow side needs some sort of power boost since the minions aren&#39;t as tough as contemporary Uruk decks.<br>
<br>
One of You Must Do This helps exert companions. Combined with Saruman&#39;s Reach, you may or may not get the ring-bearer to put on the Ring. If you do, then Return to its Master + Enquea means that Frodo better be healthy with ways of increasing his strength or canceling the skirmishimmer may not be the strongest concept for the Shadow, but it&#39;s fun to play and works well when played effectively. The idea isn&#39;t perfect by any means, though, and constructive criticism is appreciated.<br>
