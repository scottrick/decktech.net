Well another deck and I must be very honest with you. The concept for the shadow I have found here on DeckTech but I don&#39;t know anymore who I should give the credits....But now you all know I don&#39;t take full responsebility! I do take resposebility for the courage to play this deck! It is just another fun deck...it seems I like them almost the best. Sure I&#39;ve got some competetive decks, Elf-telepathy, Dwarven, Elven-archery, but the fun nowadays is to make a certain combo work and do some serious damage! <br />
And damage it did! Sense of Obligation needs to be out very early in the game. As is your web, or at least your Evil smelling fense. That way you can play time after time your Stinker/Shelob combo. Shelob makes the main-fighter frustrated for not beeing used and holds him responsible for adding a burden....twice! So the burdens start to build up. Then you&#39;ve got a possible Enquea with Between Nazgul and Prey, for at least 3 burdens...and so it becomes obvious. If played well, with a right opponent, this is an auto win!<br />
The fellowship is also one of my favourite! I just love the 3 petit-basterds...They are small, use illigal cards, can figth, can avoid combat, they can filter your deck, and get assisted by The Master....It is still questionably who is the Oldest living creature, our friend Tom or mister Treebeard, but despite his age, Tom is very vital and can be very important for my deck! Well that&#39;s all there is to say...Keep your fellowship alive and lead the other fellowship into certain death!<br />
Have fun :D </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
