<br />
I didn&#39;t even popularize this, much less play this at a big event.<br />
<br />
The fact is that this deck type has been around for a good little while now. It&#39;s been played by Casey Barson, Brian Fred and lots of others at various Premiere Series and TOC&#39;s around the country, and has proven itself to be a solid deck.<br />
<br />
Why post this one, you ask? Simply because of a slight difference that makes the run 3 or 4 times smoother in 90 percent of it&#39;s matchups.<br />
<br />
But I&#39;ll get to that.<br />
<br />
The deck is designed to frustrate your opponent, at least on your turn.<br />
<br />
Legolas combined with the choke elements and the stealths in this deck make it hard for any strategy the opponent plays to be completely effective. Thats nothing new.<br />
<br />
Promises and gear make the Hobbits extremely resilient should a situation arise where they need to fight, and Dauntless Hunter allows you to assign your skirmishes with confidence, since you&#39;ll know if they can afford a pump. Should they save pool to pump over your companions, you have Merry to stop the all-important overwhelms.<br />
Again, this is nothing new.<br />
<br />
Galadriel provides the uniqueness. Most of the time, you&#39;ll see Elrond in a Dauntless deck, since he can bounce conditions and heal. Thats all well and good, but if you want to play Moria and have even a shot in the dark beyond dumb luck of not only stopping your opponent, but getting a shadow kill, you need some way to cycle. <br />
<br />
Thats where Nenya comes in!<br />
<br />
The effect that Nenya has on the way this deck runs is just phenominal. Once it gets going, it&#39;s like getting 3 reconcicles a turn. You pitch 2 cards that ya don&#39;t need, and then maybe one of the cards you draw up is useless to you, so when you stay you pitch that. It&#39;s huge. Also, while it&#39;s not going to happen a whole lot, you can use it twice a turn should you double move. I cannot explain the usefulness that this much-maligned RotEL rare contains.<br />
<br />
Using Galadriel over Elrond has it&#39;s downsides, though. She can only heal Legolas, which isn&#39;t as big a help as Elrond providing extra exertions for Merry, or keeping Frodo and Sam unexhausted. She is easily overwhelmed, should your opponent be using Dunland Ally eaters. She&#39;s hot, and therefore distracting. But in a deck this size, the cycling more than makes up for it in 90 percent of your games.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll be bidding high (generally between 5 and 7) to go first and, depending entirely on your hand, either doubling(prefered) or stopping to sucker the opponent into Golden Hall. From there on, it&#39;s going to depend on your draws and what Shadow the opponent is playing. Uruks are generally a good matchup, because they roam long and aren&#39;t cheap. They also have poor wound prevention, though broad bladed sword can suck. Trackers are rough, until Fearing the Worst hits the table, then you can laugh. Nazgul are the hardest to deal with, especially without Stealths which can happen in this large of a deck. <br />
<br />
Moria is actually a matchup you&#39;re advantaged in. You have 3 Sentinels, which will kill every Swarms and every Armory, generally, allowing you the luxury of holding onto PATHS and jumping to 9. Curse Their Foul Feet before 7 or 9 is just mean, and encouraged. <br />
<br />
There&#39;s nothing too complicated, the deck is easy to play but can get frustrating to play against when it&#39;s working, which is sort of the point.<br />
<br />
The Shadow is just a blast.<br />
<br />
You have not lived until you have pulled off a multi-Troll attack at the Cavern Entrance, and it only gets better the more gear the Troll has and the more Friends they bring with them, and thats what the deck is all about.<br />
<br />
The conditions are there because they facilitate the Swarm and the Troll. Armories generate pool, They Are Coming ensures you can spot an Orc so Fluffy can come out ta play. Relics grabs Fluffy&#39;s Hardware. Swarms lets you capitalize when the big guys have to block the Troll and your smaller minions win. Dark Places serves double duty, pumping the Troll to overwhelm range of most un-equipped characters, and ensuring you get the Cavern Entrance where they cannot kill your Troll and your Troll comes out cheaper. Bear in mind that you only need 10 pool and a Runner to get down 2 Trolls at the Entrance.<br />
<br />
There&#39;s not much else to say, I wanted to post this because it&#39;s one of the most decks to play. If you have any questions, feel free to D-mail me and I&#39;ll do my best to answer them. More decks to follow after my teamates get back from Dragon Con.<br />
