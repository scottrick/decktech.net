Your hand should almost always come up with a large amount of minions.  Moria are in there for swarm/twilight pool addition.  The Nazgul are in there because the early sites are all so nice to them – either making them fierce or deploy for less.<br />
<br />
Bid low always – you want to go second.  Bid one burden at most – when you deploy Pippin – Hobbit of Some Intelligence he will remove the burden.  There are far too many cards that hurt high burden counts, and most of them are Nazgul.<br />
<br />
If by some chance you do go first, grab the Gaffer.  He is somewhat important in that he heals Frodo.  To heck with Sam – you should barely have to use his text for burden removal.  And if you do, that is what Rosie is there for (that and to add 1 to Sam’s power).  The Gaffer/Sting combo is very important to any deck.  Why?  You get to look at your opponent’s hand.  Anyone who has ever played a gam of CCG in their life is well aware of the benefits of knowing what your opponent has in their hand.  It is the difference between moving one site or two sites.<br />
<br />
Yes I know there is no Black Breath in here.  That would go in if I had the deck space.  I personally do not like Black Breath as it has a tendency to not be that effective.  I have had Merry survive 5 sites without healing.<br />
<br />
The sites are all carefully selected to cause the fellowship some difficulty in their travels.  Low deploy Nazgul/Moria, archery bonuses, card drawing bonuses, and exerting penalties.<br />
<br />
There are few rares, most should be easily attainable.  But as I am sure we are all aware, the uncommons are sometimes harder to come by then the rares.  :)<br />
<br />
Use your Runners when you need to to increase the pool by one and to cause some doubling up.  Hold on to the Wallcrawlers until the underground sites.  Patrol Troop because it isn’t unique and is high power.  Just wish there was a way to make him fierce!<br />
<br />
Why Merry – From O’er the Brandywine?  Because with a weapon, he becomes Super Hobbit, able to kill minions very easily, and hard to overwhelm!<br />
<br />
The basic strategy of the deck is to move 1 site a turn and get your sites out to penalize your opponent.  Use your low deploy, fierce minions to kill companions early.  Unless they are running a similar deck, you should easily win every game by site 5!<br />
