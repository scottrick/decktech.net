    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The object of the shadow side is threats. The Desert Fighters and Desert Villians each can add a threat with the removal of one pool. Once you get four threats, your Southron Captains are damage +2. Companions die, threats come out, more people get wounded. Pretty soon merely winning a skirmish will kill a companion. This deck has few rares and is a deck that shouldn&#39;t be too hard to put together, but it works very well. <br />
The Knights were decent in Towers, but their main problem was lack of healing. By about site seven or eight all your companions were covered with wounds, especially with the site 7s there were - and adding cards like Elrond and Athelas took up valuable deck space. <br />
Voila! Aragorn, CAG not only is another knight, but for two pool can heal another companion every turn. He&#39;s the staple of healing in this deck. <br />
Also, to kill off minions before you often had to use Men of Numenor to wound them. Now Gondor Bow will do the job, and it stays out there permanently. <br />
Anduril gives you defender +1, which can be a lifesaver against some of the Sauron swarms I&#39;ve been encountering. No threats can be tricky, but if you&#39;re lucky enough to get out Hearts Raised you can get rid of a threat every regroup phase, making this deck good against similiar Shadow sides. <br />
This deck would do decently against Nazgul. Flaming Brand, if you have one, would help a lot, but this deck is designed for people who don&#39;t have a lot of cards or money - or no Fellowship cards.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
