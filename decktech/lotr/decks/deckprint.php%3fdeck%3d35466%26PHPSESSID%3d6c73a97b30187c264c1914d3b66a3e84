I don&#39;t believe this is the easiest deck to run, it does have some weaknesses, but in the hands of a skilled player it can be extremely sound and consistant.   <br />
<br />
The general concept came from me brainstorming ways to abuse the lurkers ability to play from the discard pile.   I wanted to try to break the deck so that it would be shown how abusive it can be.  It occured to me that Muster was a perfect fit for the lurkers.    Being able to discard your hand of lurkers to cycle your deck is amazingly good as you can just pull all the minions back into your hand at a later site. <br />
<br />
So I set out to find which fp culture provided the best means of gaining muster and cycling through your deck.    I came up with a few good cycling fps.   Gandalf culture ents with muster and card filtration, Dwarven Muster with card drawing, and then some various filtering FPs including rohan.   <br />
<br />
I ended up focusing on two different builds paired  with the same shadow.   I chose the Ent build and the Dwarven Muster build.   I chose them for their ability to not only cycle the deck well but also to wipe out condition heavy shadows.<br />
<br />
Over my testing I just found that the dwarven build is faster and seems to be more versatile in today&#39;s environment.   Which leads us to this deck...  <br />
<br />
On to the selection of card choices. :)   <br />
<br />
*Gimli, Bearer of Grudges (RB)(9R+4)<br />
The one Ring, Ring of Rings (Resistance Ring)<br />
<br />
pretty typical selection, I chose this ring because of an increase in the use of Ferny and burdening shadows... I know ring of doom is hunter... but it&#39;s the penalty for skirmishing that gets ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fellowship (36)<br />
1x *Ring of Accretion(9R6)<br />
2x *Ring of Fury(9R+7)<br />
2x *Ring of Guile(9R8)<br />
1x *Ring of Retribution(9R9)<br />
<br />
I chose this artifact package as it seems to offer good versatility in special abilities, and it allows me to pump up 4 dwarves. <br />
<br />
Companions: 5<br />
1x *Dain Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain(14R1)(Start)<br />
1x *Durin III, Dwarven Lord(9R+3) (Start)<br />
1x *Gloin, Son of Groin(15R6)<br />
1x *Linnar, Dwarven Lord(9R5)<br />
1x *Thrarin, Smith of Erebor(12U15)<br />
<br />
This selection of Companions I have found seems to be the most versatile.  I have tried the deck starting Durin and Gloin but I find in the meta that I am facing that Dain tends to be better, as I am facing minions that have reg special abilities.   You can burn your extra conditions with dain and keep that shadow at bay that much longer.   He also is nice at getting rid of extra minions making your BRC even more effective.   I have tossed around the idea of adding in Grimir instead of Thrarin, as I hardly ever use thrarin and Grimir would give me a bit better wound protection, however Thrarin really excels in clearing out Nazgul shadows.  Since the Nazies tend to get rid of Proud and Able.  The other bonus to starting Dain is all your dwarves cost -1, which is another reason i run linnar.  he costs 1 then and has 7 str. :) His text is a bonus, and helps against the uruk hunter decks that are creepying around out there.<br />
<br />
Conditions: 6<br />
2x *Proud and Able(12U12)<br />
4x Stalwart Support(12U14)<br />
<br />
Proud and able is a given, but Stalwart Support is the backbone to the deck.  With Stalwart support I can discard minions via Dain, or I can discard what is left of my hand in the reg phase to muster.  You always pick the lurkers to discard first. <br />
<br />
Events: 8<br />
2x Blood Runs Chill(8R3)<br />
2x Dwarf-lords(13U4)<br />
4x No Pauses, No Spills(12R10)<br />
<br />
Blood Runs Chill and No pauses no Spills is pretty self explanitory, Most Dwarf decks use them. :)   I&#39;ve had a few people question my choice of Dwarf-Lords.  My answer is, my deck is all about discarding and cycling.  I don&#39;t want to have to keep a pump in hand.  it&#39;s much better for me to be able to play it from discard pile, and I have plenty of dwarf cards in there typically to burn.<br />
<br />
Possessions: 9<br />
1x *Arod, Rohirrim Steed(13R1)<br />
1x *Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe, Vicious <br />
Weapon(11R9)<br />
4x Axe of Khazad-dum(11U3)<br />
2x Belt of Erebor(12U2)<br />
3x Dwarven Bracers(12U5)   <br />
<br />
I&#39;ve found this dwarven possession package to be quite satisfactory, it could be changed to suit your needs, but I have found it works very well.  I have packed the muster axe just to ensure that I have muster out even with no conditions... :) even 1 card a turn is worth it.   <br />
<br />
As you can see the FP cards are all focused on cycling, surviving, and clearing out the opponent. Played right the fp is by no means weak.   it is very strong, and can take most shadows.  I&#39;ll get into matchups later. On to the Shadow side of the deck.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow (36)<br />
<br />
Conditions: 9<br />
4x Demoralized(11U114)<br />
1x Forced March(13R108)<br />
4x Goblin Hordes(11R123)<br />
<br />
I&#39;m focusing on the key conditions to make the deck function.   I&#39;ve seen variations on the setup  using always threatening and Underdeeps, but I have taken a preference to this setup as I can beat almost any deck if I play it right.<br />
Demoralized to add twilight, Hordes to get back minions, and forced march to make them move again.<br />
<br />
Events: 1<br />
1x Massing Strength(13C111)<br />
<br />
This has been a later addition to my swarm, and it has won me a number of games adding in another element to my deck allowing me to beat on fellowships site after site.<br />
<br />
Minions: 24<br />
1x *Cave Troll of Moria, Savage Menace(12R85)<br />
1x *Horror of Harad(14R13)<br />
3x *Rallying Orc(12R100)<br />
2x Howling Orc(13S109)<br />
1x Isengard Underling(11C125)<br />
3x Mountain-Troll(15R112)<br />
4x Orc Skulker(12C95)<br />
4x Orkish Smith(11C132)<br />
2x Picket Denizen(13S118)<br />
3x Prowling Orc(11C136)<br />
2x Watchful Orc(11R143)<br />
<br />
This is my minion package.  I run 1 cave troll in there to add in some early beatdown potential and it allows me to have one more way of beating the fp.   The key is the mountain troll though, and you need to have at least 3 to insure consistancy in pulling the swarm off.   Horror of Harad is amazing ... he can come in free and typically adds 4-8 twilight because of demoralized.   dont&#39; forget that he is also ambush of 1 and fierce.... Yes he helps the prowling orc too.   The set back to him is he isn&#39;t pullable by the mountain troll, but you can&#39;t have everything. :)  Rallying orc is another key piece to the deck, again running at least 3 is essential. Howling orc I like as he gets bigger as orcs die.   They running arch?...he gets bigger.... they beating the other minions down?.... he gets bigger... :) well worth two slots. Isengard Underling is in there exclusively to pull massing strength back whenever you need it.   he can be pulled by mountain troll.... :) don&#39;t forget to pull him out when you have your swarm out... final nail in the coffin and Massing str negates tale of the great ring.   Skulker is there because they are the cheapest and most cost efficient in the lurker swarm. Orkish Smith is there to keep your key conditions coming back. Remember that the Mountain troll can play them from discard.... :) Picket Denizen is money in my meta right now.  There is alot of wounding fps around and he soaks up the wounds making them have to work harder at killing your prowling orc or something to that extent.  Prowling orc is in there to make use of the extra twilight that you will have when you swarm.  you dont&#39; always have it but generally you have some, and if they play events that add twilight or use a follower on someone that then has to exert... that is twilight... :) Watchful orc was a selection I had debated on, I wasn&#39;t sure if I should run the condition or the minion to manipulate the site.  I decided that I wanted my smiths to focus on the dem and hordes and not have to worry aobut the conditions and watchful can be played with troll... and be pulled back with hordes.   <br />
<br />
<br />
Onto the matchups:<br />
<br />
I&#39;m just going to list some of the matchups that I have seen common in today&#39;s meta.<br />
<br />
FP:  <br />
IB Rangers<br />
Gondor ranger Eowyn Wounding<br />
Hobbits<br />
Gandalf Ents<br />
Gandalf Men<br />
Dwarves<br />
<br />
SH:<br />
Corsairs<br />
Lurkers<br />
Bill Ferny/ Evil Men<br />
Ninja Gollum<br />
Turbo Corruption<br />
Uruk Hunters<br />
MORCS<br />
<br />
<br />
Alright let me first address the possible Shadows you might face.  <br />
<br />
Corsairs:<br />
THis is a strong shadow that will be able to do some damage to your dwarves.  However, you should be able to out cycle them.   First thing to do is choke them, dont&#39; give any more twilight than you have to, if that means running a smaller fellowship so be it.  use muster to cycle through everything to get BRC out ASAP... if you can keep their ships off the table then you are gold.   BRC is the key to this matchup. <br />
<br />
Lurkers:<br />
This can be a bothersome matchup if they know how to play against your dwarves.  Typically though people don&#39;t know how to get around BRC fast enough, by the time they&#39;ve figured it out you have beaten them.   I really haven&#39;t seen anyone run my fp, and that is really what allows you to win... you just out cycle them.  Realize that they won&#39;t do much damage until they swarm... get gloin out fast as he can help you cycle faster by picking on the weak orcs.   load up gimli with possessions, and keep in mind you have to have an axe to use dwarf lords.  You should be ok. <br />
<br />
Bill Ferny/ Evil Men:<br />
THis can be extremely annoying, so make sure you load up gimli with those possessions.   Ferny can get insanely huge, and is a huge NPE.  Just make sure you cycle cycle cycle and get BRC out to take care of the conditions.<br />
<br />
Ninja Gollum:<br />
Ninja Gollum or any of the Shelob decks typically fall to Dain.  Dain helps you choke, and he discards shelob before she can be put on web.  Just keep up your cycling use BRC to wipe out the webs, and make sure to use Dain to eliminate the stacking of shelob.  Don&#39;t worry about gollum as he&#39;ll be pulled back with events anyways. they typically dont&#39; have an effective way of getting shelob from discard.<br />
<br />
Turbo Corruption:<br />
Alright, this one can be tricky.  Make sure you get the damage+ stuff on gimli then I can&#39;t express it enough.... CYCLE!!!!... there really is no way to prevent them adding the burdens... if you see they are getting conditions out get BRC going.  One thing you must do though is choke.  don&#39;t play more than you have to<br />
discard the companions except gloin as they are really pointless in this matchup.  If you see a chance to get them snagged with parapet in another region then double to do it.   You typically want them in front of you but in this matchup you&#39;ll be ok if you can get parapet stuck somewhere and not recurring... also a well timed mount doom can do this.<br />
<br />
Uruk Hunters:<br />
This is pretty much a cake walk.   Yes they can be nasty with their damage + pumps....  but that is what bracers are typically for.   don&#39;t take chances of losing companions and you should be ok.   Play out your 5 companions and you&#39;ll be fine.  muster of 6 each site and you&#39;ll have them setup for a swarm in no time.<br />
<br />
MORCS:<br />
typically you would think this would be a good matchup for Morcs... well... honestly... I haven&#39;t really had any troubles facing them.  Morcs typically have to setup hands therefor my deck effeciency is 10 times better than there&#39;s assign the morcs right and they won&#39;t do much damage. you&#39;re huge companions typically take care of most of them :) <br />
<br />
Overall the point of the FP is to survive long enough to setup your swarm.   I will say that the main weakness to this deck and other lurker swarms is the FP.   If they can kill your fp that is typically the easiest way to beat the deck, as the swarm is extremely hard to beat.<br />
<br />
<br />
onto the FP the Shadow might face:<br />
<br />
IB Rangers<br />
<br />
People complain about the blades... but honestly... the blade sucks against lurker swarm.  IB decks excel at beating big minion shadows.   The lukers will exhaust the fp before they ever get a chance to use the blade.  This is how you counter IB.  get your conditions setup, typically you might see pallando and maybe gandy come out.  Get as many conditions come out as fast as you can then just use your smiths to get things setup.  All that is really essential is keeping 2 hordes out, and keeping demoralized out if you can.  If Dem is discarded no biggie just use smiths to play them again.  Now one trick you MUST watch out for in these games is Steward&#39;s Legacy.  If they are running Faramir if they choose to exert him they can cancel the text on your troll.... this is where multiple trolls are key.   Alot of times they forget about him being non unique... so keep an extra in hand.  and make sure you have the twilight to pull him off.  2 trolls isn&#39;t typically that hard to get out considering you can get them out for free.   You can also attempt to get keep the FP as close to exhausted as you can... so when you play the troll down faramir is only able to stop it once if that.  This is also a match where Massing str can come in really handy.  exhaust the Rangers then kill them all off.   I dont&#39; typically have problems facing this deck. Just watch for Steward&#39;s Legacy.<br />
<br />
Gondor ranger Eowyn Wounding:<br />
typically plays similar to the IB deck, only with a wounding setup.  Eowyn sucks when she is exhausted... and the rest of the deck then typically falls apart.   One thing you want to do is play a minion each site if you can. One that will give them something to think about.  Cave troll is good if drawn early.   it will force them to have to use their events early on instead of saving them for later.   If not it&#39;s ok, you&#39;ll have them exhausted and they won&#39;t be able to exert to play the event.<br />
<br />
Hobbits<br />
Easy matchup.... TYPICALLY.... I&#39;ve seen some players play it effectively, but typically once you have your stuff in discard you will be ok. Hobbits have no condition discard except using pallando.   Smeagol does show up at times with gladden homestead, but that doesn&#39;t hurt you enough.  they shouldn&#39;t be able to handle your massive swarms.  Keep massing str handy with underling.   if they try to exhaust and choke you... then just play your bigger minions and kill them... :)  you&#39;ll be looking at a kill around site 6 or 7.<br />
<br />
Gandalf Ents<br />
Gandalf Men<br />
I&#39;m going to group these together as they pretty much function the same way.  This was the hardest matchup for me to get a strategy down for.   Travellers homestead is VERY annoying.  I&#39;ve finally ironed out how to beat it though.  it&#39;s in 3 stages.  Before you see travellers homestead come out play as many conditions as you can get out.  Once he has played it, don&#39;t play a single minion.   :) that&#39;s the key as you have effectively shut down any way they typically have to discard the conditions.  If some of those conditions are demoralized then they tpyically think twice before playing new awakened as it can be very expensive.  Don&#39;t try to pull off a swarm until you get setup in region 3.  It&#39;ll be the only time you tpyically have everything ready for your massive swarm.  If you don&#39;t see homestead appear and you have enough to swarm and make them double then by all means.... go for it.  But typically they have it out by region 2.  The key to this is your FP.  Use Muster to discard every shadow card you draw except these:  Mountain Troll, Smith, Dem, and 1 rallying Orc. If you get some Dem out early on this will be easier to pull off.  If you don&#39;t or they discard them keep as many dem in hand as possible. or smiths... to get discarded dems back... forget about hordes in this matchup... it&#39;s worthless typically unless you can get it out early, before they play homestead.  The general idea is to play all your dem out rallying and mountain troll at one site.   typically you can keep them from doubling just from the threat of it.  Which means you can double into 9 and win in a pinch.   Typically though you&#39;ll get yourself setup and you&#39;ll be able to swarm at sit 8 or 9.  It&#39;s usually just in time.  Muster saves you in what would normally be a horrid matchup for your shadow.<br />
<br />
Dwarves<br />
Dwarves... the key is to keep them exhausted.   If you do that then you don&#39;t need to worry about BRC.  Keep them exhausted and get massing str out to overwhelm with cavetroll and mountain trolls... not typically too hard.  the other way to counter BRC is to keep enough minions out there that they can&#39;t get BRC to do any damage to your support area. :) <br />
<br />
<br />
Alright, <br />
This was a LONG write up.  I hope you enjoyed it and it has helped to enlighten you on how to play Lurker swarm to it&#39;s fullest potential.   I also hope you realize now that it is far from an easy deck to win with as there are plenty of tricky counters to it.  If played right though it can be one of the most consistant decks out there.  This deck I have only lost 2 games with out of probably 30+.  Both those losses I can write up to being thrown off by a trick I wasn&#39;t expecting. I hope this helps and enjoy the deck. :) <br />
