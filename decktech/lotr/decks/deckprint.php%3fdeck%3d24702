King in Exile should be replaced by another HttWC but my 3rd one is in my PromiseChoke/generation deck. I am currently looking for a third Friend of the Shirefolk and when i get him i will drop the Wizard is Never Late (no need to give the opponent the extra 1 pool and the duplicate can always be used to heal).<br>
<br>
The starting fellowship is a standard in big fellowship decks. The &#8220;Wonder Twins&#8221; along with the &#8211;1 to play sting & Coat Frodo. I play with Isildur&#8217;s Bane because I have so many other companions in the deck Frodo should not have to wear the ring at all, and the extra vitality comes in handy when you are stinging to rid the pool of counters.<br>
<br>
 I explained a great deal about this deck in my last tournament report which you can read at this link: http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?id=3874&view=2<br>
<br>
First this deck is designed to WIN with the fellowship and slow the opponent down with the Shadow. Keep this in mind because you have the ability to run and run fast, while your opponent is going to be laboring arduously against the Massive Uruk Beat down which fosters exhausted companions and adds more pool with the four tower Orthancs. <br>
I built this deck as &#8220;tech&#8221; against my local play environment. I have been seeing a great deal of Saruman&#8217;s power and other condition removal cards on the Minion side and I figure if my companions are buff and cut already with their weapons they should not need conditions anyway. Also just about every deck is playing two Tower Assassins (even this one) because of the feared Gladriel/mirror Elrond Elven fiasco, now his assassin is nothing more than a 11 strength minion. I also use the site seven which is the BANE to ally decks. If the opponent decides to double move ahead of me and skip the sanctuary they are going to have a very nasty surprise when all those nice elves run back to their sylvan estates with long hair flowing in the wind and the fellowship is caught with its pants down staring at a Lurtz, Berserker, and Captain. <br>
<br>
I don&#8217;t bid very high at all with this deck. My Pony is not pivotal to the win, as I have 3 Aragon&#8217;s in the deck I will have either him or Boromir + Armor by site 5. The cart is awesome, just start stacking possessions until  their matching companion comes along. The exception to this is Asfaloth. This is one of the rare occasions where you put the horse in the cart until site six, after that site at least ONE of your elves will be a stud and be ready to kill some bad boys. <br>
<br>
Tips:<br>
Don&#8217;t play more than 4 companions until site 8 if you are playing against and Uruk, not more than 5 against Nazgul. Sacrifice Arwen first, and at site 7-8 if you are ahead PUMP her with her sword by ditching as many shadow cards as possible to draw into the fellowship companions & toys.  The Shadow Side is very easy to play, the Captains are incredibly broken when the opponent gives you twilight. Always play your Saruman first if you are afraid of the double move, often a lone Saruman will stop the double move even if you play no other minions. With 4 Battlecry the Towers of Orthanc should be generating pool left and right, this is especially true if you are playing against a Greenleaf/Aragon&#8217;s Bow deck such as my own fellowship. Make sure your one of your Assasins KILLS an ally. If this means killing a Bounder of a Filbert rather than putting two wounds on Gladriel DO IT! Your Captain&#8217;s can then proceed to pull the Raider for 3 pool.  With 6 pool you can get a fierce 9 strength minion & a 9strenght minion both damage +1!  The &#8220;tech&#8221; of my shadow side is against Aragorn decks. Thus the two &#8220;can you protect me&#8221; and the Orthanc Berserkers. Always Exhaust Gandalf (because of sleep) or Aragorn with the Berserker then the little guys have to fight the Uruks. As you can see the Shadow half of my deck is designed to deal with Big Fellowship/Ally heavy decks. Since this seems to by my current play environment meta and seems to be the meta around the nation based on the decks that have been winning the major tournaments It does very well against them. Of course against a Promise/Choke deck it is VERY hard to get the high cost minions out of your hand. If that is the case just sacrifice them on the point of Gwemegil and draw into more fellowship because you are going to have to be running!<br>
<br>
Cheers, and I hope this helps you all out!<br>
