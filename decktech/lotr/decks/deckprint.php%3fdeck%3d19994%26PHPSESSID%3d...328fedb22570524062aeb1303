were a lot of rares in it.  Its really easy to play<br />
though.  I originally had all 4 Arargorns as the<br />
King in Exile persona, but I swapped the other one in<br />
case they start Prancing Pony and go first.  I like<br />
the healing better, but its good to be able to have<br />
defender +1 too.<br />
<br />
I typically bid 2 burdens, since there is no way to<br />
remove them in this deck.  The strategy is to give <br />
each character their weapons and tales, making them<br />
virtually indestructable.  There are duplicates of the<br />
weapons because the Nazgul can sometimes destroy them,<br />
and it lets you draw them faster.  Move twice every<br />
turn, thus enticing the other player to keep up.  Go<br />
first, if you win the bid, this deck works on any<br />
sites.<br />
<br />
The sites are chosen to help your Shadow side more<br />
than your Free peoples side.  This makes sense since<br />
if your sites are out you usually are behind.<br />
Site 1 lets more Nazgul<br />
play if they deploy companions since companions play<br />
at +2 twilight cost.  Sites 2 and 3 let Nazgul<br />
play for cheap, site 4 lets you play Nazgul weapons<br />
from the discard pile, site 8 lets you do archery<br />
damage to large parties (over 4 companions), site 9<br />
lets you make all your Nazgul fierce.  I&#39;ve also <br />
chosen only 3 river sites, limiting the play of A<br />
Ranger&#39;s Versatility (that card really hurts Nazgul<br />
since you&#39;ll only have 1 or 2 out at any one time).<br />
<br />
The Fellowship can handle large minions like the<br />
Troll with all the direct damage in the deck.  Here<br />
is the setup you want: Aragorn with Bow, Legolas with<br />
Tale of gil-galad, and Arwen with a bow and Splendor<br />
of their Banners.  Arwen can exert to add +1 to the<br />
archery total, and aragorn and legolas can do direct<br />
damage.  A Ranger&#39;s versatilty helps when you reach<br />
sites 7 and 8, always dangerous sites.  Plus you even<br />
have little Frodo using Power According to his Stature<br />
to clean up any leftover minions.  Watch out for Goblin<br />
Armory and All Blades Perish, of course.  Arwen is a<br />
beast against Nazgul.  After you play Aragorn the<br />
twilight pool will be fairly small, aside from any<br />
weapons or allies you play, so that will be to your<br />
advantage.<br />
<br />
For swarms, use direct damage.  You can kill a bunch<br />
of guys with 1 vitality, and if they are weak, they<br />
shouldn&#39;t be able to take Aragorn or Arwen in hand to <br />
hand combat.  Sting and Bounder help prevent frodo&#39;s<br />
death, and Sting helps limit the twilight pool against<br />
Orcs.  But I usually don&#39;t have to assign Frodo to<br />
a skirmish, my other companions are so effective at<br />
archery damage.  Use Athelas & Aragorn&#39;s text to heal.<br />
<br />
Also, the Elf allies greatly help against Uruk and<br />
Orcs, causing even MORE direct damage.  And they help<br />
you make that push towards site 6, even if the Troll<br />
is still there from site 5 because you can always<br />
assign the Troll to attack the elf allies and they are<br />
archers so they might even kill it (your 3 companions<br />
are all possible archers as well).<br />
<br />
The Nazgul are made to stick around and not die.  This<br />
will slow down your opponent, giving your Fellowship<br />
the advantage.  This deck is not meant to kill or<br />
corrupt Frodo, unless they recklessly move twice.  With<br />
a large pool, there is a lot you can do.<br />
Not Easily Destroyed is great to keep<br />
Nazgul alive, even against A Ranger&#39;s Versatilty.<br />
All Blades Perish prevents that last wound that will<br />
kill your Nazgul, allowing him to live on and harass<br />
the opponent at the next site if they move again.<br />
The Blade Tips and Black Breaths are very powerful,<br />
especially combined with Ulaire Lemenya and his Sword<br />
of Minas Morgul.  Imagine Aragorn with sword against<br />
Ulaire Lemenya with sword.  Exert Lemenya to discard<br />
Aragorn&#39;s sword, then transfer Black Breath to Aragorn<br />
and he is only power 6 to Lemenya&#39;s 11!  Throw on a<br />
Morgul Blade on Lemenya and Aragorn is overwhelmed.<br />
Relentless Charge is there to kill any and all archers,<br />
as they are a big weakness to this deck.<br />
<br />
In short, this deck is made for the fellowship to<br />
move fast, and for the Nazgul to force the opponent to<br />
take it slow, or suffer greatly.  If they move slow,<br />
you probably won&#39;t kill or corrupt Frodo (you might<br />
not even get to skirmish him), but your fellowship<br />
will be well ahead and win the game.<br />
