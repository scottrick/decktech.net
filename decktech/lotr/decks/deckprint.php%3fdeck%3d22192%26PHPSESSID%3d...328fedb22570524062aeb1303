Cave Troll&#39;s Chain<br />
<br />
thats it.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well, this deck is designed to capitalize one some of the new Mines of Moria cards. The first one is:<br />
<br />
Gandalf, the Grey Pilgrim<br />
<br />
while not as buff as his rare buddy, the new premium Gandalf is sneakier in his usefullness. First off, an extra card every turn is HUGE. This allows you to get set up with your fellowship side faster than you would. Second, he has the Aragorn signet, which is cool since I use King in Exile.<br />
<br />
Gandalf&#39;s Staff<br />
<br />
well, makes my spells cheaper, which means free SoS, SotSF. Also, can get me out of tight situations by wouning Gandalf twice, which I can prevent with SoS.<br />
<br />
Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer<br />
<br />
he makes Sting free, the Mithril Coat 1 and has the Aragorn SIgnet, so I can be sure to Sting them every turn. <br />
<br />
Flaming Brand<br />
<br />
the only shadow side that does well against aimed archery is Nazgul, since they have All Blades perish along with high vitality. I can&#39;t afford to be losing skirmishes against the new Nazgul, so I have included these cards as the instrument of Nazgul destruction.<br />
<br />
The Balrog, Flame of Udun<br />
<br />
well, this guy has NEVER been a bad card since I have begun to play him. He is like to Cave Troll&#39;s bigger, meaner brother, pluse he looks a hundred times cooler. When the Balrog hits the table, it is not only a bad thing for them in reality, but psychologicaly it hurts too. Never fails to provide an &quot;Oh Crap&quot;.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples<br />
<br />
this deck is designed to be slow at first, then, once you are set up, run like the pipeweedens. You will bid 5, go first, then pull Sam, take off 3 Burdens, play EVERYONE you have in you hand, if you can, then move. If you drew up Aragorn, you are probably okay to double move, other wise, take it slow. Your shadow side WILL stop them from moving very quickly. I promise. After site 3, you should be set up, with beefy Aragorn carrying Bow, weapon, Saga. Gandalf with a staff and Legolas with Tale. Save Sam to feed to the Balrog. When you get there, if you have Thrarin and Sam, they are Balrog food. If he doesn&#39;t show, handle it normally. The Free people side will win against ANY Shadow culture<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
VERY standard Moria with Armories/ Scavengers. I threw in the Cave Troll&#39;s Chain since Moria doesn&#39;t like Archery, but it could come out. Basically, you will drop ALL of your guys when you can and hopefull drop the Balrog, Troll and some guys at site 5. The Shadow side will put in a position where they have to either kill your Free Peoples side, which they can&#39;t, or move twice, which will cost them the game. <br />
<br />
thats about all I can say for this deck, it has served me well. The only problems I have had have come from getting Aragorn too late, so I might work in another one, but thats really all I can think of as far as changes go. If you have questions, e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com<br />
