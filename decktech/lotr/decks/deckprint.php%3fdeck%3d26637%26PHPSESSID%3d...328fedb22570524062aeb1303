The fellowship is almost unkillable, and has never lost me the game.  If you keep your movements to one site a turn (2 if you know for sure you won&#39;t lose someone important, and I mean 4 SURE!) and play it smart, you will have enough throwaways to last you to site 9 with ease, but you shouldn&#39;t have to make it that far.  Your goal is a quick kill, but site 7 is a good back-up... Set up the swarm with the fellowship and Nerteas and stack em on swarms (3 swarms is NOT overkill) and if they can prevent you killing them by site 6, they won&#39;t at site 7... just make sure you have the minions for site 7!<br />
<br />
This deck is not very easy to play because it requires good judgement, but after playing it 10-20 times, you begin to feel very comfortable with it, and that&#39;s when you get really dangerous.<br />
<br />
A little advice on playing this deck:<br />
The opening draw you are shooting for should include a Slealth, Elrond or Ottar and maybe even a companion... obviously this doesn&#39;t happen everytime, but if you are nowhere near this mulligan.  No stealths on the first turn can be very deadly... especially if you do play Elrond.<br />
Never double move unless you have to.<br />
Don&#39;t play minions unless a) you will be able to swarm with them b) some will stack on swarms for sure or c) you can play the cave troll or other big moria guys (Chieftain, Keyward, Flanker)... otherwise hold on to the little guys, and play em when you can dump 8-10 of their friends...<br />
I play 3 Nerteas because it kills big fellowships who think they are safe from swarms... most people think it&#39;s overkill, but with Moria, it&#39;s hard to have the exact card you want at the right time, so 3 is a must.<br />
3 swarms is for this reason too, it is essential, and if you know my deck, you will be removing these before armories every time.<br />
<br />
Sites<br />
1. If you bid high and make me go first then you are probably playing Rangers, and thus you won&#39;t like this site : )  No other sites really make a difference anyways.<br />
2. I can get out Treebeard, who is not necessary, but nonetheless good.<br />
3. This site owns most decks, and any chance I get to take out Aragorn&#39;s Bow, I&#39;ll take.<br />
4. Doesn&#39;t hurt me...<br />
5. Stronger Goblins with swords means more overwhelms :)  Especially after I take YOUR weapons at site 3!<br />
6. Least likely to help you...<br />
7. This site is Moria heaven, BEST SITE EVER!<br />
8. This site sucks...<br />
9. More Nertea!<br />
<br />
Important cards:<br />
Gandalf&#39;s Staff (moria): Makes wielder free and gives me more skirmish cancellation... because I felt I needed more :)<br />
Cliffs of Emyn Muil: should be in all decks!<br />
Fearing the Worst:  I play lots of Hobbits and the deck that hurts me most is trackers, so I hurt em back!<br />
O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!:  Very good Moria protection...  whether you think so or not!<br />
A Wizard is Never Late:  Gets who I want, when I want...<br />
Wielder of the Flame:  THE card in this deck... makes ANYONE defender +1... of course they can prevent this sometimes, but not most of the time.  Proceed to stealth or cancel any skirmishes with defender +1 companions and sacrifice them as necessary.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Ancient Chieftain:  He will almost always be over 12 strength, and that will overwhelm companions alone, so I think he&#39;s a worthy addition.<br />
Cave Troll:  I only play one because he is in  here just to do early damage or play cheap at site 7... he is not worth 3 or 4 slots because the name of the game for this deck is getting 10 or 11 minions out, not 4 and a troll...<br />
Dunland guys:  Get rid of annoying allies (Dreary, Elrond, Thrarin, Bounder)<br />
Backstabber:  Even more overlooked than the Chieftain, this guy is great because he kills without overwhelming! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
