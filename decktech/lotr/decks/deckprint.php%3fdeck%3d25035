First of all, you have to make sure that the opposition has a Balrog in their deck and is for sure going to play it when you get to the bridge.  Secondly, you will never win with this deck.  Ever.  You will most likely get overwhelmed at site 6.  This deck is just for kicks...the sole purpose is to not only defeat the Balrog, not only kill him, not only overwhelm him...but do all this with a pathetic Dwarf Guard!<br>
<br>
What you want to do with the shadow is burn all the shadow cards you get as soon as you get them.  The minions are all very cheap, and you will have no trouble playing the 1 or 2 of them you might have in your hand.  Use They Are Coming to trash any fellowship cards, such as excess Dwarven Axes.  Get rid of shadow cards with it, too.  Make sure you can get rid of any cards that you don&#39;t need in your quest to have the Guard overwhelm the Rog.<br>
<br>
For the fellowship, you want to give the axes to the Guard first, then give the extras to gimli.  Give the Hobbit Sword to Merry, so that when the big moment comes around, he can add at least 5 strength to the Guard.  The intuitions are there so that you can avoid any skirmishes you need to avoid up to site 4, or to give Merry more strength to add to the Guard.  Hold on to the best pumps for the final confrontation with the Balrog.  Use Wealth of Moria to not only pick up more fellowship cards, but also to automatically discard shadow cards.  You don&#39;t care about any othem, anyway.  Stairs of Khazad-dum and Endurances give you even more strength against him.  Ideally, you can make the Dwarf Guard a 50 strength against the Balrog!  However, after that&#39;s all over, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you get eaten by a few minions...lol </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
