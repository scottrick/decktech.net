I don&#39;t think that we really defined who had 3rd and who had 4th, but who am I to complain? I still got 125 bucks. Not bad, and it makes up for the Elronds I had to buy to play this deck this way. Anyways, the story behind this deck begins with me getting my butt kicked on Frtiday using the Ranger/Choke Moria deck I had, you can see it on my page. Anyways, it got it&#39;s butt kicked by all the Mirror decks, and there were a lot, so I decided I wouldn&#39;t lost to a Mirror deck again. Nazgul are the least vulnerable to the Mirror, since any one Nazgul should make a pretty satisfactory impact. Well, it did pretty well, and Gift of Boats rocks. I could have done better, but I am used to winning with the shadow, and thats really not what the Nazgul are all about. <br />

<br />
well, this deck is pretty standard. You beef up Aragorn, slap a Bow on Arwen and run along, shooting what you can and fighting what you can&#39;t. This deck matches up well against Nazgul, Moria and Sauron. It doesn&#39;t do so well against Uruk-Hai. The bigger Urk-Hai tend to wound Arwen a little more than she can take, and Legolas gets overwhelmed too easy. Spies screws you. If you know you are playing against Uruks, hold a Secret Sentinels and keep Elrond fresh. <br />
<br />
Bow of the Galadhrim- sucked for me, take it out, put in another versatility.<br />
<br />
Elven Bow- did okay, if you don&#39;t like it, put in Asfaloth, This card DOES make her vulnerable to a Relentless Charge.<br />
<br />
Valiant Man- ask Steven what this card did for me. Armor without Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
fairly standard Nazgul, no real surprises. Only thing I want to change is to add in Lemenya instead of Ferny. He NEVER made an impact all weekend. Relentless Charge wins games. ll Blades wins games. Cantea makes them think. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what I have learned since the DPC<br />
<br />
Nazgul CANNOT win late in the game, they must make their impact early, or not at all.<br />
<br />
I now know how to run. I have learned that even Nazgul need to go first if you plan to win with your free peoples side.<br />
<br />
if you have a versatility and you are planning to move again, use it to kill the minions that are there. <br />
<br />
don&#39;t move to site 8 with 2 Troop of Uruk Hai of your back.<br />
<br />
The Mirror of Galadriel is GAY. GAY.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the fun guys, I had a blast at the DPC and met some cool people. I also met some very UN cool people, but they will leave unnamed. <br />
<br />
if you have any questions about the deck, e-mail me or d-mail me, suggestions are welcome. Also, if you have some extra Servants, emme know. Thanks. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
