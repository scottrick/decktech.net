Sorry if it’s not the best format…it’s just easier to explain the methods to my madness right from the beginning, that way you don’t skip over my reasoning and give me a 1 (you know I deserve a 5, come on! ;) Please be kind, it’s the first deck I’ve had the nerve to post here!). If anyone out there has suggestions, I’d love to hear them! Send me a d-mail. <br />
<br />
**I’ve rated this as an Intermediate deck cuz it is pretty basic to play, but it’s pretty rare intensive.<br />
<br />
I normally bid 2 with this deck. Sometimes you win, lately you don’t…all those nuts who start Green Dragon are bidding 8. Ugh. It’s okay, I have a Burden-be-Gone (aka Sam) in here as well, just in case they do that…here goes nothing!<br />
<br />
Starting:<br />
Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer – Gotta love him…free <!--194-->Sting! Less pool makes Lisa happy!<br />
The One Ring, Isildur’s Bane – I like the rare ring better…for the vitality. But you could easily substitute The Ruling Ring here. I see both sides of the argument. Against Sauron, Nazgul, etc., you really don’t want to be taking lots of burdens.<br />
<!--306-->Boromir, Lord of Gondor – This guy is a tank. And if for some reason I don’t get ‘Gorn out, I need someone who can take an a$$-wooping and survive.<br />
<!--874-->Merry, Friend to Sam – I like this guy. He gives his strength to Boromir so that Boromir won’t have to take wounds, and then bravely sacrifices himself to Fluffy or some other insanely strong guy. He’s got a stout heart.<br />
<br />
Adventure Path:<br />
Prancing Pony – It’s excellent to get Aragorn out ASAP.<br />
<!--213-->Midgewater Moors – Alright, I think I’m the only person that plays this site. Tee hee. Maybe I’m just a nerd, but most of the Moria guys are pretty cheap (even while roaming), so I can usually get them to discard a couple cards…it can be a killer! I’ve only shot myself in the foot with it once…that’s a risk that I’m willing to take though.<br />
<!--217-->Council Courtyard – Hey, you can see Elrond in this card! No, that’s not the only reason I picked it…getting rid of pool doesn’t bother Moria so much. It screws up other guys though.<br />
<!--224-->Mithril Mine – Kinda cool if I have discarded some Scimitars and have <!--303-->Armory out.<br />
The Infamous Bridge – As if I could choose anything else…not that I would. Gotta love getting the rare ‘Rog out for so cheap!<br />
<!--230-->Dimrill Dale – Typical Moria choice.<br />
<!--234-->Silverlode Banks – Aren’t all site 7’s crappy?<br />
<!--238-->Shores of Nen Hithoel – Another typical Moria card.<br />
<!--242-->Summit of Amon Hen – Drawing cards = goooooood. And if they beat me to site 9, I might need it.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples:<br />
<!--245-->Aragorn, King in Exile x3 – The debate continues…I like KIE better because of the healing. Period.<br />
Ranger’s Sword x2<br />
Aragorn’s Bow x2<br />
<!--303-->Armor x2<br />
<!--305-->Blade of Gondor x1 – Good if it comes out, but not as important as Ranger’s Sword.<br />
Flaming Brand x1 – Mostly there for the free cost and the +1 strength, but it’s also been helpful with the latest rash of Nazgul decks I’ve faced.<br />
<!--258-->The Last Alliance of Elves and Men x2<br />
<!--193-->Sam, Son of Hamfast x1 – Good old “Burden-be-Gone”<br />
<!--35-->Gimli, Son of Gloin x1 – I tossed him in as a speed-bump…and he’s great to draw late in the game when Aragorn is tired out.<br />
Arwen, DOE x1 – Mostly a speed-bump, same as Gimli. Keeps my main guys from taking too many wounds.<br />
<!--260-->Legolas, Greenleaf x2 – Gotta love direct-archery.<br />
Elrond x2 – Drawing cards, I love it! And I also have a crush on Elrond…I’d make a deck entirely out of him if it was legal. Tee hee.<br />
Galadriel x2 – Heals my Elven Allies and herself…and then…<br />
<!--264-->The Mirror of Galadriel x1 – This card is so cool to draw late in the game!<br />
Celeborn x1 – Usually I sac him at site 6. I just keep him around to heal Elrond so I can draw more cards.<br />
Rumil x2 – More archery, yay!<br />
Orophin x1 – Even more archery! And more elves!<br />
Secret Sentinels x2 – I used to have 3, but with this large a fellowship (and the fact that lots of people aren’t relying on conditions as much anymore) I found that I didn’t need it as much.<br />
<br />
<!--180-->Hobbit Sword x1 – Great to put on Merry if you get it early. I’ve also used it on Sam to beat the Scrabbler, heh.<br />
<!--194-->Sting x2 – Love this card<br />
<!--190-->Power According to His Stature x3 – Three might be a lot, but it’s won the game for me a couple times now, so…<br />
<br />
Minions:<br />
<!--91-->They Are Coming x1 – Great if it lasts until the end of the game.<br />
<!--82-->Host of Thousands x4 – Can anyone say swarms?<br />
Goblin <!--303-->Armory x4 – More pool = good!<br />
<!--78-->Goblin Swarms x2 – More orcs = better!<br />
Fluffy (Cave Troll) x3<br />
The Balrog, Flame of Udun<br />
<!--86-->Moria Scout x4 – This guy is usually free. He rocks!<br />
Troll’s Keyward x1 – Lowers Fluffy’s cost, and +3 vitality…with a scimitar, he’s a 10! What’s not to like?<br />
<!--73-->Goblin Scavengers x4 – Scimitars = more cards and more pool.<br />
Goblin Scrabbler – After this kid Anthony played him on me and lost me my Last Alliance, I added him to my deck. He wreaks havoc on those who rely on Last Alliance. And he only costs 1. Not bad at all! In Vegas some guy exerted Greenleaf all the way down with Gil-Galad, so I popped this guy out…bye bye Legolas! Chafin gets props for giving me the idea.<br />
<!--72-->Goblin Runner x4 – More pool, yay!<br />
Cave Troll’s Hammer x1 – I have this because I play with 3 Fluffys…and it adds pool with my <!--303-->Armories out. Fun stuff.<br />
<!--75-->Goblin Scimitar x4 – A must have…and you get to draw more cards.<br />
Ulaire Enquea x1 – I included him because so many people have opted for the 9 companion fellowships. He can usually kill a guy—sometimes two. Even if they don’t have a large fellowship, he stands strong at 11 strength.<br />
Tower Assassin x2 – Don’t play your stinkin’ allies on me!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hope you enjoyed it! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
