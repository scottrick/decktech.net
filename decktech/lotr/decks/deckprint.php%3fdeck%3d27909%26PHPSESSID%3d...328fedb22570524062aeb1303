Aragorn&#39;s Bow -- Heh, 2nd copy was literally the 37th card. Couldn&#39;t decide what to take out. <br />
Hand Clogging -- Eh? I can discard *22* cards via card effect without playing any minions more than once w/ Nertea. I can also draw *19* cards with the shadow side alone. I have ten conditions that play directly to the table (six for free). It doesn&#39;t matter that Grishnakh and Moranon are unique, because I can discard extras and pull them back if needed. <br />
Grima, WT -- Not a real big problem. Pipe, 2x Sword, and 2x Brand can all play on any Gondor guy, so just make sure nobody (except Faramir) has more than two possessions.  <br />
==End Response to Reviews==<br />
<br />
Saruon&#39;s fellowship-block nemesis, Sleep, is plumetting with Chief Counseler sending Gandalf decks as we know them packing. Sentinels is still a threat, but is offset nicely with Dead Marshes. Scroll for how to play the shadow.<br />
<br />
Fellowship:<br />
Bid zip, second is fine. Slow-moving early unless you smell a bad draw and want to take advantage. Matchups:<br />
<br />
Uruks: Mapping out five is even better than twilight choke vs. the bomb. Save Stealths for five if you have to. Sam and Filibert are champs. And, of course, Faramir + Brand + Sword .<br />
<br />
Moria: Frying Pan on Frodo with the ability to heal him completely before every move is pretty much impossible to stop. Map out seven and you should be set. You usually won&#39;t want to play Legolas. <br />
<br />
Nazgul: Archery + Brands + Boromir/Merry pumps = dead Nazgul. Always capable of striking early, but Stealths help here. Should be a fairly easy matchup.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
In the past, I&#39;ve played Sauron at 30-32, but the cool new card-drawers let you play more cards, and still get through the deck quicker to establish UtWE/Bowmen ASAP. Moranon is a nice boost against choke early in the game, but its ARFM function makes it essential, and means it won&#39;t clog your hand due to uniqueness. <br />
<br />
Three Nertea may seem excessive, but you need him down the stretch (7-8) to pull back guys while you start saving guys for site nine. You only need one Orc to trigger the Bowmen. Also good for recycling the Tower Assassins if needed. Remember that he can go down to undirected archery, should O Elbereth become a factor.<br />
<br />
At site nine you&#39;ll have to do the math and see if you can win by corruption; if not, you&#39;ll need to remove burdens to play guys and go for the swarm. Sting the hand for PATHS/pumps in order to make a more informed decision.<br />
<br />
Matchups:<br />
<br />
Horn: I can&#39;t see how this won&#39;t become the dominant deck. Utilize Tower Assassins to wound Horned allies so they can&#39;t take archery. The threat of Hate should keep Horn usage to a minimum. Dead Marshes takes can be used in maneuver, after Sentinels, if twilight allows.<br />
<br />
HiD&N: Eowyn will have to be dealt with first. Don&#39;t make the mistake of holding Hate for too long. Play them just to do insignificant wounds if you have to. Probably won&#39;t have any extra Hobbits or a way to heal en masse, and Fortress Never Fallen isn&#39;t going to be enough to neutralize your conditions.<br />
<br />
Unbound Hobbits: Dauntless Hunter is a pain, I don&#39;t even want to think about him showing up with Sentinels or Elrond&#39;s ring. Luckily, Legolas is the only one likely to see play. Pray for Enquea early, cause if they&#39;ve got 2 Hobbits + Legolas, you can bet they&#39;ve got six guys. If this is popular in your area, switch out a Nertea for an Enquea.<br />
<br />
Gandalf: Use Dead Marshes wisely. Enquea + Hate can get rid of Gandalf outright. I really don&#39;t see this deck being popular.<br />
