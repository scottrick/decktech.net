My first deck posted here at deck tech, be hard but fair please.<br>
<br>
For starters bid 2. If you start you can win by getting first to site 9, but if you don&#39;t start you&#39;ll propably have a hard time catching up with your opponent. This basically leaves the winning up to ONE card, The Irresitable Shadow. It&#39;s a Win at once card. If the Ring-Bearer has 5 burdens and the opponents draw deck is empty, you corrupt the Ring-Bearer!<br>
<br>
How do we go about discarding cards now then. Well It&#39;ll go faster if I make a list so here it is:<br>
<br>
SHADOW<br>
*Uruk Soldier - Play minion to discard a card from draw deck<br>
*Tower Lieutenant - Win skirmish to discard two cards at random from hand<br>
*Orc Inquisitor - Play minion to discard a card at random from hand<br>
*Tower Of Barad-Dûr - Each time the fellowhip moves it must discard top card of draw deck (cummulative)<br>
*His Cruelty And Malice - In regroup exert minion to discard top card of draw deck<br>
*Hand Of Sauron - In maneuver exert minion to discard a card at random from hand<br>
<br>
FREE PEOPLES<br>
*Nobody Tosses A Dwarf - win a skirmish to discard the three top cards of draw deck<br>
*Dwarven Axe - win skirmish to discard top card of draw deck<br>
*Greatest Kingdom Of My People - each time opponent plays an orc he/she must discard top card of draw deck<br>
<br>
All in all it&#39;s an awesome discarding machine. Your opponent can never gather up good cards. Companions, Possessions, Minions... they all go to discard pile. Both from draw deck and, even better, at random from their hand. This leaves their shadow side almost pathetic. With a bit of luck, you can also discard their extra companions leaving their free peoples side equally pathetic.<br>
<br>
What if they have some luck and already have their party out then? They just run on, ignoring the fact that they are loosing cards fast? That&#39;s when the Win Card - The Irresistible Shadow comes in. In combination with Thin And Stretched you can often bring the burdens up slowly. Unfortunately I cannot fit in more burden adders. Suggestions are welcome.<br>
<br>
About the rest of the cards:<br>
<br>
The Free Peoples side uses some shadow pool denial. Frodo, RA makes his two possessions almost free. Many of the Dwarf possessions are free.<br>
<br>
Starting Frór because Uruk Damage isn&#39;t very nice. Better try to win, I guess. <br>
<br>
Book Of Mazarbul !  Draw engine, great card. You draw a card for each dwarf companion at sites 4 and higher. I usually draw 3 cards (Dwarf Guard being an emergency companion only), 11 card hand at the start of each fellowship phase feels pretty good.<br>
<br>
Bounder and Thrarin..you now what they&#39;re all about.<br>
<br>
The rest of the cards are there only to let you win more skirmishes. The Orc Butcher likes all the conditions (+1 str per condition)<br>
<br>
Sites:<br>
1- Help against early Nazguls. The Nazgul decks are often small, leaving them very weak late in the game against the discard tactics.<br>
2- Rotation, 15 possession in the deck.<br>
3- The plan is to move past this site from 2-4, this makes that double move easier.<br>
4- You got Gimli, does he/she?<br>
5- ...<br>
6- Well if you follow the plan you should try to go 4-6. If there are minions out there after site 5, this makes the next skirmish easier.<br>
7- No archers in this deck<br>
8- The Classic Emergency Brake, if you can find 5 orcs in your hand that is. Have this in mind when you play minions on site 6 and 7.<br>
9- Thought about the old 3 trackers card, but with all discardings done earlier most companions will be without possession. This leaves your minions stronger then them, so make them fierce and win twice. <br>
<br>
This is a deck killer, your opponent will not like you. They will curse here and there when they first see the second and last Aragorn&#39;s Bow go to the discard pile and then Boromir and Legolas. It&#39;s frustrating to play against this deck. It&#39;s however more a deck for FUN than for competetive play. Try it and see how fast you can empty a players draw deck!<br>
<br>
Enjoy<br>
