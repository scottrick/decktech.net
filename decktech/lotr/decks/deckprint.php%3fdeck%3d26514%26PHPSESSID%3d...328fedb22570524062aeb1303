Elven Might TTT only by Minas Morgul    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The general consensus is that the elves in TTT block arent very strong, but they have something other cultures do not have and something that has almost NO shadow counters in TTT block. Archery. They also have the means to take advantage of the wounds they make.<br />
<br />
sites<br />
1 the local meta game around here is ring bound rangers and rohan so this is definitely useful.<br />
2 the ability to MAKE them stop at site 2 cannot be understated helps you move ahead if you go second.<br />
3. this is a great cards Holding a hand full of shadow? get rid of it played your hand out and have just a couple shadow cards in hand? get rid of it overall a great site.<br />
4. purely a choice of teh rohan metagame its useful because your guys are still roaming.<br />
5. more archery is always good.<br />
6. you play possessions and your uruk hai are already fierce a good site.<br />
7. least hurtful one i think.<br />
8. i dont play dunlend<br />
9. big fellowship is a big thing around here and most people dont bid more then two so this is the best site but this is purely meta choice.<br />

your # 1 card elven bow you have to get these out to set up your combo. second card is all blades drawn with your lorien swordsmen to kill off weak minions. ive played one game with this deck and it has problems with lots of uruk hai thats why i included lorien is most welcome, but if uruk hai is a large part of your meta by all means add more then one. i had trouble slimming this deck down but i believe it works.<br />

Shadow <br />
ugluks the man the shadow side is designed to get those conditions on those companions and beat em down with minuses to there strength and that one wormtongue is in there just in case you get a hard to kill companions like aragorn. gl and hf  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
