I hadn&#39;t really seen many elf decks other than the Lorien Elf swarm variety, which I didn&#39;t care for. So, I whipped this deck together. When I went to compare it to some other decks on DT I wasn&#39;t able to find any. So, I&#39;m just going to post my version in search of comments.<br />
<br />
The early game will play like most Arwen/Aragorn/Legolas decks. I trust you&#39;ve seen these in action.<br />
<br />
Once you get to site 6, your allies all become buff (strength +3, +6 if Uruviel is out, +9 with Swam-ships). The Pathfinders are there to make sure you can get Lothlorien Woods, but it&#39;s pretty popular anyway due to Ranger&#39;s Versatility. They&#39;re also useful for avoiding Anduin Confluence/Anduin Wilderland.<br />
<br />
On the home stretch, you will want to bring out your allies every chance you get, since they&#39;ll be at full strength. The Exert-to-wound text on Orophin/Rumil plus archery hits should reduce minions to something that Aragorn/Arwen can handle.<br />
<br />
The only card that I really wanted to work in, but didn&#39;t, was The Seen and Unseen. Getting rid of a Spies of Saruman or Orc Bowmen, Thin And Stretched, etc. could be very handy. <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
This is all about sticking it to Ranger&#39;s Versatility decks (and other archery decks, like my fellowship half :). They generally have a fellowship consisting of Legolas, Arwen, Aragorn with Bow and maybe Boromir. Their Arrows Enrage (in multiple) can turn Aragorn into a sub-par skirmisher and reduce Legolas to dangerous levels. If Arwen has the Elven Bow, she&#39;s useless too.<br />
<br />
With a couple of these out, even cheap Uruk-hai can tear through a fellowship in short order. Uruk Gaurd is especially good since he can spot the one companion who isn&#39;t an archer, and then pound an archer of opponent&#39;s choosing. <br />
<br />
The Shamans further take the wind out of ARV&#39;s sails, as they can heal exhausted minions before the archery phase.<br />
<br />
The Snows stop skirmish events, which generally equals more wounds, and possibly some overwhlemed companions if Their Arrows Enrage is doing its thing. Saruman&#39;s Chill is there &#39;cause it can come out of the deck at site 4 against Hobbit decks and can make overwhelming Frodo a bit easier - if the fellowship is all or mostly archers, Frodo may actually be doing some fighting anyway. <br />
 <br />
There&#39;s always room for Enquea. He&#39;s good early when all the Uruk-hai are still roaming. And he&#39;s good late, after Worry has added a sufficeint number of burdens.<br />
<br />
Well, there you have it. All I ask is that your review be informative.<br />
