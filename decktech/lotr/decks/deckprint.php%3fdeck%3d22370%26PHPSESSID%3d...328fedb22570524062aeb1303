Bid no more than three and hopefully go first, and get Aragorn out, and then hopefully Boromir. Use Senitels to pump up Aragorn and Boromir against all the nasty Fierce Uruks and Nazgul. Get Wizard&#39;s Staff or Glamdring on Gandalf, Flaming Brand or Blade of Gondor on Boromir, Ranger&#39;s Sword or Flaming Brand on Aragorn to make sure they win Skirmishes. Use Servant of the Secret Fire to make all the skirmishes Gandalf is using by maybe one or 2 strength to make him win it. Use Glamdring for Anti-Swarm and Sauron.<br />
Sleep, Caradhras anything like Orc Bowmen, Blade Tip, Black Breath and Saruman&#39;s Ambition(So Uruk&#39;s Don&#39;t Get Pumped). Use Hobbit Stealth to escape the Balrog at the Bridge and Lake. It doesn&#39;t matter when Sam comes out, but he helps with his Burden Removal-Aragorn heal circle. Use Pippin, Mr. Took to make sure Gandalf comes out low twilight at 2, and if you don&#39;t go first and if they don&#39;t play the Pony first then when Aragorn comes out, use his ability for that to, to make sure Aragorn comes out for 2 twilight, which has helped alot against Uruks and Nazgul which always could use that extra 2 twilight. Use Gandalf&#39;s nice ability to draw a card, which may just keep you going! And of course, once per turn, heal one of you companions!! (Ex: Gandalf, Sam, Frodo, Pippin or Boromir). They all have the Aragorn signet:)<br />

Advenrure--<br />
Prancying Pony lets me get Aragorn out, so him and Boromir can go against the big guys at sites 1 or 2, if I go first. Trollshaw I usually get Wizard&#39;s Staff, Glamdring, Flaming Brand, Hobbit Sword, Blade of Gondor, Armor, and Ranger&#39;s Sword by then, or at least two so I play it. Council Courtyard I am thinking of possibly thinking of replacing with Frodo&#39;s Bedroom, because of my possibility of getting Bounder and Sam there, which has happened alittle, and also Council Courtyard can get hurt me sometimes with the twilight removal.<br />
Moria Lake may hurt me, but it hurts them even more, making them alittle bit closer to death. <br />
The Bridge you think I had a choice? Thinking of adding the Balrog to this deck, reasons in the Shadow part. Now I used Galadriel&#39;s Glade over Valley of the Silverlode because even though their both Sanctuaries and Valley would help me out, it helps them out alot more to(Making Hobbits heal early). Anduin Wilderland is for obvious reasons, so all my orcs don&#39;t get shot down against heavy Elven Archery decks, which start to get strong around sites 6 and after where I live. Shores of Nen Hithoel, I sometimes have stopped them from getting to site 9 with it, if I have enough twilight because this isn&#39;t a swarm deck after all! But normally I have the twilight for it, and its obvious in any Sauron or Moria deck. Tol Brandir lets me get Scouting Band and Ambushers and Scouts back from my discard pile, which I normally am out of Scouting Bands by site 9. <br />

<br />
Shadow-<br />
Wound whoever skirmshes you! Orc Scouting Band, Orc War Band, Orc Hunters, Hate and Under the Watching Eye will make your opponent&#39;s companions Exert and then finally drop off one by one around site 6-9. I am thinking of throwing in The Balrog, Durin&#39;s Bane just for his big Damage +1 and his possibly overwhelming a hobbit or something, which trust me, would help alot in this deck, and gives me an advantage at site 5, which I could use, because of no special ability right now. I am thinking of switching Ambusher to Soldier for the wounding ability, but Ambusher sort of helps. I am also thinking of trying to find room for Morgul Skirmisher to exert all of the pesky Hobbit companions that travel wil Frodo. Also thinking of adding Whip of Many Thongs for the Balrog to get rid of Mithril Coat, Armor and Gimli&#39;s Helm, so if I do win and I wound them with Hate or their ability, they take two wounds instead of 1(Ex: Gimli, Dwarf of Erebor with a Gimli&#39;s Helm and Battle Axe, and an axe strike, making him 10 strength and I make Balrog with Whip attack him, I can discard Helm and give gimli 2 wounds, cuz I won. Then next turn I can make Orc War Band skirmishing him and use its ability to give him two wounds if i win, instead of one cuz i got rid of it last turn..I hope thats understandable but I know what I&#39;m saying...I think/hope!). I chose the refular Enquea over his twilight because his older one is so much better, and he is in there for the same reason as Scouting Band, War Band, Hunters, Hate and the rest, to kill off Frodo&#39;s Companions. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
