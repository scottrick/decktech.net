While I don&#39;t think that Hobbit healing decks are the best deck out there, I do think they have potential, especially in 2-player games. <br />
<br />
The problem I&#39;ve seen with the standard healing decks is that the fellowship &#39;nickel and dimes&#39; itself into a beating, since everything costs one to put into play.<br />
<br />
So, with this deck I strayed from the &#39;traditional&#39; Bag End > Gaffer setup, and went with Green Hill Country and Hobbit Farmers. Once you get out a Farmer, all of your allies are free, save Bilbo who requires 2 Farmers in order to be free. <br />
<br />
Other card choices:<br />
Sting x2 = Frodo starts at +1 strength, so you may as well let him fight if there&#39;s no way he can be overwhelmed. But the real reason to double-up is that this deck really needs the hand-check to double-move.  <br />
<br />
Merry, FtS = If you haven&#39;t heard my lecture yet, pull up a chair. In a Hobbit deck, FtS is better 99% of the time. You&#39;ve all witnessed a battle in which somebody burned all of their pumpers in an attempt to overwhelm. Merry is what stops this. Let&#39;s say you&#39;ve got a strength 8 Frodo against a Strength 10 minion. Now, if they have three +2 pumpers, they can overwhlem. But if they do, you&#39;ll just use Merry&#39;s text. If they don&#39;t, you&#39;ll just wound Frodo and save Merry&#39;s text to make sure you&#39;re not ovrwhelmed on the other skirmish (assuming there are multiple skirmishes). Comined with Bounder, there&#39;s really no way to overwhelm without some serious bad luck involved.<br />
<br />
TFNBS x3 = This card is really that necessary, and you need it early.<br />
<br />
No Boromir = I&#39;ve found that he&#39;s really just dead weight in a Hobbit deck. He adds another twilight every move, and, against Uruk-Hai, he is more trouble than he&#39;s worth. Savagery to Match There #&#39;s and Uruk Fighters are in nearly every Uruk-Hai deck.<br />
<br />
Thror&#39;s Map x2 = No Anduin Confluence.<br />
<br />
Bilbo = Lets you keep those Stealth events coming in the late game. <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Look familiar? The Goblin Sneaks are the only thing really out of the ordinary, and work well because Bilbo can shuffle the draw deck at will. The end game should be a constant stream of weenies for the opponent.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ll want to try to outnumber your opponent at least once early on (site five usually being the opportune moment) so you can stack a few on the Swarms. Site 4 could also be the time to strike, since the Wall-Crawlers get a bonus, and anybody with a weapon is damage +1.<br />
<br />
Unfamiliar Territory is just to good to pass up with all the archers running around. Also good for getting fools to the Swarm stack.<br />
