I got this deck off Casey Barson and Courtney Haggerty after their Utah PSQ.  Casey had won with it and it was something that looked cool and different, plus it ran with uruks, and I love uruks. So, I get the deck and begin testing it and loose TONS of games.  But I still think  it is mad solid, so I take it to SoCal PSQ (59 players) and get 1st there with it 7-1.  So, I&#8217;m like wow that&#8217;s an awesome deck. I notice on buzz boards that Brian Fred is angry that Court let me have the deck, and decide I gotta meet him and thank him, hopefully assuage his anger.  I continue to play it and decide its what I&#8217;m gonna play on Day 1.  I went 6-2 there getting 5th place. I ended up meeting Fred and he was very happy that someone was doing so well with his deck.  I only wish before hand that someone had told me that Mike Dalton may also have had a hand in building this deck. <br />
<br />
Anyway, STRATEGY, the free peoples side is obvious, choke them out, garbage their hand so that you can own them on site 5.  Faramir is a broken beast who usually cant be beat, and Aragorn and his bow are nasty.  Merry can be an affective companion with escape or a sword out. This deck beats most decks hands down. It struggles slightly against Moria and a heavy Saruman&#8217; Power Uruk deck..  But rips up everything else.  Try to always go last with this deck, you will be able to double at some point.  Most games at Vegas I bid four, but I can&#8217;t recommend that. The best thing about this fellowship is EVERYTHING plays right out of your hand. This deck cycles like mad by itself, no card drawing needed! I am well aware that this deck has no condition removal, it does not need it.  Betrayals do the job. <br />
<br />
When to play Lego?  The deck is very strong with the four main dudes; throw Lego away against Moria! This cannot be overstated. Lego owns though against nazgul, dunland, and uruks.  BOROMIR, Boromir is solid most of the time, I lost a game to Pat M. because I was reluctant to play him and give him that fifth guy for Nertea. <br />
<br />
Shadow: Uruks, uruks, uruks, its ALL about uruks. This shadow has handled everything except Dalton&#8217;s deck!  It can come back and not let you down.  Sometimes, it&#8217;s better not to play Saruman, as the swarm is much better.  I killed McClure and McGregor because I swarmed them and didn&#8217;t play Saruman at key times. Keeping this in mind the first characters you want to kill are Lego, Eowyn, and of course Aragorn.  I beat McGregor and McClure cause I killed their Legos.  Don&#8217;t be tempted to put in No Business, there are MORE than enough minions here. <br />
<br />
Thanks again SOO much to Brian Fred, Courtney Haggerty, and Casey Barson (long talks over strat really helped) as this is more their deck than mine, but I did play it well and made some slight changes. <br />
