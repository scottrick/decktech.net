Gandalf&#39;s Bottomless Quiver, v1.2 by Andreas Vindenes    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Strategy: <br>
<br>
Bid relatively high (somewhere around 4), and go second. This is of course to facilitate play of your punishing second and third sites. If your opponent plays Pony, hope for a shadow discard on their turn. If they play pony, and you think you have a swarm on your hands, play RotN, think you&#39;re dealing with Sauron, Nazgul, or Isengard, go with Kie. Pray that you get Gandalf and Aragorn out early, and play toys as you get them. The only thing you hold on to is ARV for when you Thror&#39;s Map site 7 and 8. Use directed archery for killing minions before skirmishing, using Strenght in Spirit with Barliman to recycle them. Use your head, though, as four SoS at 7 and 8 can make the game.<br>
<br>
Card-spanation:<br>
Frodo, RA---for KIE and stings cost<br>
IB---I play nothing else, and you shouldn&#39;t either. IMO the best ring by far. The extra vitality is huge and the ability to put it on anytime outweighs the burden-adding<br>
Arwen---Simply put, she&#39;s the only worthy companion to start alongside Greenleaf<br>
Greenleaf---The theme is directed archery....&#39;nuff said<br>
RotN--- For pony (since everybody plays it) if you think you spot a swarm<br>
KiE---Healing Frodo<br>
Gandalf, FotS--- Need the strength more than the drawing since I use a small fellowship and I have Elrond <br>
Barliman--- recycling those SoS&#39;s for when I need them at later sites (alternatively SotSF if I they&#39;re exhausted)<br>
Elrond--- Need some kind of drawing in here... Extra cards can make a game<br>
Gwemegil--- She&#39;s in there so she might as well be useful<br>
Asfaloth--- Same<br>
Ranger&#39;s Sword--- Constant power-up for one of my main skirmishers<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Bow--- need those directed shots<br>
Glamdring--- see Ranger&#39;s Sword<br>
Gandalf&#39;s Staff--- extra vitality, lower cost for SoS and SotSF, AND skirmish canceller. This is great!<br>
Sting--- The Sting/glamdring ability can be huge, and it&#39;s a much better choice than hobbit sword<br>
Thror&#39;s Map--- Important for site 7. Can&#39;t afford a skipped archery fase.<br>
Athelas--- Blade tip/desperate defense/black breath-type of annoying conditions. If you don&#39;t face these, use them to heal<br>
Tale and Saga--- Extra vitality for exerting companions is HUGE!<br>
Strength of Spirit--- Prevent exertions<br>
ARV--- Complements archery excellently<br>
SotSF--- best booster event there is<br>
Sleep--- last resort. Can be devastating vs. UtWE/Bowmen and swarms.<br>
A wiz...--- Since I don&#39;t a 2 more FotSF&#39;s...<br>
<br>
Punish your opponent with a witch-king or enquea with ostea (hopefully) and play resistance/wraith world/return to it&#39;s master to capitalize on the burdens. The helpless is there to destroy sam, bane of corruption deck (aka son of hamfast) and His Terrible Servants is in so you can keep your exertables alive for the stop. Do not hesitate to use the game text of Emyn Muil, though, as a fierce wk or enquea is one of the best things you can get. <br>
<br>
Ulaire Attea---he&#39;s twilight and helps with those annoying healing circles and elven allies<br>
Enquea--- Exert to wound ringbearer rocks!!!<br>
Nelya--- This guy will be using his text a lot since those burdens will be piling up... He&#39;s twilight, too...<br>
Wk, LoN--- This guy is like enquea only better!!<br>
Otsea--- Fierce Wk or Enqua will be hard to deal with<br>
Helpless--- Sam, Son of Hamfast really hurts burden decks... This will make that a non-issue..<br>
His Terrible Servants--- Keep those &#39;guls alive for the stop.<br>
Gates--- Cost is a major issue for nazguls. This helps deal with that.<br>
Return to It&#39;s Master--- This is a great card!! combo this with Resistance and your stacking burdens fast!<br>
Resistance--- Makes him put on the ring. What&#39;s not to love???;)<br>
Wraith World--- With resistance this is like an instant wk!!<br>
Treshold---Makes them win so they can burden that irritating little hobbit.<br>
<br>
This is a deck that works pretty well against almost everything. The worst match is nazgul, because they have so friggin&#39; high vitalities. That is why Gandalf is in there, though, and ARV also helps with this. It&#39;s not impossible, but a little more difficult than moria swarm or something. It has served me well, and will be the deck I use for the Oslo Territorial Open, therefore I desperately need reviews! Thank you for looking, and I hope you have learned something.<br>
