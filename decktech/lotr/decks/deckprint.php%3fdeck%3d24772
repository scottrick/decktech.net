<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1)Introduction.<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
For most of the players, dwarfs can&#39;t win games. This deck is trying to prove<br>
the contrary. It doesn&#39;t seem strong at first glance but it&#39;s reliable and trustworthy<br>
(as all dwarves are after all).<br>
<br>
2)Fellowship side.<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
For this side the general idea is to choke the opponent by giving as few twilight as <br>
possible. With this in mind, lot of the cards are free or cost only 1. To avoid clogged <br>
hand, most of the cards are equipment or condition. In most game, the hand will<br>
be depleted before moving (save for some boost and shadow cards).<br>
The number of tales, weapons,... insure that Gimli and Gloin will be tank right from site 1<br>
(at relatively no cost). <br>
The choice of playing only dwarf in this deck is not for theme.<br>
It hinder some of the new strategies develloping in my area: Moria Swarm (Moria scout <br>
doesn&#39;t add anymore), Sauron corruption (No Gondor for Gleaming in the snow),<br>
Sauron Power (Vile blade), Anti-archery (Saruman&#39;s Spies, Relentless charge,...),...<br>
This work perfectly with the prime goal of this deck: clog opponent hand with unused shadow<br>
cards.<br>
The fellowship is perfectly able to double move and avoid stopping at sanctuary with its<br>
number of healing cards.<br>
<br>
3)Shadow side.<br>
-----------------<br>
<br>
The main goal of the shadow side of this deck is to put as much wounds as possible<br>
on opponent&#39;s fellowship. It&#39;s second goal is to not clog my own hand.<br>
The minions are cheap, there is a little of twilight generation/Stockage and<br>
they hit quite powerfully. As for fellowship side, situational cards are kept to the <br>
minimum. With overconfident opponent kills are likely to happen by site 5 <br>
and overwhelm by site 7. Against other, they will gear down enabling dwarfs<br>
of the fellowship to sprint for site 9.<br>
<br>
4)Specifics cards choices.<br>
----------------------------<br>
<br>
Gimli, dwarf of the mountain race : The first version of this deck was built with<br>
                                                  Gimli, Son of Gloin. But soon, it appeared to me <br>
                                                  that the main fighter was Gloin and that Gimli<br>
                                                  served only to take wounds. I&#39;ve never used his<br>
                                                  exert ability due to the number of equipment <br>
                                                  in this deck preventing him from being overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
Stairs of Khazad-dum: It&#39;s a tale for 0. So a permanent +1 Strenght for Gloin<br>
                                 without drawback. It&#39;s text is very handy against Balrog who are<br>
                                 very likely to appear at site 5.<br>
<br>
Make light of Burden: Mainly to avoid Desperate defence of the ring/Black breath/Blade tip<br>
                               and other such cards. One is few but as the deck flow really well<br>
                               it&#39;s enough.<br>
<br>
Book of Mazarbul: Troughput. Enough said.<br>
<br>
Song of durin: Only condition removal of the deck. Moria swarm is the only deck<br>
                     where condition discarding is of utmost importance (plus it&#39;s a tale<br>
                     for Gloin).<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s ambition: Lower all event cost and it&#39;s great in this deck.<br>
                              Plus avoiding Able guide and other that will hinder regroup event.<br>
<br>
Abandonning reason for madness: Useful to get rid of unuable card (cost 0 with<br>
                                                 saruman&#39;s ambition).<br>
<br>
5)How to play it.<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
No burden Removal so bid low (usually 0, but 1 is fine too).<br>
Opponent will go first and probably make to the 3 (Really good, thanks<br>
now i&#39;m on my site). Try to play all your shadow cards.<br>
In your turn play all the free stuff you can and move to the trollshaw forest.<br>
Stop there. (Yes stop there!).<br>
In opponent turn, i&#39;ll enter dwarrowdelf chamber (for, hopefully 2 exertion)<br>
Play your hand (generally 2-3 minions). Opponent will wins it&#39;s fight but in regroup<br>
he&#39;s likely to take 2-9 wounds (exertion and tree are strong). Always play tree are strong if possible.<br>
So opponent will face from 4 to 11 wound before bridge, so he&#39;s likely to stop<br>
(otherwise it&#39;s quite sure that the bridge will become a death trap).<br>
In your turn, play equipment (and so draw cards with trollshaw forest) and let&#39;s go to the 4.<br>
Opponent should play a low number of minions (you give on an average basis 3-5 for the<br>
first move, then reduce by 2 and add 3-5 so 4-8 twilight for second move).<br>
Opponent will go to the bridge, with your hand (statistically) made of 90%<br>
of shadow, stop him here with 2-9 wounds more (6 to 20). If you have hollowing of isengard try to stock some <br>
twilight for next trun beatdown.<br>
You should do 4-6 in one turn (till durin wakes again is likely to be in play in multiple<br>
enabling a lot of healing). Now, you are in the lead.<br>
Opponent will try to do for the 6 (if hollowing in play, it&#39;s like a second bridge).<br>
As usual 2-9 wounds (plus a real possibility of kill against an exhaust character<br>
with the help of saruman). So 8-29 wounds and a dead in opponent fellowship<br>
by this time. (And his hand is full of unusable cards due to your low consumption of twilight!!)<br>
Make it to 7, if no problem here continue to 8 (60% of time). If not, you&#39;ll<br>
be able to stop opponent at 7 due to it&#39;s previous wounds. (even with aragorn+sanctuary, in<br>
the low wound figure, 2 will remains after healing at site 6! and by experience the<br>
total will go for an average figure of 5).<br>
The end of the game will be a sprint with you in the lead with full strenght fellowship<br>
against a weakened opponent. You should win this one.<br>
<br>
The trick is to double move between 5 and 6, the real helper is till durin wake again.<br>
In the worst case Thrarin should take the blow. Balrog is really not a problem here <br>
(Sure i take 2 wounds, two times but i&#39;ll heal everything by leaving this site).<br>
Moria is not a problem. Keep Disquiet of my people for desperate situation only.<br>
(Played on Gloin with stairs out and some equipment you should take 3 medium to<br>
big minions, like troops, without being overwhelmed and without playing a boost).<br>
Nazguls are a pain but are heavily shocked all along the way to site 7. (Too late to<br>
stop you with these pests).<br>
Uruk... Well... Choke them, defeat them and take a lot of dead but you should survive that<br>
(in fact i win 2 out of 3 times against Uruk, but not an easy game). And never forget to<br>
remain at  4. If you play the fifth companion it&#39;s game over.<br>
