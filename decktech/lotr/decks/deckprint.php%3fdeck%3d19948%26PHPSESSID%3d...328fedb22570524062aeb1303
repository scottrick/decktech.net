<br />
With this deck, you want to bid so that you go second.  Going second with this deck allows for the sites being pulled out for the Adventure Path to be mostly, if not all, yours.  The sites in this deck all play an important role.  First, Weathertop makes all of your Nazgul Fierce, and against decks that start with larger Fellowships, especially Hobbits, you should have enough Twilight to play almost any Nazgul in the deck, even if roaming.  The Ford of Bruinen gives the Shadow side of this deck a big advantage, allowing some Nazgul to come into play free, the rest for next to nothing.  Being a River site, it also allows the play of A Ranger&#146;s Versatility.  ( see below )  The Moria Stairway helps both sides as well, because by this time in the game you should have a hand weapon in play.  With a Nazgul Sword and three burdens on the Ring-bearer, your Ringwraiths will be Fierce and deal 3 damage in any skirmish they win here.  The Bridge is there because, well, it has to be.  Lothlorien Woods is an advantageous site for the Free Peoples side, again for using A Ranger&#146;s Versatility.  The Anduin Confluence, site 7, gets rid of pesky allies in Hobbit and Elf archer decks.  It is also a River, so Versatility can be played here as well.  The Shores of Nen Hithoel is a great River site that costs 9 Twilight to get to.  Tol Brandir is the only site 9 that is a River, crucial for an end game Versatility.  <br />

FREE PEOPLES STRATEGY <br />
<br />
You are probably wondering why this deck starts with the Premium Aragorn.  The answer is that he heals Boromir, the other key Fellowship member, every turn.  Taken along with Athelas and sanctuaries, Boromir should never die.  Boromir is key because he is a Ranger, and because his strength must be tripled in order to overwhelm him.  Boromir is the go to guy if any minions make it to the Skirmish phase.  No Stranger to the Shadows can play on both Aragorn and Boromir, so your Twilight cost for each site is potentially -2.  With such a small Fellowship and a reduction in site Twilight, the Shadow player(s) will not be able to throw a whole lot of minions your way.  At a River or Forest, A Ranger&#146;s Versatility exhausts up to two minions, and then Aragorn can pick off the rest with exerted archery.  If anyone sneaks through to Skirmish, the hand weapons and a total of eight power up cards will take care of business.  As far as Gandalf, Legolas, and Sam, you want to save these guys for last.  At site 7, your opponent should be one site ahead of you ( if your Nazgul haven&#146;t killed them off by now )  It is time for the endgame rush.  Play Gandalf, Sam and Legolas at site seven and move.  Play a final Versatility to exhaust a couple minions and pick off what you can with Aragorn and Legolas.  Skirmish whats left, if any, with Boromir and Gandalf.  Then play Pursuit Just Behind during the Regroup phase to wound whatever minions that survived.  Now play An Able Guide, removing 4 Twilight, and move again.  By this time the Shadow will have a little more Twilight to play with, but dont worry.  If you have one more Versatility, play it, then use Aragorn and Legolas again, exhausting them if needed.  Any body who makes it to Skirmish should be handled by Boromir and Gandalf.  Frodo should never have to fight, but if he does, assign him any minions with 1 Vitality.  Power According to His Stature will finish them off in the first Skirmish action.  After the dust settles, Frodo should still be alive and well at site 9, and you win !<br />
<br />
SHADOW STRATEGY<br />
<br />
The Shadow strategy of any deck in LOTR is simple : kill everyone.  This deck helps speed that process along.  First, Black Breath and Blade Tip together on the same companion spell certain doom.  Black Breath prevents healing while Blade Tip deals damage every turn, regardless if the companion it is transferred to fights again during his now shortened life.  Put these conditions into play as soon as you draw them.  Blade Tip can be played as a response when you want, so dont waste them on characters who will obviosly be overwhelmed.  Drawn To Its Power helps keep burdens on the Ring-Bearer.  This makes power up cards like Nazgul Sword and Threshold Of Shadow even more powerful.  Imagine a Fierce Nazgul, bearing a Nazgul Sword that makes him damage +1, being powered up to 14 Strength or higher !  Things do not bode well for the Fellowship now.  Each Nazgul has its own special abilities as well.  Ulaire Toldea picks who he fights.  Ulaire Nelya can replace sites with your own if the site advantage doesnt go to you.  Ulaire Enquea can simply wound someone for standing there, as long as there are five burdens.  Ulaire Cantea gets rid of pesky bows or swords.  Ulaire Attea can pump himself up to 17 Strength without any other cards, as lond as the Twilight is available.  Lastly, the most frustrating part of playing Shadow is having to deal with Allies.  Whether its Hobbit allies healing and removing burdens all game long, or if its Elves coming out to play with their bows, allies make the game harder for the Shadow to kill the Ring-Bearer.  This is where the Anduin Confluence works so well.  Discarding EVERY ally definitely helps toward the end, and it usually leaves Frodo and only a couple companions left, buck-nekkid.  But this deck doesnt have to wait that long.  Fear gets the job done early.  Spot a Nazgul, kill an ally, its that easy.  Tired of Elrond drawing cards ?  Kill him ! Tired of the Gaffer and Hobbit Party Guests making all your work for naught ?   Kill them !  With no allies, many decks get overwhelmed fast, especially with brutal Nazgul that are Fierce, have the potential to be damage +1, and have nearly unbeatable strengh.  You win ! <br />
