Tha END!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Please Read This! I Know what you are thinking, he won&#39;t win ANY skirmishes with that deck! And I say to you, I know! This is sort of an experiment, and I think it&#39;s not too bad, although it had notable weaknesses. First of all, your deck&#39;s objective:<br />
<br />
To SHOOT you opponent&#39;s minions down before they get close enough to kill your companions. <br />
<br />
You have almost NO protection against minions who live through archery. You DO have 2 Copies of Armor, which will deal with Uruks and The Common Balrog, which is the bane of this kind of deck. In the early game you should have enough archery to clear out just about everything they are able to throw at you. Basically, if they play anything with the minimal twilight you give them, then it will die and you move again for free!<br />
<br />
weaknesses? skirmishing! The Uruks cause trouble, since Troops have high vitality and come down for relatively little, which means that it might survive the archery phase. To that end, let me show you our ARMOR section, where Aragorn and Boromir can stand there, take a wound, and live to fight another day.<br />
<br />
No Double Shot? nope, the card sucks. It is a non-efficient card that causes one wound for clogging my hand and using precious deck space.<br />
<br />
You will DIE! - will not! I am giving VERY little twilight, which means that the only shadow getting out more than 2 minions is Moria, and they will ALL die to my archery, it&#39;s just that simple. <br />
<br />
The ONLY card that absolutely cloberS this deck is the Cave Troll&#39;s Chain, and you just have to hope that your oppoent isn&#39;t playing it. Thats all you can do, I&#39;m sorry to say. Sorry, nothing&#39;s perfect.<br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
<br />
Nazgul Ugly Beatdown. The Witch King doesn&#39;t lose skirmishes, plain and simple, and thats why I&#39;m playing 4. Won skirmishes mean wounds, and Black Breath says that those wounds aren&#39;t leaving. This causes the opponent to move slowly in the early game, which is where you can run and get your head start. The Nazgul are weak late game, but they make up for it by being scary, which is enough for me.<br />
<br />
Card Choices?<br />
<br />
OK!<br />
<br />
Bill Ferny - why play him when I&#39;m using Bree Streets? Well, he causes overwhelms, which is about the only hope the Nazgul have of getting early kills, and thats good enough for me.<br />
<br />
No Too Great and Terrible? - nah, I chose All Blades cause it makes skirmish event less efficient and hoses archery, which can be a problem for Nazgul. Did your opponent just manage to off the Witch King by double servanting and Trusting Gimli? All Blades the Final wound and watch your opponent wince!<br />
<br />
The Pale Blade? - oh yeah baby. Nothing like a 17 strength Witch King to clear out Trust Me, O Elbereth, Tale, Saga and No Stranger! The Damage +1 is just Cake!<br />
<br />
well, I hope it makes since, and if you like it drop me a D-Mail and lemme know how it does for you. Thanks for looking, I just wanted to post something a bit different from whats in the top 10, namely Uruks! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
