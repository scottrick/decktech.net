That is it    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The Free People is fairly straight forward.  Bid 3 to win.<br>
Then pull aragorn out because you will need him.  when you get a <br>
weapon put it on merry first so he will be a seven.  Use sam when you have to many or really big minions<br>
make him defender plus one and use a stealth event.  Use there and back agian on frodo becuase it is free with him<br>
save the stout and strong for sam or roise. When you get boromir in your hand play him then, the 2 men are just there to take <br>
a beating form the bigger minions. Try only to play one pump card on them a skrimish. Don&#39;t worry they will survive until the next sacutary, if someone has to die make it pippin early or late in the game or Sam late in the game because of his power.<br>
<br>
The minions side is a strandard uruk side. Play your armories and surumans ambitions as soon as you can.<br>
The Broods are good with another minion out and are a pain at the last site.  Slayers are quick and easy to pump if you play them by themselves because then <br>
you can remove the twilight to pump them up and play a Bred for Battle on them. Try to use hunt them down on site 7 or 8 even if it means playing one or two minions. becasue <br>
them they will have twice the wounds on them with no way to heal and be going into site 9 where you can make all your minions fiece agian.<br>
