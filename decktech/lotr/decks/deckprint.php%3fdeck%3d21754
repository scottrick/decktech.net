The start with Sam let you bet at least 5 burden with no considerable danger involved. It let you remove 3 burden. If he had bid more and start the dragon inn. Start with aragorn. Sometimes I even bid 8, and kill my frodo at the first opportunity, so I have 0 burden. Its a gamble thought. Do you feel lucky ? Sam is a great ring bearer you know. Don&#39;t underestimate him. Starting the game remove a luck factor. Deck that rely on killing the right bearer might be very unlucky sometimes. Or get paired against a fellowship too strong for them and loose. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Most archery deck have 1 weakness, once the opponent manage to go through the archery phase they do considerable damage to the fellowship, sometimes knocking off some key character. Now this deck use 9 companion, 7 stealth, and 1 allies. So it doesn&#39;t matter if they manage to go through the archery phase you have so much character to suck the damage. Never put more than 5 characters that&#39;s all. Unless your at site 5 and you can play Ranger Versatility all the way. The combination of stealth and Ranger Versatility is great with plenty companion, as it easily take care or some minion. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Right now the most broken card is without doubt a Ranger s Versatility. No deck can be viable without it. This card let you abuse the archery fire. So for you the hardest location to go is 4 and 5. That&#39;s why you have multiple companion and Stealth to cancel fight.The ally Tharin act like a stealth from location 2 to 9. He is great. Then later at location 6 you should have 1 of your 2 thror&#39;s Map (statistically). Now that card is really handy as it let you play your own site. From 6 to 9 you have only forest / river. And that card call A Ranger s Versatility let you go so easily to site 9. It exhaust 2 minion of your choice at any river or forest if you can spot a ranger. Then legolas and Aragorn use their bow to kill them. Just one arrow and that cave Troll is History <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
The Nazgul Deck Now.The Thing About Nazgul is that they are almost never roaming. So They can stop the Opponent real fast. With Morgul Gates, lots of time if the opponent double Move He might get his frodo overwhelm, so he just cannot double move. Nazgul are really Though to kill, especially with All Blades Perish x4. So thrust me, he wont go very fast. Those nazgul will slow him down, so even if you have little problem with his shadow, Those Ulaires will give you enough time. <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
I could be optimistic and tell you that the goal of the Nazgul deck is to kill everybody, but no, it will not always happen. This is why the Fellowship is optimized so much to be the fastest, don&#39;t rely on killing your opponent, it will not always happen. Use the fellowship wisely and Run ! Run Forest Run ! <br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
By himself this deck is brutal. Anyone can use it. But anyways, good luck if you use it. <br>

Just for the reccord, this deck is for me 32-3 in tournement play ... And every player in my region are trying to find a way to beat it, but very few are sucefull. Even if I played it for  35 games and lots of player here copied it...<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
also people seems to think that sauron is my weakness. but no, sauron with direct damage is the most popular deck right here. I chose to play with no condition remover cause I know how much direct damage 9 companion can suck. Also look at my site 9 . Ill Thors map to play it. So no 3x tracker for them      </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
