  <br>
If you havent read the Lone Frodo article you will likely be unequipted to make suggestions on this deck without sounding silly. I would suggest reading that before you comment. <br>
<br>
<br>
Bid about 3. It is always nice to go first. Play everything you can on site 1 (wether you are first or second) and make sure you are going to your site 2. <br>
<br>
Once at site 2 you will double move unless there is 4 or more twilight in the pool, you expect to see Ford of Bruinen AND you arent holding 2 stealths or intuitions or combonation of the two. Wounds mean nothing. If you have Bounder and a pump up or two, there is no reason to sit at site 2. <br>
<br>
You will generally stop at site 3. If you had to stop at site 2 you will want to pass this site up unless you have more then 2 wounds or if there is a lot of twilight in the pool (around 6) and you are short on intuitions and stealths. <br>
<br>
At site 4 you will want to keep running if you have 2 Stealths. There is no reason to wait if you have them. If you are facing Moria and dont have 2 Stealths you will want to stop. They will almost always be playing a Balrog. If you are playing against another shadow and can get your strength to 9, or to 6 and have Bounder, then you can double move through. <br>
<br>
If you dont have to stop at this site, dont. The only thing that will encourage you to stop here is if there is a lot of twilight (7+), a lot of minions out (3+) or if you are completely out of pump cards. You should have a PATHS or 2 in your hand by now, so you should generally be safe. <br>
<br>
Stop at site 6 if you have more than 2 wounds and your opponent is playing something that gets wounds on you easily or you are short on pump cards. If you are exausted but your facing Moria, you can usually get away with moving. <br>
<br>
For the last 2 sites its the same. If you have 4+ pump cards in your hand, go. If you have 4 PATHS in your hand, you are unstoppable. Hold Stout and Sturdys to heal up Bounders in emergencies. <br>
<br>
Shadow is a standard Moria Swarm, so I wont go into that much. I chose Moria because they can dump quickly and replenish your hand of useful cards. <br>
<br>
Always hold PATHS. The only time you should use PATHS is when you WILL DIE if you dont (or, I suppose, if taking the wounds in burdens will make it impossible to use PATHS). Up until site 5, hold Stealths after site 5, hold Stout and . Its the only healing you get after site 6 and they are invaluable for Bounders in the last couple of sites. Intuitions are good to hold late game, too. No other card needs to be saved, you can ditch them all. <br>
<br>
Dont waste pump ups needlessly. Say you are facing a Wallcrawler underground and you have sting at site 5. Dont drop an intuition to win the skirmish, unless you are exausted. You make it to the next site and you heal, so theres no point in throwing away a card that might save an overwhelm later. <br>
<br>
 Keep cards cycling as much as you can. Lastly, They Are Coming can keep your minions flowing. If your opponent wont let you dump your fellowship cards in skirmishes, dump them to play minions. Lastly part 2, always double move. Its acceptable to double move to win and lose Frodo, if the alternative is your opponent making it to site 9 before you. Remember, your Shadow is not incredibly strong, and is not meant to destroy big fellowships. Its meant to keep the cards rolling and slow the opponent down enough to win. <br>
