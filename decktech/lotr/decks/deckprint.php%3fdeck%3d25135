   Basically, I start aragorn unless my opponent is playing the prancing pony then I start boromir and pull aragorn.I always bid 0 cuz I dont want to go first I want my opponent to, that way he goes to my sites which can hurt.The fellowship basically follows the opponent if he moves one then I move one; if he moves two I move two.The deck can keep up cuz the fewllowship is very strong. Aragorn and Boromir can get very high if pumped with trust or swordarm.The Servants also help if the dawg gets too big.sam is there for moria decks or too take on the the cave troll and rog if needed other than that keep up with ur opponent just incase u dont have the burdens and u can just breeze by him.<br>
Note:i play frying pan cuz its a ghetto paths which I dont have <br>

   Heres where the game gets fun.Make sure the opponent goes first cuz ur sites are very important.First at weathertop nazgul are fierce. If u get witchking then u can exert the ring bearer up to 4 times which would exhast him. If hes exhasuted Resistances makes him put on the ring and then u can add some burdens. If u dont get him and u get an otsea instead, play him and all the it wants to be found u can.At site 4 u add a burden then at site five pull the balrog and play all the must do without hopes u have. Now whenever u get tired of aragorn just drop an uruk-hai and play a can u protect me.ur opponent will either exhaust him or add 2 burdens which is right down ur alley.throughout the game do this stratigically and ur opponent will eventually exhaust him cuz no one can take six burdens just from those cards but if they do then u should have one. Most people take 2 to 4 then 3 to 4 from the it wants to founds and another 1 or 2 from the must do without help and 1 from the site. thats at least 7 not countingwhat they bid. If u get them too put on the ring or if ur nazgul win a skirmish then theyll take additional wounds or burdens from the The ringwraiths wake, the twilight world and Wraithworld.All in all its actually very easy to corrupt the ring bearer just keep those burdens coming and that ring will get to heavy for him to get too far. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
