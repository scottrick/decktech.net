This deck in the version I played in day 2. I won&#39;t post the day 3 deck cause I made some bad changes. <br />
<br />
This deck beat a bunch of good players on day 2, including 3 top 16 players. The reason why it did so well is because nobody was expecting Nazgul, and the 3 Too Great and Terrible killed all those Gandalf weed decks that were dominating. <br />
<br />
Usually, I bid 4 and try to go first, but very often I was outbid. The reason I didn&#39;t want to big 5-6 is because i expected a few hobbit decks that would bid really high and not start with Prancing Pony or Green Dragon. If I bid 4, I would usually win, and start sam + arwen and go get Aragorn, but if I lost, I could start aragorn and not worry about going into enquea/berserker range. <br />
<br />
I chose Son of Drogo because I knew there would be mostly Uruk decks, and i was a concerned about Worry. It turned out that it wasn&#39;t much of an issue, but it still helped a bit.<br />
<br />
This deck is really good because when playing against moria, you can just play all your companions and that makes it very difficult to get swarmed, but when you are playing against Uruks, just keep 4 companions and kill everything. <br />
<br />
I&#39;m glad I played this deck. Nazgul was a great choice for day 2 and 3. <br />
<br />
I completely wrecked Peter Leiher&#39;s Gandalf big fellowship/Uruks with a version of this deck, because Too Great and Terrible killed his Gandalf every time...<br />
<br />
This Deck is no good now with all the new cards, but I wanted everyone to know why i played nazgul and not uruks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, now for some match-ups:<br />
<br />
moria: Usually, I played 5 companions so enquea or Nertea couldn&#39;t hurt me as much. Once I got gandalf and sleep out, I basically won. Pathfinder helped at sites 7-8-9.<br />
<br />
Uruks: Usually, I only played 4 companions, and they were denied plenty of twilight. Later on, I picked the right time (when they had a weak minion hand) and dumped all of of companions and ran. Pathfinders really helped at site 4, 7, and 9.<br />
<br />
Sauron: I didn;t play against a sauron deck all weekend.<br />
<br />
Nazgul: Nazgul suck so I just walked all over them. I have never lost to Nazgul with this.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this is what I played and i hope you enjoy.<br />

Cya next year.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
