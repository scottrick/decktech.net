Plus, pipeweed decks are FUN to play! <br>
<br>
To start, bid high. I would suggest 6. This is for two reasons: you need to get Gandalf&#39;s Cart out and you will be able to remove burdens easily when the pipes and weed start flowing. <br>
<br>
Free People: <br>
The key to this game is Gandalf&#39;s Cart. Use it to stack all copies of pipeweed from your hand and also any extra possessions you need to get rid of (extra pipes, athelas, ranger&#39;s sword, etc). There are multiple copies of the important possessions because it is pretty important to get these things out. Athelas is used mainly for condition removal - use the pipeweed to heal! Get the pipes on the people as soon as you can - use the weed to remove burdens and to heal (when the pipes are out, you can heal up to 4 companions by only playing one weed using aragorn&#39;s pipe). <br>
The beauty of pipeweed is that it can be used for many different purposes. With The Gaffer&#39;s Pipe, you can use it to shrink the twilight pool. With Gandalf&#39;s Pipe, you remove burdens. Finally, with Aragorn&#39;s Pipe, you heal companions. When you play those 3 pipes and Bilbo&#39;s Pipe, you can heal 4 companions, remove 4 burdens, or remove 4 from the twilight just by discarding a one twilight pipeweed possession. <br>
The Strategy then is to utilize the pipeweed and cycle through the FP cards (play them or stack them on the cart). The companions should be strong enough to make it through for you. <br>
You may encounter some problems with Swarms, but the best thing you can do if you are playing against Moria is to use the weed to make the twilight pool as low as you can each turn. <br>
<br>
Shadow <br>
The Shadow side is a Moria Swarm - I find that it complements the pipeweed FP side very well because you will be constantly drawing cards and playing a hoarde of Moria each turn. The configuration is pretty standard, using many common cards and only 8 uncommon ones. Without using any rares, I find it&#39;s the easiest shadow to pull off - and it works well with pipeweed. <br>
<br>
I hope you have fun with this deck.  And remember - you can have fun, even without 4 witch kings in your deck.  ;) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
