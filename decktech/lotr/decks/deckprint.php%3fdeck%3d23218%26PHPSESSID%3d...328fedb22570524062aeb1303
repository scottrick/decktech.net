Designed to do one thing and do that well. This deck will get Frodo, alive, to the end of the Adventure path before the opponent. It will do this through a number of ways:<br />
<br />
Stealths: your site 2 is a built in stealth, you have 7 stealth events and Filbert will help you hide from the Fierceness.<br />
<br />
Numbers: Swarms will have a hard time overcoming your Fellowship, and Enquea hurts you little or not at all. There are nine companions here, plus 4 allies that can come up an fight. <br />
<br />
Aragorn: he can fight up to 4 minions at once. Its been said before, this guy fresh at site 9 is an auto-win<br />
<br />
Shadow: the Uruk-Hai pack the most punch, doing twice the wounds of a normal minion and doing it cheaply. Spies screws archery decks and Savagery screws decks like this one.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAME PLAN<br />
<br />
start off by bidding 6, 7 if you feel frisky. you MUST go first. It will allow you to ensure that you get YOUR site 2, which is essential. After you win the bid, Pippin removes a burden. Then you will use Sam to take off 3 more. Exert Pippin and play Buckleberry Ferry. Play any allies, but NO companions. You don&#39;t wanna fight at site 2. You should be able to move into site 3 without too much trouble. If you don&#39;t have any stealths, be a little wary, but moving to 3 should be little trouble. After you make it to 3, play any companions you have, being sensitive to what the opponent is playing. If you draw Sting, try to use it every turn in order to see what the opponent is up to. Don&#39;t be afraid to lose companions with this deck, you have 9, so use them as you need to. The only one you should try to not lose too soon should be Aragorn. He should be sacrificed at site 9 to secure the win. You should be able to move quickly with this deck, while your shadow side pummels the opponent. <br />
<br />
MATCHUPS<br />
<br />
Swarms- your numbers are so high, it will be difficult for them to even get a minion on Frodo. If they do, you have plenty of ways to keep him from being overwhelmed. They will have plenty of twilight, so try to use the Sentinels on their Swarms, since they will probably stack multiples on them. Double move if you can, and remeber that your Stealths will work all the way through the danger zone, that is, Moria. Filbert helps against the Balrog and Troll.<br />
<br />
Sauron- Under the Watching Eye and Bowmen will not hurt nearly as much in this matchup, since you have A LOT of companions to soak up the damage. Use Sentinels to rid yourself of the Bowmen, Thin and Stretched and Desperate Defense. Walk to victory and use Thror&#39;s Map to deny them Tol Brandir.<br />
<br />
Nazgul- Fierce Nazgul are your easiest matchup, since Filbert screws them, but beware of the Twilight variety. They will win skirmishes against you, so beware of The Witch King. Keep Frodo healthy so that you never have to put on the ring. If these Nazgul are popular in your area, take out the There and Back again for another O Elbereth!<br />
<br />
Uruk Hai- this is your toughest matchup, since Savagery will often hurt and the damage +1 will add up eventually. This game will be Bloody and if they are playing Worry you may find yourself using Sam even late in the game. If this matchup, you must go first, luckily you are bidding VERY high for that privilige, therefore you should be able to survive. Again, Filbert helps against fierceness.<br />
<br />
well, I hope that this has been satisfactory. I think that this deck is VERY solid, and it has a leg up on the competition, simply because it doesn&#39;t play with the Mirror of Galadriel. Thanks for looking and please ask me if you have any questions before reviewing.<br />
