1) Archery: Wipe out big or little minions in the archery phase to avoid getting a beat down later<br />
2) Healing Circles: found mostly in Hobbit decks or Shoulder to Shoulder... also to a minor degree in Aragorn signet decks<br />
3) Twilight Choke: reducing twilight so as to face fewer minions and choke the opponents hand with shadow cards<br />
4) Power: Companions simply don&#39;t lose skirmishes, Trust Me As You Once Did is a perfect example<br />
5) Discard: Hopefully you get rid of minions to get an easy double or triple move for the victory<br />
<br />
This deck combines a little bit of the first 4 in a nifty little package.  Choke your opponent, use archery to make sure your companions will not lose skirmishes, win the skirmishes and clear out the minions, and then heal the wounds with Citadel and Elrond.  Elrond can come in as your 11 str free moving companion.  Galadriel also heals Legolas every turn... This deck can move pretty fast and the companions stay alive.<br />
<br />
Vs. Isengard Orcs: Do enough archery wounds so they can&#39;t exert after you beat them in skirmishes.  The Bow of Galadhrim should help here too.<br />
Vs. Uruk-hai: Take out big guys like the Berserker, Lurtz and even the Lieutenants in archery, then take care of the rest with your two men.  The choke will hurt them as will the archery, but watch out for an easy overwhelm by stinging them every turn.<br />
Vs. Moria: One of your two tough match-ups... Your archery, the bow of galadhrim, the horn and Power According are your swarm protection... use them wisely.  You&#39;ll have a tough run, but if you stay alive you will probably win.<br />
Vs. Nazgul: The toughest match-up.  Black Breaths are beyond painful to this deck... so don&#39;t take archery exertions... a lot of times they&#39;ll just All Blades Perish those wounds anyways... instead rely on your bulls... Aragorn and Boromir... a nazgul deck won&#39;t get more than two minions on you, so this is all the defense you need.  W/ Brand you have a 16 str Aragorn and a 15 str Boromir... the Witch King is the only real tough minion.  Of course early game is where you will have problems, so play smart.<br />
Vs. Sauron conditions: You can heal 4 wounds a turn and you won&#39;t be losing skirmishes to trackers... Keep all your companions except Frodo at least 1 exertion away from exhausted.  Remove Under the Watching Eyes w/ Sentinals and Orc Bowmen w/ Vilya... paying that 3 again will suck... especially when they see you&#39;ll probably just bump it back to their hand again.<br />
<br />
The shadow is all based on what I like to call a super combo...  The combo revolves around 4 cards:<br />
Can You Protect Me From Yourself: Adds Burdens most of the time<br />
Orthanc Berserker: Exert him to exhaust a companion in maneuver<br />
Uruk Shaman: Use 2 twilight to heal an Uruk in maneuver<br />
Ulaire Enquea: The Machine gun...<br />
<br />
The deck is built with this combo in mind but can easily function without it.  Enquea is always useful... the Berserker is still a really good minion and the shaman is extra archery protection.<br />
<br />
The opponent has to have Aragorn for the combo, that&#39;s why I bid high and pull Aragorn w/ the pony... the opponent will pull Aragorn too if he plays him.  Play CYPMFY early when Aragorn will probably be fighting someone, or midgame when their superfellowship is up to 6 people and you have an Enquea out.  This way you add burdens for sure.  Your goal is obviously 5 burdens for the berserker and enquea.  <br />
<br />
Late game:  You get 16 twilight from their superfellowship going into site 7 or 8... stick out a Berserker and the Shaman.  Maneuver phase: exhaust a companion... heal the berserker... exhaust a companion... heal the berserker... then exhaust another companion... maybe even play another CYPMFY to exhaust Aragorn or add another 2 burdens.  That&#39;s 3, maybe 4, exhausted companions... no fellowship can heal all of that in one turn... which is when Enquea comes out swinging...  I think you see how this works... and yes... it takes a lot to get out, that&#39;s why the deck is not built around it... it&#39;s just a major bonus and something to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Outside that combo, you have a very powerful Uruk half that wins skirmishes, and overwhelms easily.  <br />
<br />
Vs. Trust: Saruman&#39;s Power are huge, plus a trust deck is the most susceptible to the CYPMFY combo as having Aragorn exhausted is not exactly cosher to them.  Saruman will give your Uruks the determination they need to win a couple for the gipper along the way.  But don&#39;t expect anyone other than Lurtz and the Troops to win many skimishes.<br />
<br />
Vs. The Mirror:  Oh yeah... the mirror is dead...<br />
Vs. Archery: Lots of High Vitality guys and Saruman should be enough to get a couple of Uruks through... Breds and Savageries will help overwhelming those weak elves.<br />
Vs. Choke:  Saruman&#39;s power will get rid of No Strangers and CYPMFY will pretty much add a burden everytime.  Don&#39;t underestimate how much damage 1 Troop can do.<br />
Vs. Superfellowships:  Put out Enquea w/ an Uruk and play a couple of CYPMFY... easy burdens!  Oh yeah... and Savagery is a pretty good card too...<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
Boromir vs. Gandalf:  Best Fighter in the game after Aragorn... also because Gandalf requires more of a central role, whereas Boromir is more of the support character I wanted.  Also can play one fine tune on the horn.<br />
Elrond, Heir: Heals someone everyturn... beats Troops and Orthanc Assassins in skirmishes... oh yeah... and removes conditions... this just in: this guy is good.<br />
Galadriel, new: Heals Elrond or Legolas (why would she heal herself?) everyturn, plays some of your sites (not that it makes a difference post-ARV...)<br />
Filibert: Best ally in the game... in every deck for a reason<br />
Citadel: Yes it&#39;s hard to make work... but when it does... it&#39;s awesome.<br />
Orc Overseer: He makes assignment tough for the opponent<br />
Enquea, Shaman, Berserker: Explained above<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power: The reason I don&#39;t use Worry/Tower of Orthanc<br />
Savagery: This is a good card right?<br />
<br />
Cards that you could add:<br />
Tower of Orthanc, Worry and Greed: Exhaust a companion w/ Berserker using burdens from Worry... and either let him add 3 twilight next turn or kill him for 2 twilight w/ Greed.<br />
Rumil/Orophin: just didn&#39;t want to concentrate too much on allies.<br />
another horn: obvious reasons<br />
The Common Saruman: Another method of picking companions off... exhaust them and then assign Lurtz or a troop to them... bye bye!<br />
