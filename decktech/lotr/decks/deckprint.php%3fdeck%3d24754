<br><br />
1: In case you go first, helps with the allies costs. Dont have the site that pulls Bilbo yet.<br />
<br><br />
2: DUH!<br />
<br><br />
3: You should have a ally in your hand. Play a card, get a card. Nifty!<br />
<br><br />
4: Uruk Hai can beatdown 1 site quicker.<br />
<br><br />
5: Let&#39;s see......<br />
<br><br />
6: After a rough fight at site 5, gives the Hobbits a chance.<br />
<br><br />
7: No archery in good archery.<br />
<br><br />
8: ARV and other annyoing FP (and Shadow) maneuver events prevented. WOW!<br />
<br><br />
9: Pure gold. I play usually 5-7 minions here, killing off Frodo and winning the game. Dont know if I should change it for Enym Muil or whatever it&#39;s called ( Exert to make fierce.) <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
First off, this deck is a project I have been working on for the past 3 weeks. It did well in its original form, but that was a 80 card deck that I didnt like ( wasnt very fast). I decided to cut it down to 35 a side, but lost its strenght in the act. I dont play with hobbit allies because I dont have everything needed do do so, and I dont play A Promise because I dont have any. The focus is to use the hobbits to sneak along the sites while the Uruks kill the the other Fellowship, or slowing them down enough to run past them at site 7 to run to 9. The shadow side has been my core that I have based all ofmy other shadow sides off of, with a few modifications. Here is the stragety:<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
* I DONT OWN ANY A PROMISE, SPIPES OF SAURMAN, URUK CAPTAIN, OR ANY RARE HOBBIT HEALING CIRCLE ALLIES!! WHEN I GET THEM, I&#39;LL MAKE ANOTHER POST!! *<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Bid 2 and go second. Your sites are inportant in this deck.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
FP: Basically hide and try to stay alive. Use stealth cards when you need them, because Fireworks and Bilbo will recycle them back into the deck. Avoid double moving unless you KNOW FOR A FACT that you can survive, otherwise take it one step at a time. If necessary, kill Frodo and let Sam carry the ring, but only at site 6 or higher. Always try to have Merry alive; he&#39;s your fighting unit, and Gandalf can take minions on also. Here are the match-ups:<br />
<br><br />
Nazgul: You need to be VERY careful with this deck. The soadow player will only get 1 to 2 minions out, but they will be big, so just plan to survive. Use Sleep to get rid of troublesome conditions when they are out (Blade Tip, Black Breath, and Helpless will hurt A LOT!) <br />
<br><br />
Uruk-Hai: Almost the same as Nazgul, except they will play more minions. This is where luck plays a BIG factor. Be cautious, and you should (hopefully) do OK. Probably the worst matchup. WATCH OUT FOR WORRY!<br />
<br><br />
Isnengard Orcs: Fairly easy matchup. Ue Frying Pan to wound the minions so they can use thier regroup action. IF they do, you sould be OK. Hobbits are very good at taking damage. <br />
<br><br />
Swarm (Sauron or Moria): Same as Isengard orcs, except without regroup actions. Kill the minions with Frying Pan and PATHS. You should do OK against them.<br />
<br><br />
Sauron Direct Damage/ Moria Archery: I lied. This is the hardest match-up. Orc Bowmen will hurt A LOT, so discard them ASAP. Archery will hurt too, so try to stay alive. Luck plays a big part in this match-up. Site 7 will help a lot.<br />
<br><br />
SHADOW: Basic Uruk-Hai beatdown. Pump up the minions to beat FP comanions down. I use 2 Powers because the FP will play more than 2 of their important conditions in their deck, so these will kill all of them. Runners add pool to play more minions, and CYPFY can help by either making Wrooy work faster, or putting Aragorn in prime killing rane for Lurtz or the Troops. AR4M helps cycle through the deck faster. Here are the match-ups:<br />
<br><br />
White Arrows/Mirrior decks: NO BUISNESS OF OURS is GOLD!! Sure, it will get trashed by SS, but it stalls enough for you to play some minions and hurt them. Kill Legolas, win the game.<br />
<br><br />
Ranger Decks: Tough match up. Site 8 helps out a lot here. They will almost always have about the same power as you, so pump wisely. You will win if you play smart.<br />
<br><br />
Big Fellowship: They will give you enough twilight to play a few squads of Uruks to inflict some major damage. Use Savagrey to kill off companions. Might not do so well against this type of deck because of the high number of companions. Worry will help out here. They will have everybody skirmish, and you are bound to win some. Good luck here.<br />
<br><br />
As I have said, this is a work in progress. I am hoping to get enought responses to get this thing ready for FoundationCon in Michigan on September 20-22. The site is http://www.foundation-games.com/index.shtml. Any CONSTRUCTIVE comments are welcome, but ones like " Add A Promise", or " This deck sucks" arent welcome. As I have said, I will be getting the rares I need soon. <br />
