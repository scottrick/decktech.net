Can this deck?  I believe so... maybe not win, but I think it can definitely compete.  Why?  Because twilight denial destroys not only Uruk-hai decks, but Nazgul decks as well... Either deck may be able to get out 1 minion a turn if they are lucky before you hit the last rest stop... (2 or 3 Uruks at the Bridge is possible).<br />
<br />
How do you play this deck?<br />
<br />
Early Game (Sites 1-3)<br />
<br />
Bid low (1-3).  If you win, go 1st and pull bilbo, if not, you are still in a good position.  Most decks will try to double move against you because Moria can&#39;t really stop any deck before site 4... try to keep this from happening, but don&#39;t waste minions... play Flankers, a Cave Troll if possible, Guard Commander or Keyward, or even Nertea if you draw him, basically anyone who will survive archery that you don&#39;t mind sitting in the d/c pile that will also win a skirmish... A Flanker with a Moria axe will go a long way towards slowing a fellowship down.  If you won the bid though, stop at 2 and let them pass, that way you can play your site 3... you don&#39;t mind playing from behind with this deck.  Dump conditions and get those scimitars in your d/c pile to free up space for your freeps... <br />
<br />
Mid-game (Sites 4-6)<br />
Swarm time... by clogging their hand with minions, you are essentially weakening their fellowship, so it&#39;s time to swarm like mad... Use sting on your fellowship turns and see if they are carrying swarm protection (i.e. Stealths, PATHS, etc.), if not, maybe you want to try to overwhelm Frodo at first opportunity, or maybe you just want to take out a couple of companions, Gandalf for one should be your first target... As for fellowship, don&#39;t double move unless it&#39;s required to keep up.  Don&#39;t give your opponent any unneccesary opportunity to dump minions on you...  <br />
<br />
Late Game (Sites 7-9)<br />
Shouldn&#39;t come to this, but if it does, you are easily equipped to make it to 9 with all of the boosters and defender +1 bonuses... don&#39;t be afraid to run if you have to.  If you&#39;ve done your job and taken out Gandalf and a couple of companions, it should be easy to finish off the job, you should have 5-10 Minions on Swarms and maybe 15 cards left in your draw deck... should give you ample chance to finish them off, or at the very least stop them at 8 so you can double move for a win.<br />
<br />
A Couple Card Choices<br />
<br />
Lord of Gondor:  Not easily overwhelmed, just in case I get swarmed, he should come out alive... the new premium Boromir could be pretty good for this deck too, hell, even Son of Denethor doesn&#39;t have downside for this deck, Lord of Gondor is just a safer choice.<br />
Sam: Burden decks can kill Frodo and Sam will take the Ring, or Sam can sacrifice himself for the greater good... also Great at the bridge with 1 or 2 stealths... <br />
Uncommon Bilbo: Condition Removal... Sentinals would require too many cards... this makes use of some cards I would use anyways like Banner, Saga, and yes... even Trolls...  I would like to use the Rare Bilbo, but I think condition removal is too important to leave out of a deck... especially when a good Sauron condition deck could take me for a serious ride...<br />
Banner or Valiant Man with Swordarm... good luck overwhelming...<br />
Athelas: Again, more condition removal and healing is nice from time to time...<br />
Shards: Not essential, but nonetheless would be a welcome draw anytime... okay, maybe not at site 8, but you get the point...<br />
Filbert Bolger: You mean cancelling skirmishes is good?<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
Backstabbers:  I think I like these guys a little too much...  who cares about overwhelming anymore, these guys bypass that step completely, let&#39;s just damage the hell out of &#39;em instead...<br />
Guard Commander:  One day people are going to start reading what this guy does...<br />
Scrabblers:  Most underated Moria Minion by far... these guys are huge<br />
Flankers: Work well with Swarms, Moria Axe, everything else, etc.<br />
Goblin Warrior: New Dwarf conditions will hurt, but won&#39;t be that popular...<br />
Ulaire Nertea: A Minion Scaveger, I love this guy... a great late game companion...<br />
Goblin Armory: Is there a better card in the game?  Not anymore...<br />
<br />
Cards I didn&#39;t chose:<br />
Elf Allies:  too many cards...<br />
ARV:  don&#39;t like the thought of exerting Aragorn too much (this is still a great card...)<br />
Host of Thousands:  Should have enough Minions... I hate getting 2 of these off the opening draw... it&#39;s bad enough I draw the Balrog 4 of 5 times... They are coming should get me the minions I need when I need... not to mention swarms should build a hefty little army.<br />
<br />
I see quite a few people using the Balrog sword these days, and I don&#39;t understand why... sure, it&#39;s nice to overwhelm Aragorn even with a brand or sword, but what are the chances you will 1. get it before site 5 and 2. get it late enough that it doesn&#39;t end up clogging your hand?<br />
<br />
This deck should burn if you move one site at a time, try to get power ups out of your hand, although save PATHS if possible... don&#39;t expect more than 20 cards left in your draw deck by site 6... by the same token, you won&#39;t need that bounder until late... so having one should be enough... if you don&#39;t agree, maybe take out Valiant Man or a Swordarm...<br />
