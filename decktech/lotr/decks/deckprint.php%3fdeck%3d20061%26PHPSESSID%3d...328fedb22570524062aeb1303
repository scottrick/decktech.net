This deck is made to play A Ranger&#39;s Versatility as often as possible, and then let your 2-3 points of archery damage kill whatever they played. Against Nazgul they can only play a couple of dudes a turn, so that is no problem for this deck. Against Uruk-hai, early on they will only be able to play a 2 or so guys, so that is also a problem. Site 5 is the tricky site against Uruk-hai because you give them a good bit of twilight, and they no longer have roaming fees, plus it is not a forest or a river (obviously). Survive site 5 and the rest is no problem. Against Moria Orcs just let your normal archery kill a few dudes, unless they play a wallcrawler, then just use Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Legolas&#39; ability. Power According to His Stature also destroys this deck. Against Sauron Orcs, Site 1-5 is relatively easy. Just don&#39;t get carried away with Aragorn&#39;s Bow or Legolas&#39; ability, because the next turn they could just get Hated away. Against this deck I suggest just moving one site a turn, and rely on killing them at your site 9. I play Merry because he is one of the few pump cards that any culture can use. He is incredible. <br />

The minions were chosen on  late game vs. early game situations. The Fighter, Warrior, and Lt. are all pretty decent early on. Late game Lurtz and Troop of Uruk-hai take over. The deck plays Saruman&#39;s Ambition because it can just be thrown onto the table early on to get it out of your hand, plus it makes Spies cheaper, and it obviously has the useful +2 to power ability. Spies of Saruman is for the insane amount of archery decks in my area, so play something else if archery is not that big, but I recomend keeping them in. Savagery to Match Their Numbers is a great card. A lot of times it might just be +2 to strength, but because of archery I think it is still superior to Breed for Battle. Plus on a number of occasions you will find your opponent has 5 companions, and then the card is just incredible, giving your minion +4 to strength and fierce, and the +4 last through both attacks. Thats is almost always 4 wounds from one minion. If you get to play it on Lurtz, he often overwhelms somebody on one of his trips, or at least hurts Aragorn and Boromir, putting them both close to dead. The card is also really good with Troop of Uruk-hai because of the ignore the weapons ability. Troop will almost always win it&#39;s fights.<br />
