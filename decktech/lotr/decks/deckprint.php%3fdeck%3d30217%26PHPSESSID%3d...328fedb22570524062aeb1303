EDIT: deeping wall should be helm&#39;s gate...i think.  whichever site says "hand weapons +2" since there&#39;s no saruman in here.  whatever.  /edit<br />

This deck went 4-2 (losing to AJ Delisle because he went first and to Peter Sundholm because I drew only 1 companion before the massacre at 6), then won the semifinal round against Peter Sundholm, and took a bow from David Kitzman who decided to cut out early and start the long drive home.  The fellowship was developed by my brother and I back in January/February when testing revealed that Fortress Never Fallen wasn&#39;t too good against Moria, so Rohan needed Gandalf...and Aragorn...and Legolas.  But no more cultures than that.  With the exception of the British Columbia TOC and Origins Premier Series, i&#39;ve been playing it all year, tweaking it as needed.  For instance, after earning 4th place at the RadCon PSQ, it was determined that the deck needed Help in Doubt and Need rather than just direct archery, and with that in mind the Elf allies were removed.  After the X-list and Grima CC, the deck was a little less popular, but not for long.  About that time the Betrayals came out for two of the four Defend it and Hopes...anyway, I bet you wanna know how to play it.<br />
<br />
This is mostly a player&#39;s deck.  It has a lot of tools, not all of which you&#39;ll need.  The basic point of the deck is to get Albert Dreary down and a Defend It And Hope in your hand so that you can balloon up to 7-9 companions without fearing Greed (props to Tim McKnight for making me always consider Greed) or Enquea.  After that it comes down to matchups.  Against Moria: the more the merrier, balloon upwards and let your deck naturally defeat it.  it&#39;s what it does best and what it was built to do.  So much so that i dropped the other GST and frying pan.  remember to never put some random wound on merry because in a swarm he needs to be able to take a wound from a random 5 str orc and then pump frodo.  Against Moria/Uruk Archery: Boromir is your savior here, everybody knows that you just load him up and heal him every turn.  Defend it and Hopes are cool, even though they basically turn into an archery wound...but at least you don&#39;t have to fight the guy you just killed.  you have lots of pincushions, especially your rohan allies.  Against Moria/Troll: Arrow Slits the hammer, direct your archery around the chain if you need to, and let Eomer take the beast down.  he won&#39;t always be able to, but remember you have lots of speedbumps (allies, merry, sam, even Gandalf after playing GST).  Against Uruks: Defend it and Hopes, plus archery, plus Uruk Camp generally remove the early threat.  Arrow Slits and DiaH&#39;s generally remove the Spear from the game, but you can get along without mounts rather well with your archery.  Against Nazgul: Eomer plus archery owns Nazgul.  you don&#39;t even need the Thundering Hosts I used to play...Defend it and Hopes are better thanks to self-healing Boromir.  all you have to worry about is BB/BT decks, but i don&#39;t see those much...you have Eowyn anyway.  i do miss flaming brand though...  Against Burden decks: Let them load up Frodo, then pass the ring to Sam.  most decks can&#39;t add 15 burdens in one game.  why people play corruption i&#39;ll never know.  maybe patrick malboeuf does...(congratulations dude! don&#39;t let sullivan and brochu mock you anymore, lol).  Against Dunland: Arrow slits is somewhat useful against clubs, but eventually they&#39;re going to get your possessions from you.  the best you can do is try to kill the I think that about covers it...<br />
<br />
As for the Shadow, if you need to be told how to play it...I hear that Scavenger + Scimitar + Armory x4 is pretty good.  Give yourself enough twilight to play the Cave Troll, then Relics for his toys.  remember that armories add twilight for the hammer but not the chain.  with the stupid over-powered rohan decks running around, make sure you try to get the Troll&#39;s toys as often as humanly possible.  only one enquea because the troll tends to keep fellowships small.  enquea + troll is pretty cool when they&#39;re over 6.  the shadow is designed to stop your opponent so that your fellowship can race ahead (which it&#39;s good at).<br />
<br />
usually bid 1-2, and choose to go first.  I usually mulligan if i don&#39;t get either Help or a DiaH in my starting hand because those are so necessary against uruks at site 2 (against Dauntless Hunter, i pay much more attention to my shadow hand and mulligan if i don&#39;t get at least 3 conditions).  Uruk Camp really helps you there, but only if you go second because i dropped the pathfinders.  i chose to go with the Great Hall over the Caverns o&#39; Aglarond because my fellowship is more important than my shadow...i&#39;d rather be able to chump those allies than drop 3 off the cost of the troll.  Valley of Saruman because my allies are generally useless about that point in the game (except maybe bounder), and i hate seeing treebeard block the troll.<br />
<br />
anyway, i hope you like the deck.  always room for improvement, so let me know what you think should be changed to bring it into line.  thanks for looking.<br />
