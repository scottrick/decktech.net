Strategy: <br />
The FP side is a look at seeing how a straight Dwarven Deck can handle it &#8211; with the new released culture cards from Siege of Gondor.  I must admit I&#8217;m totally fresh to trying a straight dwarven deck &#8211; so please don&#8217;t be too harsh with your reviews on this one, I&#8217;ve only playtested it a little and it seems alright &#8211; although when I play dwarves there seems to be something lacking (just like with a straight elven deck).  The whole idea is simple &#8211; just get out your dwarven cards as quick as possible &#8211; using dark ways + Gimli&#8217;s Axe to make him a machine early in the game.  I&#8217;ve tried to put a little of everything useful as a &#8216;surprise factor&#8217;.  I do think that the new Dwarven cards in SOG definitely give the culture a push in the right direction, other than Gimli and his toy&#8217;s not much else in this culture seems to see play.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Now the SH side is a look at the new Nazgul and their Enduring Ability.  I&#8217;ve tried to take as much from SOG as I could to make this work and believe me &#8211; these new wraiths are painful.  It would even be adviseable to try a blend of nazgul with their new orcs, thus gaining enduring bonuses from the archery wounds BUT I&#8217;ve got a <Ringwraith> culture orc deck in mind without much aid from their Nazgul counterparts that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t want to add them in this deck idea.  But these bad boys can definitely deal enough wounds for them to hang around long enough for the enduring effects.  I&#8217;m trying a few new Winged Mounts seeing as there are now 2 underground sites which will detract from the use of Black Steed&#8217;s.  Between Nazgul and Prey + Beyond all Darkness are very nasty new events &#8211;and them also being rare means they&#8217;ll be quite sought after out of this expansion.  Obvious addition&#8217;s from older sets like enquea, cantea and gates simply round the deck off nicely.<br />
<br />
Other Notes (O/T):  Sorry to tag this onto the end of my deck BUT due to a hacker we lost our original decktech site.  Now I don&#8217;t have all of the contact&#8217;s for each person who was a member of our old site, but I do know that a few of you were subscribed to my posts so hopefully you read this message and pass the new link on. <br />
We&#8217;ve started our new site here:<br />
http://www.decktech.net/groups/h.php?g=541<br />
And we&#8217;re trying to make it more of an Australian/New Zealand (Downunder) site rather than just a QLD site like it used to be &#8211; so even if your reading this and weren&#8217;t already a member of the old site please consider joining the new one, everyone&#8217;s welcome (no matter where in the world your from) and feel free to come along and talk about any Tolkien related game/topic not just the TCG.  A great place to advertise up and coming events and your have/want lists etc&#8230;..  Once again I&#8217;m sorry for plugging this here, but it honestly was the only way for me to reach a lot of our old crowd.  Have fun.<br />
