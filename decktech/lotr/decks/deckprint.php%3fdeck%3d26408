(You don&#39;t want to find yourself too burdened at the beginning facing Easterlings or Nazgul- you can remove burdens later with Sam or as you play RB Rangers).  Your site one punishes most current strategies, where people are trying to get 4-5 companions out right away.  You should be able to make it to site 3-4 without any additional companions, depending on opponent&#39;s shadow culture(s).  Use the Shards of Narsil to stash Gondor companions until you need them later on.  You can keep your opponent&#39;s minions roaming for a long time, buffing the RoI&#39;s and Faramir, with Gondorian Rangers.  <br />
<br />
The cheap conditions and Shards of Narsil allow you to cycle your hand quite rapidly, so the large deck size makes no difference.  I nearly ran dry on two occasions.  You can stack the Shards of Narsil on the Shards of Narsil when you get another, or use it to discard to Boromir, my Brother.  Gondor Bowmen are good to lay down as a threat, and pick off all the bad guys to allow for a double move.  If you can get No Stranger going on early, there is quite a choke element that really hurts Raiders and even Isengard.  <br />
<br />
It is very important to pay attention to all of your options, as little mistakes/forgotten actions are what can cost you the game with this deck.  Make sure that you remove burdens when you play ring-bound companions.  Use the Citadel when you can.  The unique Gondor conditions have double uses, and should be remembered.  <br />
<br />
The shadow side is based on playing lots of cheap trackers, and trying to keep them around for the fierce skirmish.  Grima wrecks Rohan with Leechcraft and Many Riddles.  Grima counts all cards, not just Free Peoples to activate, but only the Free Peoples cards return to hand.  This leaves a buffed Eomer, Legolas, Aragorn, or Gandalf naked and ready for Uruk Savagery...  It seems like no one has figured out Unferth around here, but he is stone cold brutal.  Very often you will find yourself assigning him to double up on someone as the FP doesn&#39;t want to exert.  This works good to help keep cheap trackers around for the fierce skirmish.  Also gets another bit of misery out of Grima.  <br />
<br />
One of the keys to this deck is to try to add a few burdens with Worry.  If you get beaten to site nine, there is nothing like pulling out your nastiest minions from the discard pile with Palantir Chamber.  I even let smaller parties jump site 8, laying down one minion and acting scared, like I don&#39;t have any more in hand.  When they rush on to nine with a huge twilight pool, I drop a glut of little trackers, fish out Ugluk and Lurtz, then use the Palantir to empty their hand of bufeasterlinge.<br />
<br />
This is still a very rough version of this general idea, and the meta will undoubtedly change it, but it seems to be unstoppable, and is undefeated through 8 or 9 games.  Please comment/criticize.<br />
