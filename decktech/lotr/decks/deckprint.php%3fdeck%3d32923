It will be very hard to win with this deck but here is a little strategy.<br />
<br />
FREE PEOPLE<br />
After Treebeard was played, you can run and choke with Talent and Deft in Their Movement. Bid enough to start and play Here is Good Rock from your draw deck and stack all the those me on it. Gimli will be a big beast (like the Wolf). If you are overwounded, discard the Unbound Hobbits or Heal them with Farmer Maggot. <br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
Only 16 Minions in the Deck, it will be really hard. Try to get 4 minions during the regroup phase and play Fire and Foul Fumes. The Balrog is a beast and he can discard every ranged weapon. He is the key minion of the deck so try to kill some companions with him. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
