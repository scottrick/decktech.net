Thas That!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Alright, so heres what I think is a good post ROTK Standard deck. It&#39;s roughly based on a combination of an old deck tha Chris Tubman and I talked about, but only he had the guts to play. It&#39;s also influenced by the deck P. Malbeouf won DPC T.O. with and lastly by a deck posted by Steve Miller called The Sweet. How could I resist?<br />
<br />
That all being said, it&#39;s a fighting/wounding/running choke deck. <br />
<br />
The trick with a choke deck is always surviving the first move in good enough shape and with few enough minions alive to double. The second move is often the easiest, as the pool is less (since they spent it) and the opponent is sad. yes, sad.<br />
<br />
I called the deck Lotion because Smeagol looks like a friggin&#39; Serial Killer.<br />
<br />
It Rubs the Lotion on it&#39;s skin, precious, or else it gets the hose again!<br />
<br />
The fellowship uses direct damage in the form of Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Faramir&#39;s Bow, Bowmen, Cliffs and PATHS to kill what it can. Smeagol is usually the big minion killa, as he assigns himself to a fatty then uses DLAT to off, which is usually unpreventable.<br />
<br />
The Free Peoples also has really large Ringbearers, and a Sam that will NEVER be exhausted, which has often been the weakness of Promise Decks. <br />
<br />
Having 4 Ringbound companions able to skirmish rather well makes this deck insanely strong against Easterlings, which is a shadow I have lately been terrified of. It&#39;s easy for them to get those first 2 burdens, but after that they get 4 more. One for each Polearm :)<br />
<br />
The Shadow is nice. It gets stops ALL GAME LONG by making sure that whatever you play is exactly what is needed to stop their Shadow. Cantea combines with Gollum to strip 2 possession minimum almost every time he shows up, which makes Rohan a less daunting issue. I know Swordthain can get them back, but I honestly am not all that worried about him. Maybe I should be.<br />
<br />
The Witch King can arrive every time geared up like you need him. Are they playing wounds? Fetch ABP and watch him wreck. Choke? Get back Morgul Gates or a cheap Nazgul. Large fellowship? No deck likes to see Enquea 6 times, much less the new Cantea. <br />
<br />
Don&#39;t be fooled into keeping threats around, threats are a tool here that you should use. Just because it looks like you&#39;re going to kill someone don&#39;t leave threats, use them to kill possession or fetch a Pale Blade. You&#39;ll get more, I promise :)<br />
<br />
I know this isn&#39;t as good as my usual strategy sections, but I think mostly it&#39;s elf-explanatory. If you&#39;ve got comments or questions, D-Mail me or post them in the reviews and I&#39;ll get back to ya. <br />
