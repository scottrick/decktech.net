Site selection:<br />
<br><br />
East Road - cuz I never play a guy my first turn, so it can only punish my opponent. plus I rarely go first with this deck..<br />
<br><br />
Marshes - pain in the rear for hobbit decks, why not..<br />
<br>Waterfall - lets me get from sanctuary to sanctuary without pause..<br />
<br>Stairway - underground, low shadow..<br />
<br>Bridge - well it was a real tough call, but in the end I thought the Bridge best fit this deck..<br />
<br>Dimrill Dale - so I can drop the Keyward for 1, I guess.<br />
<br>S. Banks - if my Aragorn is dead when I get here, I may as well give up anyway.<br />
<br>A. Banks - wanna play 9 companions? take 10 damage then..<br />
<br>Summit - dont plan to have too many burdens, plus 8 shadow instead of 9<br />
<br><br />
OK thats that, now here&#39;s the gameplan with this deck:<br />
<br><br />
Bid 2. Or 1. Usually 2 though, cuz you wanna go second and if ya just bid one your opposition may sniff something suspicious. Reason you wanna go first being that ya wanna get your site 3 out. Chances are pretty good that your opponent will do the 1-3 skip and you&#39;ll get it out easy. But if he pauses at 2 then you do the same. First few sites are standard, throw out as much shadow as you can to cycle and find Boromir and all your weapons.<br />
<br><br />
So, whether it takes you two turns or one, you&#39;ll reach site 3 and your opponent will go. Slow him down as he travels through the mines with your Moria garbage. I know my shadow looks like every other Moria shadow but that&#39;s just cuz it&#39;s that gosh darnit good. Most noticeable omission is They Are Coming, I prefer extra Hosts for this deck.<br />
<br><br />
While your opponent is getting clobbered in the Mines you will skip from site 3 to site 6 using the site 3 text. This is big, because you wont fall into the usual skip to site 5, then stop at 6 to heal. In essence you&#39;re saving yourself two turns. Use Aragorn the machine along with your extensive arsenal of support cards to plug your way through the mines. You shouldn&#39;t have much trouble against any shadow except Moria, as you do not give up much twilight and your fellowship is pretty tough. Against another Moria deck you&#39;ll have to use as many support cards as possible, once you make it out of the mines you&#39;ll be in better shape.<br />
<br><br />
So you take the lead doing the sanctuary-to-sanctuary skip, then continue hammering your opponent in the mines. Try your best to skip from 6 to 8 (leaving your opponent in the dust back at site 5 or 6), then gear up for a big battle on turn 4 at site 9. Survive that and win.<br />
<br><br />
Card choices:<br />
<br><br />
UC Boromir - turns Frodo into a fighter. Ya gotta have Frodo in your deck one way or the other, may as well get some power out of him. Combined with other cards like Dagger Strike and PATHS and Sting, little Frodo can get pretty beefy.<br />
<br><br />
Elendil&#39;s Valor - this card is for emergency use only. save it as long as you can, except against Moria decks where you will probably use it in the Mines.<br />
<br><br />
Pathfinder - a little extraneous maybe, and could be a Thror&#39;s Map, but I doubt I would use it more than once and I don&#39;t own a Map, so ha!<br />
<br><br />
Bounder - we all know what this guy does<br />
<br><br />
Aragorn&#39;s Bow - if you draw it, great. if you don&#39;t, great. It&#39;s certainly a worthy card, but by no means necessary. The combos it makes with ARV, PATHS, Dagger Strike, etc can be really good for sure.<br />
<br><br />
Gondor&#39;s Vengeance - this is the card that lets you move three sites at a time. Sure, the Waterfall actually extends the move limit. But THIS card kills the Cave Troll when you want to move from 5 to 6.<br />
<br><br />
Coat of Mail - Make Aragorn even crazier, and give Boromir his game text back.<br />
<br><br />
Troll x4 - cuz stopping your opponent is best done in the mines. and the Troll is the best card in the game.<br />
<br><br />
Keyward - second best card in the game<br />
<br><br />
all the other Moria jerks - you know how it works. play a Runner for one, get two. Play a Scout for two, get two. Play Host for Scavenger from discard pile, he pulls Scimitar from discard pile, 3 Armories means you add 3 and draw a card for the Scimitar. Yadda yadda, I dont think I have to explain this<br />
<br><br />
As for Boromir...<br />
<br><br />
Knock the UC version all you want, it&#39;s better ... for this deck at least. Turning Frodo into a fighter is really attractive. Not being a ranger isn&#39;t too hard to deal with when you start Aragorn. And the built-in Coat of Mail is easily replaced. And having all 4 copies brings him out by site 3, and keeps him healthy so he can continue beefing Frodo up.<br />
<br><br />
So there&#39;s the newbie deck. If I screwed up any rules or cards or whatever, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll hear about it. Enjoy!<br />
