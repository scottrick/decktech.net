What Did You Discover?<br />

The Fellowship side is pretty straightforward. Brego goes on Aragorn, who can then remove Rohan tokens to whack minions in the regroup phase. I don&#39;t usually have to use him, since Eomer & Co. can kill almost everything, so if I play Open I&#39;d probably switch him for Heir to the White City. <br />
This is a Standard deck, by the way. <br />
Frying Pan takes care of Moria, with Frodo&#39;s 6 vitality. PATHS and Cliffs for additional help. The one problem with this deck is you MUST pull Aragorn at site 1, so you need to bid high. Sam removes burdens when you draw him. <br />
Eowyn is Enqeau protection, for bidding high and since you run 6 companions. Hrethel is great because you&#39;re basically a 11 strength with his horse and spear. <br />
For the shadow, it&#39;s awesome. Often, at site two, if you can play an Ugluk with his sword, you can get out 3 fierce minions on whatever little Fellowship he has out. With your site 5, swarming is an option. Ugluk is (with his sword) a 15 strength damage +1 fierce minion, better than Lurtz, and he lets you play non-roaming trackers. Weary boosts your Searchers and gets wounds on people, and then you finish them off. <br />
I haven&#39;t included either Grima, because this is a Standard deck. I&#39;ve played about 20 games (winning 19) and never even had the chance to use them, so finally I dropped them. However, in Open I&#39;d add Grimas (Wormtongue and CC) as well as maybe 2 Saruman&#39;s Power.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
