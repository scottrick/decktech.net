Usually I bid low (two or less), since many people start with the same site one as this deck, and you should not be concerned if your opponent goes first (in the end it usually doesn&#39;t matter). Obviously, if you get to go first, pull Aragorn and run to site 3, then sandbag from there. If your oppenent runs ahead, even better. Now on to more specific things...<br />
<br />
Free People<br />
Gandalf is the man in this deck, and his support cards are the key to this deck. Servant of the Secret Fire and Sleep stop big minions and any Shadow condition that may hinder your path. Albert Dreary stops Spies and Snows, and Ottar can unlock a bad hand. Obviously Barliman is in this deck to retrieve Servant when neccessary. ARV can be key at certain points in the game ( I do not think this needs explaining any further). <br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
The combination of Sauron Orcs, and their ability to add burdens to Frodo with Desperate Defense and Thin and Stretched, are simply lethal in most games. Because of this, Enquea is an excellent support character in this deck and can &quot;hit&quot; up to three characters if there are more than 6 burdens (which happens often). Enduring evil can render even a pumped up Aragorn or Boromir useless. The 3 trackers (Scouting Band) are cheap cards early, but really shine at site 9, especially if your opponent runs to give you additional twilight to play with. The ability to get then out of your lost pile makes them essential to the Orc strategy, plus you can exert them to wound someone they are skirmishing. The other characters are either really big (Band, Hunter, Warden) or have excellent abilities (Inquisitor). Overall, a case could be made that Sauron Orcs are the best minion in the game, with the only drawback being their late home site.<br />
<br />
This deck has worked extremely well for me in the last two tournaments I have played in, going 7-3 over that span (One of those losses was self inflicted). I hope it works as well for you as it has for me.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
