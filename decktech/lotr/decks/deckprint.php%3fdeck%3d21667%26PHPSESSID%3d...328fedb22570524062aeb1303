&#8220;Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard&#8217;s side, so pager was he to come to Moria&#8221;, the text of the heroe of this deck. Gimli lets works along with  the shadow side of this deck (moria-uruk) and kills with a final deathblow in the final sites. DRAW, DRAW UNTIL THE ENEMY WITHDRAWS !!<br />
<br />
<br />
An the nominees are&#8230;<br />
- Gimli, the best: you can put up to 2 cards from your hand under the deck. Of course with able guide at end of your you will be able to eradicate those 4 tokens. BUT DON&#8217;T BE AFRAID OF GETTING VERY HIT; you have aragorns versatility to kick those orc butts.<br />
Of course Gimli is not going to do all the dirty work all by himself, Elrond the good Elf is going to help out too, but he &#8230; is another nomineeeeee:<br />
<br />
- Elrond, AKA Agent Spike-Ears: All right, we know Elrond is one of the best cardsin this game and used with dwarves and shoulder to shoulder&#8230;. He gets really insane. (those 3000 years of wait &#8230; haven&#8217;t been in vain for him) We exert him 3 times to draw 3 cards. We use shoulder to shoulder to now exert a dwarf (thrarin or grimir&#8230; OR BOTH) to heal Elrond. If we have an athelas we might even we able to exert our little Gimli to draw some more next turn. Elrond (since he is a good elf) will heal every turn his dwarf friends (home site 3) in exchange for their exertion earlier. Finally if we draw one of our two tale of gil galads, put it right away in Elrond to get&#8230; ANOTHER DRAW. In no time with you gimli there you will have consumed almost you whole draw deck an gotten the most needed cards for last sites (like versatility)<br />
<br />
- Threat of the unknown: Ever thought this card would have been useful ? well let me tell you it is !! with Gimli constantly putting our little moria orcs, uruk hais and the snows under our deck by site 7 or 8 we will have ONLY minions in our draw deck. Now we play an orc we had and exert to draw two more cards. These cards can be played right away, also during your same shadow phase, so , by now you should have at least 3 copies of this card in hand. They won&#8217;t cost a thing and you will be able to play two more orcs or the snows.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2 ways to kill:<br />
<br />
1.- Direct damage: Very used lately. It has been proven that Aragorn and Legolas by themselves can go through site 9 all by themselves (hm&#8230;. A versatily push maybe&#8230; just a lil&#8217; =)) With their direct damage you won&#8217;t have to bother to skirmish a witch king or a cave troll. (can&#8217;t wait for the Balrog). Athelas can be used to eradicate a condition or to heal an ill Legolas or to heal Gimli to draw some more with Elrond. Of course power according to his stature will lighten the way for the next site if you wanted to advance against a nazgul deck, for example.<br />
<br />
2.- Uruk-Moria: with the help of my dear Elrond an threat of the unknown, we will draw like crazy and Gimli will get all those Orcs in the bottom of our deck for a very welcome timed-bomb which can include maaaaany many orcs. At least 8 of your hand and maybe 2 more with another threat o. t. u.<br />
I put only cheap orcs, in order to play more of them in the blow. Remember to play the goblin runners and scouts first to add some twilight. If you hadn&#8217;t anything to play in one of your shadow phases BUT you have a scimitar throw it for your scavengers.<br />
<br />
<br />
My Conclusion:<br />
This is a draw deck. But not that exaggerated in the way of drawing because we use also the Direct Damage and the aggressiveness of the versatility.<br />
If you use wisely the should to shoulder, manage you wounds properly, heal properly and draw with care; YOU CANNOT LOSE. <br />
10 of 10 games wined. Against choke, against direct damage, against Mahatma Gandaleasterlingainst those nail-hater uruks.<br />
<br />
