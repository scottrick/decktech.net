First i will start with the adventure deck. Site one usually gets the most questions asked so i will start with it. The Pony has a duel purpose in my deck. It is there to tempt my opponent into playing Aragorn from their reserve deck if they can because it adds a burden which is useful with enduring evil and it also will increase the shadow pool for the roaming cost of my minions. Sites 2 and 3 are there to increase my possible movement so i can (with a little luck get to site 5 on turn one).<br>
Site 4 is there for the low shadow number because i plan to play on my own site with the pathfinders anf Thror&#39;s map and it keeps my fellowship above ground as long as possible. Site 6 is there because it is a forest for versatility. site 7 really punishes my opponent if they do not have a ranger and site 8 is there to discard any unneccesary cards to heal characters before moving to site nine. My site 9 is there for two reasons, first it is a river for versatility and I do not want my opponent drawing extra minions with the summit. Now to the Free people cards. As stated earlier the pathfinders and Thror&#39;s map are there to allow myself to play on my own site path. Athelas is there<br>
to heal Frodo and Aragorn or to remove annoying conditions while Aragorn can heal one of the other rangers when not at a sanctuary. Gondor&#39;s vengeance is there to remove huge minions (trolls and Witch Kings for example) and the armor helps Aragorn and Boromir survive those damage +1 characters. The best card by far in this deck is the No Stranger to the Shadows. They reduce the pool enough to make moving twice a turn possible and fairly easy. As for the Shadow deck the orcs are there to use their skirmish abilities to add wounds and , along with Under the Watching eye force your opponent to exert everytime they move. Thin and Stretched causes Frodo to battle or take a burden.<br>
Combine this with Desperate defense of the ring and Frodo gets a burden every turn or your opponent has to discard 3 cards. These cards cause your opponent to slow down their fellowship because they almost always have to take several wounds due to skirmish abilities and Under the Watching eye. The Hate is their to remove any exhausted character and the enduring evils are huge especially if they bid lots of burdens. With thin and stretched you can remove a powerhouse character with a well time enduring evil. This alone can cause a huge slow down in your opponents fellowship. This deck has won its share of matches and has only lost to Frodo being overwhelmed usually at site nine.<br>
By keeping the shadow pool low with No stranger and using Sauron&#39;s orcs to slow down the opposition this deck can and will be very competitive. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
