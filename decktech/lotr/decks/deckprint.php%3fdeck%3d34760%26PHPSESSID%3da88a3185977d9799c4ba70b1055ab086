I&#39;ve noticed that today&#39;s standard format decks lack protection from swarm, so I tried to build a swarm deck, so I turned back to Moria (or rather the new Orc culture) to swarm and Isengard (the new Uruk culture) for support.<br />
So, this is a Shadow kill deck. As with every shadow kill deck, FP and Shadow side have to work in sinergy towards the goal, which is Shadow kill. That means that FP side must be dedicated to setting up the Shadow hand, plus it should survive long enough for the shadow side to do its job. So I chose Dwarves, as they are the best in card drawing (thanks to No Pauses, No Spills, which draws 4 cards) and in cycling (thanks to Stalwart support, as each dwarf gains muster). Smeagol is added for pathfinding (Follow smeagol) and emergency dealing with minions (Don&#39;t Look at Them). Blood Runs Chill represents condition and possession removal, and is effective in combination with Proud and Able, which also boosts Gimli&#39;s resistance. With a fellowship like this it&#39;s not difficult to set up an ideal Shadow hand.<br />
In order to set up the swarm, Shadow side, in addition to minions, needs twilight generation and hand extension. Orc culture is very efficient in twilight generation, thanks to the condition Demoralized. Rallying orc and Cave Troll&#39;s hammer are the key to exerting the FP companions, which turns to twilight tokens thanks to the condition Demoralized. It is imperative to draw and play your copies of Demoralized early and protect them (by taking them back with Orcish Smiths if they are discarded). Troll&#39;s Keyward also should add some twilight. Goblin Hordes provide hand extension by taking the minions from the discard pile, giving the liberty to play or discard some minions early in search of the perfect hand. But, as Goblin Hordes is a condition and can be discarded (and there are not enough Orkish Smiths to protect both Demoralized and Goblin Hordes), and their hand extension may not be enough against a large fellowship, like a nine companion Rohan with Merry. Here&#39;s where the Uruk-hai support comes in, via Determined Uruk, which says: &quot;To play spot an Uruk minion. Each time a companion exerts, you may draw a card.&quot;. Given the number of exertions the lurkers give, Determined Uruk provides a huge hand extension, especially if there is more than one in play. The only downside is that it requires spotting another Uruk, so I put in Vigilant Uruk, because it&#39;s the cheapest Uruk lurker available (and hence can be spotted by Cave Troll&#39;s Hammer for an additional exertion).<br />
This deck is an auto win against any 6+ companion fellowship against any deck low on condition removal, and against any deck which gives a moderate amount of twilight. Against small choking fellowships, it takes some calculation, mustering and patience before bombing away on Expanding Marshland.<br />
The deck requires some playtesting and minor changes to find the right mix and to adapt to the metagame, but overall I think my Orc army and their Uruk-hai helpers can confidently say &quot;No Passaran&quot; to any fellowship unfortunate enough to enter Moria. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
