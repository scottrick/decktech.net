 <br />
The goal of this deck is for entertainment.<br />
This deck can be played in Open and in LotR On-Line Open formats.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: as more marshes become available in Bloodlines, those can be added to the Adventure Deck.  The current non-marsh sites are chosen due to current meta, and how it affects this fellowship and my minions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bid two burdens; a burden will be added to play Smeagol in starting fellowship, one burden removed by Pippin.  This is to ensure my fellowship goes first, and sets up a situation where my  felloship can control the site path. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of burden removal in the deck, as Smeagol quickly develops a situation where Frodo could be corrupted, and the fun is over.  <br />
As far as I am concerned, Smeagol must survive at all costs if my fellowship is going to have a chance to control the site path to set up the Foul shadow side.  In my opinion (in terms of Smeagol in the Felloship), Slinker is the best choice to survive. <br />
Winning skirmishes is only important to remove burdens.  Reaching site nine for the win is highly unlikely with this fellowship and is not the goal. <br />
<br />
The goal is to set up a situation where my opponent has to travel through marsh as much as possible, and face foul tentacles.  The deck is immensly fun to play with, as the Foul Tentacles create a situation (at least 2x a game) that results in my opponents facing a number of tentacles and a Watcher.  The Goblin Runners create twilight, which is essential (they get discarded by Watcher, so play them first or twilight generation won&#39;t work).  After my opponent faces two assaults by tentacles my opponent has a cake-walk to site 9.  The Gollum Shadow cards, events, and HOst of Moria are included to support the Foul Tentacle scenarios.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Dark Places does not work to replace sites on the adventure path outside of Fellowship adventure paths.  <br />
Once again, site control is key.  There are many cards that manipulate the site path and any of those could be used to enhance the site path and goal of this deck.<br />
