If they bidded more than you, great easier corruption, if you then you start.<br />
<br /><br />
When you start, you remove the burden with Pippin and you go get Farmer Maggot. With Eowyin vailant, you can play Simbelmyne.<br />
<br /><br />
You try to keep Pippin if they play orc because you put a Frying Pan on him (after putting one on Frodo)<br />
<br /><br />
Before reaching 6 companions or more than 3 possessions on a companions, go get Merry&#39;s Sword so you can prevent Grima or Enquea or...<br />
<br /><br />
Armor are really usefull because of new southron&#39;s wounding event and D+1.<br />
<br /><br />
Bow are really usefull because you know that Dunland is the fear of Rohan and also, if he can get out a dunno... 30 strength, D+1, Fierce 4 vitality minion, just do Merry&#39;s Sword ability and then Rohirrim Bow him to kill that fat guy.<br />
<br /><br />
After that, there isen&#39;t many start, just run when you can, the FP is strong enougth to double move.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
For the shadow, it&#39;s all about adding burden and killing everybody with Enquea. <br />
<br /><br />
can be really goo to win skirmish, and even overwhelm.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Site 5 add 2 burden or discard your hand, that&#39;s realy helpfull.<br />
<br /><br />
Site 9 you pull Enquea out, kill companions and add more burden to finish him :) I like that idea :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
P.S: Nelya is there to be able to play it Wants to be Found since I need a Twiligth nazgul to play it. And because Nelya eary is as beast (Site 2). Footman is not there because I can get to 2 burden really easly and after that he would become useless.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Even if they got burden removal, they will need Sam SoH, 4 Brace of Courney, Gandalf&#39;s Pipe, ... to be able to counter my deck... and they would have to play a Ring-Bound deck.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Easterling can add 8... let say they add 2 in a game<br />
<br /><br />
It Wants to Be Found add 4 for sure<br />
<br /><br />
Gollum, I can pull him 7 time and with the condition he can add 14 burdens, let say he add 6 in a game<br />
<br /><br />
Site 5, it&#39;s a hard choice, many time they got some stuff that they really want to keep. But let say they discard their hand.<br />
<br /><br />
So that make 12 burdens. Even if they pull out Sam, play 4 Brace of Courney??? that will do -7 so still 5 burdens. Enquea can easly kill their fellowship. Enquea will kill Ring-Bounf guys first, like Faramir and the if the really play Gandalf&#39;s Pipe, he will kill him, and then what&#39;s left.... Frodo alone, agaisnt Nelya, Gollum, Ferney and Enquea.. mabye some easterling can join the party too.<br />
<br /><br />
Oh! I forgot that he has to bid 0 too, so then, you can start and just go to 9.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
So far, againt Dauntless I had no problem, it was even more easier then other deck. Nelya and Enquea make a hard time for the undound hobbits, they usually low in strength so don&#39;t win skirmish and Golum and easly add burden. The easterling only need to be assigned to done their work so after that I don&#39;t care if the hobbits cancel the skirmish or are discarted. And then with Enquea I just kil Legolas easly and it&#39;s done for their FP side.<br />
