Strategy:<br />
<br />
Freepeoples<br />
The Idea is to get Gandalf out as quickly as possible and get him and Gimli suited up with their weapons. Then use Servants and <!--249-->Axe Strike to help them when they need it. They are damage+ 1 or 2, so they can hopefully get kill the minions they face and double.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Wound people as much as possible. It doesn&#39;t matter if you when skirmishes or not, just put out the wounds whenever possible. <br />
<br />
Individual Cards<br />
<br />
Glorfindel- A 9 strength companion at site 2 and an elf for Gandalf.<br />
<br />
<!--45-->Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe- I think that its abilty to wound an orc is good (and I don&#39;t have others).<br />
<br />
Faramir- Helps with Easterlings and Ninja Gollum. If I am not playing against a swarm, I will play him instead of Aragorn to stay within the 5 companion limit that Enquea enforces.<br />
<br />
Ring of Retribution- Strength and Vitality bonus. This helps for exerting with Great Day, Great Hour and my save Gimli from a Red Wrath death.<br />
<br />
Elrond and Vilya- Only healing this deck has other than extra copies of Gandalf. Also can help with Conditions if in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Dead Marshes- If you are playing against a possible Blood Runs Chill or Gandalf multiple condition removal, don&#39;t play this to the table. Wait until they have removed the conditions and do so. Then they don&#39;t just get rid of it too.<br />
<br />
Orc Insurgent- Helps to cycle and can use <!--140-->Hate.<br />
<br />
Orc Archer Troop- Might actually win a skirmish. Does archery, possibly is fierce and more archery. I like this card.<br />
<br />
Orc Cutthroat- Can deal wounds and is good for roaming.<br />
<br />
<!--319-->Orc Ambusher- I chose this over the iniative orcs because I think that one less twilight is better than one less site number.<br />
<br />
Terrible As the Dawn- To many Galadriels.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help and suggestions you can give me. <br />
