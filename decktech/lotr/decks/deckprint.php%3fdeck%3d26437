 Gandalf&#39; his friends and Uruk-Hai by Bart&#322;omiej Kozak    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Strategy :<br />

 I ussualy bid 2 to go second, my sites are very useful. On site two I&#39;m able to stop my opponent from moving again thanks to huge twilight poll [ at about 4( Aragorn or other stuff ) +3( Site ) + 4( Fellowsip members ) = 11 ] that is 2 uruks ( Two skirmishes is +2 twilight<br />
 tokens ! ). If he goes again, he must face two uruks and I may have enough twilight tokens to play another uruk or two. Now if I can play Aragorn from my deck, I do. I also play Gandalf if I have one ( Chance of having him in first draw is at about 45 % ), and all stuff I have in my hand. Unless I know what is my opponent holding I never move again this turn, it is just to dangerous. My third site is neutral. I was long thinking abous a site that gives me one twilight token but all those sites aren&#39;t good for me, so<br />
 I have chosen less evil. Site four is simply the best! Battlegrond, Sahadow number 3 and it <br />
 gives me additional tokens if my opponent is using horses. Now site five... Battleground, Shadow number 6 and first uruk for -3! Thanks to Uruk Regular it is possible to play 5 to 6 Uruk-Hai and  even Saruman! Now it is important to estimate one thing... Can I easily kill him? If the answear is Yes I&#39;m moving slowly one site each turn. But if it failed.. I&#39;m trying to make double move 4-6 at all cost. Then trying to go to the site 9 before my opponent. Now about cards I&#39;m using... Why this Ring? It allows me to put it on everytime I want and It&#39;s giving Frodo +1 Strenght all the time. I&#39;m using this Aragorn becouse of his Signet ( Which works well with  Trust Me as You Once Did ) and Defender +1 ability ( wich don&#39;t need  any exertion ), besides I don&#39;t need Rangers. Gandalf x4 becouse I will often exert him ( and that is additional healing ). Now the best thing... Bow of the Galadhrim! Best direct damage I  have ever seen. I can take two minions on Aragorn, one on Legolas<br />
 and if he wins ( And that is not hard ) he can wound a minion  skirmishing Aragorn ( Killing is the best ) and thanks to that  letting Aragorn win! With his Knives, Legolas is Moria killer and when Gimli gets his Axe, Moria have no chances. Aragorn is good anti Uruk and anti Nazgul fighter ( max Strenght of 13 ). Some weapons for Frodo ( Sing against everything and Frying Pan against Moria ), Gandalf ( Glamdring witch makes him Strenght 12 and Damage +1 ). Gandalf&#39;s Staff gives him one additional vitality point. Four times Servant of the Secret Fire does not need comment, as well as two Sleep Caradhras and Trust Me sa You Once Did. Now Shadow... 8 pump&#39;s up and 2 Saruman&#39;s Power are all my events. That leaves me with 20 minion slots. I have chosen to play a lot of cheap Uruks, some more powerful ( Troop of Uruk-Hai and Lurtz ). Thank&#39;s to that ( With a little help of Uruk Regular ) I can play<br />
 a lot of Uruks. At the beggining I was using 3 Sarumans but I have noticed tht I was&#39;nt playing them. So I cut them to two [ One for site 5 and the ther one ( Wich can be played from lost pile ) for site 9 ]. One Enquea is here for a little control companions number.<br />
 Let me have you an example of my shadow deck possibilites: Site 5 and 11 twilight tokens.. I play 2x Uruk Regular, Uruk Captian, 2x Uruk Liutenant ( The second one for Regular exert ), Then I exert Captian, remove 1 and play Troop of Uruk-Hai ( Again for Regular exert).<br />
 That is 6 uruks for just 11 tokens! And one more thing. None of my companions ever bears 3 cards so they have Grima immunity!<br />
 Sorry for my weak English and mistakes ( I hope You understand it...)<br />
  Enjoy your play!! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
