<br>
Before I explain any more I want to note that this deck is very flexible in how it is played. Its kind oeasterlingame by game basis.<br>
<br>
I most games, your shadow side won&#39;t serve much more purpose than getting cards from the top of your deck and into your hand. Play lots. Play fast. The only time you should consistantly save up shadow cards is saving a select minion or equivalent for site five. The Balrog is fun on the table, not in your hand. The structure of the shadow side is aimed mostly at swarming while throwing out a few larger minions every once and a while to make your opponent think about moving twice. If you see an opportunity to inflict heavy damage, it can be worth it to save cards. Backstabbers become quite fun when you grosly outnumber the opponent.<br>
<br>
For the Free Peoples turn, There are two main ways I like to progress. In either case you should bid to go first, usually 3-4. The first idea is to all out run and beat the opponent to site 9 by being so far ahead of him that he doesn&#39;t have a chance. This can work if 1) you have an ungodly first hand and/or 2) your opponent is very vulnerable to either choking, archery, or both. <br>
<br>
The second way that requires more thought but is overall the safer way, is to follow right behind your opponent through most of the sites. You should do this if 1) your opponent double moves in front of you early and/or 2) you have a bad hand early. How you follow your opponent is interesting. Try to keep within 1 site of him. Sounds simple, but is sometimes harder than it looks. Don&#39;t move in front of him untill he reaches site 8. The idea is that both players have been moving identicaly, and have ended up both on site seven. Your opponent moves to site 8, your site 8. Your site 8 prevents him from running to site 9 if you spot 5 orcs, which isn&#39;t too hard, especialy if you saved orcs on site 7. Great show stopper site for tripple move decks. Then, (assuming your opponent isnt also playing orcs, in which case you should try the all out run because they are vulnerable to archers) you can merrily skip to ste 9. <br>
<br>
A word on individual turns. Early game, you won&#39;t have incredibly much, but neither should your opponent. For those times when he does have something, however, use a gondor Bowmen. If your opponent is decreasing your archery total, try to secret sentinals the evil card. Occasionaly, you will have to give the opponent quite a bit of twilight to get cards out of your hand. Be sure your archery and companions are ready to take on a massive amount of people BEFORE you play the cards. Otherwise, play them out little by little. Its only polite to give your opponent false hope every once and a while.<br>
<br>
Card choices:<br>
<br>
Merry, friend to sam- This guy is fun. He helps with Talent for not being seen and keeps your archers from being overwhelmed. Also good with hobbit stealth and cannon fodder.<br>
<br>
Dinendal- For twilight removal during a double move.<br>
<br>
Galadrial - Heals an elf. ANY elf. good targets are Legolas, Elrond, and Dinendal.<br>
<br>
Haldir - Another archer, cannon foder.<br>
<br>
Plundered Armories - Keep playing scimitars as you minions die to keep drawing cards.<br>
<br>
They are Coming(TAC)- Good to get doubles and other useless cards out of your hand.<br>
