Real quick, for those who are rules-challenged:  You can play Too Great and Terrible even if Gandalf is not in play.  The requirement to play the card is spotting a Nazgul.  The effect is to wound Gandalf (if he happens to be in play).  If not, you&#39;ve just cycled a card rather quickly.  Just mentioning that - a few reviewers mentioned hand-clog if there&#39;s no Gandalf, and I agree, it would be terrible if it worked that way.  But it doesn&#39;t.  :)<br />
<B>End Edit</B><br />
<br />
Here&#39;s the deck I played at Comic-Con, its one version of the Trust Me deck and uses an unusual Nazgul package for shadow.  The Fellowship is strong and fun, and the Shadow side is a bit... different... but equally fun.  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t play something generic.  Oh yeah, it did pretty well, 6-2 day 1 and made the second round on day 2 before some disastrous draws ended things. <br />
<br />
Fellowship:  Trust Me and Horn are two of the most powerful post-ROTEL archetypes, this combines elements of both into a powerful fellowship that shouldn&#39;t lose key skirmishes.  The ideal fellowship is Boromir, Aragorn, Gandalf and Frodo (geared up) with Elrond waiting for the Horn-call.  Elrond is key for taking on Troops of Uruk Hai and making the opponent play a pump to win, or taking on a Cantea so your fellowship doesn&#39;t have to lose weapons.  Hehe - I hear his gametext is pretty good, too.<br />
<br />
Shadow:  I figured 90% of the decks in the field would be Uruk-Hai - I was wrong, it was like 99%.  It was crazy - people were metagaming Betrayal of Isengard x4, Foul Creation, Blended Race, etc.  (Likewise, all the Uruk decks ran No Business x2-3 for Mirror).  So I picked Nazgul as a counter to the field, and put in counters to what I expected to be prominent decks - Trust Me and Horn.  That&#39;s how you get a janky shadow package like this...<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t laugh, it was big fun to play.  Scrabblers help the Nazgul win skirmishes by cancelling Last Alliance, which is key with the amount of elf allies people play.  They set you up to whack some gear with Such a Little Thing.  The Boromir hoser can also be played with the Balrog.<br />
<br />
The Gandalf hoser was in there to limit other Trust Me decks.  I thought it was effective.<br />
<br />
Black Steed actually came out of the binder!  With the amount of Ettenmoors and Hollin sites that all the Uruks are using (and the fact that this deck bids 6-7 and goes first) the Nazgul are at the plains quite a bit.  +4 for two fierce skirmishes seems pretty good to me.  In fact, the guy who won rode a second turn Witch King (with Steed, Pale Blade and a buddy Nazgul) to victory in quite a few of his matches.  I heard quite a few stories about site 2 power 21 Witch Kings...<br />
<br />
Card Options:<br />
In retrospect, keeping the Relentless Charges would have been a good choice for me, I think I substituted an extra Scrabbler and Such a Little Thing.  I took out EPP Gimli* and put in Ghetto Legolas to help counter the threat of Day 2 Nazgul, since Gimli bites it against Nazgul.<br />
<br />
Why no Servants of the Secret Fire?  I hear that drawing Gandalf&#39;s staff, spells, weapons, etc, in your opening hand, and not getting Gandalf until  mid-game is pretty bad.  Oh yeah - that&#39;s right - Gandalf-clog happened to some of the other Trust decks and they lost horribly.  As it was, I never got Gandalf-clogged.  If I&#39;d change anything, it might be to drop a Horn for an extra Blade of Gondor, since Boromir starts.<br />
