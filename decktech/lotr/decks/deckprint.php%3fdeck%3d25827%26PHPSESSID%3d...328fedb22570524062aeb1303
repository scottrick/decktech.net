After trying a couple of deck in the couple of tourneys I played out here I decided to play this kind of denial deck.  I tried it out in 2 tourneys before I play it in the DPC and it goes 8-0 so I think it has a fair shot of doing some damage in the DPC.<br />
<br />
<br />
The deck is supposed biuld your fellowship and then take away the twilight that you put in with the Denial Aragorn.  It also uses No Stranger lessen the Shadow Number of the sites and further reduce the twilight that the shadow player can<br />
use.  It gets out an all ranger fellowship with the exception of Frodo and Legolas and it can kick the crap out of any dark side that it faces.  <br />
<br />
Usally I bid 1 and I dont care if I go first or second but if I have the option I want to go first.  Most of the time I go 1-3, 4-5, 5-6, 6-8, 8-9 but if they have a bad hand or I have a good fellowship I run quicker.  Use Galadriel to get out your site 7 if you are playing a archery deck of any side, and always use Elrond if you can.<br />
<br />
For the Shadow side its a lot easier.  Play as many minions and you can and use the runners and They are Comming to cycle through your hand.  I put them in the deck just in case I faced a Hardcore denial deck that would clog my hand and I<br />
would get stuck with a hand ful of high cost minions that I would never play.  Also, Uruk-Hai Rampage is sooooooo Great it helped me win 3 games at site 9.  With 2 Troops and 6 twilight left i made 2 Troops fierce with just Aragorn,<br />
Boromir, and Frodo left.  Killed Boromir, beat Aragorn and made both fierce and one had to fight Frodo and game over.<br />
<br />
Thats about it.  If you have any questions Istant Message Me at FrodotheBurdened.  Or Email me at Frodotheburdened@aol.com, or just use the<br />
