Bid 0. Going 2nd would be better (to improve the chances of drawing a Saved from the Fire), but going 1st wouldn&#39;t be too bad. <br />
Ranger of Westernese plays Flats of Rohan (or Caras Galadhon, if you prefer) to make it easier to survive all of the beads if you hit Saved from the Fire. <br />
Ideally, you burn the Ranger after he changes sites for you and get Boromir, Aragorn, and Elendil. Radagast and Garrison of Gondor act as emergency companions. <br />
<!--284-->Glamdring and Watch and Wait keep the burdens off, so G for Grand works. <br />
All of the Gondor guys get pretty big, in a perfect world in which Elendil has all of his toys and four G for Grands, he could be a base strength 20 companion.<br />
Banners Blowing is a little expensive, but it can be recycled after it&#39;s been played once so it gives me two +3 pumps for one card slot.<br />
Pallando and Traveler&#39;s Homestead take care of the conditions.<br />
<br />
As for the Evil Men, I&#39;ve never played them, so I&#39;m not sure how they&#39;ll do. The base of this shadow side is taken from some of the other Evil Men shadows that can be found of these boards. I&#39;ve made some small changes to suit me and I hope they do well. <br />
I like the potential of the Desert Wind over the Voice of the Desert, Desert Wind is also non unique. The Voice makes my guys fierce when I need them to stay alive the most, and I don&#39;t like that.<br />
I&#39;d like more minions but with the Mouth of Sauron and Saved from the Fire, I&#39;m hoping that the cards move fairly fast.<br />
