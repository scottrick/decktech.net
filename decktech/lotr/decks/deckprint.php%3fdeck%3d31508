a adventure. I will help you out a little.<br />
For site 1 play Edoras Hall. It makes<br />
The twilight cost of all Rohan possessions<br />
-1. (Choose this site because it is a King<br />
site and most people play King sites.)<br />

For a beginner I believe that Rohan is the best<br />
Free Peoples to start off with. In this deck the<br />
only Freeps. rares are The One Ring, AtAR and Weapons<br />
Stored. The strategy for the freeps. are simple. With all the<br />
allies you can pump up your companions strength. You have<br />
4 An Honorable Charge to pump up your companions. Eomer<br />
can heal the allies you have to exert to pump your companions.<br />
Weapons Stored gets out hand weapons that your opponent <br />
might discard from his minions. (If you do not have this card<br />
that’s o.k.. Just replace it with another pumper or another <br />
Aragorn. Aragorn can heal Eomer at the beginner of each of <br />
your turns.<br />
<br />
Shadow********************************<br />
I also think that swarm should be the first deck that a<br />
beginner should try. Most of the time swarm would be<br />
Moria but to have a good Moria deck you have to have cards<br />
like Goblin Armories. Don’t get me wrong Moria is really good<br />
but I want the beginner to experience trackers, O.k., the point<br />
of swarm is to try and play as many minions as you can so if<br />
there are any minions left over you can assign them to Frodo and<br />
try and overwhelm him. Since Saulron minions are roaming<br />
until site 6 the trackers can make the roaming penalty up to -2. <br />
To swarm, save enough minions in your hand so you can play<br />
a lot of them and swarm Frodo. This is easy using Orc Ambushers<br />
and Orc Scouts. The Orc Soldiers can wound minions, as the same<br />
as Orc Scouting Bands and Orc Hunters. If you play UtWe, your<br />
opponent will have to exert every time he moves through the site<br />
path. The Taskmaster and Cheiftain can add twilight.<br />
<br />
I hope this deck helps you beginners out there.<br />
