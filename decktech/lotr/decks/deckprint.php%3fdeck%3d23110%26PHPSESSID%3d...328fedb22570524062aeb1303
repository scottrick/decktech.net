You are going to complete the adventure path with this deck, not kill your opponent.<br />
First of all: bid around three..Let me explain:<br />
If I bid high, I start.. And to start is important.. First of all you then are ahead of your opponent AND you can play your site 1!! As my site one I play The Prancing Pony. <br />
This deck is about archery fire and Gandalf큦 Strenght of Spirit. You are going to shoot down the meaniest minions and whip the toughest with Aragorn and Gandalf and Arwen.<br />
Aragorn and his bow is important. <br />
I use Albert Dreary to stop Spies of Saruman and Fill with Fear..<br />
Then you are supposed to doublemove to site 3, after playing a few weapons and first of all Gandalf. <br />
If you meet Nazguls at site 2, stop. <br />
Never double move into site 5! Take it slow. Hopefully you got a couple of stealths on your hand. Then the bridge isnt too deadly.<br />
Strenght of Spirit is to let Legolas and Aragorn exert more and Double Shot to shot even more! I use only one of each of the possesions, except Aragorn큦 Bow. The reason is because I hate to pull out three Stings in my opening hand... But Aragorn큦 Bow is too important... And if I start with two of them in my hand I can discard it or hold on to it until I see that my opponent dont play Moria (I hate Fill With Fear!).<br />
Move double into site 6. There you can heal and let your archers get ready. Site 7 is dangerous. But thats why you play Thror큦 Map.<br />
If your opponent didnt smack you too hard, double move into site 8. This is most important if your opponent play Moria or Sauron. Then they could stop you at site 8 with Shores of Nen Hithoel too.  That shouldnt happen.<br />
Next you move happily into site nine, sacrifies Aragorn, Legolas and Gandalf at the worst. But Frodo they cant touch.  Cant touch him na, na, na...<br />
<br />
Over to my Shadow half..<br />
This shadow halfs job is to prevent the other fellowship from doublemoving.. Its that simple..  Uruk Fightets are cheap and can be very nasty.. For just three twilight I thinh they are better than Lurtz.. The Troops are there because where I live everybody uses loads of possesions.. Troops can be nasty, but Ularie Cantea is the father-ugly! The Uruk Scouts and Spies of Saruman are because everybody uses A Rangers Versatility and Aragorns Bow.. Enquea is there to shock big companies or punish the Ring-bearer for having too many burdens.. Nelya is there because he is really good! Almost always the Ring-bearer has two wounds or two burdens.. <br />
The Witch King is there because of the psychology.. When people sees Lurtz, The Witch King or The Cave Troll, their faces turns blue though tey are not really that good..<br />
Many asks me why I dont use Lurtz큦 Battle Cry or Savagery to Match Their Numbers.. Here is the answer: they are not that good.. They are events.. And though events can be a big surprise, the downside is huge: you must hold them in your hand.. They takes up important space.. And my point with the Shadow half is too prevent my opponent from doublemoving, not kill him.. But I like pump, therefore the Ambitions..<br />
The Wariness is there just until a good Uruk-hai comes out in the Realms of the Elf-lords.. And it have actually made me win several fights by overwhelming the Ring-bearer at the Bridge..<br />
The Shadow and Free People halves is really good matches.. I tend to play four Free People cards in my Fellowship phase and four Shadow cards in my Shadow phase..  It is good to have two halves that draw an equal number of cards.. Then you dont come up in the situation where you have only Shadow cards in your hand..<br />
<br />
The sites:<br />
1.	This is easy: to get Aragorn out!<br />
2.	This is worse: I play Trollshaw Forst because I dont use that many Nazguls and if I played a Nazgul helper it would hurt me more than it helps.. I can also benefir from the ability to draw more cards and A Ranger큦 Versatility works there.. But Im supposed to go first and doublemove into site 3 so it is acually not a problem..<br />
3.	The few nazguls I got are cheap here!<br />
4.	Uruk-hai are not roaming.. Should I say more?<br />
5.	There isnt much of a choice is there?<br />
6.	The best site for me to play.. Should I play Galadriels Glade and exert Legolas to look at my opponents hand?<br />
7.	I dont use allies.. I cant skip the archery phase.. and I got two rangers.. I shouldnt have lost both of them..<br />
8.	It큦 cheap.. It dosent help others much...<br />
9.	I play Uruk Scouts which are trackers.. its a river.. ARV..<br />
<br />
Thats Mithrandir큦 Powers.. and remember:<br />
<br />
techniques and styles, I combine the two<br />
to mix up the brew that is bound in you<br />
wanna try me crew?<br />
step up kid, and get sliced in two!<br />
