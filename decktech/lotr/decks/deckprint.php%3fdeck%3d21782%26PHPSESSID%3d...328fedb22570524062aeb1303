It is all about beatdown for the Shadow and runnin like whimps for the Fellowship. Even though it may not seem much, when you get all five of your companions going, there seems to be no stopping ya. Well, here is how to play it: <br />
<br />
Fellowship: <br />
Get out Aragorn and Boromir as fast as you can. Arwen is good too, but the men are better in the long run. Go one site at a time unless you have all of your No Strangers out, or you see that they have weak minions or none. Not a lot of archery in this deck, but that&#39;s why there is the small fellowship and Strength of Spirit, so you can pick off almost anyone who comes by. Servant of the Secret Fire, what can&#39;t you say about this card? It is so broken its not even funny. Anyway, keep it at one site a time, unless you see an opening. <br />
<br />
Shadow: <br />
The Shadow in this deck is tough to combat against, especially when you get your UTWEs out. That is your first priority, even if you know the tracker will be waxed. The important thing is to accumulate them to set up your opponent for the Orc Bowmen. This is the reason why I play with the minions that exert to wound companions. With them, Orc Bowmen, and UTWE, its almost too easy. And the Morgul Hunters are just beasts against large fellowships. Be sure to save key cards such as Hate, Enduring Evil, and Enheartened Foe when they will do much damage and you should have no problem with the other person&#39;s fellowship. <br />
<br />
Now, here are how to play against certain decks: <br />
<br />
Nazgul: <br />
Probably your easiest matchup when you get your No Strangers and fellowship going. They are so expensive that one coming down on each site will do nothing to you. Just play it smart and do not do anything dumb like double jump big sites(i.e. 5, 7, 8), unless, that is, you scan their hand. Let Arwen fight off the Nazgul each time, or if your men have their Armor on, let Boromir. <br />
<br />
Moria: <br />
Moria relies on no archery, but I have some in this deck just for this reason. Whatever you do, do not double jump almost ever, except for site 2. This has ended so many games by doing it, so be very cautious. Save Aragorn and your archer ally for when they try to swarm you bad. Also, you can use Aragorn&#39;s text so he can take on lots o guys without being scratched. <br />
<br />
Sauron: <br />
Always a tough matchup, but try to never let them get out many minions and UTWE. Also, if at all possible, do not let any companions get exhausted, for Hate is a very mean card. Key person to use in this fight is Gandalf, for he can take on almost every minion with Glamdring and Servant of the Secret Fire. Archery helps too against the exert to wound minions. <br />
<br />
Uruk-hai: <br />
Uruk-hai are mean, but they cost kind of a lot. If you can get your No Strangers going fast, you really have nothing to worry about. Be sure to use your archery wisely against these guys and watch out for any suprise cards, such as Savagery to Match Their Numbers and Spies of Saruman. Play it safe and you can usually double jump sites on many occasions. <br />
<br />
Well, there is the deck. Hope you like it, I put a lot of time into it and really think its a true contender.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
