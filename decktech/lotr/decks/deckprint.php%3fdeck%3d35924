I submit it as a fundeck, but a know the rarecount is somewhat high and not fun at all. Fun is a tricky thing, it&#39;s a mather of opinion. What&#39;s fun? Fun is,imho, to make mashed-fellowship from those who do not know troll-swarm. Fun, imho, is Gandalf Ringbearer assisted by all his hubbies from the book. So this, all together, is my humble opinion of fun. <br />
It&#39;s been a while since I added something to decktech, but with an overall backdraw of decks being added, I thought I should add once again. <br />
The fellowship is pretty tough to beat. It has a potential te be strong, in the most positive fellowship gandalf is str. 13, Treebeard 16, Grimbeorn does his thing (not too difficult with a few strong Trolls around), there is conditionremoval, burdencontrol -very important- I can play a few skirmish events, there is a comp, who can be defender +1, AND I can filter some cards with SftF. It&#39;s a small deck, 31-31, so keycards should be around pretty fast. So again, the fellowship should be able to survive. <br />
The shadow should be able to hurt people. With an amazing Warg, Troll&#39;s Keyward is a beast. Keeper of not only the beast from Moria, but from all over Middle Earth. It&#39;s a nice thought. The spear is an extra strength bonus, plus it add&#39;s twilight with all the expensive dudes around. Spurred into Battle also add&#39;s twiligth, so with a little luck, you should be able to play a few trolls, hit a few people and do it again in a next turn. EuE makes you able to stack the Keyward and makes it cheap the next time, Forced March can be even more lethal and Goblin Hordes gives you back the trolls, you might be able to use against their fellowship. <br />
Well that&#39;s it! Please review and be nice! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
