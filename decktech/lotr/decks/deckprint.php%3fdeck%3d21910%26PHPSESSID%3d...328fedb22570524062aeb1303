<!--843-->The Balrog, Durin&#39;s Bane    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">People should know how this works. Ranger&#39;s Versatility lets you kill everything with Target Archery. Strength of Spirit prevents you from taking wounds for your exertions. Barliman Butterbur lets you recycle your Strengths of Spirit. Sleep, Caradhras kills Moria and Sauron decks. Thror&#39;s Map ensures that you get our your late-game sites, especially 7, 8 (if you are going to double-move through it) and Tol Brandir.<br />
<br />
What few tweaks have been made may include starting Sam and Legolas, rather than starting Gandalf and playing with 3 Greenleafs in the deck. What does this do for me? Well, first of all it increases my chances of getting Greenleaf since I only own one (yeah, yeah... poor me). Second, it allows me to *immediately remove burdens.* Didn&#39;t catch that? Let me repeat: I can immediately exert Sam to remove three burdens. I will do this at the beginning of each of my games, and if Sam lives a second turn, I&#39;ll remove more. Sam is your burden monkey, and then he dies (sorry, Sam).<br />
<br />
Yeah, but the Balrog skips the archery phase, doesn&#39;t he? True. You bet he does. That&#39;s Sam&#39;s other job. He takes one skirmish while Gandalf or Aragorn will have to take the other. Things may change once the Swarm-happy Rog shows up, but then he&#39;ll only be one more exertion than the Cave Troll...<br />
<br />
What about Spies of Saruman? Albert Dreary.<br />
<br />
But don&#39;t I only have one Albert Dreary? Hmm... yeah, but I suppose if someone&#39;s playing a Spies of Saruman-happy, Snowstorming Uruk-hai deck I could, maybe, just possibly, consider thinking about possibly using STRENGTH OF SPIRIT on Dreary.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, guess that works, don&#39;t it? Uruk-hai are expensive. Spies of Saruman is super-cool, but it&#39;s expensive, too (card slot and 2 Twilight). By the time they finish paying for everything, your opponent will lose it all to Ranger&#39;s Versatility and Target Archery. Heck, half of the time you don&#39;t even need to target.<br />
<br />
The Nazgul? Yeah, they&#39;re good, but you&#39;re probably thinking, &quot;My Moria Swarm overwhelms people more often.&quot; They probably do. My Nazgul aren&#39;t designed to overwhelm, just slow down, my opponents. I want to win the race. If they happen to die and lose the race before the end, that just makes my job all that much easier.<br />
<br />
Why is Second Suicide? Read the tournament report that this deck was meant to accompany. If I didn&#39;t win by getting to site 9, my lead in the race put pressure on my opponents to double-move. It&#39;s hard to double-move with Nazgul chasing you.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
