Read the whole thing before rating. It could be a bit long, so grab a pop and get sit down.<br>
<br>
Most people look at a LOTR deck as two halfs. This is a bad idea. You can have a tournament winning shadow, put it with a free side with differing throughput or differing site prefrence and place last in a tournament (For example, a good twilight nazgul burden deck coupled with a dwarf pump card deck). I will show you how each side works together as much as I can.<br>
<br>
The free side is a general format you&#39;ve probably seen before, a general aragorn, arwen and legolas deck. However, this deck uses some stragies from a different deck type that is also fairly good, but not as common where I play: the Aragorn, boromir and merry deck. The key to the second deck is the amount of twilight depravation you can have. You can have a constant -4 shadow number, plus more if you play deft in their movments. How do you get that? No stranger on Aragorn and boromir, Talent for not being seen spotting merry and frodo, and of course, bill the pony on frodo. I looked at the deck and realized that most of the denial comes from rangers. I have 3 rangers in my deck. 2 starting. So, I figured I would put No stranger on Aragorn and Boromir like the other deck, replace the Talent with a third No stranger on Arwen, and of course, bill the pony. On top of that denial, I add archery. 3 by early to mid game plus 2 archery directors. That narrows the opponent down to a few options: 1) play a big minion with your limmited twilight and hope he survives archery and can beat a companion, or 2) swarm what you can and see a bunch of it go down the tube and the rest assigned to defender +1 aragorn or let the bow of the galadhrim eat one. Sure, you can get through all this, but not often enough to kill anyone before a sanctuary. With Armor protecting aganist the #1 threat to free conditons, Uruk-Kai, I&#39;m prety safe. Secret sentinals helps a bit with my own condition removal.<br>
<br>
So lets go through a game for the free side. It doesn&#39;t matter if you go first with this deck, in fact, going second is perfered. If you go first, you&#39;ll pull aragorn for sure and run with your free side. For this reason, bid 0. Let your opponents bid. It can only hurt them in the long run. Lets assume you went second because not many people go second, unless you&#39;re up against another nazgul deck, in which case you won&#39;t have to worry about going to the right sites. Your opponent may not start with the pony (Imagine that!), but you have 5 gondor companions, 3 of which are aragorn. A word on pulling aragorn: If your oponent goes second, they are propbably playing a nazgul deck. So, pull Aragorn, Heir to the White City vs the other one. Defender +1 doesn&#39;t help you against one really big guy. You can usually get a nazgul down at site 2, 2 nazgul if they splurge on twilight or you have Morgul Gates. Along with the nazgul, you&#39;ll probably have a black breath or blade tip. People do weird things when they see those. Early game, people usualy don&#39;t have strong companions, so either save your nazgul pumps or try to obliterate a companion (wheather it be by power, damage or both). This is how you win games by site 3. People assign minions to lesser people to keep the "strong ones" away from black breath, not realizing 2 things: 1) The nazgul is fierce and will fight your big guy next, and 2) without your support people, your "strong companions" aren&#39;t that strong anymore. If your that terrified by black breath and blade tip, your deck needs more condition removal anyway. Sure your going to take a few wounds before you can do anything anyway, but it shouldn&#39;t actually directly KILL them. Indirectly? Yes, thats the point. So, at this point, you should move one at a time. They won&#39;t be running to the ford unless they have a death wish (or a sudden and violent attack of the stupids). Your Free side is starting the choke on the opponents shadow, and therefore their hand, and therefore their free side. So, their companions are going to be weak compared to other games they play. This gives you the opportunity to put on conditions and laugh. An evil laugh is something to be proud of, so practice, and practice often (some argue that this gives you the "mental edge" in a match, so it might actualy be helping more than you think). Your site 4 is a milestone because it raises the burden level one. This could be the difference between 2 and 3 burdens (nazgul sword gametext), or 3 and 4 burdens (Ulaire Toldea gametext), or, if you&#39;re lucky, 4 and 5 burdens (enquea). It gives a low amount of twilight, but its worth it anyway. Site 5 is your fellowships first big challenge. its the first truly large giving of twilight (Ford of Bruinen doesn&#39;t count). It is also the place for the Balrog to come out and play. You should have your deck recycled fast enough between Gandalfs cart, blade tip and black breath, and Morgul Gates to pull all the important posessions (you have two of each), so don&#39;t play much and let your choke do its work. Your archery could be comprimised at this site (Fill with Fear), but don&#39;t worry, it will all come back soon enough, if its not already on Gandalfs Cart. You should survive. By now, you should decide if you need to focus more on your free or shadow. Just get into that mind set. If their Fellowship is almost gone, you can sacrifice free cards to pull more shadow. If you&#39;re almost gone, you may need to focus on both sides because killing frodo with your nazguls may be your only option. If your Free is doing exceptoinaly well, run the last few sites if you haven&#39;t started already.<br>
<br>
As for the shadow, each nazgul can be classified under one of 3 main groups: Heavy hitter, Sniper, and support. Archery doesn&#39;t realy bother this deck, its either not enough, a companion exerted, or the companions are so weak they die before site 3. The shadow side is more of a card by card thing (There&#39;s only nine nazgul and they&#39;re all special), so I&#39;m going to go over individual cards and site strategy.<br>
<br>
Card choices and what it means:<br>
<br>
Witch-King: This guy is mostly a Heavy hitter. He inspires awe in players who look at him, and can overwhelm anything the cave troll can. Use him to transfer Blade tips as you need to win to transfer those. Also good with a weapon early game to take out a few companions. His added power bonus for each other nazgul he fights with doesn&#39;t hurt you either.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Attea: Attea! Attea! He&#39;s our man! If he can&#39;t transfer blade tip, your in trouble. The "Site 3 Balrog" is used much like the witch king, but he can be power 17 with out help.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Toldea: Heavy hitter and Sniper at the same time. You can&#39;t ask for much more than that. Works especialy well (as do all the heavy hitter category) with Ulaire Lemenya. If your opponent has 4 or more burdens (thats betting 2, pulling aragorn and moving to site 4 without burden removal), than he is in trouble. I rarely get many people to bet much though. If there aren&#39;t many burdens, its same as whitch king.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Cantea: Fun. I put him in the heavy hitter category because he can strip a companion to nothing before fighting. Can get rid of flaming brand, but only in odd circumstances when your opponent is already in a bad spot. Another card that people do weird things around. Deadly in combination with Lemenya. (Aragorn, power 16, fade Last alliance, he&#39;s now 13, Cantea rips off brand and sword, he&#39;s power 8, transfer black breath with lemenya on table, aragorn is power 6, and I see a sword on Cantea... OOPS!)<br>
<br>
Ulaire Enquea: He is the mob man behind the nazgul that makes people afraid of nazgul. As long as the fellowship is below 6 companions and the burdens less than 5, you&#39;re fine. But as soon as you break the rules, your fellowship may be sent to "sleep with the fishes." relatively weak. Sniper category. Best with another Nazgul to take opponent mind off him and so he is assigned to someone he can beat.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Lemenya: I went to a no-rares tournament and had so much fun with this guy I decided to put him in my regular deck. Definatly in the support category, rarly beats anyone. Used with another nazgul in an attempt to overwhelm someone. Best combos are Lemenya/Cantea or Lemenya/Toldea (depending on the situation). The only non Fierce nazgul in the deck.<br>
<br>
Morgul Gates: You must have a fair amount of these for this deck to work. If you don&#39;t have 4 and want to test out the deck, find an understanding friend and use proxy cards (that is, other cards that count for Morgul Gates). This card gets 2 or more nazgul out at a time and helps the overall throughput of the deck very much. Don&#39;t splurge with these. If its the difference between having a weapon on a nazgul or not, don&#39;t use it unless you need the weapon to kill someone.<br>
<br>
Beauty is Fading: My favorite card in the game. Almost nobody uses it anymore (I have no clue why), so nobody expects it. Primary defence against any anti-nazgul card (flaming brand, O Elbereth, trust me as you once did, etc. Condition or possesion, you name it, its gone) It costs 5 twilight, which is the cost of a nazgul, so consider it as a cantea that discarded something and lost so that in all future turns you can win where he failed. <br>
<br>
Fear: This is mostly aimed at one ally that manages to piss me off every game in one way or another: Filbert Bolger. Sure, he&#39;s gone at site 7, but what if he is played after that? Or you don&#39;t want to wait that long? If Filbert isn&#39;t there, chuck Albert Dreary, or Elrond or someone. If there are no allies, chuck the card.<br>
<br>
Black Breath and Blade tip: I put these together because thats how they should be, on one companion, together. Actualy, I often don&#39;t fight a big person with both of those on the table at once. I usually use it to finish someone off, or for long term prevention. For example, if the opponent assigns a Nazgul to someone who is then exaughsted, transfer blade tip and kill them, not black breath (Unless they are at a sanctuary or can heal in the reproup phase). Put black breath on the big companions so they will eventually be whittled down to nothing. Don&#39;t splurge with these, play them strategicaly.<br>
<br>
Theshold of Shadow, Black Steed, Nazgul sword: these all have the sole purpose of getting nazgul to even higher heights. Again, don&#39;t splurge with these. If it won&#39;t make much of a difference, hold on to it. Remember that you shouldn&#39;t hold a Black Steed in hopes of playing it at site 5 as it is discarded at an underground site (I&#39;ve done that a lot).<br>
<br>
Thats about it. If you have questons, D-mail me. This version is so far undefeated (because I haven&#39;t played it much) but the previous version with all its faults placed 6th out of 15 in Seatle. Constructive critisisim is appreciated.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
