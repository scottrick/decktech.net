BASICALLY - You&#39;re FP will beat down opponents. There is only one Ring-Bound (Frodo) - every one else in unbound. <br />
ROHAN - Eomer and the Elite Rider are to be mounted at all costs. This gives them their strength bonuses. Plus if you get them with a Spear/Sword and Bow, they are pretty hard to beat. <br />
Spears - for Dunland and Orcs<br />
Swords - Uruks<br />
(((Helm! Helm! - is easier to use then Sword-wall, plus it helps keep sites liberated))) <br />
<br />
ELVES - The Lorien Swordsmen are your back up fighters along with Arwen. Leggy is for point and shoot. Haldir is mostly for liberation...unless you need to fight.<br />
(((Helm! Helm! - is easier to use then Sword-wall, plus it helps keep sites liberated))) <br />
- Archery keeps those powerful Uruks from using their powerful (But conditional) gametexts...so there...(so do the mounts) <br />
<br />
***IMPORTANT*** - I have been told that Archery and Mounts are Redundant - I don&#39;t think so. Especially if the Shadow has archery protection - the mounts are set as a backup. Hope this clears that up... ***ALSO*** Dunland is very strong - plus they have discard, the Bows and Mounts are meant to offset this as well.  ((I thought this one out))<br />
<br />
***FP AGAINST OPPONENTS SHADOW - Dunland seems to be better off - because of their low vitality - Uruks, Isenorcs and Raiders have to exert when assigned, if they don&#39;t they use their game text and give my Riders their strength bonuses anyway...*** <br />
<br />
SHADOW:<br />
 Ferny takes away, for the most part, Gondorian Rangers game texts. SO THERE. <br />
These bad boys stop Hobbit decks and hard.  This deck is not dependant upon anyone Nazgul - but Nelya is a key player.  It&#39;s designed to piss people off and make them move slowly (which is does very well)- <br />
It is very hard to beat 2 or 3, sometimes 4 Nazgul at a time...this Shadow allows for multiple Minions to be out - do the the variety of the Minions.<br />
<br />
SITES: <br />
Play them as they come....Hopefully you will be able to play to your sites...If you cannot play to your sites, use Nelyas game text (when available)<br />
<br />
BIDDING: It just depends on who or what you are playing against and whether you want to play to your opponents site or yours...There is no Burden removal - because my FP are designed to beat almost anyone...<br />
<br />
***If you want add 2x Flaming Brand for the FP***<br />
***Add one more Black Breath and Blade Tip for the Shadow***<br />
