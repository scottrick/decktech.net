It&#39;s quite powerful, and partucularly annoying against my type of deck because they can run as many companions as they want and not have to worry about Enquea. <br />
Which is precisely why I built this deck. Throw Yourself In Next Time prevents a Hobbit from exerting except from Shadow conditions. The strategy is simple: Play a cheap Moria Orc, the condition on Merry, and drop Enquea. If you&#39;re lucky you can kill Merry, if his vitality&#39;s -1 for the armour, or if he has a couple wounds, if not at least you can pick off Eomer or Eowyn. <br />
It&#39;s also alright against Dauntless Hunter, because although it now costs 2, you can keep Merry, Friend to Sam from adding +3 strength to anyone, and Bilbo, WSGH can&#39;t discard it.  <br />
The Shadow side is my own mix of Moria archery, and functions well against every deck it&#39;s played, including the Dauntless Hunter and Rohan.  <br />
For the freeps, it&#39;s whack-minion Rohan with Gandalf providing pumps, and removing pool with Glamdring if he&#39;s playing Orcs (2/3s deck types). I haven&#39;t played against many Nazgul decks, but what few games I have played it&#39;s done well. Fortress discards conditions, or a Sleep can wipe the board if he&#39;s playing Sauron conditions or Moria. Dernhelm is a base strength 11 against Nazgul, 13 if the have a fell beast. She&#39;s also tech against any rogue Warg decks you may run up against. Dunland will be your toughest matchup, but if you can draw Gandalf and Trust Me early you&#39;ll be fine. Dreary pitches Isengard or Moria conditions in the maneuver phase, great against a Snows or whatever. <br />
