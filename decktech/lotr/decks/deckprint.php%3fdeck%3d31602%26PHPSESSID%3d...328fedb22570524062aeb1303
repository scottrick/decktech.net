<br />
*The only thing i clame credit for is the fellowship as the minion side is designed by Carny , and francly after testing it alot i realy didn&#39;t see much flaws if any in them :]<br />
<br />
I see you looking at this deck and wondering :<br />
Hmm that fellow starts with a fellowship of 5 :]<br />
Well the strenght of this deck is is twilight denial ( like the good old Star Wars time , gimme my revolutions :]]] )<br />
It has the power of Swapping from a DH to a hobbit stealth deck or even run both , cse one Enquea isn&#39;t realy all that scary.<br />
<br />
We all know that Dunland needs heavy choking to come out properly , well this deck does it!<br />
And not only that , it can dual move via don&#39;t follow the lights , killing one minion with Smeagol winning and the other one u simply toss away.+2 for all condition and events -2 for each site.I fear The Freedom Brothers pile of tech will strand a bit with lack of twilight , no? :]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not Always helps?<br />
Well , i&#39;ve used both , but i found the stinker better in casus handeling Easterling decks and hide decks.In my last games before i started playing this deck , ppl would just save a Wulf with a club and cloth up a boost or sth , and kill 2 companions per site , and using their hides to cancel any sweet stuff atempted by Smeagol :/.Also the captain with a polearm and a friend to his rescue kinda screws up Always helps :$<br />
<br />
Why so small?<br />
Well this way , i might be missing out on some extra usefull cards , but the deck , both minion and fellowship cycle like a bomb.I draw the greatest openings and they have given me not rarely the win before site 5.<br />
<br />
Card Choises :<br />
<br />
Not Listening : The bomb in combination with Countreyshire : Use Merry of strenght 5-7 to boost once ( or twice if u got ur escape down ) , with with smeagol , toss the minion away , and tata : Fully healed using countryshire.<br />
<br />
Cloack : Heal + Burden Remove + Heal cse of the countryshire&#39;s : DUh!<br />
<br />
<br />
Worst Matchup would be a deck that heavily adds burdens , so i can&#39;t utilise them always to boost Smeagol.(Yet have to encounter a corrupt deck worthy of tournament level in my scene).<br />
<br />
Props For Carny For making the dunland such beautiulll and smooth running machine vs Rohan and DH.It can also easily take care of swarms :]<br />
<br />
This deck isn&#39;t perfect yet , but we&#39;re hoping to getting near to it , and with your positive reviews and help it could improve alot!<br />
<br />
So What is it&#39;s record i see you wondering?<br />
<br />
Local Tour : 5-0<br />
Asthon DCon : 5-0<br />
Finals : 2-0 ( facing a Uruk deck Moehahahaa).<br />
<br />
Yeh , it has yet to be beaten :]<br />
That&#39;s why i playtest everyday , since im in vacation now hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking, I&#39;ll answer any questions.<br />
Props To Carny For our teamwork.<br />
