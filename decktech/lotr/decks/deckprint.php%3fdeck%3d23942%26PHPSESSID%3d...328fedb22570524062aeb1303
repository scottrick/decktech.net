My goal was to make an effective deck based on my favorite characters from The Fellowship of the Ring: Sam, Legolas, Boromir, and Glorfindel. Since Glorfindel is replaced with Arwen in the movie and thus the card game, I decided to follow suit with a Legolas/Arwen start. Adding Boromir, it&#39;s already pretty much a Ranger deck, so I thought I would test myself if I could build one of these decks successfully without the &#39;big cheese&#39;. The Nazgul are cool but I really just chose them because I play them the smartest. Let me explain some of the odd choices:<br />
<br />
Sam, Proper Poet: With Sam in the theme, it&#39;d be silly to just use him for the burden/bid trick. Instead, I go with a one bid, hang back and get myself together, then burst ahead. The Poet version has two strategies I can take: Defender+1 to save Frodo from a swarm, or sack Frodo himself to a fatty and carry on. This really helps me push through the mines. In a site 9 rush with Fierce minions, Sam&#39;s Def+1 can save the game when he is the Ringbearer. I&#39;ve done it!<br />
<br />
Hobbit Sword: Yes, not Sting. Why? In about 3 out of 5 games, Sam becomes my Ringbearer.<br />
<br />
Elven Bow/ Splendor: Without Aragorn&#39;s Bow, I need some extra firepower behind Legolas. Splendor lets Arwen replace Legolas&#39; lost Archery point, and can be played safely before Elven Bow is on, if that catch comes up. Everybody can exert-to-whatever but Arwen without it, and since she doesn&#39;t lose that often, it gives a use for her Hit Points. Great in multiplayer.<br />
<br />
Dagger Strike: Arwen can pump herself, so I use this rather than Swordsmen, to let Sam in on the action.<br />
<br />
Twilight Nelya: Alot of people don&#39;t realize the power of this card. Fierceness is all the Twilight Nazgul really lack, and Nelya is that AND Damage+1, most of the time. It&#39;s MUCH more reliable than it seems at first, as most people, whether playing against Nazgul or not, take some wounds on Frodo to avoid burdens or deaths. Nelya activates on those wounds if the burdens aren&#39;t there. That makes a HUGE difference in how often he &quot;triggers&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nazgul Sword: To me, minion weapons are there to win single skirmishes, especially important for the Nazgul. A blade can make the difference between a loss to Flaming Brand or Arwen, and a win. So naturally I use the one that can be used by all the wraiths. Oh, and Damage+1 doesn&#39;t hurt.<br />
<br />
Fear: No, not Tower Assasin. He won&#39;t kill Elrond, who is probably the single most deadly ally, because of the card advantage he generates for your opponent. Wary players will draw TWO cards with him. Tower Assasin wounds twice. Sack Hosts. Elrond lives. Fear just kills him and Galadriel, Bounder, etc.<br />
<br />
Beauty is Fading: Used in moderation, this card is, well, a beauty. Flaming Brand, Aragorn&#39;s Bow, or Gwemegil can all be discarded before Archery ever begins. Tale of Gil-galad can be discarded and, whoops, Greenleaf is dead. I know some would say to use Stricken Dumb because it costs less. Let me point out that BiF on Nelya or Cantea costs exactly the same as SD on the Witch King, the ONLY Nazgul you can use it with. I&#39;d much rather pay 1 more twilight to use it on a 6 cost Nazgul, simply for the ability to do so.<br />
