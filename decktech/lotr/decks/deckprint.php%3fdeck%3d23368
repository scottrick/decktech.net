Dwarves move through the hand quickly, allowing you to draw more cards and dump more minions. <br>
<br>
The fellowship should be played like a warped hobbit hospital. Move slowly along the site path, pumping your dwarves to survive skirmishes and cycle through cards. Keep as much presure on as possible, for two reasons. First, your shadow is very capable of stopping your opponents fellowship making it possible for your fellowship to win. Second, keeping the presure on can force your opponent to double move, increasing the twilight, and dropping one or two extra minions for them to deal with. Do remember that your fellowship is your weak side, so dont pushimmer too hard. <br>
<br>
How does the shadow work? Simple, wounds without winning skirmishes. Dump as much as possible as soon as possible. Drop Orc Bowmen as soon as you can, as it is free damage. Be sure you use them, as well (example, if you have 3 twilight in pool, Bowmen in play, and one in hand with a scouting band, play the orc to get the archery this turn). The Bowmen are increadible in this deck, but losing them doesnt stop you. Get the Moria orcs out and into the discard pile so you dont have to hold the hosts. Inquisitors can be a game winner. Basically flood your opponents with damage and theyll go down. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
