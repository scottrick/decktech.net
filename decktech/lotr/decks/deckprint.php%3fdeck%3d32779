I worked for a while, and finally settled on 4 boats and 3 Marauders with a Lookout. The Lookout can occasionally discard Bounders and even Elrond, and he can come out for free with just 1 token on a Black Sails. <br />
Basically through the first 6 sites you do nothing but play your stuff, add tokens, and put minions back under your draw deck with the sneaks, mostly the scavengers. I’ve actually won several games simply setting up for the massive swarm at later sites. Save the Corsairs until you have several in hand so you can add tokens while you scrap possessions. I like waiting until site 9 because by then with your amazing Rohan filter you’ve gotten 99% of all FP’s cards out of your draw deck and then you can draw cards with threats and as a rule, get out 12 minions pretty easily. I’ve played up to 18 at one time, that was my all-time high, but almost always you can get out enough to kill them. <br />
<br />
The FP’s is a very good filtering side. If you draw a Saved, burn Grimbold and pull out Eomer, Firefoot, and Eowyn, Eowyn should always be one of the first because she’s valiant. Simbelmynes pull out more companions, and you’re completely set up by site 4 or earlier. (I’ve had Eomer/Firefoot/Spear/Eowyn/Blade combo out at site 2 with this) Even if your shadow is getting completely screwed, it’s Rohan and can effectively run to site 9 with no problems. <br />
<br />
So far this deck is 36 and 2 with the only 2 losses coming from a deck that I specifically designed to counter that particular decktype. I’ve paired these two decks five times and this one has still won 3 of them. <br />
<br />
Enjoy your killing…<br />
