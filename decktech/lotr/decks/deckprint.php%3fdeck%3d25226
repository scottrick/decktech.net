<br>
This deck has won the Image Collections tournaments for the last bunch of times. This deck is about a week old, so the past 2 tournaments, it has gone undefeated. At Nexus X, a very ghetto version of this deck went 3-2. It has the biggest problems with Nazguls, which are my meta unfortunately. Legolas and Aragorn haven&#39;t died since this deck was made. <br>
<br>
A few of the combos:<br>
<br>
Orthanc Berserker + Can You Protect Me From Yourself + Tower of Orthanc = twilight and an exhausted Aragorn. Good chance of working if they play aragorn.<br>
<br>
Savageries and Ambitions, Uruk Soldier, and Battle Cry = An unexpected big kill or big hit. My Uruk Soldiers have killed more companions than Lurtz. The unexpected hit really hurts. Soldier has killed Frodo on several occasions by himself.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai Armory, Ambition, and the Balrog = usage of the extra twilight and unclogging your hand. Not a hard-hitting combo, but a good saviour.<br>
<br>
Tale + Legolas = 3 aimed hits when he&#39;s at full health.<br>
<br>
Splendor + Arwen + Bow = Good use of her extra vitality when it does nothing. Adds a lot of archery.<br>
<br>
Brown Lands + Lurtz + Orthanc Assassin = 4 archery, 2 10 + minions, one of them fierce.<br>
<br>
Uruk Soldier + Lurtz = Quick and cheap fierceness for Lurtz, and a card discarded. Today I discarded my opponent&#39;s Attea, Enquea, and Cantea with them.<br>
<br>
Uruk Captain + Lurtz = 11 twilight to bring Lurtz back from the dead! Cheap fierce minion + 9 power uruk!<br>
<br>
Now some of you might be wondering why I play cards like Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith and One of You Must do This. These were cards that I needed until I get better cards. Tomorrow, I&#39;m getting a second Orthanc Assassin, and a third can you protect me from yourself?. These will replace both One of You Must Do This. Uruk Scouts are iffy too. Please give me some advice on what cards I should take out, and what cards I should add in. Thanks for the help. <br>
<br>
By the way, Arwen, Greenleaf, Lord of Gondor, my second Merry, Elrond, PATHS, my second Savagery, both Battle Cries, both Can You protect mes, tale, blade of gondor, and basically the rest of the good cards besides a few, I got from trading. I actually got my second Lurtz there too. I&#39;d like to share this site with you if you haven&#39;t seen it already. It helped me out a bunch: www.mahasamatman.com Again, thanks. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
