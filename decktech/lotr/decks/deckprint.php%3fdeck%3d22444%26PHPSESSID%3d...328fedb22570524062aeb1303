This isn&#39;t necessarily a tournament deck. If you want to win tournaments, you&#39;ll want to reduce the Random Factor by playing a slimmer, more efficient deck. But if you spend all of your time at tournaments losing, you might want to give this deck a chance. If nothing else, it&#39;s fun.<br />
<br />
At 100 cards, it&#39;s a big, clunky deck. People don&#39;t like it when you shuffle, but that&#39;s okay. People don&#39;t like it when you swarm them with 12 minions to their 2 characters, either, but you know you want to do that.<br />
<br />
Most people, though, don&#39;t mind seeing Gimli explode the Balrog with a mighty swing of his axe. That&#39;s just d*** cool, and everyone knows it.<br />
<br />
The tricks? Mines of Moria brought out a new mechanism for Dwarves that lets you do lots of things by discarding cards off the top of your deck. Normally, that&#39;s a huge problem, because you have limited resources to discard. This deck is also finite, but it&#39;s much BIGGER than other decks. Therefore, you can discard more stuff off the top. The only cards you can&#39;t really retrieve are Cave Trolls (but you have 4), Armories (if you discard them, just wince and be done with it), Hobbit stuff, and Dwarf conditions. If you&#39;re keeping track, that means that you can manipulate, from your discard pile: Dwarf weapons, Dwarf events, Minions, and Scimitars. You actually want a sizable discard pile so you can get the cards that you need.<br />
<br />
Okay, everyone knows how to play the swarm, so I won&#39;t belabour that issue.<br />
<br />
Dwarves, on the other hand, are relatively new at high levels of performance. With the new Bracers and Hand Axes, though, Gimli and his pappy, Gloin, can become tanks. Gimli gets to an unmodified (by events) 10, and Gloin, with 4 conditions, gets to an unmodified 13!!! If three of those conditions are your Stairs of Khazad-dum, they&#39;ll be 13 and 16 (!!!), respectively, against Moria minions. Gimli SMASH!<br />
<br />
How to play the deck?<br />
<br />
Swarms are really a Dwarf deck&#39;s worst nightmare. When Frodo starts facing multiple Orcs, things are going downhill. You want to bid 3 to go first and get Bilbo if you can. But bid no higher than 3, since you have no way to remove burdens until (if) you draw Sam. Bilbo can kill things like Swarms, They Are Coming and Armories. Play every character you can against a Swarm deck. You need to keep minions off of Frodo.<br />
<br />
Against non-swarm decks (Nazgul, Uruk, most Sauron), you just play a safe number of characters (usually four, sometimes five), load them with weapons, and send the tanks into battle.<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t forget to use Realm of the Dwarrowdelf. It&#39;s the impetus for this deck. Underground it adds not only to power, but to damage!<br />
<br />
And, in closing, a brief litany of the things that Gimli has smashed:<br />
<br />
Witch-King, both versions.<br />
Cave-Troll, many times.<br />
Balrog, both versions, many times.<br />
Cave-Troll and Balrog at the same site... once.<br />
Witch-king, Cave-Troll and Balrog in the same game... once.<br />
Lurtz? Don&#39;t remember. It would just be another notch in Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe.<br />
<br />
When Gimli gets mad, Gimli SMASH!!!<br />
