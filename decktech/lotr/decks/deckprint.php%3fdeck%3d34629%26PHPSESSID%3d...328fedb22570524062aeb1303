This is a standard knight build altered for expecting corruption and wounding decks.  I wasn&#39;t quite sure how to make it at first, so I started with Mike Perucca&#39;s build and made my alterations from there.  I knew there would be some alternate ringbearer hate, so with the help of Clayton Edwards and Steve Jones, I altered it to fit in the Drawing his Eye and Last Throw.  The Catapult came out for the latter, and Last Throw won enough games to make it worth while.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
The shadow was initially a nasty southron archery (how can Seth resist playing Southrons?), but with certain meta choices (dwarves choke a little too much for it early), I decided to go with an old Syracuse standby, Easterling Captain Superstar.  I swear, Team &#39;Cuse came up with this before QC did &quot;Beasterlings&quot;.  Anyway, that hurts dwarves and makes smeagol useless for anything other than a speed bump.  Anyway, this was able to win a handful of games, but it was more to slow my opponent for the running the knights do at the end.  They heal so much, they just take off.<br />
