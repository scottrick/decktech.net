You wanna bid to go first, not really becuase of the fellowship, but you want to have first dibs at the sites(I can normally get a site on thier move to site 3).  The fellowship is pretty basic, you got abunch of elves, only, these aren&#39;t the sissy shoot everything and hope not to skirmish elves, these guys are big and bad.  most of these elves are at least base power 9 with a bow and sword, and the powerhouse of arwen in all her glory is a huge base 14 agianst any feirce minion if she has her stuff on her (thats not including if it&#39;s a plains).  But they deal thier damage pretty effectively, can&#39;t always double move if the shadow has alot of high vitality minions, but hpoefully the shadow is doing its job.<br />
<br />
The besiegers in this deck have been proving lots of fun and the most solid site control deck I&#39;ve put together.  The old Orc fighters from Battle o helms deep make controling site rather easy, all they have to do is win, and even if they don&#39;t with any luck they will still have a vitality left to grab a site, you wanna get one of these uglies early before the fellowship gets all kinds of weapons/horses and such with damage bonuses. and otheriwise you have troop tower, where all you need to do is have a besieger survive until regroup and discard him.  Great seige towers help too, its like having pumps for sauron! everytime you play a besieger be sure to put your token there, because in each skirmish you can drop tokens for bonus power (on any orc not just the besiegers).  And once you get a site or two its all good from there.  you get out troop tower and tower walkway and you get acouple guys on site and you are getting strength bonuses left and right.  gotta get that pillager on a site to make all the besiegers fierce too.  For me, these guys have proven a highly effective fighting machine.  In most games I get at least 3 sites.  That&#39;s about all there s to these guys, control sites, and beat em up.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
