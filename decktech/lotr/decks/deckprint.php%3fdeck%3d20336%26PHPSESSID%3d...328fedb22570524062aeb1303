Just look at Gandalf&#8230; smoking too much of the Hobbit weed dulled his senses and he got abused by Saruman.  BUT&#8230; its great for relaxing and letting go of your burdens.  Have fun with this deck &#8211; its not tournament quality, but is definitely a fun multi-player deck, in a &#39;Jay and Silent Bob&#39; sort of way.<br />
<br />
Theory:  Gandalf&#8217;s Cart.  Dumping all of your possessions into the Cart (especially lots of WEED) turns the cart into a party on wheels.  More importantly, it gives your deck a lot of play-through since you&#8217;re always drawing a lot of cards.  With that in mind, I&#8217;m playing a combo-intensive shadow strategy in this one (explained below).<br />
<br />
As the game progresses, and the Pipes come out, the deck becomes very difficult to stop because the entire fellowship can heal each turn, remove burdens, and occasionally remove pool.<br />
<br />
Strategy:  Unfortunately, you need to bid high (4-5+) because the Cart is very valuable.  Dump possessions into the cart allowing you to draw more each turn.  Once you have out a couple of Pipes, start smoking the Weed.  Old Toby is great, since you draw a card, discard the weed for some benefit (usually knocking down burdens or healing) and then shuffle it back into your deck with Bilbo - Gandalf&#8217;s supplier.<br />
<br />
Late in the game, the every-turn-healing is especially effective with Greenleaf and Gimli, since they can exert each turn for their text, take a puff on Aragorn&#8217;s pipe, and do it all again.<br />
<br />
Notes:  There are not many battle cards, so don&#8217;t expect to tear through minions and move twice.  Its all about slow, consistent movement and lots of healing.  Also, the most dangerous turns are the first few, before you have out extra fellowship and your burden total is still high.  Be careful.  Because of the play-through, this deck could even be a little bigger and go with 4 Sams for burden help.<br />
<br />
Shadow Side:<br />
Well, the other side of the drug problem is CORRUPTION.  Just ask any Republican.  And Middle Earth&#8217;s environment-destroying 80&#8217;s Republican types are definitely the Uruks (No offense to GWBush, he&#8217;s doing a great job).  To think it all could have been avoided if Saruman just toked up a little with Gandalf instead of being so stressed out&#8230;<br />
<br />
Theory:  Corruption isn&#8217;t quite there yet as a tournament strategy, but in multi-play where you can target that guy with too many burdens, its definitely effective.  Here is the combo:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Uruk + Saruman&#8217;s Reach + Nazgul + The Twilight World&#8221;<br />
Sounds rough to pull off, right?  Luckily, since the fellowship side is mostly possessions which you dump (instead of events, which you would normally save and hold) you have a little extra room in your hand to hang on to some combo cards for when they&#8217;re playable.<br />
<br />
The idea is that with a Uruk and Nazgul in play, when you play the reach, they either injure two guys (which is good) or they put on the Ring (which lets you play the Twilight World to add 2 burdens).  Later in the game, when they&#8217;re past the last sanctuary and you have a Spy out, too, it becomes much more of a dilemma.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Worry and some Uruk beatings should provide a steady flow of burdens during skirmishes.  4 Patrol Troops with Snows is particularly rough, and very good at dealing burdens with Worry.  If you get out Worry early, add a few burdens during the game, you&#8217;ll put yourself in good shape to defeat someone with a site 8-9 corruption win.<br />
<br />
Have fun, and remember &#8211; in Middle Earth its okay for Gandalf to smoke and drive. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
