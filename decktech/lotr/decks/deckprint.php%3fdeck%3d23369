<br />
I realize that this was posted earlier and w/o a strategy section, so I figured I&#39;d both submit my version and give a general strat on how to play it. <br />
<br><br />
Bid 2, sometimes 3 (only if you know they&#39;re not playing Nazgul). Go first if you win the bid. Not going first isn&#39;t a big deal. <br />
This deck isn&#39;t exactly hard to play (then again, no decks are for this game). Play what you draw and run like hell. <br />
<br><br />
The only fellowship cards this deck holds onto are the Secret Sentinels. Use Gimli and the sneaks to set up a beating at site 7 or 8. This is the easiest way to ensure that you get 5 orcs for the Slopes. Use Mirror to keep your fellowship going along or to pull vital fellowship cards to keep them from running easily. <br />
<br><br />
Shoulder to Shoulder&#39;s primary functions are to keep wounds off of Legolas and to keep your allies from dying to Tower Assassin. It also works well vs Enquea.<br />
<br><br />
Swanship was some Adam Beauchamp tech.. it lets you use Rumil/Orophin at site 7-9, adding one to the archery total, then taking it to the hilt. This card was affectionately called "companion #11" in playtesting. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
The Moria mix is fairly standard. I took out the Balrog and added troll #3. Cave Troll > Balrog in terms of stoppage power, plus shuffling doesn&#39;t combo well with stacking cards on the bottom of your deck. The Goblin Warrior was a bit of overtech (in hindsight) to combat Thrarin or Greatest Kingdom of My People (I&#39;m paranoid). <br />
<br><br />
Recent questions and some answers:<br />
<br><br />
Q: Why no They Are Coming?<br />
A: This deck doesn&#39;t hold onto fellowship cards. Every card that you draw (except for Sentinels) gets played. The only redundant fellowship cards that would be pitched are the extra Mirrors.<br />
<br><br />
Q: Why Sneaks?<br />
A: These, in combination with Gimli, let you speed through your shadow cards even more quickly. Gimli does it directly, while the Sneaks allow you to play orcs freely, providing a means of retrieval. Stacking 4-6 orcs isn&#39;t uncommon at all, and can provide an ensured stop at the Slopes or a powerful horde elsewhere.<br />
<br><br />
Q: Why only 2 Shoulder to Shoulder?<br />
A: This isn&#39;t a Shoulder-fire deck. You&#39;ll draw into it soon enough. You mainly only need it for sites 5 and on. Also, Goblin Scrabblers/Sarumon&#39;s Power was considered to be a non-factor in the meta.<br />
<br><br />
Q: How do you handle Balrog or Witchking/Pale Blade?<br />
A: There are 9 companions. That means you can spare a couple if they get a combo through after you Mirror. Yes, Witch King/Pale Blade and Troll/Hammer sucks.<br />
<br><br />
Q: Why no Gift of Boats?<br />
A: In hindsight, I probably coulda played Gift of Boats and done better in the DPC (would have won me a game that I had lost), but as it was, I didn&#39;t see any card other than Swanship to take out, and I figured I&#39;d have done better with Swanship (and I was wrong).<br />
<br> <br />
General strats vs certain decks:<br />
<br />
Vs Moria:<br />
You win. Kill Swarms/Armories with Sentinels.. Your archery should wreck here, and you have enough companions to take Troll shots for you. Mirror can help you get around the Slopes. <br />
<br><br />
Vs. Sauron:<br />
Shoulder to Shoulder shines here. Use it to negate Hate and Tower Assassin threats. Sentinels will take out Bowmen/Under the Watching Eye.<br />
<br><br />
Vs. Nazgul:<br />
Mirror shines here..  Nazgul decks tend to hold onto minions for a couple of turns. Sentinels are generally useless here. Nazgul will get a good start on you, but if you survive that, you should be able to hold on and make it to 9. Filibert Bolger should win you this game.<br />
<br><br />
Vs. Uruks:<br />
This is a little bit of a tougher matchup, but you have Filibert Bolger to help vs Savagery, Sentinels for Spies of Sarumon/No Business of Ours/Sarumon&#39;s Frost (yes, there was a Bill Ferny deck at DPC Atlanta). Mirror away as many minions as you can. Tough, but not impossible.<br />
<br><br />
DMail me if you have questions. More may be added to this later on (when I get the chance.. heh)<br />
Later,<br />
