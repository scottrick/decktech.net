<br><br>
Ok, here&#39;s the first alteration....Agreeing with Toad and Wizard Boy, I decided I needed some stopping power with the shadow, so I&#39;m switching in two Cave Trolls, one for a Scrabbler, one for a Wallcrawler.  Hopefully this will help to keep them from getting too far ahead.<br>

Edit 2<br>
<br><br>
This deck (in almost the exact same form) just got 11th place on day one at Origins, and beat some of the best players out there.  As a matter of fact, it was the only one that beat Clint Hays on Day One.<br>
<br><br>
End Edit 2<br>
<br><br>
Alright, first off let me say this:  it&#39;s a gamble, but not as big as you might think.  The Shadow side is built to do nothing more than get out of your Fellowship&#39;s way by cycling through cards fast enough that you deck yourself at site six, at which time you draw up the six cards you stacked at the bottom of your deck, which, in an ideal case, are two ARV&#39;s and four Deft in their Movements.  Then you map out your site seven, versatility whatever they throw at you and shoot it down, play your four deft in their movements and give them one twilight for the last two sites.  Combined.  But it&#39;s a little more complex than that, so I&#39;ll explain...<br>
<br><br>
First off, before you wonder why I have a small number of certain cards, know this:  you will get all the way through your deck by site six.  I&#39;ve played this deck around 20 times now and every last time it&#39;s gotten all the way through by site six.  So you will have your Thror&#39;s Map, you will have two hobbits for the deft in their movements, you will have the bow.  Everything will be there unless it&#39;s discarded by your opponent, in which case you hold an extra ARV or DitM and use Dear Friends to stack the needed card at the bottom.   There are two things that will kill this deck:  1. an absolutely horrid draw in which you don&#39;t get to the bottom of your deck by site six (like drawing four scimitars but no minions).  No such draw has happened to me yet.  2.  another Gift of Boats deck or a deck that double moves every possible time.  This shouldn&#39;t be a problem most of the time, since the swarm deck is good enough to at least stop your opponent once.<br>
<br><br>
The Fellowship is designed to just line people up for them to mow down before site six.  Be generous with archery and then assign what&#39;s left to Boromir, Arwen, Gandalf and especially Sam.  Don&#39;t be hesitant to lose one of them, but above all, KEEP ARAGORN AND LEGOLAS ALIVE.  They must live to site six.  On a side note:  I chose Gandalf because this particular version is a strength nine when he makes an appearance and has the Frodo signet, so Dear Friends works well with him.  <br>
<br><br>
Bid 1 or 2.  Choose to go first if you win, but if you don&#39;t, that&#39;s ok too.  Going second helps you get through your deck quicker, but going first helps prevent them from running away from you in early game.  Early in the game, do whatever you have to do to keep Aragorn and Legolas alive.  You don&#39;t have to keep up with your opponent, but don&#39;t fall too far behind either.  Drop EVERYTHING every shadow phase.  This shouldn&#39;t be too hard - everything is cheap.  Use They Are Coming and make some sacrifices.  You may have to disard a Ranger&#39;s Sword, or a double of Aragorn.  Do it.  You must cycle through the deck.  Discard the ARV&#39;s and DitM&#39;s early, so you can use Dear Friends to cycle them back under the deck.  Anyways, about site three, get a deck count, and know how many cards you have to go through.  Depending on how far your opponent gets and how fast you move, you should get anywhere from 7 to 13 draws, on average about 10, plus individual draws from scimitars and Elrond. <br>
<br><br>
That&#39;s about it on the strategy, although I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve forgotten something.  If you have any questions, go ahead and D-mail me.  This is a deck that my brother and I have put a lot of thought into, so please be serious in your ratings and give some advice.  <br>
