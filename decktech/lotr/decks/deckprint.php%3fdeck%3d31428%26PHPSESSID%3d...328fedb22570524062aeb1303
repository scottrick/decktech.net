<br />
Fellowship Strategy: the strategy here is to bid zero  it dosent matter if you go first. then use gimli to start to put all of the moria scouts under the deck and if needed put the rinners and scavengers also. you also ise gandalf to draw cards along with delving and if you get clogged then moment of respite helps out. pippin is a sacrafice guy because you never want to hei the 6 companion mark in this deck. merry is just there to pump and then die if desired because the moria combo will set up quite fast if played correctly. <br />
<br />
Shadow Strategy: ok this is the heart of the deck. the strategy is to abuse the goblin sneak and put all of your moria minions at the bottom of your draw deck to accomplish this there are 4x host and they DO NOT clog your hand because you can simply ditch them off and use gimli to put a minion if you draw it next turn. but the only minor clog is that you need to hold in you hand at all times a saruman&#39;s snow, and the 2 isengard minions. but hand clog is rare in this deck because you can cycle and discard very fast. but in the end the botom of your draw deck will consist of all scouts,scavengers,runners and 1 sneak. it is very important to always have 1 sneak at the bottom. then you will always see another hobbit in decks so you use fool of a took and grab all of those minions back and play the runners to add twilight then the scouts then play a sneak to sneak a sneak then play a scavengers to grab the sneak and repeat until sneaks are out the finally play the warrior and shamen and snows and you have a virtually unstopable swarm of 18 minions with no archery special abilities and no skirmish events. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
