TADA!<br />
<br />
what&#39;s the title mean? go to homestarrunner.com and click on Strong Bad E-mail. I&#39;ll wait.<br />
<br />
now you know, wasn&#39;t that great?<br />
<br />
A Cup of Ice. Heh.<br />
<br />
So, whether you are familiar with my decks or not you should know by now that the one thing I prize most in my decks is versatility. Why should you know this? I just told you!<br />
<br />
This deck originated from my current obsession with Faramir, Ithilien Ranger and his ability to start the game with 2 (potential)archer companions, with a sure early Aragorn supplied by multiple copies in a small deck. The deck also spawns from me having 3 copies of Wingfoot Foil, which means I find was to play him regardless of whether he fits the theme of the deck. Luckily, this time he does. This deck has 2 theoretical starts, but I&#39;m sure you can see the ones I won&#39;t mention. <br />
<br />
Ideally, you will go first, show the the Legolas puller site and start Faramir, Merry and Pippin. You pull Legolas and hopefully get down Gorn for cheap. If you feel intuition of an Enquea and aren&#39;t holding a Defend it and Hope, don&#39;t pull Legolas, as Gorn is stronger fighter. <br />
<br />
If your opponent goes first and starts a site you can use (pull Gorn...ummm, nothing else really ) then you start the 2 Hobbits and Faramir, if you can&#39;t use it and know that an early Greenleaf will benefit you more than 2 Hobbits and a cheap Gorn, start Legolas and Faramir. Legolas is a good start against Dunland, Uruks and Nazgul but usually a poor one against Moria (believe it or not) and Trackers(which, I guess, are Uruks). <br />
<br />
The deck works by sort-of choking(more like conservation of pool than denial) and then doling out more wounds than a shadow can take. Very much like the RBR deck I have posted, this deck can win fights AND out wound a shadow side. The difference here is that this deck does not need to dedicate all the cards to keeping an opponent roaming. The down side is that when both decks are running at full tilt, the RBR deck is much stronger while this deck is much easier to get and keep running at full tilt. <br />
<br />
WOUNDS<br />
<br />
archery = wounds, and 3 undirected is not too bad to have throwing up every turn. suplemented by Gondor Bowmen and pokes from Legs and Gorn and you&#39;ve got a potent barrier between Frodo and minions.<br />
<br />
conditions = wounds, and Cliffs, Citadel and Gondor Bowmen(already mentioned) can kill minions that made it through the volley.<br />
<br />
events = Defend it and Hope means that you can sometimes stop Lurtz from being fierce and kill any Uruk that doesn&#39;t have a big sword. also good at stopping Enquea from tasting a kill when you need to go big fellowship and killing Dunland and the sites where archery is a joke. PATHS is swarm defense in it&#39;s purest form.<br />
<br />
other = Faramir&#39;s Bow kills Dunland dead. that is all.<br />
<br />
I think most of the card choices are fairly self emplanatory, but just in case you haven&#39;t gotten the memo, Bilbo serves as somewhat decent condition removal. I know that running only one is somewhat risky, but I only truly need him against Moria (and on the rare occassion, Sauron)<br />
and in that match I am pretty much dissadvantaged most of the time. Against Moria you pretty much just play it by ear. If they get the conditions out in the early game, pray that they don&#39;t kill you and single move. If they apear to have gotten a bad draw, and you&#39;ve gotten a good one, double move every time. <br />
<br />
The Shadow is inspired, to some degree, by Alan Sagan&#39;s Big Uruks deck he posted on DGMA. It is mostly big Uruks and ways to get them back and will usually get the stop but rarely the kill.<br />
The best I can do as far as strategy here is explain questionable cards and give matchups.<br />
<br />
Q&#39;s CARDS!<br />
<br />
Desert Lord - this guy is the ideal play at site 4 and works hand in hand with Saruman, SoTE to kill any companion you want. Opponent playing Mithrandir? this is a guaranteed stop for them :)<br />
<br />
1 Troop? - well, to be honest, I only own one :)<br />
The other thing is that he ends up as Eomer bait, and I&#39;d rather just have an Advance Uruk Patrol. On the up side, this guy gets through with a Spear, and you have a fun game against Rohan.<br />
<br />
Mauher? - did a double take there, did ya? <br />
Mauher is the guy you play when it seems stupid to play anything. He will not die, and while him living will be a bit expensive it makes a difference sometimes. Besides, he&#39;s cheap and I didn&#39;t want to put in another Captain, as they apear to be unique.<br />
<br />
MATCHUPS!<br />
<br />
Rohan - get a Spear through and the game is yours. Between 3 Spears, Black Traitor and Saruman&#39;s Power you should get one through eventually. The key will be how soon the Spear goes through, and how many horses you skewer.<br />
<br />
Gandalf - save Snows for site 5 if you get it that early, as Servant/Trust etc. can make winning fights tough sometimes. Do enough damage at the site with Snows, and you&#39;ll win the game. Ents should be a relatively easy match, as you&#39;ll get enough pool to drop multiple large minions on them. Make sure you use the Captain as minion pullers and not cheap minions, as they will definitely die. Kill Lindenroot ASAP. <br />
<br />
Elves - laugh, and save 2 Broad Bladed Swords and big minions to ream them at site 5. Against Gondor/Elves, kill last Alliance and you kill fellowship. Troop is a good card here. <br />
<br />
Hobbits - run with the fellowship, as the choke they likely have will make playing even one minion before site 5 a tough concept. discard a minion every turn.<br />
<br />
<br />
that seems to cover most everything, if you have any questions D-Mail me and I&#39;ll get back ASAP. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
