Please re-read my request for constructive criticism. I do not appreciate comments like "Pipes are crap" or "Don&#39;t use Gandalf". I am not a fan of pipes either, but this deck is about pipes, and thus do I request objective criticism on how to improve the mechanics of the deck, and not subjective views of the nature of pipes. Sure, they may not be the winning deck now, but how sick are you of seeing all those Big Fellowship/Uruks decks dominating, and suffocating the joy and and spirit of creativity, and the expansion of it? Cats copy cats, why not open your mind to a deck to make others kneel?<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>EDIT 1</b><br>
<br><br>
You might like to take out Gandalf&#39;s Staff for Wizard Staff, and fit Narya in, perhaps remove Gandalf&#39;s Pipe or Gandalf&#39;s Staff. Why? With Wizard Staff and Glamdring and everything out, Gandalf is 13 strength (excellent against Nazgûl), and can make a minion -6 strength. Picture this.<br>
<br><br>
Boromir exerts once to +3 to Merry, Friend to Sam with Hobbit Sword. Merry exerts twice to +8 to Aragorn + Ranger&#39;s Sword skirmishing Cave Troll. Gandalf exerts twice twice to -6 to Cave Troll. 18-9. Bring on Durin&#39;s Secret!<br>
<br><br>
His ability also benefits other instead of himself, and the fact that he gets to use it more than Gandalf&#39;s Staff&#39;s means Frodo&#39;s Pipe is more value for twilight money. <br>
<br><br>
Therefore,<br>
<br><br>
Remove: <br>
<br><br>
Gandalf&#39;s Staff<br>
Gandalf&#39;s Pipe<br>
<br>
Add:<br>
<br><br>
Wizard Staff<br>
Narya<br>
<br><br>
<b>END EDIT 1</b><br>
<br><br>
I am really only interested in posting interesting, and fun-looking decks which can hold their own in the tournament scene here instead of those day-to-day 9 Walkers/Uruks etc deck-types that are boring and overplayed to hell. I share with you my newest creation.<br>
<br><br>
The Free Peoples half is straightforward, utilising all the help gifted to pipeweed by the new set. Hand out the pipes and pipeweed, and smoke your pains away. It embodies massive healing, big archery, strong skirmishing and denial.<br>
<br><br>
Note that all of the companions in this deck (except Frodo man himself) have the Frodo signet. Also note that of these, three: Legolas, Boromir and Merry, and also Aragorn and Gandalf when outfitted with Bow, Staff, Glamdring etc, have useful exertion abilities. Thus is Frodo&#39;s Pipe a valuable asset in this deck, allowing you to recycle their abilities. Aragorn&#39;s Pipe takes on a broader spectrum. Say three of your companions have 1 wound each? Aragorn&#39;s Pipe. Aragorn has 3 wounds on him? Frodo&#39;s Pipe. Skipping sanctuaries is definitely a viable strategy with this deck. The massive healing means that Legolas and Aragorn can almost always get to shoot, and the Boromir-Merry tag-team can pump other companions to win their skirmishes or even prevent an overwhelm.<br>
<br><br>
A denial element is also present. The fact that Heir to the White City has been chosen over the other versions of Aragorn is because he has the Frodo signet, but I have expanded the denial concept. Gimli can prove extremely useful at Sites 4-5, and himself also has the Frodo signet. The Gaffer&#39;s Pipe combined with Aragorn&#39;s ability leaves your opponent nothing to work on until you move. Sting and Glamdring are also there to tighten the noose around Orc cultures. Sure, you don&#39;t have twilight-reduction abilities like No Stranger to the Shadows or A Talent For Not Being Seen, but you can ensure that you will always give your opponent a clean twilight pool to sweat on.<br>
<br><br>
To justify the choices of companion versions: Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir is to heal Bilbo, who is to recycle pipeweed and a candidate for bearing Bilbo&#39;s Pipe. Heir to the White City has the Frodo signet for repeated directed archery and is utilised for denial purposes. Friend of the Shire-folk has the Frodo signet, and can reach 10 strength un-boosted with the full fellowship out, and even more with his toys. Dwarf of the Mountain-race has the Frodo signet and can deny. Greenleaf has the Frodo signet for repeated directed archery. Son of Denethor has the Frodo signet, and can boost Frodo out of a sticky situation especially on the later sites, or boost Merry to increase his strength (5 base with Hobbit Sword) so that he can add 8 or 11 strength to another companion possibly for overwhelming or simply to win a skirmish (i.e. key with Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe and Bow of the Galadhrim) or prevent an overwhelm. Merry...just mentioned.<br>
<br><br>
A literally &#39;secret&#39; tech in this deck is to pitch Durin&#39;s Secret when you get it early (unless you Sting and find nothing in his hand), then when you really need it at Site 6 or something (late-game is when this deck is near-invincible), fetch it with Barliman Butterbur. Hopefully, you will still have Gandalf, Gimli and Legolas to spot then. The 2-twilight is a non-factor with so many denial capabilities for the Free Peoples. For Moria or Sauron decks which are content to sit back and let you run on<br>
<br><br>
Against Moria, your big archery and Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe, with denial + Sleep negate the swarm extremely well. Against Uruks, big archery is again a factor, with denial, Armor, big Aragorn and the Boromir-Merry tag-team aiding you. Against Isengard Orcs, your massive healing totally ignores their abilities. Gimli especially is scary. He is Damage +2 with Battle Axe and Battle Axe triggers when he wins a skirmish, meaning he is dealing out 4 wounds to those puny Orcs. Sleep if you&#39;re Trapped and Alone. Against Sauron, again, big archery, and denial + Sleep is awesome. Against Nazgûl, admittedly, it does look a little weak for the double-move. Hopefully, you can get Aragorn and Gandalf with their full kit out and use Gimli and Legolas to win key skirmishes. Be wary of Black Breaths. You own Blade Tips.<br>
<br><br>
For shadow, Moria swarm to create a card-cycling synergy with the Free Peoples side. 4 each of the &#39;core units&#39; and multiple copies of the &#39;core conditions&#39;. Extremely straightforward. Key combos include Flankers or Keyward + Moria Axe to simulate a mini-Cave Troll. A Flanker or two on Swarms can hinder double-moves extremely well. 2 copies of Enquea might seem excessive but then, the number of big fellowships walking around is WAY too excessive.<br>
<br><br>
The only new addition to this traditional Moria swarm is Such a Little Thing. Lord of Gondor is getting really annoying these days, defeating the murderous purposes of your Trolls and Balrogs, and don&#39;t neglect the Boromir-Horn decks. With just one card, you can cripple it in half. If your opponent isn&#39;t using Boromir, just pitch it to They are Coming.<br>
<br><br>
For a start, the bid is your choice. Site 1 is pretty important. Gandalf&#39;s Cart may not be essential for a victory as you do have They are Coming on the shadow side, but it can definitely speed your deck up. 2 is safest, 3 or 4 riskier. You do have Gandalf&#39;s Staff for burden-removal, but the pressing worry is you might not get the burdens down before the Nazgûl come knocking, and uncannily, that always happens.<br>
<br><br>
There are 24 possessions in this 80-card (79 in draw deck) deck. Trollshaw is a no-brainer. Courtyard helps for some early denial: your Moria Orcs shouldn&#39;t be scared of it. Stairway is big: Gimli can deduct the twilight number to 0, while on the other side, a Cave Troll + Hammer (Damage +2), Flankers + Moria Axe (Damage +2) or even Scavenger + Scimitar (Damage +1) can wreak serious havoc. Site 6 is a no-brainer and (hey, you have Gift of Boats? Check that out, *I* can triple-move, you can&#39;t!). Site 7 may sound a little strange to you, so I&#39;ll explain here. Usually by Site 7, I should have already got Bilbo to shuffle back all the pipeweed I need (if he shuffles more after that, I may not even draw them), and don&#39;t really need him anymore. As for Barliman, his task is to grab Durin&#39;s Secret from the discard pile at Site 6. Any later and he&#39;s useless. Shores is the best site for Moria. Site 9...your choice between Emyn Muil (Flankers, Keyward, Scout) or Summit, though I&#39;d prefer the latter.<br>
<br><br>
Hope you liked this propaganda for the new generation of pipeweed decks. Constructive criticism please, thanks.     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
