<br>
There are a lot of reviews coming in about adding in cards from ROTEL.  While these suggestions are good, and I do appreciate them, please consider that this deck was made and played prior to the erratas or to ROTEL coming out.  With that in mind, keep it up.  I love most of the feedback I&#39;m getting from this deck.  Its really helping.<br>
<br>
********END UPDATE********<br>
<br>
This is the deck that took me 7-1 at the Utah TOC, helping me make it to and win the final.  There are a lot of cards that others would probably add in or take out.  Let me explain the choices of the deck to you before you go flaming it on a review.  Fair deal??<br>
<br>
Why no Boromir?  Boromir is the 5th companion.  When playtesting this deck with Hag and Nathan, we found that Uruk-hai rely heavily on their opponent having 5 companions.  Without 5 they pretty much fall apart as they have a harder time winning their skirmishes and are fierce less of the time.  You may be saying well then why Sam??  Sam is in the deck to die, plain and simple.  If you get him early he can stealth at the bridge, taking on the cave troll, Balrog, etc.  And then since his ability lasts until the regroup phase, he can take them again and die.  He is also really good if you get him later as he can dirtnap it at site 7, 8 or 9 by going defender +1 and taking out two minions.  He&#39;s better than Boromir as most people try to keep Boromir around, but you just don&#39;t need the traitor anyways.  And since we expected to see a lot of Uruk-hai, this seemed like the deck to play.<br>
<br>
Where the F@$# is Elrond?  Since this deck requires you to be sneaky, Elrond was a Liablility.  There is no guarentee that you are going to draw Galadriel first to make him free and so thats 4 extra twilight added into the pool, not good when you have limited companions.  The deck cycles pretty good anyways with Gwemigil and pitching a card every turn.  Pitching a card every turn is key to the decks survival.  It makes it work so much better and faster, plus it helps you get through your deck quickly and efficiently.<br>
<br>
Why no Elf Lords cards??  Since this deck was played at the UT:TOC, Elf Lords wasn&#39;t legal at the time and so none of the cards are listed here in this deck as this it an exact copy of the deck I won with.  I&#39;ll probably do an update on what I would change/add in now that Elf Lords is legal, but not here in the original post.<br>
<br>
How to play the game with this deck.  I usually end up bidding 0 - 1, depending on my opponent and what I think my opponent will be doing (duh).  If given the option, I will go first, it guarentees me Aragorn and I&#39;m already ahead, win win situation.  Don&#39;t worry about getting your sties out, Nelya can do that for you so your opponent will still have a tough time getting to the Sanctuary.  If I lose the bid and end up going second to a deck that doesn&#39;t start the Prancing Pony, I&#39;m not worried as there are 3 aragorns in the deck, you will have him by site 4.  This just gives your opponent less twilight to play their minions with and the "Wonder Twins" can pretty much walk to site 3 with no problem.<br>
<br>
At the sanctuary you will move to site 4 and stop, unless you can tell that they are totally getting screwed and then move to 5.  Sam can help at the bridge as can Thrarin if you need him.  From site 4 you double jump to site 6.  Your allies will add to the archery total and are also able to fight.  If you have the map by then map for your site 6.  It makes your allies able to fight if you get in a pinch, plus its a forrest for ARV.  You will never die on site 6.  After site 6 you want to save as many of the stealths as you can.  They will be key when you move to site 9.  THEY KEEP FRODO ALIVE!!  Oh yes, don&#39;t forget to mirror the whole while also.  I killed 2 Cave Trolls and the Balrog in one game with the mirror.  It is that good.  I usually ended up running into site 9 for the win or overwhelming my opponent early (site 3 or 4).<br>
<br>
A little bit of added tech here, if you draw Asfaloth before you go underground, give it to one of your allies (preferably Galadriel) and then transfer it to Arwen when you come out from the bridge.  Mad tech going on here.<br>
<br>
The shadow in this deck is pretty standard.  I love Cantea, that is why there are 4 of him in the deck.  Nobody likes seeing him come down and usually don&#39;t move against him.  The All Blades Perish and Not Easily Destroyed pretty much are for ARV, although if they have a huge fellowship you can drop Enquea and with the Not Easily Destroyed he acts like a virtual machine gun as long as they have 6 companions.  Kill whoever you want, Aragor, Gandalf, the possibilities are endless.<br>
<br>
Why not Stricken Dumb as opposed to Beauty is fading??  Although I am playing 3 Witch Kings and it is a cost of 2 vs. 5 to play.  Stricken Dumb only gets rid of weapons or conditions.  Beauty is Fading can get rid of any condition or posession.  So if the mirror is getting annoying, its gone.  If they have a map that is destroying you its gone.  Not to mention that if they have no conditions or posessions, because you killed all of those companions then it gets rid of a companion also.  Its amazing and more versatile!  Thats why it made the cut.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions regarding the deck or the strategy, D-mail me and I&#39;ll be happy to answer them.  If there is something you don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t just rate the deck poorly because you don&#39;t understand it.  Ask me.  I&#39;m more than willing to explain it. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
