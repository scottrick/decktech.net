It would be nice to go first so judge according to the person you&#39;re playing against.  You can use Nelya to get out your sites when you really need them such as Bree Streets and The Ford.  <br />
    The fellowship isn&#39;t that hard to play with.  Mainly power-ups and weapons to protect them.  If you find yourself falling behind use An Able Guide to help you move.  Most minions don&#39;t stick around against this deck.  I would take it slow at the front until you are ready for The Bridge.  After that you can charge ahead of your opponite.<br />
    The shadow side is my favorite side to play.  Most players do not like Nazgul because of the high twilight cost.  I think I have curred that problem farrly well with the Morgul Gates and Goblin Runners.  This will help in trying to get out as many Nazgul a turn you can.  The conditions are the same as all Nazgul decks.  You sould know what to do with them.  I have also choosen the Nazgul I did because of the fact that they&#39;re fierce.  Most people have to empty out their hand to take one the first time and have nothing the second time.  One of my favorite Nazgul is Cantea.  He can get rid of a lot of anoying cards such as Ranger&#39;s Sword, Blade of Gondor, and Flaming Brand (which can kill a Nazgul Deck) and many other great weapons.<br />
    Basically that&#39;s it.  A very strong fighting deck.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about this deck is that it is a little to big.  I tried to limit the cards but couldn&#39;t bring myself to get rid of any more.  Hopefully you will think my deck was worth looking at.  Thank you. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
