Mabe its a  little huge, but filter with They stole it and catapults is brutal. If you are at site 9, you are almost without draw deck.<br />
<br />
Sites. Sites are very important. Always go second!<br />
Only Mere of dead faces and north undeep is here to product some kind of twilith and - HELPs almost to none opponent. <br />
<br />
Shortly - 2 is Mere of dead faces. 4 is Crags of emyn muil - you need time to get gollum combo (they stole it+promise keeping), slag mounds is breaking site - if you are sure, this card could win a game.<br />
<br />
FP - I have chosen knights, because they are able survive brutal discard with They stole it and can throught 6th levels take out discarded conditions.<br />
<br />
Start only with Alcarin+Ingold - maybe Derufin against corasairs or Besiegers. And only 4th levels and shoot, shoot, shoot. The one ring RoR gives a great chances to survive almost everything. Problem are new orcs witch burdening - there isnt many events...so...its hard.<br />
<br />
Shadow - classic combo They stole it + Promise keeping.<br />
At first sites pull out Mad thing and filter with BOTH sides to get combo. After combo arrival pull Stinker - one kill = one burden. After few sites Enqea have a free range - witch slag mounds it means many burdens, with not yet vanqished it means a LOT of burdens (I corrupted 12 res Frodo witch new ring). Shelob deny to fight Theoden with kings mail etc. <br />
At the end, in 90% ringbearer gets corrupted. Only a few survives to get ovewhelmed by shelob and gollum.<br />
Just a few things - hobitses are dead - discard it with TSI and pump shelob with it. <br />
Not yet vanqished - late its key card - fiercing shelob, enqea, sometimes sauron = burden.<br />
Sauron - just one - discard him, later, he will rise with Evil smelling fens...5 threats and 5 burdens = sauron for 8...and Gollum dont eat many twilith.<br />
Evil smelling fens - also important - web &quot;kiiled&quot;? use evil smelling fens...shelob, sauron, enqea (fot second, third...he is still alive???)<br />
Frenzied attack is there for later times - shelob wounding for 2 damage and using promise keeping? massacre...<br />
<br />
Problem 1 - Dwarfs - they choke, they dicard, they are 4 vit (sometimes 5). Pull out as many conditions as you can - blood runs chill cant take all of them. Also deny Durin and Linnar - fight witch Gimli - for assigment you have threats and burdens - gollum uses both. Dwarfs can be killed, but it takes a longer time.<br />
<br />
Problem 2 - knights - not so big problem. Just saplings - you will hate them. With right site and enqea - destrouy 6th level. At the end, they will be out of fots, saplings and full of exertions...<br />
<br />
Problem 3 - Gandalf - this is REAL problem. Deep, Sleep...it almost kills gollum...but be patient...in deck is combo 4x... Kill Gandalf soon as possible - you have YaLaT + TSI + PK = kill one turn...just kill him...<br />
<br />
So, go SECOND. He cant use his sites. No pulling Gandalf back, no protection from fierce, no denying skirmish abilities...just exertion, burdening, burdening and burdening...<br />
