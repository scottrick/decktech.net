    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">   This deck is purely in it&#39;s expierimental phase, both sides are lots of fun to play (the couple times I have played it so far) but need alittle altering and tweaking (hopefully decktech will help with that &#39;eh?).  <br />
<br />
Obviously enough the Fellowship is based around our favorite king of gondor.  Use gimli at site one to grab a condition to start some tokens goin.  everyone gets horses &#39;cept for gimli (he&#39;s not to graceful) And hopefully their weapons.  Gimli and Lego pump each other, and when gimli wins, you get tokens, remove the tokens to heal him (yay).  If you get Legolas wining skirmishes and getting tokens, Aragorn has plenty of overwhelming potential.  If anything is left over hopefully Aragorn has a horse (he should get the first one you draw) and you can wound it with some rohan tokens.  <br />
<br />
   And the Shadow, Also lots of fun.  Use your trackers to get out under the watching eye, and get those black breaths out.  Your opponent will probably try to save acouple companions from getting the black breath if they can help it....that&#39;s what you bring great evil is for.  with them having to exert for moving and not being able to heal those wounds will add up quickly and make things interesting.  If you start getting nazgul clogged, don&#39;t be afriad to drop acouple of &#39;em, you have two skulkers in there to pop cards back into your draw deck, which shouldn&#39;t hinder the fellowship much because once afew token conditions get out, they don&#39;t need to much more than what&#39;s on the table.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve only played this afew times, but it came together pretty well.  But of course, all advice is welcome. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
