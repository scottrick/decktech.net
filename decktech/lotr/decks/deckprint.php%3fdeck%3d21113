    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok so everyone has seen the Twilight Choke that is so cool cause it is Twilight Denial and hand denial for the opponent. While the Pee deck must win by killing the opponent, This deck uses the best of both worlds but has the ability to win by THREE different ways: moving to site nine, by killing Frodo, or by using the Irresistible Shadow.<br>
<br>
Here&#39;s how it works, and it&#39;s tweaked out against the metagame. The fellowship is pretty standard, use the twilight denial cards as well as the Versatility&#39;s to kill what few minions they can play. Stealh your way to six and then Versatility takes over. NEVER EVER discard Versatility, it wins you the game. Since everyone knows how to play the fellowship, I&#39;ll get on to the Shadow.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s even harder for your opponent to get to their cards than not letting them draw by putting them in the graveyard. So how do we do that? Desperate Measures. Play an Orc, mill them for five. Desperate Defense of the Ring is the fuel for the fire. Most decks only have one or two big fighters to go along with the targeted archery guys (or the choke deck has ONE guy that fights), and if they choose to discard the cards instead of take the burden, that&#39;s three less cards they&#39;re going to have to stop you. Decks, if built properly, require ALL of the resources in them. It&#39;s usual, with the Hand Destruction of the Inquisitor, Band of the Eye and the Tower Lt., as well as the Library Destruction of the Desperate measures, to destroy 20 of their cards. <br>
<br>
Of course, you have contingency cards. Hate is amazing in the way it can turn the tide of the game by taking out that Aragorn/Gandalf/Legolas at a crucial time. Can&#39;t destroy your opponent&#39;s massive deck but need to take out that massive fellowship? Use Enquea to eliminate them. The Scouting Band, War Band, and Band of the Eye are just monsters that are hard to deal with. Note no Morgul Hunter, he&#39;s too expensive and doesn&#39;t have any cool abilities to crush them with. Finally, should they get to site nine, u have the ability to play three Ambushers from the graveyard to overwhelm Frodo. Of course, that will be hard to do with their Versatilities and PATHS in the graveyard. This deck is a monster in tournament play, often causing all but the highest level players to become morally discouraged, and as any serious M:TG player can tell you, that&#39;s all it takes to CRUSH them. Enjoy, and please, thoughtful reviews only; having spent enough time on this that I know it works, let me know why you think it doesn&#39;t. And if you have suggestions as to what to put in, think about what you would have to take out first. Thanks for reading.<br>
