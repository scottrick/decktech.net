Free Peoples:<br />
<br /><br />
 <br />
<br /><br />
-Frodo, TT: Gandalf Signet and removes burdens with Sam.<br />
<br /><br />
-Pippin: He subtracts two from both Aragorn and Gandalf. Too much twilight is a problem with this deck.<br />
<br /><br />
-Boromir, DoMT: Gandalf signet and can heal himself.<br />
<br /><br />
-Gandalf, Shirefolk instead of White Wizard: White Wizard is just too iffy for me. Seriously, when does the opponent not use all the twilight.<br />
<br /><br />
-Albert: Kills Weapons and Armories.<br />
<br /><br />
-Treebeard: Heal cycle.<br />
<br /><br />
-Jarnsmid: In my opinion, he is an overlooked card. –1 to most possessions is helpful.<br />
<br /><br />
-Betrayal of Isengard: Evil Saruman is put down. I know I’m hypocritical.<br />
<br /><br />
-Sam’s Pack: Helps Frodo stays alive and gives me a better incentive to put archery on Frodo. Also, it makes Sam a burden-removing goddess. Goes on Frodo.<br />
<br /><br />
-The two Ranger’s Sword copies: A product of my indecisiveness. (Actually, I have had some good luck at getting the right one at the right time.)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I normally bid 1-2 because I don’t really need Legolas. If they go first I get more companions in my hand next turn so more power to them. I kill off Pippin and Sam as quickly as I can after they do their duty so I’m back under Enquea and Greed.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
 I play as much stuff at site 1 because I have Pippin who I can kill off if I absolutely have to. Also, Gandalf and Aragorn cost –2 with Pippin out so I don’t give my opponent that much. With both Sting and Glamdring, I can slow down Sauron and Moria.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
If I get both Gandalf and A Wizard is Never Late in my hand, I pull the ally that helps my the most at the moment. Albert vs. Moria or Uruk Archery, Jarnsmid if my hand has a bunch of possessions, and Treebeard if I’m at site 1 and I am in need of a extra fighter at two (and again later at 8).<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
 I use Sleep only if I have to because Trust Me is incredibly important. It’ sometimes nice to rid the opponent of his 10 Moria conditions or whatever stuff he’s packing. I don’t use Grown Suddenly tall cause I find that 5 twilight is just too much. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
With all of Frodo’s stuff, Frodo gets up to a 7 so he can actually handle some minions if he must. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Between Sam and Narya, burdens shouldn’t really be a problem. Sam’s Pack also helps by letting Sam remove more burdens.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The only thing I only worry about with this deck is Nazgul cause if Gandalf gets a Black Breath on him, it limits my Trust Me ability. My only protection against that is basically Sleep, so that is a little weak. Luckily Nazgul don’t get a boost from the new set so I don’t see it too much.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Sauron with Enduring Evil can be annoying, but I have enough burden removal I think.  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Shadow:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
This is just a typical beat down-swarm Uruk deck. With Saruman, my Uruk-hai are extremely resilient and they are fierce. Site 5 and 7 are my beat down sites. The shadow is actually pretty successful at killing, but if not I can always just slow then down enough for the fellowship to site win.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
-Uruk Ravager: Extremely cheap with Saruman.<br />
<br /><br />
-Ulaire Nertea- Gets Enquea, troops, or lieutenants back.<br />
<br /><br />
-Enquea- Uruk are a little less effective against big fellowships. Now they are.<br />
<br /><br />
-Greed- Possibly most powerful card in here if they play a big fellowship. If you get it early, you can just wait for the big fellowship to come and then remove all the pool to exhaust everyone. Then they meet Enquea.<br />
<br /><br />
-Grima-Once in a while he screws them over bad.<br />
<br /><br />
-Beyond the Height of Men: To combat heavily used armor decks.<br />
<br /><br />
-Saruman’s Power: To get rid of Trust Me and archery stuff.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I just like to thank Alex Helmke for the beautiful deck name.<br />
