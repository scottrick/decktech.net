The deck is designed to Toss up a huge amount of unaimed archery every turn, hopefully not having to fight, but keeps itself well equipped enough to fight the guys that make it by. Heres your ideal setup:<br />
<br />
Aragorn- Sword, Brand, Alliance, Saga, Bow. He is now 14 strength, 6 against Nazgul and is an archer. You&#39;re not usually gonna exert him to shoot, he just adds to the total. Your fighter.<br />
<br />
Arwen- Sword, Horse, Bow. She&#39;s your expendable companion. If you have a choice, lose her. able to fight, and GREAT against Nazgul.<br />
<br />
Legolas- important companion #1. Bow, Knives, Saga and Splendor makes him an archery machine. A potential of 5 archery from just him, and able to be healed thrice every turn, thanks to Galadriel, Elrond and Aragorn. Very cool.<br />
<br />
Galadriel- heals your elves, namely Legolas, and can pinch hit for Thror&#39;s Map, although the site this deck fears the most is the only one she IS able to pick. Actually a good card.<br />
<br />
Elrond - most important Ally. Able to heal 2 companions in the regroup, facillitating easy late game double moving, if he has his ring. Key.<br />
<br />
Filbert- cancel those Fierce skirmishes, namely the one of the Balrog, which is the only minion this deck can have problems with. <br />
<br />
Thrarin- the other solution to the Balrog. try not to let him die against Uruks. Raiders.....<br />
<br />
so, the Free Peoples side is mainly designed to keep up with the opponent, stay with them when you can, just don;t let them get 2 sites ahead, and stay within Boats range. You can triple move easily once you get set up, you just need to stall long enough to get that way. Thats what the shadow is for.<br />
<br />
weaknesses- site 7, the Anduin Wilderland. This site can truly screw you, so you need to be ready for it. Luckily, most people are playing archery these days, but you WILL run into it. I had to go to it twice yesterday in the tournament, and I made it through. Spies can be sentinelsed, as can any other condition. <br />
Uruks. because of Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry, you can lose Arwen or Legolas easily, so try to get the Tale on Legolas as soon as possible. Just don;t lose Legolas, thats all I can tell you. <br />
<br />
SHADOW  this is a standard Uruk deck, using pumpers and fiercness to stop, and sometimes kill, an opponents fellowship. The only tricks are the Raiders w/ Tower Assassins, which I&#39;m sure someone had already posted.  Basicaly, the Tower Assassins get AT LEAST one ally in the dead pile, and then your 2 cost, 9 and fierce Uruk Raiders proceed to wreck the fellowship. <br />
Other tricks? Goblin Scrabblers. They stop lots of things. Kill Gift of Boats, The Tale, Last Alliance, White Arrows, Shoulder to Shoulder and even Splendor, if you run into another deck like this.<br />
Play your Boosters when you can, always win a fight if you can, even if they have armor. A wound is a wound.<br />
Saruman can win games, but he IS a little expensive, so I am just using two of him, replacing 2 of the Spies that would normally be in here. <br />
<br />
QUESTIONS!<br />
<br />
No Double Shot? -well, I tend to have a good enough archery total to avoid clogging my hand with these cards, plus I think that one extra wound per card just isn&#39;t efficient enough.<br />
<br />
No Gondor Bowmen? - I like this card, but could find room. I guess you could do a thing with Aragorn but instead of his possessions, use the Bowmen. I didn&#39;t have time to test it out, but it might work. I just prefer not to put all my eggs in one basket.<br />
<br />
Legolas, SoT SUCKS! - granted, he&#39;s no Greenleaf, but IS better at archery than Greenleaf, and in a deck thats not giving a lot of twilight to begin with, an archery total of 7 is going to kill almost everything. <br />
<br />
Well, I guess thats about it. If you have any questions, ask me, but this deck is actually pretty cool. Thanks for looking.<br />
