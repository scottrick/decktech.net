<br />
Bid to go first.  Usually that means 4.  Try not to bid 5...that&#39;s just inviting some of the nastier Nazgul cards.  You have one Sam, so if you absolutely have to, start Arwen and him to get rid of your burdens, otherwise start Arwen and Gloin.  Exert Frodo to play Bilbo, play Council of Elrond to get the Redbook out, and your drawing is all set up.  You have 9 dwarven tales you can play to draw a card, plus 4x tidings of erebor which doubles as twilight reduction if they cancel it.  those tales also make gloin power 9 all the time, 13 against orcs.  beneath the mountains plus hand axes is just sick, you can use them for archery and then play them from your discard next turn.  or save them for use with Flurry of Blows against the Balrog.  Shoulder to Shoulder keeps your Gimli and Arwen healed up.  <br />
<br />
your Shadow side is a tried and true Moria weapons deck.  keep your goblin spearmen at damage +3 and build swarms around them, you should be fine.  mithril mine and relics plus 4xScavengers helps you get all your weapons on the table each turn, and goblin armory ensures that it pays to do so.  Relentless just plain kills your opponent, no argument there.  i use the whip only because it ensures that whoever faces the Balrog will lose armor and helms, so he really hurts (if he wins).  but its not even so necessary that he win the skirmishes...i just like to get him out there because it makes swarms of goblins almost impossible to deal with.  they give me too much twilight, they will die.<br />
<br />
all of this at the cost of a 100 card deck.  i know it looks big, it looks way too big, in fact.  but look at all the drawing i&#39;m doing.  redbook of westmarch draws cards for my 9 tales.  i get stopped at site 2 and i draw cards for each of the 8 possessions i play.  at site 3, i draw cards for the two hobbit allies i play.  i discard like mad with beneath the mountains and gwemegil.  tidings of erebor draws cards during the regroup phase so i can move and still be strong.  Great Works also discards 2 so i can take 1 card from discard into hand.  and on my shadow side, i&#39;ll be playing those scimitars all the time.  and i&#39;ll be discarding mad cards with TAC to get my goblins out.  i won&#39;t have problems with a deck this big.  i just wish i could fit more delving into it...<br />
<br />
thanks for checking this out.  thanks for reviewing it and trying to help me out with it.<br />
