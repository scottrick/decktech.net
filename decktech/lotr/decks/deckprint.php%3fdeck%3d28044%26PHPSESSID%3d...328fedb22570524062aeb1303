Like it says, this is the deck I used to go 4-4 and get 41st place at the Vegas Premier Series, my first ever premier series tournament.  The focus of the deck is avoiding the site 5 uruk bomb and the site 7 moria bomb, as well as be strong against freaky shadows.  the shadow side is intended to slow down my opponent and even possibly destroy him late if he underestimates and doubles.<br />
<br />
The fellowship was first developed (at least in our area) by my brother Mike, so he deserves special props (and also slops because he&#39;s so insistent on getting credit for it).  The point is to use undirected/directed archery with Greenleaf and Aragorn, combined with the incredibly high strength of Eomer and Aragorn, with Gandalf&#39;s ability to kill Saruman with Betrayal.  Thus, you only really have to deal with a very small number of uruks against that type of deck.  Filibert Bolger is the only ally, and he&#39;s not even that necessary against uruks because of betrayal and the natural strength of the deck, so against uruk decks i almost always discard him so i don&#39;t run afoul of uruk raiders and stalkers.<br />
<br />
The uruk bomb itself is one of the strengths of this deck.  No matter how you slice it, the uruk bomb requires 12 twilight to set up (8 at the Deep of Helm).  Pathfinder your own site 5, move to it with 5 companions and no extra twilight thanks to HttWC, and your opponent is stuck holding a bunch of uruks they can&#39;t play.  The only problem you run into is if your opponent drops a bunch of uruk raiders first, but those guys should be no trouble anyway.  And if they try uruk bomb without saruman koi, you just use gorn&#39;s bow to destroy all those regulars.<br />
<br />
Moria is a bit more tricky; pathfinder is of course for site 7 in this situation.  I decided not to go with any kind of maneuver wounding for the hand/moria orc combo deck, partially because i didn&#39;t really think it existed...stupid, i know, but no one in my area had even attempted to play it, and it does have the ring of a hoax deck (like hag&#39;s hand orcs/yellow guys comments on the buzzboard).  The only real problem I had with moria was the cave troll, since my companions can generally take on everybody else.  my solution is to let him take 1-2 directed archery shots, and assign him to eomer holding his spear and a flaming brand.  with those two weapons, eomer beats an exhausted cave troll, or requires only one pump from Help in Doubt and Need.  the other flaming brand goes on Aragorn to make sure his 11 beats a scavenger with scimitar so they don&#39;t end up on swarms.  Betrayal + directed archery + fortress never fallen = moria has little chance against me once i get fully set up.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t expecting a lot of nazgul against this deck, but i had already packed 2xflaming brand for purposes of pumping aragorn, eomer, and eowyn against other decks.  against nazgul, my plan was to drop both flaming brands on eomer rather than his spear, since that + firefoot = natural 15 against a nazgul.  help in doubt and need + fortress never fallen = nazgul either don&#39;t win against me and i discard their black breaths and blade tips to make sure they don&#39;t hurt me at all.  there is nothing more fun than running against nazgul knowing they can&#39;t hurt you.<br />
<br />
Even though everyone at Vegas had to have at least 1 premier point, i figured there would be some scrubs (like me) slipping in anyway, so i developed strategies for beating several other decks as well.  against easterlings, i added another gorn&#39;s bow because directed archery reduces their guards and lieutenants to uselessness.  against dunland, aragorn&#39;s bow also helps out a lot, as does my pathfinder making sure they don&#39;t get the pull saruman or weapons +2 site, both of which tend to seriously help out dunland.  betrayals also hurt hill chief, ring of isengard, and saruman rabble rouser.  help in doubt and need is naturally good against dunland, because they have little condition removal, so with my archery they are only able to play 1-2 minions per site, which i can pump my guys high enough to beat, thus preserving my weapons in tact.  filibert bolger usually finds himself being discarded rather than played against these guys, since a dunlending warrior plus a war club is bad news.<br />
<br />
As for my shadow side...I have played nazgul forever and still have not discovered how to play them right.  I dropped down the number of black steeds and eliminated the nazgul swords in this version, because in past tournaments i was having problems getting those out at the right sites and accidently clogging my hand by not playing them right (i am a bit stupid).  so this time i went with 2xgrima wormtongue and 4 of each BB/BT so i could get some possession removal on eomer and aragorn to make sure my nazgul could win without a lot of extra stuff hanging off of them.  also, few people suspect two wormtongues (some never expect to see 1).  so the super best site would be where i play twilight nelya, lemenya, the witch-king, and wormtongue.  nelya goes around handing out 2 wounds, the witchking just keeps overwhelming because everyone is str -2, etc.  however, i didn&#39;t playtest enough and now realize that this deck ends up putting wimpy nazgul into my opening hand far too often.  so it kind of needs work, despite definitely being a winner at locals.  right now i&#39;d drop a wormtongue, lemenya, a nertea, and one of each BB/BT, and add 2x toldea, another black steed, and something like all blades perish.  obviously the biggest hole in my strategy (then and now) is a pumped faramir...that guy just sucks and i hate him.<br />
<br />
i&#39;ll be posting a tournament report soon, &quot;VEGAS - starring Ryan French, John Curran, and Clay Alexander&quot;, if you wanna see how this deck worked out and why it only went 4-4.  thanks for your reviews.<br />
