His text reads: To Play, spot a (Rohan) Man. Skirmish: Exert Hama to discard a possession borne by a minion he is skirmishing. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
There are currently two things which Rohan has a hard time against: Dunland and Beasterlings. Dunland because of low vitality and the ability to discard possessions via War Club. Voila! Assign to Hama, exert to relieve the minion of the club, which also makes it now -2 strength, you can then pump Hama with boosters or you can just let him take another wound - now that there&#39;s no consequences. You can use Hama to get rid of those pesky polearms, thus setting up a double move where you can wipe everything out with Merry&#39;s Sword and Greenleaf. If you know what your opponent&#39;s playing, and it&#39;s Dunland, I would suggest starting Eowyn and Hama, because Merry&#39;s sword won&#39;t help you much anyway. <br />
<br /><br />
You companions get huge and quickly with Simbelmyne. Leowyn cycles and heals, Deor pumps, Fortress gets rid of conditions, Arrow-slits takes care of Hides, corsair ships, and shelob&#39;s webs. Once you get set up you can double move practically every turn, and you get set up fast. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The shadow side is a lot of fun to play. Getting tokens out is very easy with Castamir and the Plunderer, who also helps you cycle. Once you have tokens you also get initiative which means you can get rid of possessions with the Black Numenorean, and with your ships you can get expensive minions out of your discard pile for free which really puts a beat-down on the fellowship and generally swarms them sooner or later. At the very least it prevents double-moving, which lets you take the easy lead with your FP&#39;s side and coast into 9 with an easy win. I added the Raider Bow/Red Wrath combo because it&#39;s something that nobody expects. Castamir with a Raider bow generally equals two dead companions, and even if not it adds 10 twilight. <br />
