This is also where I got some of my ideas, with some tweaking to the current popular deck types.<br />
<br />
Now, I have made this deck to help out in the current RotEL enviroment, not the MoM enviroment of huge fellowships + Uruks.  <br />
<br />
The Moria side is designed to pick on a small fellowship, with some beefy Orcs + swarming abilities.  Enquea is there to help if there are some 9 person fellowships still, to pick off the archers and men, so no more defender +1.  I find this mix of Orcs to be the most effective, with Scavengers and Runners doing the work and Scouts and Flankers to bring some power + the Troll.  Other than that, it has all your regular Moria tricks.<br />
<br />
The Choke side is a lot fo fun to play.  I have not had Frodo overwhelmed yet, and Aragorn has died only 2 times out of about 12 games (to save Frodo).  It beats up Nazgul and Sauron real bad, choking them out so they get maybe 1, or 2 guys out and then Aragorn kills them (especially nazgul with 2 brands).  Frodo can also fight, and my main strategy is if the minion looks to big for Aragorn, he fights Frodo.  Having the mindset of &quot;Must keep Aragorn alive, so Frodo fights&quot; has helped me out, because Frodo has lot&#39;s of pumps, PATHS, Bounder, and the ring.<br />
<br />
Burden removal is not in here because the most burdens I should have are 3 from 3 PATHS.  I always bid zero and if I go first then I get to run and watch them catch up vs. Moria or I can go second and pound them at my sites (namely 6, 7, 8, and 9 where I can get tons of stuff out).  Also, with Versatility and Thror&#39;s Map neutered the Troll actually gets to fight outside!<br />
<br />
The new Isengard Orcs can be a pain since all their stuff will target Aragorn, but the choke will help keep the major ones off the board and a couple archery shots will keep the exhaust one away.  They have almost no pumps, so if you can beat them do it.  All other shadow cultures my deck is good against, Uruks can only get (maximum) 5 guys out from sites 1-6 because of twilight denial and that&#39;s if I double move each turn as well, so their hand will be clogged.  Nazgul have it even worse, after the Ford (if it comes out) they are paying top dollar for each guy, and even with Morgul Gates the Aragorn beef beats them down.  Just shoot Cantea twice, and he beats everyone else but the King who costs too much anyway.<br />
<br />
Moria is a bigger problem, and against them my deck switches to &quot;Aragorn must die, then the orcs have to fight frodo and he gets to not be overwhelmed.&quot;  in other words, kil off Aragorn if needed, presumably at the Bridge, and after that Frodo can handle himself.  Also, my shadow side can help punish their fellowship, but this is defiently the hardest match-up (as it is for all choke decks).<br />
<br />
Anyway, this feels like it&#39;s getting long so I&#39;m gonig to stop now...any questions, feel free to D-mail me before reviewing.<br />

<br />
THIS PART<br />
<br />
I have NO ROTEL CARDS IN HERE.  I did this on purpose, because the only cards I would want for either side would be Shards of Narsil + Still Sharp, but Sentinels is still great (especially vs. Nazgul).<br />
