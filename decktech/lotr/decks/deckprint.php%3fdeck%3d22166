We all know that Dwarves are short. This deck will ensure that your opponent will also be short by the end of the game. Short of cards!<br>
<br>
Top Cards<br>
Saruman’s Snows and Saruman’s Ambition are a killer combo. This is no secret to any experienced player but for new players this prevents your opponents from playing any skirmish events to save their lives. They cant even use things like Bounder or Filibert Bolger to save them. Meanwhile you can use SA as needed to add +2 to your already STR 9 Uruks to win skirmishes and inflict 2 wounds!<br>
<br>
How it Beats You<br>
This deck tries to bleed your opponents draw deck dry. Every time your Dwarf with an axe wins a battle - card for your opponent. That can add up to a lot. Play an Inquisitor -1 card. Play a Soldier -1 card. Win with a Rager -2 cards. Win with a Sword -1 card. I usually put the swords on Ragers, nothing like seeing three cards go bye bye. Be conservative with your Dwarves. You want a long game. Let your opponent think there is no rush to finish. There is...for them! <br>
<br>
As soon as your opponent realises what you are doing they will have to change their playing style. Moria players will stop using They are Coming, Arwen will cease pumping Gwemegil and everyone will be careful about what they play and will not &quot;waste&quot; cards. This is great, your opponent going through their deck more slowly gives them less choices and you the card advantage.<br>
<br>
In battles your minions are very tough. They are mostly STR 8 or 9 and damage +1. 8 of them will be fierce against a large fellowship. That is a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
Number 1 Card<br>
Hard to say but I might surprise you by saying that it is Axe Strike. The +3 STR for a cost of 0 is hard to beat value and will make you strong enough to beat all but the largest minions.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
You could easily swap Farin for Fror if you think you will be fighting Orcs rather than Uruk-Hai. I just find the consequence of losing a battle to an Uruk-Hai early tends to be worse than losing to an Orc.<br>
<br>
With just a couple of rares such as Greatest Kingdom of My People I know this could be much better but as it is it is fun to play and different from many of the more common decks. Best of all you could easily build this deck from the cards your friends have rotting in their shoe boxes for nothing!<br>
