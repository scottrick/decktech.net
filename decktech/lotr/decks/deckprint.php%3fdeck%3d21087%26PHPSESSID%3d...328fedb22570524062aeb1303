My goal has been to highlight effective strategies that get away from the ultra effective Gandalf-archery /Strength of Spirit decks, and choke decks, that have been popular on the site.  These submissions should be somewhat fresh and tasty.  Enjoy!  This paragraph will now self destruct&#8230;)<br />
<br />
UPDATE:  A few of the reviewers had good some good ideas, replace the Ruling Ring with the One Ring (extra vitality for Frodo) and I&#39;ll replace Hobbit Stealths with Stings to make decisions around using the Mirror a little more effective.  Back to the original strategy section-<br />
<br />
(Pssst... everything below this is the &#39;official article&#39;)<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
INTRO:<br />
Cate Blanchet is so creepy as Galadriel; creepy and beautiful.  And your opponent will get creeped out as you snatch cards out of their hand, turn after turn, using Galadriel and her freaky mirror to generate some discard action.  Ranger-archery and a Sauron burden strategy round out the fun.<br />
<br />
TOP CARDS:<br />
The fellowship side of this deck uses a standard party consisting of Arwen, Legolas and Aragorn to accompany the Ring-bearer.  It relies on possessions and the overpowered Last Alliance of Elves and Men to give the companions high, static strength scores without the need for events, opening up card slots for Galadriel and her Mirror.  Use the Mirror to remove difficult minions; use A Ranger&#8217;s Versatility or a beefed-up Aragorn to take care of the rest.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is fun and powerful.  The Sauron minions have discard related game text to enhance the disruption your Mirror will be causing.  They have decent vitality for playing the burden-adding conditions.  The game-text on the Nazgul activate with more burdens, and recycle via the Skulkers for more late game excitement.<br />
<br />
HOW TO PLAY IT:<br />
Bid low to start &#8211; 1 or 2 burdens tops.  If you win the bid, make the opponent go first &#8211; you want them running into your Weatherhills and Ford to help out your shadow side.  In general, you&#8217;ll want to move slow and steady until you have your fellowship combos in place.  Once the Mirror and Galadriel are in play, you&#8217;ll be able to remove minions with the Mirror, and use your Ranger&#8217;s Versatilities to make some double moves.  Because the Mirror has been errata&#8217;ed (essentially to twice a turn), there&#8217;s no need to invest more into the combo than some extra Galadriels (to heal her) and a single Celeborn.  You&#8217;ll be using the Mirror plenty.<br />
<br />
On the shadow side, its good to play the fierce Nazgul early &#8211; they&#8217;re great for slowing a fellowship down, and will be put back into your deck by the Morgul Skulkers so that you can draw them late game.  The other Orcs are chosen because they either force a discard when they come into play or win a skirmish.  Desperate Defense of the Ring and Thin and Stretched add burdens, which activate the deck&#8217;s other combos.  Enduring Evil will allow an orc to win a key skirmish, or overwhelm most companions once the burden total starts getting high.  Meanwhile, Toldea and Enquea (particularly with their swords) become frightening as the burdens increase.  Your opponent will learn why Enquea has earned the nickname &#8216;The Hitman&#8217;&#8230;<br />
<br />
The sites are pretty standard &#8211; two and three enhance your Nazgul, four is outside to allow an extra Asfaloth turn, six-eight are forest-rivers for Versatility, and nine will let you draw cards for burdens (hopefully getting back a key, recycled Nazgul).<br />
<br />
THE NUMBER ONE CARD:<br />
Definitely the Mirror.  Taking cards directly out of an opponent&#8217;s hand has always been an extremely effective CCG strategy&#8230; ah, my mind harkens back to the days of Hypnotic Spectres and Hymns to Tourach.  Here, you get your choice of cards&#8230; did you see an Athelas the opponent might use to get rid of Thin and Streched?  Yank it.  How about a Spies of Saruman that&#8217;s going to hurt your fellowship archery?  Buh-bye.  And you&#8217;ll be able to use the Mirror once each turn, twice with Celeborn in play or twice whenever you draw a second Galadriel for healing.  With 4 Galadriels, you&#39;ll have plenty to discard as you draw into them in the later sites.  Heck, my wife has played this against me, trashing both Lurtz and the Witch King on the same turn.  It can work for you too.<br />
<br />
So, Mirror mirror, who is the fairest of them all?  We&#8217;ve got Arwen and Galadriel together, that&#8217;s enough.      </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
