    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is kind of themed as a Battle of Heml&#39;s Deep, without being it, and without a lot of new cards.<br />
<br />
I got the idea for it when I was looting through my cards and realized a lot of people don&#39;t play burden removers, and archery penalty cards.  So now I added archery, and took it away from the opponent, while still caring for the ring-bearer. <br />
<br />
At sites 1-3, just do the obvious, get your stuff out and ready, put Elven Bows on Arwen and Haldir and stuff like that.  You may want to try out this combo with the companion, Erethon, Naith Lieutenant.  Since he is damage +1 and strength +1 while bearing a ranged weapon, you could put Elven Bow on him.  But, since he also does not add to the Fellowship archery total, go ahead and put Elven Bow AND The Splendor of Their Banners on him.  He will be an Elf Archer Companion, meeting the requirments for TSOTB.  That means you can exert this newly formed 7/3 D+1 killing machine to add +1 to the Fellowship archery total.  He&#39;s a beast.  <br />
<br />
When Arwen, Haldir, Erethon, and Legolas can&#39;t take one more blow when moving to Site 6 from 5, you bust out all these site 6 allies on your opponent.  They are completely disposable.  Use the archery to your advantage, and snipe off your opponents, and then let your allies go down in a blaze of glory, like the Deep Of Helm.<br />
<br />
If needed, Swanship of the Galadhrim will help you out while getting your site 6 friends out in the game early, and taking down minions with arrows.  It&#39;s a shootin&#39; range for the headlines down there.<br />
<br />
Of course, Elrond is there to heal companions if needed, and if it is an emergency, Celeborn will first-aid heal Elrond for another heal FROM him.<br />
<br />
And always remember those eas-to-forget cards.  Elf-song and Hosts of The Last Alliance, not to mention Elven Cloak.  This will completely destroy minion archery and remove burdens from Frodo who would have become Pincushion.  And if neccsesary, but I do not condone, use HOTLA to prevent some Elvish wounds.  <br />
<br />
You should be set for a final showdown at site 9 if you save all cards like Double Shot and Swanship of the Galadhrim, and take down those pesky bad guys with arrows and a huge laugh of defeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is always self-explanatory in my decks.  Put out, use strenght pumpers, they usually can discard cards, and Worry.<br />
