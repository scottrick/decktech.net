<br />
Start with Gandalf and bid about 3 usually. If you win, choose for yourself to start so that you can pull Aragorn w/ the Prancing Pony. Play any other Companions you have drawn, as well as allies. You really don&#39;t care how much stuff they put out, because your guys are usually bigger, and it will be hard for them to kill anybody this fast. Run to site 3 on turn 1 most of the time. The deck goes through cards pretty fast, because it plays a lot of weapons and Elrond and Ottar, who also work good together. Albert Dreary is in there for on the spot condition removal, and you have Sleep, Caradhras as well. For Skirmish Events there are 2 really good cards. Servant of the Secret Fire is an amazing card and lets your guys win a bunch of battle. Swordsman of the Northern Kingdom works on Aragorn, Boromir, and Arwen. Gandalf will be big already and Legolas rarely fights. If you get Aragorn&#39;s Bow and/or Legolas, site 2 and site 5 become a lot easier, because you can abuse their abilities a good bit. Power According to His Stature is there for Moria Swarm decks, and Barliman is like an extra copy of Servant of the Secret Fire or Sleep, Caradhras, depending on the situation.<br />

Shadow - <br />
<br />
This half of the deck is pretty straight forward. The deck could easily be made into a snow deck, and the deck could still probably use a couple of snows for the later sites, but I wanted to see how just a straight forward Uruk-hai beatdown would work. The Lt., Warrior, and Fighter are all pretty efeccient, so you can usually play 2 a turn pretty early. Lurtz, Orthanc Assassin, and Troop are all pretty big, and make it very hard for them to run at later sites. Breed for Battle is awesome on Troop of Uruk-hai, and Lurt&#39;z Battle Cry can often kill whoever Lurtz or the Assassin is battling. Saruman&#39;s Power is there for decks that play a ton of conditions, such as elf archery decks, and spies of saruman&#39;s is in there for decks where the archery total is a bit to high for you to mount an early offense. Site 8 and 9 will be pretty hard going for the Fellowship against this deck, especially if they move to your site 9. <br />
