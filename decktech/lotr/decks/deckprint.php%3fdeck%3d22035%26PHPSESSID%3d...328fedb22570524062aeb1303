<br />
with promises, rosie and a couple of swords, you have strength 10 frodo and strength 10 sam. coupled with a bounder, overwhelming them is tough! merry is the good old str 7 version, and he can suck up a few hits along the way. and pip is the classic speed bump, good old pip, he knows how to take one for the team! and the common ring is great for putting frodo up to fight and only taking one burden, which sam/rosie take care of real nice.<br />
<br />
aragorn stops by with crazy exerting and valiant man of the west to put up a wall vs 5 minions, and does a nice job of it at later sites.<br />
<br />
galadriel + rumil + secret sentinels = mad archery and condition removal. gandalf who?<br />
<br />
first turn:<br />
bid 5 and if you win, go first. exert sam three times to dump some burdens. if you get a promise or two, only exert him twice. if you expect nazgul or a burden deck, just exert three times anyway. exert pip to play the ferry, and move without fear of fights. moving to site 3 is usually harmless, but pip can always slow down a witch king if hes early to come out.<br />
<br />
second turn:<br />
heal up, play your promises and move to site four. i dont recommend double moving to 5, unless you have alot of stealth cards.<br />
<br />
third turn +<br />
just move as you think you can, once you get to site 7, you should have 2 or 3 of your PATHS in hand, and thats plenty to win.<br />
<br />

shadow<br />
<br />
this is what i suppose to be a fairly ordinary moria archery deck. it packs lots of archers, and the troll, to really hurt the oppenent. all the archery coupled with the troll adds up to be some crazy wounds, and slows the opponent well. if they dont have archers out and you do, dont play the chain, its just common sense :)<br />
<br />
denial decks do hurt the shadow side, but often enough you can just dump guys through your hand and try to get free people cards. once you get 2 paths its pretty much a guarenteed win vs moria, and 3-4 paths is even better. try to hold the paths as long as you can, because if they play the burden drawing site 9, theyll be getting tons of cards as frodo generally takes a lot of hits.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for reading my deck, please leave me a suggestion on what could make this deck better. <br />
