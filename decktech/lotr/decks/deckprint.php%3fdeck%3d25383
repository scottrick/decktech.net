also, I used Great River as anti-moria on day 2.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well, here is the deck that helped me to make it into day 2 of the Atlanta DGMA Premier series event. I think it&#39;s pretty darn good, if not entirely original. <br />
<br />
Free Peoples<br />
<br />
The point of the deck, ideally, is to set up with Arwen, Gorn and Boromir w/ No Strangers and Legolas. This way your opponent gets minimal twilight, while you are still equipped to deal with whatever your opponent DOES play. If they play Uruks, you should drop Legolas in favor of Boromir, and equip him and Gorn with Armor ASAP, in that order. This way you are Savagery Proof and you can take 1 wound from losing the fights. Gandalf is purely there for anti-moria and sauron. If you manage to draw sleep against those cultures, great. I never did. What would I like to have had in Dragon Con with this deck? 4 Betrayal of Isengard would have been PERFECT, since everyone on day 2 was playing either Moria or Isengard. For day 2, I added the Pan and PATHS for Moria, but played only Uruks. D&#39;oh! I think the cards speak for themselves, but I&#39;d be happy to explain if anyone has any questions.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
The whole point here is to stop your opponent. You have LOTS of cheap guys, which means lots of Fierce Uruks. With Saruman, you can stop the opponent almost every time. Best trick? Drop Saruman at site 4, along with No Business, and they will almost ALWAYS stop. This Shadow stops the opponent at 2 almost every game, even against denial. Yes, Uruks can clog you, but thats why you&#39;re running Gwemegil, 2 in Day 2 version. Where are the tricks? Slopes of Amon Hen is freakin broken. A Free Peoples side that is absolutely WRECKIN you can be stripped to ribbons here. The -1 twlight cost to Uruks and Saruman means that for 10 twilight, you can chew up any fellowship that shows up. Weaknesses? No way to capitalize on burdens, which means your opponent can bid as high as they want. Work in Enquea or a Berserker or two. Abandoning Reason would be great two, and the Spies of Saruman was for high archery total decks, which I played not ONE of. Hopefully this gives you some insight into what was being played at Dragon Con, and if you have any thoughts, lemme know. Check out my TR.<br />
