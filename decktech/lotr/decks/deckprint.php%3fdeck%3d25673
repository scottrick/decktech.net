Note that this deck is for beginners. I have made this as easy as possible. There are no rare cards in this deck and only 2 Premium ones. Naturally this could be made better with some more expensive cards but if you are a beginner this is a deck you can make with mostly spare cards that a friend who plays can give you. You just need to loan the two Aragorn King in Exiles or buy one starter deck. <br>
<br>
Nazgul are expensive. So many people tell me that you cannot have a decent Nazgul deck without dozens of $10 or $20 cards. That is not true. The basis of most Nazgul decks is a solid set of uncommons. Sure it is hard to find cards as good value as Ulaire Cantea or as powerful as The Witch King but the cards here are a close compromise. As a beginner you do not want to spend the big bucks until you know if you really like the game. So try making a deck like this and feel the power of the Ringwraiths.<br>
<br>
The other half of the deck is also designed with the beginning player in mind. You have played a few games and did alright against your friends Moria, Uruk-Hai and Sauron decks but every time he plays Nazgul you are dead before you make it to site 6. This is a common problem for beginners. You need to use certain strategies and tactics to play against Nazgul. This deck will help you to learn how.<br>
<br>
First of all the sites are not exactly advantageous for the anti-Nazgul side of the deck. So if you are only playing the anti-Nazgul half I would suggest swapping in [2] Trollshaw Forest,  [3] Council Courtyard, [4] (really depends on what minions you are playing but a good anti-Nazgul choice is) Balin’s Tomb, [6] Valley of the Silverlode,  [9] (again depends on your minions but for minimum assistance to anyone)<br>
Wastes of Emyn Muil.<br>
<br>
Free Peoples<br>
Nazgul are fantastic but they need two things to really make them work. Twilight and Burdens. If you limit the amount of them that you give your opponent then they are operating at a huge disadvantage. What is the best way to keep your burdens down at the start? Bid 0! But that is crazy, you want to go first. But wait. There is one deck type that wants to go second. Nazgul. By Bidding 0 you are already half way to beating the Nazgul players. <br>
<br>
Twilight is the other main factor. They are very expensive to play. So you want to spend as little as possible as the start. Some things you must do like play Aragorn, but other cards I would hang onto. The normal rule in this game is play everything as soon as you draw it. Against Nazgul it is often a good idea to hang onto a few things until you are past the Ford of Bruinen.<br>
<br>
This deck is designed to not have many expensive cards to play. The vast majority of your cards cost 0 or 1. Even better we have a number of cards  (No Stranger to the Shadows, Bill the Pony and A Talent for Not Being Seen) which reduce the Twilight we produce. Keep your party to 5 or less and you will only be giving away enough twilight to allow your opponent to play one or sometimes two Nazgul. <br>
<br>
How does this deck survive the early sites? This is where Nazgul normally win or lose the game. If they haven’t hurt you enough by site 6 then they are probably not going to win. Their conditions take time to take effect and their big advantage is their low site numbers. Early on we have the brutal combo of Sam exerting to become defender +1 and then playing Hobbit Stealth or Hobbit Intuition. This allows him to take on the two biggest (only?) Nazgul your opponent has played and live to see another day. They are Fierce? No problem he takes them both again as the Defender +1 lasts until the regroup phase and plays stealth again. This even prevents Black Breath being played on him as he gets first action and cancels the skirmish before your opponent has an action. The other option is that you can cancel the Fierce skirmishes by using Filbert Bolger and exerting Frodo, Merry or Pippin twice to cancel the fierce skirmishimmer doesn’t matter as long as you make it to the sanctuary to heal with no deaths.<br>
<br>
How does the deck survive later sites? This is tougher but by the later sites you will have your Twilight denial running fully so will be facing little opposition. Merry using your stealths and intuitions can deal with some Nazgul, Legolas at STR 9 is very hard to overwhelm, and Aragorn should be STR 10 by now. You will not kill many Nazgul but they shouldn’t kill you. Don’t forget to use your less useful Hobbits like Pippin to cancel fierce skirmishes and then next turn heal whim with Aragorn&#39;s game text and then do it again. To double move you can use Gondor’s Vengeance to clear a big nasty Nazgul out of the way. (Also very good against Cave Trolls and Saruman.)<br>
<br>
How do you survive against Blade Tip and Black Breath? Those things are nasty! Well the first idea is that you don’t get them on you. By canceling skirmishes you prevent them getting on you. If any do get onto you, you have Athelas to deal with that. (Also good if they play Helpless on Sam.)<br>
<br>
The final thing that is crucial in an anti-Nazgul is something that we couldn’t use in this deck. Site control. Because we are using Nazgul we can’t avoid the Nazgul sites. If you are not using Nazgul consider using t the card Pathfinder to play your own sites and keeping behind your opponent until site 5. <br>
<br>
If you could add one rare card to the fellowship which would it be? Aragorn Heir to the White City is the bane of all Nazgul players. Reducing the twilight yet again will cause them all sorts of fits and unless they find their Morgul Gates make it very unlikely that they will get out more than one Nazgul per site until near the end of the game.<br>
<br>
The other style of deck for beginners that has a chance against Nazgul is massed archery. Swap Legolas Prince of Mirkwood for Legolas the Son of Thranduil. Also start Arwen Elven Rider. Have two copies of Haldir and a couple of Lorien Elves. Play 4 copies of Elf Bow. Add in a few Elf allies like Dinedal, Calaglin and Galdor. You will also want 2-4 copies of A Rangers Versatility so that the archery will result in deaths. <br>
<br>
Shadow<br>
The Nazgul come down hard and early before your opponent has a chance to set up. They are big and tough and even worse their conditions wreck you. If your opponent doesn’t have any way to remove conditions it can be goodnight nurse before site 6. Attea is a bit expensive but the ability to wound an ally can be handy. Enquea is not only one of your best fighters but his game text is brutal. Too many burdens or companions and it can be game over man. Lemenya is a god. If you have any doubts look at Clarrie Browns deck Lemenya Superstar http://www.decktech.net/lotr/decks/decks.php?deck=20800. First he makes it much easier for the other Nazgul to win skirmishes and overwhelm their opponents. Secondly if he gets his weapon he is a destroyer. Watch out, he will be a high priority target for your opponent. Nelya is a key as he controls sites. He lets you make certain that you can use the sites you want and avoid the ones you don’t want. Nertea punishes large fellowships and recycles your minions. Don’t forget that after site 6 it is good value to recycle your Morgul Skulkers who can recycle whatever else you want. Ostea can make any Nazgul including himself fierce. Great if you can do this to Lemenya with his sword. <br>
<br>
The weapons make the Nazgul just that little bit more likely to win and inflict massive loads of damage. The Sword of Minas Morgul is brutal, worth hanging onto until you get Lemenya. <br>
<br>
The conditions are what make the Nazgul so feared. Put Black Breath and Blade Tip on someone and watch them go away. Even better you can recycle them with your Morgul Skulkers. <br>
<br>
Wreathed in Shadow helps a lot against undirected archery but does nothing against directed. That is where All Blades Perish comes in. Upset your opponents plans with a card that costs 0. Even if your opponent is not playing archery it is useful to save that last wound on a minion that would be otherwise dead allowing it to fight again.<br>
<br>
Your Nazgul are expensive so you want to win battles, a couple of copies of Threshold of Shadow helps this. Two other useful events are Relentless Charge and Their Power is in Terror. Some decks play multiples of these. If you expect masses archery or lots of allies they can be very useful. <br>
<br>
While very expensive before site 6 the Morgul Skulker allows you to recycle whatever cards are most useful against the particular opponent you are playing against. Something you cannot predict before the game. <br>
<br>
The way to win is to ensure that your Nazgul can survive the opponents archery and then start to drop conditions on them. Once enough people are bleeding the deaths will start to mount up. You can play Nazgul as a beginner and the more you play them the more you will understand ways of beating them.<br>
<br>
If you could add one rare card to the shadow side what would it be? The Witch King is tempting but I think for cost effectiveness Ulaire Cantea is the most effective. You can even bring him back with Ulaire Nertea and the Morgul Skulkers.<br>
<br>
I hope this was useful for beginner players and if you have any questions feel free to dmail me. <br>
<br>
A note to reviewers: When you review this deck please remember that it is a NO RARE deck for beginners. Don’t say stupid things like “Legolas Greenleaf is better than the Prince of Mirkwood – one star”.
