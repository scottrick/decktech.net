<br />
This is the deck I used to get 1st place at the Vegas TOC (8 players).  It also got me 5th at the Nor Cal TOC (40 players).  It is solid against all shadow types, except perhaps dunland.  Dunland may be the worst matchup, since I have no site liberation.  Besiegers aren’t so bad, since I can get rid of their engines and that hurts besiegers even more than site liberation.  Choke also wrecks the trolls, especially w/o their engines.  Who pays full cost for trolls?<br />
<br />
The shadow is meant to do 2 things.  First, strip away weapons and allies.  Then, swarm them using your pirate booty on the ships to play guys for free from discard pile.  There are 8 ships so arrow slits and Rolls of Thunder will at best just slow you down for a site.  The Ships of Great Draught are meant to get back the other ships from your discard pile.  Fierce in Despair is so good.  Just discard a War Galley to add lots of pool, and discard a companion with Fierce in Despair.  Then you can put it back on your deck with the Ships of Great Draught.  Depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
There’s not much strategy to the corsairs, they’re easy to play.  Just don’t stack too many cards on top of your deck because you won’t draw fellowship.  I don’t like the rare ship that much.  The common ships are much better.  Each Black Sail is basically a minion sitting in your support area.  Use the gunners to make everyone fierce.  The +6 pump is so freakin&#39; good!  You just need one guy on frodo most of the time!<br />
<br />
As for the fellowship, its something none of you have probably seen before.  Originally, it used Smeagol instead of ROTN, but the Isen swarm just owned that version.  ROTN makes this deck so much better.  The Promises and Depart Silently save the hobbits, and Sam heals up each and every turn.  And he also makes sure you can cycle cards out of your hand if you have to go first.  Another cool trick is using your site 1 to add 8 pool and draw 4 cards, then use Glamdring to remove all the pool.  It really helps you get to the crucial fellowship cards (like ROTN).  Servants and Ranger’s sword also ensure that Aragorn survives.<br />
<br />
Nazgul don’t do much at all against this deck.  Rolls get rid of souped-up Nazgul (no steeds and swords).  Deep in Thought takes out breaths and tips.  Sam and Frodo can take beatings thanks to Promises, then Sam heals up.  Sting also discards Nazgul.  Sting is the only way Nazgul will add threats (aside from gollum), but you only need to use Sting at the back sites (7 and 8).  So you shouldn’t add threats until then.  And rarely will they have pool to play Cantea AND someone else.  Too Great and Terrible is not too much of a problem (lots of so cal players use that card).  There are lots of Gandalf culture cards you can toss to that in this deck.  And he should have either Narya or Staff to help his vitality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easterlings probably won’t work either.  Corruption-style won’t win, since Frodo and Sam are ringbound and can fight.  Captain-style will see his bow get rolled away by Gandalf.  Or if Gandy has his staff he can cancel the fight.  Frodo can even fight the Captain if the circumstances are right (2 depart silently in hand, and 4 promises out).<br />
<br />
<br />
Besiegers will certainly take sites on you, but without their engines they will have problems.  They can forget about playing Trolls.  The choke helps against that.  Just get Deep In Thought out.   Remember to pitch cards to Sam to make sure you draw what you need.  Also, you can pitch corsair cards to the ship to put on tokens.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dunland is tough.  They will probably take sites (esp if they play siege troops).  Their high strength/low vitality is good against this deck because there is no archery.  Hides or clubs won’t be around long thanks to rolls, but again, they don’t really need hides without any archery.  PATHS or Gondor Bowmen might be good counters for dunland.  Dunland wouldn’t be so bad except for the darn Elders.  They can be nasty.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, this deck uses cycling to set things up.  Need Deep in Thought?  Pitch cards to ships of great draught and/or Sam.  Need more Rolls?  Same thing.  It’s a cool deck that’s something you don’t see everyday.  Have fun.  Thanks for reading.<br />
