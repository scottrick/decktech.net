So this is just an ordinary choke deck? Wrong, its a choke deck with power! <br />
Let&#39;s get straight to How to play this deck:<br />
<br />
Free Peoples:<br />
1) Bid 2 and go first if you can.<br />
<br />
2) At the beginning just throw your hand down get Aragorn, weapons out etc. Beware of Dunland. <br />
<br />
3) Then moving from site 3 time to choke. If your plan works their hand with many minions wont play very well and even dunland won&#39;t be able to play much. So move cautiously. Use sting if you draw it. Escape is good too if their not much in the pool. Merry&#39;s ability is basically all you need pump wise since you can do it twice with Escape.<br />
<br />
4) Where this deck really shines is its power beating the little minions the shadow player(s) can play. Gondor Bowmen and Defend it and Hope is good against almost all shadow strategies so they&#39;re all good. So far as moria goes its pretty dead so long live choke. <br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
1) Well this is pretty much good old fashion Uruks, which basically means: Dead Companions = Good, Dead Ringbearer = Better, Stopping your opponents Fellowship with an old fart and a white beard out, nothing else = Priceless. Seriously if your opponent is scared you have as good as won with your shadow side mission complete. The fact that they could win games is just a bonus.<br />
<br />
2) Try and Keep a Saruman in your hand for site 9 and atleast 4 other Uruks, Savageries is good so is Lurtz&#39;z Battle Cry. Dont be a fool and use it in a skirmish against a man with armor.(Its very sad when you realize Borimir isn&#39;t even clse to death and you wasted a Cry.) <br />
<br />
Well that&#39;s basically all i can think of, Cheers! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
