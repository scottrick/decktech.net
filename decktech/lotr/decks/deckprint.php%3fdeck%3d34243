You probably want to put Asfaloth on Legolas so he can win more skirmishes. I know the 3 devilry seems a bit much but it is not. shoulder to shoulder helps sometimes a little with enqea if you play all your companions. I know  the deck is a little big but it works extremly well.it is noy perfect but it usually works and it is fun to play.the reason i put this deck as an advanced deck is because of so many rares.half the deck is rares after all.<br />
<br />
Strat.<br />
Win with Lego and Gim to get lots of tokens. Use elven tokens to help Gorn and dwarven tokens to heal gim and use gim and shoulder to shoulder to heal lego and arwen.<br />
<br />
exert your beserkers to put tokens on devilry and just play uruks for tokens on seige engine.<br />
Something i pulled of in my most resent game was overwhelming three companions (gorn was one of them) on three moves the exausting his last three with devilry and using slayer twice. i used 2 scaling ladders to heal him after the first 2 exertions. that way i exerted every comp with devilry and wounded them twice with Slayer (his comps left were Gimli with a vitality ring, Legolas with Tale of GG, and Frodo with Bane). I killed Lego with slayer and gimli with a butcher so frodo was the only one left.and i killed him on site 7 (the next site).<br />
<br />
This is my first submission in a long time so dont be harsh. i know this deck has some weakness&#39;s but it is still a good deck. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
