<br />
Alright, well you’ve seen it before. The Help in Doubt and Need deck that seems to do at least marginally well at every major tournament in the standard environment. While this version may not be exactly what has been played at these events, it is my version, and of course the best.<br />
Right.<br />
So anyhow, I decided that noone had posted a HiDaN deck with a decent strategy section, so I went ahead and typed one up. This is a basic Free Peoples side paired up with a solid Nazgul deck that I use to test new deck designs, and it is quite balanced against everything. While it may not always defeat everything, it has about the same chance against all shadows.<br />
Heres the goal.<br />
<br />
Bid 1. You cannot afford to bid high, since there is no burden removal, and this way you will at least stand a chance of deciding who go first without leaving yourself more vulnerable to burden strategies and the Palantir Chamber. You want to go first, but if you don’t it’s no big deal, as Aragorn or Boromir will show up eventually. If you go first, usually grab HoE, but get ROTN against Moria, he will win the game. <br />
Set up as quickly as possibly, but do NOT double unless you get a remarkable opening hand. Your shadow has stopping power in the early game, which should be enough to stall until your Fellowship is running strong.<br />
You will win fights, as Eomer is a monster. Against Dunland,. You have a bit more trouble, but the typical Dunland deck runs 4 pumps and 4 Clubs. You will kill one club with Arrow Slits, don’t waste it on a Hides. HiDaN is hard for them to get rid of, and Weapon Store is insurance against Clubs that DO get through. Aragorn’s Bow is also huge.<br />
Against Nazgul, if it is the Steed variety which is most likely, you will not be overwhelmed. Against condition versions, it will be harder but usually Simblemyning for Eowyn’s Sword first so she can take the first Tip is a good idea. After that, fish for your Athelas. <br />
Against Moria, Fortress will be huge, but stay below 6 companions until you see 3 Enqueas pass. Trust me. If you can pull off Fortress to nuke Armories or They Are Coming, th game will be better, but move quickly, since if you can get a head start before the Shadow gets set up, you will have an easier game. Sam, PP is huge in this matchup.<br />
Sauron should be easy, since most of their abilities require exertions, and Eomer can fight, and kill, two or their Swarmers. He likes vitality. If they get lots of conditions out early, use your Hobbit speedbumps to soak up wounds, then kill them off ASAP. Eowyn is nice insurance against Hate.<br />
Raiders are not an issue.<br />
Uruks have been a bit neutered by the loss of Saruman and the Regular, but Trackers can still be tough, especially early. Just remember to move slowly early on and then double jump once you are set up. <br />
<br />
Card Choices of Question<br />
<br />
Shards – HUGE for storing extra copies of weapons and HiDaN, which means that a solitary Saruman’s Power doesn’t ruin your day.<br />
<br />
Legolas – yes, he has the potential for breaking the Grima Culture Commander barrier, but most people will not play Grima. Don’t let him stay on the table any longer than needed. If you are paranoid, drop him for Gamling or Alcarin. <br />
<br />
Only one Fortress – I am paranoid about drawing this card when I don’t need it. Also, I often find myself discarding it against everything but Moria and Sauron, and now Sauron has ways to get rid of it easily. I am tempted to leave it out all together, but I know I need some removal. Athelas takes the spot of the second one, but the deck is small, so you could add one and something to the shadow if you feel it is needed. <br />
<br />
Why 2 different Gorn’s – well, to be honest there’s no real reason for it. Sometimes I feel like I need HoE against a particular Shadow, like Sauron since if I exert him to Defender +1 he might be hated. Other times, like against Moria, ROTN is absolutely essential. Could easily be 3 of the same, or some other ratio of 2-1 than I have listed. Basically, go with your gut. <br />
<br />
Weapon Store – this card is huge against Dunland, which I feel is HiDaN’s toughest matchup. Also makes cycling a bit easier for the fellowship, since you can dump a weapon and get it back the next turn, if you need to.<br />
<br />
Arrow Slits – absolutely a disgusting card. Steeds, War Clubs, Broad Bladed Sword, Mumaks and soon Fell Beasts. Just a sick and versatile card. Not to mention, it has the ability to get rid of a Siege Engine so your Fortress Goes through, which is essential against Uruk archery. <br />
<br />
Shadow.<br />
<br />
Rather than go the road with everyone else and post yet another Steed/Sword big Nazgul deck, I decided to post another Tip/Breath deck. This shadow may not have the overwhelm power of those decks, but it does have the ability to kill companions simply by skirmishing them. By playing minions that will most often win their skirmishes, in turn Tip/Breathing the losing companion, this deck not only kills companions but stops fellowships, for fear of losing an important companion before they can win fights. <br />
In addition to winning skirmishes, you have the answer to any archery deck in the Relentless Charge/ Desert Lord combo, which means 2 dead companions, should you draw up both Charges. Grima is icing with all the conditions, as is Lemenya, who will win games when he is assigned to skirmish Frodo. Transfer Breath, game. <br />
Behrenger is huge.<br />
<br />
Questionable Card Choices<br />
<br />
Lemenya? – why yes, this guy is money. He makes all 6 conditions pumpers, not to mention makes overwhelm possibilities, which will at the very least make your opponent think.<br />
<br />
No Bill Ferny? – not really going for the overwhelms, and I am trying my best to keep this deck at 30 per side, which leaves no room for the Fernstein.<br />
<br />
No All Blades? – I figure I have enough archery protection in the Charge/Dlord combo, and besides, the threat of All Blades is greater than All Blades itself. Could easily replace Grima if you won’t play without it. <br />
<br />
Why aren’t you playing Steeds? – I am sick of Steed decks, and while this deck isn’t all that different, it is plays more interestingly than just throwing down the biggest minion possible. Besides, if a Steed deck doesn’t get started killing companions on turn one, it won’t ever get started, while this one can change the game in one turn through Charges and through Lemenya.<br />
<br />
Well that appears to be all for now. This deck plays fairly straightforward, though you need to get creative sometimes to win with the Shadow, which is why this deck is designed to win with the fellowship. One of the reasons I keep the deck so small is to prevent being screwed over too badly by bad draws, which is the bane of any LOTR deck. The bad draws will still come, but you should recover quicker than with a larger deck. <br />
<br />
For kicks, try paring this Free Peoples with a Warg Shadow. It should play about the same, and should be less prone to hand clog. Hint: 2 Enquea’s is needed in the Warg Deck, and War-Wargs and Sharku’s Warg are all you need.<br />
