I<br />
wanted to make a deck that would just beat everything.  So I decided to go with<br />
big Fellowship with Gandalf support.  Trust Me was an option but I decided<br />
against it cause I wanted the better characters like Eowen and Faramir in the<br />
deck.  <br />
<br />
The deck works like this play as many characters as you can be be wary about<br />
Enquea cause you have a lot of 3 vitality characters in the deck and use Gandalf<br />
to win the important skirmishes with Servants and his high power and his<br />
weapon.  The hardest match up for this deck is probably dunland but I made this<br />
deck to do better against Dunland because of the bows and Legolas.  Just use<br />
your archery to get rid of the hides as quick as you can then use the Servants to<br />
win the key skirmishes against the weapon killers so you dont lose them and you<br />
should be ok.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is a standard Uruk beat deck with the site control stuff to<br />
produce a swarm effect at site 9.  Just use Saruman to Protect the wounds of the<br />
stackers and stack them when you can.  Then with site 9 text(if they get there)<br />
use them and Saruman to get a buck of 2 and 3 cost minions to swarm your<br />
opponents.  Im writing a Tr for this deck when I played in the Chase the Can<br />
event over the weekend and it will go into more depth about the match-ups.  <br />
<br />

Thanks for reading and rating and dont forget to read the TR for more details<br />
about the deck.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
