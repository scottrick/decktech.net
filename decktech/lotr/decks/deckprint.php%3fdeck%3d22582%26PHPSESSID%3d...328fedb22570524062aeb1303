    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The FP side is probably not the best, but it should be able to survive most of the time if it takes it nice and easy - remember, this is a fun deck, and it&#39;s all about realizing the theoretical site nine incident. I think a better complement might be a dwarf/elf manipulation deck, but I&#39;ll save that for the &quot;advanced&quot; version of the deck :) All that being said, the FP side is intended to equip the dwarves and let them do the fighting. Aragorn is in there for Frodo and Silverlode. Legolas can shoot stuff. Beneath the Mountains (included chiefly to fuel the shadow) allows the Hand Axes to be recycled for extra archery. Other than that it&#39;s pretty much just Dwarves dukin&#39; in out with the baddies.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is desinged to do one thing: kill at nine. Breeding Pit stacks your draw, and Beneath the Mountains makes sure you get there. Summit makes the cheap. The standard combo will be 3 Messengers + 3 Lieutenants + Spies + Snows (all for only 13 twilight). A sixth companions means you&#39;ll need to change the mix a bit: dropping Snows means you get another minion, and can unload the pile of Ambitions you should have accumulated. If you anticipate needing to go this route, avoid stacking Messengers/Soldiers, as they&#39;ll be killed outright by PATHS - you should have the extra twilight to pay for Warriors/Lts. anyway, obviously better since the Warriors will be fierce. <br />
<br />
Also note that you have a legitimate shot at pulling off a lucky win at sites 4-5. You should definately be saving cheap minions in preperation for a swarm attempt, if it looks like your opponent will be susceptible to it.<br />
<br />
The Tower Assassins are basically in there to kill Dreary and Thrarin, but are also just generally nasty against Hobbit decks, Mirror, etc.<br />
<br />
The Goblin Men are generally pretty weak, but allow you to plan for site nine - e.g. checking for PATHS, or Orc-Bane or anytihng else that could rain on your parade. They also get the site 9 discount in case you need another 1-cost minion.<br />
<br />
As for the other cards, their utility should be fairly apparent, but in case it&#39;s not:<br />
<br />
Messengers: 2-twilight (1 at the Slopes) - Strength 9 with the Snows.<br />
Soldiers: 2-twiligt. Only &quot;Pit&quot; these guys if you expect to be able to deck your opponent (not likely, but possible with the Axes) or if you really need another cheap minion at nine.<br />
Lietenants: The most powerful Uruk you can possibly get out at site nine for two twilight.<br />
Warriors: Better than Fighters here, because a 5-man fellowship is still outnumbered by one with the theoretical six minions out.<br />
Ambition: Increase through-put; save &#39;em for when it counts.<br />
