No condition removal can hurt but it&#39;s not worth adding in cards for.<br />
<br />
The fellowship is the new gondor rangers with the addition of the two best rangers: Aragorn and the late Boromir.  The Strategy is simple... start first and stay ahead.  The shadow is proven with a couple additions and will keep your opponent to one site a turn.  I would bid 4, but you may chose more than that in your area.  4 is safe because Enquea can&#39;t hurt you yet, and you will get a chance to remove all 4 burdens with the Gondorians.  Some may say that choke is worthless now... I wouldn&#39;t disagree, but this deck is not really choke.  Aragorn and No Stranger just limit what you are going to face, meaning that Faramir, Aragorn and Mablung should face most of the minions, which in turn means you will be double moving against no minions or very few minions.  When you face someone you can&#39;t handle,  feed them a Gondorian or let Boromir with Armor show you why he&#39;s still cool.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
Choke Gorn:  Limit&#39;s twilight which is nice, because the less twilight you make for yourself, the less of a beating you are going to face.<br />
Boromir, LOG:  So he&#39;s dead, he&#39;s still a ranger, and surely good enough to beat out an Ithilien Ranger for a slot in the deck.<br />
4 x G.R.: I think you need 4 of these guys for a ranger deck, 3 doesn&#39;t do, because you want to keep Nazgul roaming.  Nazgul are a major problem as can be Dunland, so the 4th Ranger makes a difference.<br />
Boromir, My Brother:  I like cards with multiple uses, this gives me strength boosts when I need them, card throughput when I need it, and most importantly vitality when I need it.<br />
Saga:  contrary to what you probably think, this is not for the 3 big guys, this is for Mablung, who in my opinion is the freakin&#39; man.<br />
Cliffs of Emyn Muil:  I like PATHS but don&#39;t like hand clog... problem solved.<br />
Ithilien Trap: Grima/Enquea/Big Minion protection.  Makes 6 or 7 companions a very safe proposition.<br />
Sword of Gondor:  I like Aragorn&#39;s new sword, but I don&#39;t like it&#39;s limitations (only on Aragorn, unique and NOT damage +1)... Sword of Gondor does what a sword should do, is non-unique and plays on everybody... it&#39;s also usually damage +1, which is huge against Uruks.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Grima, Wormtongue:  To avoid super companions and to make double moving easy for me.<br />
Lurtz: He&#39;s still the baddest daddy there is.<br />
Orthanc Champion: This guy is a close second, I love his special ability and Strength to cost ratio.<br />
Uruk Regular: His ability is great.  Just think how many times pre-TTT you only needed 3 more twilight to play one more Uruk and cause some major damage.  Well in TTT that twilight definitely makes a difference.  Especially in a Saruman deck.<br />
Uruk Vanguard: It&#39;s like, no matter what this guy is going to kill 2 companions at a battleground... he&#39;s also actually not too expensive.  I love bringing him back with the Captain, man does this guy scare people.<br />
Saruman&#39;s Staff, Wizard&#39;s Device:  Just an extra bonus... when playing a bunch of Sarumans... why not add in one or two Staffs so he can fight too.  Any despite what some of you may say, it&#39;s pretty unlikely he&#39;ll die before he can make Uruks fierce, and if he does, that likely means some Uruk is booting someone around elsewhere.<br />
Savageries and Ambitions:  You still can&#39;t build an Uruk deck (save Trackers and Archers) without 4 Savageries, and ambitions are pretty important still as well.<br />
<br />
Possible Additions to both sides (I like 60 cards, makes it very solid for double moving):<br />
<br />
Fellowship<br />
Citadel of Minas Tirith:  The last cut basically, I just found that double moving usually results in losing a couple of skirmishes, so it&#39;s not really worthwhile.<br />
Curse Them:  I really like this card, but I am not really afraid of what I could face.<br />
New Errand:  This would mostly be to combat Dunland<br />
Flaming Brand:  Always nice, but leaves you open to Grima bomb and you don&#39;t really need them.<br />
Any of the &quot;Domain&quot; cards:  the are nice, but once again not needed.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Lieutenant of Orthanc:  I know that if I say he&#39;s too expenive you&#39;ll say &quot;you play Lurtz&quot;... truth is I like a 13 str guy who IS fierce better than a 12 str guy who makes a couple 9 str guys fierce.  Lurtz is still the best.<br />
Ferocity:  In a bigger deck, this would fill the slots along with some more Regulars or some Ravagers.  I like having 10 or more boosts in a bigger deck, but in a 30 card deck, 4 savageries and 4 Ambitions is enough.<br />
Battle Cry:  Imagine a dmg +3 Uruk Vangard... hee hee...<br />
Abandoning Reason:  Just no need for it in a smaller deck.<br />
Dunlending Warrior:  in my opinion the best ally removal in the game.  Takes out small allies like Thrarin, Filibert, Villagers, Ottar, Orophin etc. and can even take out the big guys like Elrond and Celeborn (when are these guys NOT exhausted?)... he&#39;s also cheap, almost never roaming and at 9 strength, he&#39;ll win a few skirmishes in non-ally decks.<br />
