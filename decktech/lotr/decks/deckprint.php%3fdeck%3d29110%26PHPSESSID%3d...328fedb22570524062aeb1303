Hello!<br />
<br />
First off, the name. I don&#39;t really like the name Fresh Beef, no offense to the guy who coined the phrase, but it&#39;s just not interesting. I decided to call that decktype Oprah, since it starts out a fat deck, then thins itself out, and then in some cases fattens back up (with Sneaks). I named this one Dr. Phil, because, as much as I dislike Dr. Phil, you KNOW he secretly wants Oprah dead, and that what this deck does. <br />
<br />
I have been bored of the same decks repeatedly. Decktech is pull of Fresh Beef (which I now call Oprah) decks, HIDAN decks, which are so numerous and generic that I posted one called Smith and the occasional Dauntless Choke deck that I decided it was time to throw something different out there. This is about as different as you can get.<br />
<br />
This is a standard deck, just to clarify, and it’s pretty darn good. The fellowship is a great matchup vs. Nazgul thanks to the copious amounts of pumpers, it does alright against Dunland, again thanks to pumpers and deals with Moria admirably. The condition removal helps, since it’s something they can’t stop, and having defender +1 Eomer doesn’t hurt either. Rohirrim Bows are good answers for everything from burdens to Sauron swarm( since they do a great deal of exerting ). Heres how it works.<br />
<br />
4 Simblemyne are the center. Use these to do the following things:<br />
<br />
Pull Gamling. You have no other way of grabbing him, or Theoden, so you need to get out fighter number 2 ASAP. <br />
<br />
Pull gear for Eomer. If you have stuff in hand, play it on Gamling in skirmishes then pass it off to Eomer, Eowyn and Theoden. If you notice you’re up against Moria and haven’t seen Fortress, grab Theoden so you can start Swifting away conditions(usually armories, since you’ll need to Bow some of them. <br />
<br />
Pull allies / weapons you haven’t yet drawn up.<br />
<br />
The beauty of this deck is that there are so many copies of weapons that everyone can use, you’ll rarely find yourself hurting for fight winning possessions. Eomer might be better with his own gear, but until Firefoot and his Spear show, he can mow down minions almost as well with a Rider’s Spear and Brego. <br />
<br />
Another reason why you need to pull Gamling first is that you’re playing Golden Hall, and in all likelihood went second. Plan to play little at first and then double into 3(assuming they did) and dump the motherload of possessions. Ownage.<br />
<br />
Once you’re all set up, you’ll have Eowyn, Gamling and Theoden sitting at 9, all damage of 3 (1 for horse, 1 for hand weapon) and waiting to nail whomever comes your way. You’ll also have Eomer the god at an 11 against most minions, and able to clean up after whoever got exerted in the first fight. 9 may not sound like a lot, but add in a Hlafwine exertion and you’ve got 11, which beats most minions. Factor in the 6 pumpers, plus the fact that in the early game Gamling will be a monster and you have a deck capable of winning just about skirmish needed. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem here would be that, while your non-Hobbits are going to mow down(or at the worst not die to) all the minions that come at them, Frodo is without any such help. Ideally, Frodo will never skirmish, but in the case that he does, the deck runs Bounder, There and Back Again and most importantly, the Frying Pan. Most of the time, the only Shadow side that will regularly get out more than 5 minions (4 real companions, + Firefoot) is going to me Moria, or in some circumstances, Sauron. Orcs. PING! Not the tightest Frodo package on the planet, but certainly a decent one. <br />
<br />
Some card choices:<br />
<br />
Why Fortress AND Swift? – in some cases, it is better to not fetch that 5th companion right away, or you may lose someone (God forbid). I need some way to remove conditions other than Swift, and Fortress meets that need. Also, it has the potential to ruin Moria in one fell swoop, assuming they’re not playing Saruman. <br />
<br />
Rohirrim Shield? You’ve got be kidding – it’s not a top tier card, I’ll admit, but it does provide another possession that can be played, plus it halps a lot against Urukery. Imagine dumping it in regroup, then using Ecglaf to play it back, then dumping it again. It’s almost a good healing engine. <br />
<br />
Only one of Gamling/ Theoden – 4 copies of Simblemyne ensures that I will get them out, except against Discard….in which case I will punch my opponent in the mouth. I won’t always need Theoden right away, so having only the one copy to worry about drawing into is a Blessing at times. Stupid Theoden. <br />
<br />
Arrow Slits – most people have realized how tough this card can be by now, but I’ll reiterate. Black Steed, War Club, Mumak(both kinds), Hides and even Goblin Scimitar are all possessions. This kills them. Also makes Uruk Archery even less intimidating when you kill their only Siege Engine then Swift away 2 Weapons(assuming they are stupid, of course).<br />
<br />
Ecgalf? – he is HUGE. Return Rohirrim Bows forever, or at least until you run out of healing with Theoden. He is tight. Also, helps against Dunland to some degree.<br />
<br />
The shadow is something I have been working on, but I cannot decide if it’s perfected or not. I think that the best Free Peoples side right now is Oprah, at least in some form, because it is tough to kill, able to run with large numbers of companions and sets up the Shadow. This Shadow has the right solution. <br />
<br />
Whats so good about Ents/Gandalf/ Hobbits? They all have 4 vitality, right? That means that it’s going to take more than one Enquea before they get penalized for going to 6 or more companions right? Well an Enquea plus a Hate does any 4 vitality companion in right away, no questions asked. This means that against these decks, you can take away their best condition removal on turn one, should they go to 6 companions. This makes it very difficult for the deck to continue to operate, when they are taking eventually 4 archery and 4 exertions every time they move. Sauron’s biggest weakness is condition removal, and this deck has the power to take it away immediately. <br />
<br />
How does the deck match up to HIDAN, or Dauntless Hunter? HIDAN is relatively easy, except that you need to draw up condtions early and save your Orc Patrols for Fortress, NOT HIDAN. Dauntless Hunter is tough, but winnable. It’s important to run with your fellowship in this matchup, using all your means to pitch Shadow conditions and concentrate on playing big minions to stop them. Morgul Hunter is just nasty. <br />
<br />
Heres some other Matchups that you’ll NEVER play against!<br />
<br />
Trust – kill Gandalf, that’s all it takes. Easier said than done, but as soon as they hit 6 companions ( which most Trust Decks do) you’ve got the game in the bag. Big minions like Morgul Hunter and Band will make it tougher on them to double move, and Orc Patrol is key in taking out Trust at key moments. <br />
<br />
Ringbound – make sure you kill a companion with Eye of Barad-Dur. Most RBR decks are running little or no condition removal right now, relying on Light Shinning faintly to keep themselves healed. Your conditions will chew them up quickly. Also, with your trackers, they may have a hard time keeping you roaming. Enquea should almost always target Gondorian Rangers, if your minions are at home, the Rangers can’t kill ‘em. <br />
<br />
Sam/Frodo/ Smeagol – choke + stealths is a pain in the butt. Run. <br />
<br />
Rangers/Archery – you have mucho vitality, so they are going to have to work hard to kill all of your minions with archery. Often it is a better idea to kill off your little minions with the archery and make sure your big guys reach the skirmishes. Never use a Patrol to kill a Gondor Bowmen, all you are doing is saving them a wound. Condition removal will either be ally based, which is worse for you, or Company of Archers, which is great for you. Kill Arwen(or Greenleaf) and you’ve got Free conditions all game. <br />
<br />
Dwarves – run. Dwarves are broken. If you see Gimli, just reach out and congratulate your opponent on picking the best Free Peoples on the block. You’ll never come back once they get like 10 cards on those Dwarves, especially since I failed to include a Grima. I am a fool. How could I forget Dwarves?<br />
<br />
Just one last thing to mention on the Shadow. The Orc Runner is the biggest pimp in gaming history. He singlehandedly makes your deck cycle smoothly. The fact that you get to draw a card is bonus. <br />
<br />
Hope that was informative. I realize that Sauron and Valiant Rohan are not the best deck ever. I have played them in tournaments plenty of times, done pretty well, and gone back to Moria or Nazgul or whatever, but the deck is fun, competitive and different. These are the three most important things in casual tournament play, and this deck might just be the thing you need to take that Fresh Bee…I mean Oprah player down a peg or two. The fact is that this deck contains the things that every competitive deck must have.<br />
<br />
Skirmish Winning<br />
Frodo Support<br />
Condition Removal<br />
Healing<br />
Double Move Power<br />
Direct Wounding<br />
Stopping Power (shadow)<br />
Companion Elimination<br />
Versatility (all around)<br />
Hand Cycling<br />
<br />
In theory, it is a very good deck.<br />
In theory, Sauron has always been good.<br />
You be the judge.<br />
