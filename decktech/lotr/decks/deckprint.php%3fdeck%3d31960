The beauty of Ents is that they are quite strong and they win a lot of<br />
skirmishes. Treebeard, one of the strongest Ents, can only fight if you exert<br />
a unbound Hobbit. But that is okay because you have Farmer Maggot that<br />
can heal some of those exertions. Once you can not exert with Farmer Maggot<br />
any more, to heal Pippin or Merry, use Hobbit Party Guest (or guests) to heal<br />
him. Gandalf can be an automatic 9 when he is played because you can spot <br />
3 Hobbit cultures (Frodo, Merry, and Pippin.) Plus you can put Wizard Staff<br />
on him to make him 10 and exert him to make him bigger. You have Mysterious<br />
Wizard to pump up Gandalf more. If any of your companions are going to take a<br />
wound, then you can use Intimidate to prevent that wound. This deck does have 6<br />
companions so you will be a target to Enquea, but the only companions Enquea can<br />
kill (without them being able to spot a wound on another companion) is Quickbeam.<br />
Enquea has 3 vitality where as all of your companions have 4 vitality (exert Quickbeam.)<br />
If that still sounds like a big risk to take, hold either Gandalf of Treebeard in you hand<br />
and only play one of those when one of your companions die.<br />
<br />
Shadow********************************<br />
In my last deck I submitted I told a strategy section on Sauron swarm. Now I will tell<br />
you about the really common Moria Swarm. The way you swarm with Moria is to<br />
save as much minions as you can and try to swarm at site 4. If then you don’t have enough twilight, wait to site 5. The point with Moria Swarm is to get out a whole ton<br />
of minions. You could play a runner (or runners) to add twilight. You could play<br />
Goblin Scimitar (this is a really good card) on a Moria Minion to draw a card which may<br />
allow you to draw a minion (this is how you get a lot of minions out.) Also, you have<br />
Goblin Scavengers to play back the scimitars that are in the discard pile. Goblin Swarms<br />
is a must have card for a swarms deck. It lets you stack minions on this condition each time your orc wins a skirmish. This lets you deploy cards off of this condition and<br />
lets you play minions from your hands. This increases the chances of getting a lot of<br />
minions out. There is also Goblin Sneak that lets you place a Moria minion on the bottom<br />
of your draw deck. The point of this is to get 4 minions on the bottom of the deck so<br />
that win you are about to draw up your deck, you will draw minions that you put there<br />
with the Goblin Sneak. Host of Thousands gets minions from your discard pile. The<br />
Goblin Scrabbler is a really good card against an Elven deck. They discard Elven <br />
conditions. Also, if you really try and make this a deck to stick with, you should try<br />
and get some Goblin Armories. This is like the way to prevent wounds to Moria.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and if you are not a beginner,<br />
pass this knoledge to someone that is new to the<br />
game.<br />
