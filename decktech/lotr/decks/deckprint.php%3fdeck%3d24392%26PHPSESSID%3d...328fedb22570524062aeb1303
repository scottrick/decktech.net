TADA!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">alright, i know what you&#39;re thinking. Pipeweed? are you drunk? or high? nope. Frodo&#39;s Pipe is simply the best method to consistently double move without losing any companions. <br />
This deck is designed to beat the Shadow cultures that I deemed to be the most popular in the current Meta. <br />
<br />
Uruk-Hai- they get to play at MOST 2 Uruks, or 1 and Saruman, and if they play Saruman they have wasted their Twilight. I will win my skirmishes against them, or, usually, cancel the fight with Gandalf so they can&#39;t get any Skirmish events from their hand. <br />
<br />
PLAYING INSTRUCTIONS<br />
<br />
Bid 6, go first and pull Sam. Going first is crucial. I know you get outbid by Hobbits, but Moria beats Hobbits anyway, so pull Sam, remove 3 and play whatever you have in your hand. If you know what you&#39;re playing against, give twilight accordingly. Play Aragorn if you have him. Against Nazgul, you might wanna hold some cards, unless you got Gandalf&#39;s Staff. Basically, dump your hand and move. If you can, try to keep Sam until the Sanctuary so he can get rid of the burdens. Narya is primarily for the vitality, so don&#39;t give that pool unless its the only way. Anyways, the ideal setup is to have all three pipes, but you can function with just Frodo&#39;s or, in bad cases, just Aragorn&#39;s. <br />
Move twice when you can, with the pipeweed you can potentially heal all of your companions completely without a sanctuary, which is huge. This deck has been playtested. I used it at the Houston DPC and had absolutely ZERO trouble moving with the Fellowship. The problem was with the Shadow side, which I foolishly chose as Uruk-Hai. Sadly, there were about 8 Twilight denial decks at the DPC, and as we all know Uruks can do NOTHING to Denial. Anyways, all three games I lost were due to my opponents outrunning me, and that was because I chose to bid low and start the Pony, none of my opponents were able to even hurt my fellowship. The only game in which I lost a companion was against a deck that went first and used Farmer Maggot&#39;s Fields, which does nothing for me. In that game, by the time I drew into Aragorn I had already discarded all of his possessions so he went down to an Uruk Lieutenant who was Savageried and Bred for Battled, so Servant did nothing. I urge you to try the deck, it is fun, different and highly effective. <br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
<br />
For those of you that don&#39;t yet know, Moria is a twilight generator. The Armories add 1 Twilight whenever you play a weapon, therefore multiple Armories generate Twilight by the boatload. Combined with Scavengers, who play a weapon from the discard pile when they are played, you can opperate efficiently with minimal twilight. Had I been playing this Shadow in Houston, not only would I have beaten some of the denial decks, I would have cycled faster, facilitating a better equipped fellowship, able to smoke with th best of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
CARD CHOICES<br />
<br />
FP<br />
<br />
Gandalf, FOTS - Frodo Signet, plain and simple. Also, he is 1 strength more once Aragorn comes out and has the coolest picture. <br />
<br />
Aragorn, HttWC - Frodo Signet, also contributes to the denial aspect of the deck. Essentially costs 2 twilight to bring into play.<br />
<br />
Frodo, SoD - Frodo Signet. Also, I just traded for a FOIL Chinese one. HE HE.<br />
<br />
Frodo&#39;s Pipe - discard a pipeweed possession and spot X pipes to heal companion with the Frodo Signet X times. The centerpiece of the deck, and a mini sanctuary every turn. for each pipeweed, you can heal up to 3 wounds.<br />
<br />
Old Toby - card advantage, pipweed. draw a card AND heal a companion 3 times with Frodo&#39;s Pipe? OKay!<br />
<br />
Gandalf&#39;s/Aragorn&#39;s Pipe - simply more Pipes to spot, also can be used if I lose the bid and fail to get Sam(Gandalf&#39;s) or to heal in a pinch(Aragorn&#39;s)<br />
<br />
Wielder of the Flame - this card, combined with Gandal&#39;f Staff, is a beast. Cave Troll and the Balrog staring you down? Make Gandalf defender +1 and cancel the fight twice. Not Bad.<br />
<br />
Filbert - wins games against Nazgul AND Uruk-Hai, and the reason I fear Saruman NOT!<br />
<br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
<br />
Tower Assassin - nothing I hate more than the mirror, also can get rid or Dreary, Filbert, Bounder, Thrarin and is an 11 strength minion for 4 twilight. AWESOME.<br />
<br />
Enquea - killer of large fellowships. DON&quot;T PLAY HIM IF THE HAVE O ELBERETH!<br />
<br />
Guard Commander - this guy is incredible. Able to overwhelm with the best of them, and often a surprise, although some people are starting to actually read him.<br />
<br />
Scrabbler - heard of the White Arrows? Last Alliance? Tale of Gil-Galad? Me either.<br />
<br />
SITES EXPLAINED<br />
<br />
1- pull Sam, go first<br />
2- good if I have to stop, since I play with a boatload of possessions<br />
3- possible to move to 4, if I get a good early draw and my opponent does not.<br />
4- twilight, underground<br />
5- i&#39;ll spare you the clever quip<br />
6- cheap orcs, not a river<br />
7- either discard allies or kill an archery dependent fellowship, you decide<br />
8- stop them, then pass them<br />
9- draw cards, as if you need them. not a river?<br />
<br />
Questions I expect-<br />
<br />
PIPEWEED? What the heck is wrong with you?<br />
<br />
well, try it out. how would you like to cancel 2 skirmishes with Gandalf, shoot down a crapload of people, stop at 8 then heal up you companions to go to nine?<br />
<br />
PIPEWEED? Dude, are you High?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
It will LOSE to Uruk-Hai.<br />
<br />
No it doesn&#39;t. Use up archery/Servants/PATHS to kill them on the first move, then get beat up on the second move. Stop. Heal up and repeat. TRY IT!<br />
<br />
It Will LOSE to Moria.<br />
<br />
I played against 3 Moria decks at the DPC and had ZERO trouble with their shadow. Gandalf handles Moria&#39;s conditions, and we all know that without conditions Moria can only blow up on you once, and thats what PATHS is for. <br />
<br />
It Will LOSE to Nazgul.<br />
<br />
This is actually the hardest shadow to play against. They can get the jump on you before you get a chance to beef up, which means they can REALLY hurt. If you know what they are playing, give them ZERO twilight, or start Aragorn. Mix it up, and DON&#39;T bid high. They want you to go first, so do. Just be careful, Nazgul are hard.<br />
<br />
It Will LOSE to Sauron.<br />
<br />
ummm, I dunno what Sauron decks will come from Elf Lords, but the standard UTWE/Bowmen/Hate decks with not have ANY condtions, al least thats what sleep says. They won&#39;t do anything to you early game, and late game you will be smoking, so Hate won&#39;t touch you. Probably your easiest matchup.<br />
<br />
Moria is dead.<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<br />
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.<br />
No, but seriously. I am not trying to kill them will Moria, although I will do it with great pleasure. To be fair, Moria is weakened in the current environment since EVERYONE and their Grandma are packing HEAVY condition removal. The Shadow is for cycling and stopping, nothing more. Overwhelm&#39;s are merely a sick bonus.<br />
<br />
Well, thanks for looking. This deck is really very good, and if you have any questins feel free to D-Mail or e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com<br />
See ya&#39;ll at Deciphercon, and watch for my TR from the DPC, if I feel like reliving that nightmare. Heh Heh.<br />
