  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Despite initial appearences, this deck is quite solid, and very versatile. The starting fellowship is simple. Boromir is a must for boosting Hobbits, and since he only costs 3, you might as well start a 1 deploy Hobbit. I usually bid fairly high to get the first turn and the Farmer&#39;s Fields. It may seem like a really lame starting location, but that is the beauty of it. Many current decks are built around Aragorn, and almost depend on their Pracing Pony, while most people don&#39;t even play Merry or Pippin, so in starting the fields you take away their first turn Aragorn, and give yourself Pippin, who can cure a burden or wound. <br />
<br />
This deck is strongest at the first few sites, especially if you get a Talent For Not Being Seen out early. You should be able to get to site 3 first turn every game, and hit the second sanctuary 3rd turn. The hobbit boosters (intuition, Stealth, Boromir) keep you quite safe at the first 5 sites, and the Hobbit&#39;s 4 vitality combined with Hobbit Appetite should be plenty to save you late game. <br />
<br />
The Elf Allies are quite useful and give you the edge against Orcs and Uraks, and with Celeborn + Galadriel it ensures that your archers get 2 shots every turn. The Mirror Of Galadriel is quite useful against every deck type, and in my opinion it is one of the most underrated cards in the game. <br />
<br />
The Shadow is straight Moria Swarm. Drop a bunch of guys cheap, and use the Cave Troll to keep &#39;em reeling. The Armories are key for adding pool, AND avoiding Archery, PATHS, etc.<br />
<br />
Site selection... Most of them are pretty straight forward, except for one little piece of Adventure deck tech, which I will explain...<br />
<br />
If you lose the bid, and your oppenent goes first, he will invariably move to your site 2. As everyone knows, Moria is the weakest shadow minions at sites 2-3, and is very hard pressed to cause more damage than will be healed at the sanctuary. However, if your opponent moves to your site 2, the Bree Streets,hineyuming you don&#39;t play any Moria minions, your oppenent will no doubt fear the Nazgul BEATS at the Ford of Bruen, and most likely stop at site 2. I&#39;ve found this to be far more effective than playing Minions, and should allow you to get to site 3 before your opponent, forcing them to play catch up all game. <br />
<br />
Finally, a couple card choices:<br />
Aragorn: The original version of the deck had no Aragorn OR Gandalf, and I especially loved beating people without thehineyistance of the 2 biggest mains in LotR. However, the Silverlode banks put a crimp in my Rangerless deck, and the majority of people start Prancing Pony if I lose the bet. His defender +1 text can also be quite useful late game. <br />
<br />
Relics of Moria: How many times have you had extra pool at site 9?<br />
<br />
Summit Of Amon Hen: Though I usually bid 4-5, I quite often end the game with no burdons thanks to Sam and Hobbit Appetite, and it&#39;s great to pull with Thror&#39;s Map, or draws you extra cards if your opponent arrives first. <br />
<br />
I think that&#39;s it, good luck!<br />
