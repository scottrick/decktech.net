B*tch please, this deck OWNS Nazgul. Ferny gets wasted by archery ten times outta ten, and if my opponent gets all kinda sh*t in his opening hand then he&#39;s either lucky or cheating. Maybe I&#39;ll get Gwemegil, Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Flaming Brand, Ranger&#39;s Sword, and SotNK x2 in my opening hand too - in fact, I stand a better chance of drawing a beef opening hand than most opponents because my deck is small and contains multiples of vital cards. Re-read my strat against Nazgul and take it as gospel cuz it&#39;s tha d*mn truth, word.<br />
<br />
K the deck is copy-pasted from Apprentice so I hope it shows up OK. *** denotes starting guys, Arwen and Sam. 66 cards.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
This deck is all about the speed. It&#39;s about showing up at site 9 before your opponent can blink.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
HOW TO PLAY IT<br />
<br><br />
Most of the time I bid 6. Going first is imperative. You start Sam, so he removes 3, then you add 1 to get Aragorn. So you&#39;ll have 4 burdens, just under the legal limit enforced by Officer Enqueer. And that oughta last ya till the first sanctuary, except against Nazgul...but I&#39;m getting ahead of myself.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Go first, get Aragorn, and drop all the Free Peeps cards you can. Both sides of the deck are constructed in such a way that you should be able to play every card in your hand for each respective turn (i.e., you will play all of your FP cards on your turn, and all of your Shadow cards on your opponent&#39;s). In fact, with the Shadow side, you ought to make it a goal to play all the Shadow cards in your hand each turn. There are exceptions to this, but do your best to rid your hand of Moria cards as you want to beef up your Fellowship as quickly as possible. The only cards you should save in your hand are:<br />
<br><br />
Cave Troll (never save for more than 1 turn)<br />
<br><br />
Balrog (gotta hate it when you draw this guy opening hand, but it happens)<br />
<br><br />
Ranger&#39;s Versatility (except against Sauron/Uruks, who can cancel it)<br />
<br><br />
Gondor&#39;s Vengeance (never save for more than 1 turn)<br />
<br><br />
Asfaloth (sometimes, if you want to save it for sites 6+)<br />
<br><br />
Swordsman otnk (the only card I would condone holding for more than 1 turn)<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Everything else just plays. So you go first, if your opponent bid 5 intending to start Green Dragon Inn, he&#39;s in trouble ain&#39;t he? In fact, based on your meta, you can even bid more. It don&#39;t matter. Youre ahead early and you stay ahead. Kill Sam ASAP once he&#39;s done his job, so he won&#39;t stick around adding pool. The No Stranger x4 gets them out quickly, theyre key. You get to site 3, stop. Your opponent goes and you get all the Shadow cards out of your hand. He&#39;ll more than likely move to site 3 as well, giving you TWO chances to play shadow cards and reconcile (meaning you&#39;ll get to draw more cards to fuel your FP&#39;s fire).<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Your second turn, you will try to double-move to the Bridge. Shouldn&#39;t be much of a challenge really. Then your opponent will go and more than likely get a Cave Troll in his face, stuffing him at site 4. You move to site 6, and drop another Troll and/or Balrog on the opponent at site 5. Chances are he&#39;ll be stuck there too, so now you have an unstoppable lead. All you have to do is double-move once between 6 and 9.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Check out the card choices and how they make the deck tick:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Gondor&#39;s Vengeance: Such a cheese card. I have discarded more took-Kings and Cave Trolls than Osama Bin Laden has brothers and sisters, and when it happens it just pisses your opponent off. This card is your "double-move for free" card, along with...<br />
<br><br />
Ranger&#39;s Versatility: No, this card is NOT dead, and against Nazgul or the Troll it ALSO will let you double-move with ease. Only one copy because it has become a little more limited than it originally was, and because I have to draw one of my two Bows before it can have much effectiveness.<br />
<br><br />
4 No Stranger: Totally fits the theme of the deck - very important to get these out early. Imagine having Aragorn, Arwen, and Frodo at site 3 agaisnt a Moria deck. You play a couple cards, say a Ranger&#39;s Sword and an Armor, then Sting that twilight away, and move into site 4 (your opponent&#39;s Mithril Mine). Opponent now has FOUR twilight to work with at SITE 4, where he as a Moria player ought to be playing mad shimmer. Just one of the many examples where this card wins games, and fits right into a deck like this.<br />
<br><br />
Swordsman otnk: works with everyone except Frodo, and wins skirmishes for ya. Also an easily-discarded card when not needed (though it usually is needed) - AND comes up big against Uruks early on (ala Ettenmoors)<br />
<br><br />
Frodo support cards: Sting x3 is for more twilight choke, O Elbereth! and Mithril Coat just help keep the little guy alive. Hell, he can even win some skirmishes at power 7 and canceling strength and damage bonuses.<br />
<br><br />
Bozomir: the human meat shield. Drop him (preferably with a No Stranger) to suck up some wounds and maybe exert for Gondor&#39;s Vengeance, then kill him off. He&#39;s not there to win fights, just to help you keep moving.<br />
<br><br />
Moria shadow: is just there to cycle through as fast as possible, I cannot stress enough that you MUST aim to play ALL shadow cards every turn, save maybe the Balrog or Troll.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
OK, so against:<br />
<br><br />
Nazgul - this deck absolutely destroys Nazgul. I&#39;ve playtested it every which way, Twilights, original, corruption, etc. Even with a high bid it doesnt matter. You will alter your game plan and stop at site 2 most games, however. If your opponent then moves to site 3 his first turn he gives you the game, because you will be able to use your site 3 to move from sanctuary-to-sanctuary (and YES you can do this, especially against Nazgul). In any case, you cycle through your deck so fast that before you know it, you&#39;ve got Arwen with Asfaloth and Gwemegil kicking the piss out of the took-King with Pale Blade (and yes I have done this in a real game). The twilight denial this deck does is also pretty intense against Nazgul, as the opponent will be hard pressed to put more than one Gul down at a time, even with the help of Morgul Gay-tes. You beat him to site 9 easily.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Uruks - You may also have to stop at site 2 here as well. The great thing about this deck is that it reliably pulls off the sites 3-6 move if the opponent gets greedy and moves ahead of you early, allowing you to play your sanctuary. In any case, you will once again cycle through your deck fast enough to get your guys beefed up to take out the Uruks. Frodo can fight for you here. Use your SotNK&#39;s wisely, and get the No Strangers out. When you move to Hollin with Gornie and Arwen (each with No Stranger), and give your opponent 4 twilight, he won&#39;t have much he can do. Even sites 5 and 7 will have a site number of 4, giving him a meager 7 twilight at each. That&#39;s either one big Uruk or two small ones, and either way you ought to have drawn the tools to dispatch them.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Sauron - You gotta MOVE this game. I would even recommend skipping sanctuary 6 some of the time. Move 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, and 7-9 if you can. You don&#39;t want to have to deal with Watching Eyes and Bowmen. The fact that the opponent&#39;s minions roam up until site 6 is huge, giving your SotNK&#39;s double value and allowing your twilight denial strategy to really shine. The double move every turn won&#39;t always work out, but haul arse the best you can against the Red Eyes.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Moria - this is your toughest matchup, as is the case in many decks. The lack of universal condition removal in this deck will be your downfall if you cannot win the race before the opponent has the chance to get all his nasty conditions out. The larger your opponent&#39;s deck is, the better off you are. You will make the 1-3 site jump easily, but from there you just have to hope for the best. This is the only minion culture I have lost to in playtesting. In some games, I walk to site 5 and the opponent has nothing for me but a Runner and a Balrog. In others, by that time he has dropped 3 Armories, They Are Coming, and a Relics. Fortunately ARV still works on the Troll (unless your opponent is playing Uruk Scouts in his Moria deck just in case, in which instance he deserves a pat on the back), and Frodo can fight for you here too (Frodo + Mithril Coat + Sting + O Elbereth beats a Runner OR a Scout OR a non-underground Wallcrawler, even with a Scimitar). It&#39;ll be a tough game, but still very winnable.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
RE-CAP (if you&#39;re gonna review, at least read this part)<br />
<br><br />
Bid 6, remove 3 with Sam, go first, get Aragorn<br />
<br><br />
move 1-3, 3-5, 5-6, 6-8, 8-9 (usually)<br />
<br><br />
play ALL shadow cards in hand each turn so that you can cycle through and get cards to beef up your Fellowship.<br />
<br><br />
Gondor&#39;s Vengeance + ARV make for easy double-moves<br />
<br><br />
win the game by making it to site 9 (although I have won by overwhelming Frodo before as well)<br />
