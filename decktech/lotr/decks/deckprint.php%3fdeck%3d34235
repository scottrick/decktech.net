<br />
Free Peoples<br />
For the start you definitely need a third knight in your hand, preferably Aragorn - otherwise you should mulligan. That is because there are eight fortifications in the deck that you can transfer for free if you can spot three knights.<br />
The main killing combo for big minions is Fourth Level (exhausting the minion) and then Men of Numenor (wounding it). If you dont have a Men of Numenor, Citadel of the Stars or using Targons game text works too. Swords, Mounts, City Walls and sometimes Garrison of Osgiliath help you to win skirmishes or at least to be not overwhelmed. Wounds should always go to Ingold (but dont let him die!) because he is the easiest to be healed.<br />
Aragorn equipped with a sword and mount is your main figher, you shouldnt hesitate to use his healing ability each turn. The second best are the Knights of Dol Amroth because they are virtually damage +1.<br />
Take Cover can get you one of the unique fortifications back or usually another Fourth Level.<br />
The Hobbit Sword and There and back again are a little Frodo protection, but hopefully you dont have to fight with him.<br />
Usually you can play nearly all of your free peoples cards, keeping only Men of Numenor (sometimes Take Cover) and companions over five in your hand. So there is enough place for your shadow setup.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
The idea is to play a big Uruk-hai and a Raider with ambush the first turn. Something like a Squad of Uruk-Hai or better an Uruk Rear Guard and a Desert Sneak with a Raider Bow, hopefully forcing them to assign your ambush 6 archer! Another choice could be Southron Invaders with a Raider Halberd exerting them eventually to give you some pool.<br />
If they dare to double you should be able to play at least a Tyrannical Uruk or an Easterling Pillager with a Raider Halberd and another big bad guy, usually even more.<br />
For some archery protection there are two Broad-bladed Swords and Shelob! The Uruk Spear can be used to discard a couple of your opponents mounts. If you dont see any of the above just toss them on any Uruk you like and discard Shelob.<br />
Ferocity is the only card that gets around The Tale of the Great Ring and comes in handy as a surprise too.<br />
You wont get to use the Easterling Pillagers gametext, but Southron Invaders can bring back minions with ambush, Desert Sneaks get nasty when you have initiative, Uruk Rear Guards can pump other Uruks at battlegrounds and Squads of Uruk-hai are damage +2 vs low resistance companions.<br />
<br />
Thats it, good luck and have fun! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
