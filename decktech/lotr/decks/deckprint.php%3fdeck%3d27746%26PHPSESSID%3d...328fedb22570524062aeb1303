a few mounts to let us use the plains of the TT extension.<br />
If you don&#39;t start, don&#39;t hesitate to use mulligan to stop your opponent at site 2,<br />
so you can easily double move after that. <br />
I know that this part seems not to be powerful enough to kill your opponent<br />
all the time but you will most of time limit your opponent to a single move<br />
each turn except against a very big fellowship deck.<br />
I would have added more cards but i consider that the good size for a deck is 33/33 max.<br />
 <br />
For the free people part, i decided to try a new concept based on massiv healing and archery<br />
but without pipeweeds for many reasons. The first one is that pipes need many cards in a deck   <br />
and a good cycling ability. That&#39;s why free people part is often associated with Moria swarm.<br />
The second one is more strategic : when you want to use pipes you have to play cards on your companions,<br />
allies to retrieve ammos and of course conditions (old toby,...), it will be problematic each time you meet condition removal, <br />
Tower assassin and Grima bomb.<br />
That&#39;s why i finally chose the shire countryside ability, because it only needs non shire character burden removal capacity.<br />
There are many cards to realize this goal (Brace of Coney, Elf Song...) but none of them are interesting enough <br />
to be added in a tournament deck. So i noticed that Frodo&#39;s Cloak text is quite interesting in the first sites.<br />
More over, we only use conditions to heal 4 wounds during skirmish phase even if you have no burdens!<br />
I explain : you have 0 burden, and you produce archery fire, during skirmish phase,by adding a burden with AtaR <br />
and remove it with Frodo&#39;s Cloak, you&#39;ll be able to heal 4 times, great isnt &#39;it ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope you will enjoy playing this deck, I&#39;m waiting for your reviews....<br />
