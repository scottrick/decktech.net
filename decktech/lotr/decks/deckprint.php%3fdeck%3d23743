not: all Nazgul are the NON Twilight Versions because Twilight Nazgul ARE NOT FIERCE!!!!! thanks,    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, it looks like I got you this far, and I hope you won&#39;t be sorry. This is the deck I have been playing with great success for the last couple of tournies, and I am happy to say that it is undefeated. I developed this deck for 2 reasons.<br />
<br />
1) To this date, I have been unable to obtain 4 copies of Servant of the Secret Fire.<br />
<br />
2) To this date, I have been unable to obtain 4 copies of Savagery to Match Their Numbers.<br />
<br />
Therfore, after searching my thoughts(and binders) It dawned upon me that I have all of the cards I could need to build this deck, so I did. <br />
<br />
You see, I have been looking at all of these Super Fellowship decks (after losing in the finals to Steven Lewis&#39; version) and I like the way they run. Stop the fellowship, run and play often every single card from your hand, every turn. My deck deck does this, but in a different, and honestly, less risky way. Ya see, Uruks are able to stop the fellowship by damaging them too much for ANY fellowship to last very long. This deck stops the opponent by hitting them early and depriving them of their key member(s). <br />
<br />
Imagine a Free Peoples deck relying upon Legolas, deprived of him, and you can imagine a Free Peoples deck too wary to move very confidently. Admittedly, the Nazgul don&#39;t do very well late game, but thats not the point. They are designed to do the dirty work early, before ANY Free Peoples are set up. Card Choices are as follows.<br />
<br />
4 Witch King - simply because he hits the hardest, and with the Pale Blade, he doesn&#39;t lose skirmishes. If you have doubles of him, discard it, but there will RARELY be a time when the Witch King is an unwelcome draw.<br />
<br />
Lemenya -NO SWORD. It just isn&#39;t good, and it just isn&#39;t needed. Lemenya wins games in combination with Black Breath, and Black Breath Wins games WITHOUT Lemenya. Simply the icing on the cake.<br />
<br />
Toldea - I will not play with less than 3. This guy is usually as good as Attea, granted he is unpumpable, but if his ability DOES come into play, it&#39;s often a Game Winner.<br />
<br />
Black Breath, but No Tips? -the Blade Tip just isn&#39;t as good as the Breath. This card is the key to defeating to Super Fellowship decks dominating the DPCs. Aragorn and Gandalf are their fighters, so you WILL get the chance, Even if you don&#39;t wound them, at some point you will and they won&#39;t be able to dump those copies of their heavy hitters, which will clog their hands.<br />
<br />
All Blades - these cards are as good as extra wounds on all of their archers. Also, in rare circumstances, game winners when they are depending of PATHs to kill a biggy.<br />
<br />
No Relentless Charge? - this card is not consistently good. It is sometimes a game winner, when faced with an Archer deck, but when not faced with an archer deck, this card is dead weight. I prefer All Blades for archery defense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, now that you see how the Shadow works, I can explain how the Free Peoples complements the Shadow. You see, this deck needs only to make it to sight 6. Once you make it through Moria, to all the Lakes, Rivers and Forests, you have it made. You should be able to kepp up with your opponent, even if, by some stretch of the imagination, they are doble moving. Don&#39;t go out of your way to pass them, since you bid one, they probably went first and they got to play on YOUR nasty sites. If you went first, map your way along, because these sites are specially picked to complement your Shadow AND your Free Peoples. We avoid underground at 4, since a more expensive Cave Troll is a less deadly Cave Troll. We avoid Hollin at 4 since urks are the worst matchup for this deck. Anyway, once you make it to 6 your Free Peoples game truly begins.<br />
<br />
You see, as long as you are in fairly decent shape at site 6, you have a Map out and are holding at least one each of PATHS, ARV and Secret Sentinels, you will hard pressed to find a Shadow culture that can stop you. Moria will not, since you&#39;ve Sentinel&#39;s their Armories away, and you have a PATHS. Uruks won&#39;t, simply because their biggies won&#39;t touch Frodo and their little guys won&#39;t live. Nazgul won&#39;t stop you, cause they won&#39;t play more than one a turn, and nothing short of a Witch King can win a fight against you. Sauron is nothing without their conditions, and they won&#39;t have them due to Sentinels. Gift of Boats becomes your savior here. You can VERY easily walk from 6 to nine, and even if you lose a few companions you will NOT lose Frodo. <br />
<br />
CARD CHOICES<br />
<br />
King in Exile - Simply better for this deck. He heals Frodo, Arwen and even Sam.<br />
<br />
Sam? - he gets rid of the burden(s) I bid and provides a chump blocker. also is a little insurance in case I get denied the pony and the pull the Green Dragon.<br />
<br />
So Many Sentinels? - because Spies and Sauron can screw this deck, and because Moria really angers me. No one should be able to overwhelm Frodo with 4 Twlight!<br />
<br />
So Many Elronds? - well, so many Sentinels! also prvides throughput, and brings out the boats.<br />
<br />
Orophin - shoots down Uruks, my worst enemy.<br />
<br />
Asfaloth? - better than another Gwemegil, lets me pump Legolas if Arwen is dead, and plays for free on Arwen. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
thats about all I can think of to explain. This deck is FAIRLY straightforward, and, as the name says, VERY consistent. If you have any questions, D-mail me or e-mail me at handsofcarny@yahoo.com<br />
