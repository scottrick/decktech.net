I went 4-2 with it, and had a great time. It&#8217;s a blast to play, so I hope you all enjoy it.<br />
<br />
Faramir went in the deck morning of the tournament instead of Imrahil. I chose him specifically because I wanted more filtering of fellowship cards out of my deck. Normal Knight decks will use Imrahil over Faramir, but I was able to use Faramir&#8217;s text three times out of six games, so he worked well for me.<br />
<br />
I played Sting, Baggins&#8217; Heirloom x2, but I would recommend switching to Bane of the Eight-Legs. I didn&#8217;t own any at the time, so I couldn&#8217;t play it. However, if you have lots of Easterlings/Gollum or Nazgul/Gollum in your area, stick to Baggins&#8217; Heirloom.<br />
<br />
I played three Catapults and wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to go to four. This is THE tech card for this deck. If you want to build a good shadow hand, ditch ANY fellowship cards in hand. It helps also if you have two Gnawing or two Snows in hand, and you really need minions. Plus, you can ditch Catapult with Catapult. DUMP YOUR GARBAGE is what it should be called! Plus it rocks against any deck that plays cards that all cost the same, such as the Isengard swarm, Moria, etc. David Chafin was able to win a game against a weenie swarm by getting rid of three minions when he moved to nine (I think), so that proves the value of the card. Again, the card is in this deck to help me filter. I just want to stress this point enough here so that people don&#8217;t ask why I play three and not one or two. :-) And again, I would play four if I owned four!<br />
<br />
My favorite part about this deck is that the fellowship can win. It&#8217;s not like the typical Sam/Gimli deck that most of the Isen Orc decks play. The fellowship is very strong once a few fortifications are out. That&#8217;s why I opted for this instead of a fellowship that just survives until their shadow can kill the opponent.<br />
<br />
I opted for Knight&#8217;s Spear of Knight&#8217;s Mount because I found I just didn&#8217;t use the text on the Mount enough. Plus, the option to add threats to be stronger also proved to be very powerful against Ryan Jones&#8217; Dunland deck. My Aragorn had Knight&#8217;s Spear and Gondor Bow, so he was able to add two threats to beat Wulf with War Club. Not too shabby!!!<br />
<br />
Ingold is your healing. In your fellowship phase, provided you have more than one Sixth Level, ditch a Sixth Level to heal him twice. Then, in your regroup phase, exert him to get a Sixth Level, and then exert him again to get another fortification. Then it all starts over in your next fellowship phase when you heal him again. Aragorn can also be used to heal any Gondor guy (except himself), so that&#8217;s also something to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
Frodo choice &#8211; I would probably play Wicked Master if I owned him, but Resolute Hobbit is okay. Ring choice &#8211; I still swear by ATAR, though Such a Weight to Carry might not be a bad choice here. Frodo is pretty weak, and I don&#8217;t play many PATHS. Sam is a throw in to remove any burdens against Easterlings, Sauron, and Nazgul.<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is very basic and easy to play. I based it on Garrhet Noda&#8217;s Day 1 Vegas PSE deck. Stack your hand with as many orcsies as possible for a Site 4, 5, or 7 kill. Snows will help. If you are playing against a Merry&#8217;s Sword Rohan deck, Enquea won&#8217;t do much, so you must either win with your fellowship, or win with the card drawing at site seven. Same deal with other super-fellowship decks. Enquea will normally kill only one guy, so you need to swarm with numbers. I was able to beat Erik Cabanero&#8217;s Rohan deck at site seven, getting out 14 orcs to his nine companions, including defender Sam and Eomer with Firefoot. Getting Snows out is key as well.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you&#8217;ll find that you can&#8217;t swarm them enough, but you can still do serious damage in the regroup phase. Stacking the Tender is AWESOME, because then you&#8217;ll be able to exhaust Frodo, which means the Isengard Warrior will exhaust everyone. Winning in the regroup phase is lots of fun!<br />
<br />
I opted to cut out a Gnawing (Garrhet plays three), just for size constraints. I like playing thirty card decks because I am almost always guaranteed to draw what I need. The deck I played was 66 cards; a little bigger than normal, but still good with the Catapults for cycling. I ditched the one Saruman&#8217;s Power I was running because in play-testing vs. a Promise deck, I was fine. The regroup wounds kill Promise decks without the Power. Depending on your meta you might leave it in, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary.<br />
<br />
Props go out to Michael for helping me construct this deck. You were right, it was so fun to play! And props to Garrhet for the Orcsie side.<br />
<br />
Hope you all enjoyed!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
