As you can see, these dwarves are not meant to run.  You can build dwarves who like to kill things, but the purpose of this fellowship is not to slaughter balrogs.  Only under very rare circumstances do I ever double with these stumpies.  Basically, just bid one....and hopefully go first with Barazinbar.  Look at your opponents starters and decide if you need to mulligan.  If Galadriel or Gandalf or some other key companion is out there, I like to have a Desert Lord in hand.  Oh, and if you think you can afford to filter out some bling with your ring, do it.<br />

Shadow Strategy<br />
<br />
At first glance, this may look like another typical Sauron grind.  However, with the Mordor Pillager+Southron Archer combo, it is much more.  If you are looking at a probable 3 or more culture fellowship, I can almost assure you&#39;ll win.  Just abuse Final Account early and fetch your mordor pillagers back as often as possible.  Typically, I like to use Final Account to get back another Final Account and either a pillager or Southron Archer.  If it&#39;s less than 3 (often mono Gondor or Dwarves), you&#39;ll usually have a good matchup anyway with your grind.  I suggest pitching the Southron Archers whenever possible in these matchups.  The pillagers aren&#39;t a complete waste, however, because the fellowship must still exert to prevent the controlling of the site.  Also, he&#39;s fierce...which is sometimes a convenient bonus.  In two or one culture matchups, I like to use Desert Lord followed by Final Account to repeatedly retrieve Hates.  Also, if there&#39;s some random card you need back (discarded weapons, ring of fury to heal, Enquea, shadow conditions), Final Account will help you back on your feet.  With this shadow, it isn&#39;t only possible to generate 15+ archery at sites 7-9, it&#39;s likely if they have 3+ cultures.  Thanks for looking, and don&#39;t quit the game!!!....good times are still to come. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
