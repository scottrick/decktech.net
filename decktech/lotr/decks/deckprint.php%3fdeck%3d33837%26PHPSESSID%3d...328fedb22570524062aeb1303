<br />
It has been a frickin&#39; REALLY LONG time since I&#39;ve posted anything on here, much less anywhere else. I still play! Mostly, I use SDA since I&#39;m too cheap to spring for LOTRO, and I get a chance to try out the decks without having to actually put them together. In the time since I&#39;ve started playing online, 2 things have happened.<br />
<br />
1) EVERYONE is using that whore Galadriel. I KNOW you know that, I&#39;m just venting a little. Because of this, as you also know, support area junk is unreliable.<br />
<br />
2) FELLOWSHIPS are king. If you think you&#39;ve built a reliable shadow kill deck, you are probably wrong because it&#39;s all about the triple move these days.<br />
<br />
So, who can triple? There&#39;s the good ole Radagast who is the default triple method, there&#39;s Durin&#39;s Secret (which would be neat), there&#39;s Secret Paths (right...) and then there&#39;s Gondor, with 2 playable methods of truckin to 9. As a bonus, Elendil&#39;s triple move provides no real drawback other than having to drop Narsil on him. KEEN!<br />
<br />
I have insanely bad luck, so this deck is great for me. Denenthor guarantees (barring something calamitous) that you will have the 3 cards you need for the inevitable triple to 6. Those cards are: Elendil, Narsil, Aragorn. How, you say, do I get 3 cards with Denethor? Ah! I say, there are 3 ways. The preferred method is to play Aragorn and heal Denethor as he comes into play. The other are a little clunkier are, but work as well. If Aragorn is already in play, simply use one of your first 2 Denethor pulls to grab Hard Choice or, if you&#39;ve used that already, Saga of Elendil. Either one will have Denethor getting everything you need. <br />
Once you&#39;ve set up the triple, DO IT! Don&#39;t be scared. It WILL work (usually) and here&#39;s why.<br />
<br />
1) Beefy Guys - you have strong, durable companions able to take a ton of wounds, good wound prevention and sufficent healing. Several pumps to prevent overwhelms. They WILL survive most minions thrown at them.<br />
<br />
2) Minion Removal - between the damage bonus on Noble Leaders and Anduril&#39;s Damage, some minions will die in the skirmish. The strengh comes in Dervorin and Smeagol. Every card in this deck is immediately playable thanks to Denethor&#39;s tutoring, so bringing your hand size to 4 is quite easy. That represents one dead minion every regroup. Smeagol starts off as a potential 4 wounds, but will average 2. Once you pull a minimum 4, maximum 6 free peoples cards at 6 the chances to pull shadow go up. If your opponent is playing Gollum (Ninja, Nazgul, Burdens, Corsair Init) the potential goes WAY up.<br />
<br />
3) CLOG - this is the main reason that this deck functions. When Denethor goes wild, you opponent will either draw a lot of cards or give you his ability without penalty. Once they do this, statistically they will have 7 free peoples cards and 9 shadow cards. Obviously, that can&#39;t always be the case. Sometimes they&#39;ll have a killer shadow hand and sometimes they&#39;ll have a ton of free peoples and you&#39;ll move for free. The point is, that once you survive the double, the triple is almost a gimme. Drawing His Eye adds to this by letting you see up to 7 cards in your opponents hand and choosing the Shadow card that bothers you the most. Then there&#39;s a 50/50 shot of it being replaced by a useless card! Huge!<br />
Obviously, your opponent will occasionally drop a huge force on you going into 4 and you stand a BIG risk of just straight dying to Morcs at 4, but providing you survive to move to 4 the move to 5 is exponentially easier. <br />
For example, playing a friend&#39;s Besieger deck I was faced with 2 Great Hill Trolls, 1 Troll of Gorgoroth, 1 Assassin and an Agitator at 4. After taking my wounds, I proceed to discard a GHT, smeagol pulls 4 shadow cards and offs the Assassin and Agitator and I move to 5. Opponent adds another Troll. Discard one troll in regroup and move again, opponent plays nothing. The point is, after that move into 4 the other are about 10 times less diffrimbazelult.<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
<br />
Isildur over Boromir - yes, Boromir provides an additional token for Noble Leaders. The fact is that I am not playing a Noble Leaders deck but a big Gondor Artifact deck. Isildur is more durable and less swarm vulnerable than Boromir.<br />
<br />
Isildur&#39;s Bane - the constant strength bonus, I find, is preferable to ATAR. I also like being able to put it on whenever I want. It just works.<br />
<br />
Smeagol, ON - i think this guys is just SOOO good in this deck. For little to no cost, I am often able to clear the board for the double. He often makes up for big Elendil&#39;s lack of damage bonus. Also, you can pull some neat tricks with him and Ellesar&#39;s Healing.<br />
<br />
Elessar - the 9 base strength is cool. Since I am using Isildur, though, I could easily switch to CoG and still have some healing. I find, though, that not having to pull Hard Choice at 3 just to get my third card is worth working harder for the portable healing. Also, being able to wound Sam/Smeagol to heal a Gondork or vice/versa is awesome.<br />
<br />
Derufin - I am still up in the air on him vs. Boromir LoG, but I think the presence of Grond and how HARD Grond reams this deck left unchecked, makes him the winner. I could be wrong though. <br />
<br />
Shards - I really only use Shards for one reason, and thats the temptation to pull 4 cards at 3 and then drop all my hand on Shards, choking my opponent. I have NEVER done it, but I might some day and therefore the card stays. If you don&#39;t want this option (which is fine) go ahead and play Ring of Barahir, which probably is worth playing anyway.<br />
<br />
2 Narsil, 2 Anduril - 2 Narsil is essential. The idea being that, when you move into site 6, you pitch Narsil to &quot;liberate a site&quot; (bonus if you actually do). Then, you replay Narsil (either from hand or Shards or via Denethor) and triple into 9 with ease. The 2nd Anduril just feels right somehow and what with Stricken Dumb and Grond floating around, you can never be too careful.<br />
<br />
various conditions - all of the conditions are chosen for the ability they give this deck to survive anything. All are pumps in some way and they allow your smaller guys to block the bigger guys while your bigger guys kill they smaller guys. What?<br />
<br />
THE SHADOW<br />
<br />
Let me be perfectly clear, Shadow sides are almost completely disposable right now. Very little can actually be relied upon to kill enough companions to stop a fellowship from TRIPLE MOVING, much less actually win the game. That being said, this shadow stands a chance of causing plenty of damage over the course of the game and often CAN shadow kill when your opponent realizes he HAS to triple move twice to beat you to 9. <br />
<br />
GREED - the KEY CARD, yet why do I use one? Because it will not be good against everything and you don;t wanna draw it before they balloon.<br />
<br />
Enquea? - sometimes opponents add burdens to archery, but also he is more crowd control. <br />
<br />
Ferocity x 4 - i have playtested this deck with One of You Must Do This, Cloud of Arrows etc. in multiple different configurations, but out of all of the events I have played, Ferocity has killed the most companions. Ferocity is why I use Orthanc Assassin AT ALL and why Lurtz is in over Desert Lord. Opponents simply will not expect skirmish events from a wounding shadow. Besides, Tale of the Great Ring is a piece of garbage.<br />
<br />
I figure everything else is fairly self-explanitory. I will be a round a little more often from now on, seeing the Shadows spoilers has me thinking more and more LOTR and less and less, well, that other game. Thanks for looking, hope ya liked it. OUT!<br />
