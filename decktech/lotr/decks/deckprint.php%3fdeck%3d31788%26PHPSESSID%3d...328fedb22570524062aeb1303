<br />
I just played this to a 5-1 record at the Alabama TOC, as well as a win in the Finals. The fellowship is quite strong, combining the strengths of Rohan and Elves. It has great cycling, the ability to (usualy) beat any 2 minions you need to beat AND shoot down another. It has a great deal of healing AND possession recurrance AND some burden removal.<br />
<br />
Apparently, it sucks against Moria.<br />
<br />
The real star here, though, is the Shadow side. In 7 games this weekend I never had a single opponent survive moving into site 6, and almost all of my shadow kills were, in some way, a result of the Morgul Brute being on the table.<br />
The fact is that he either makes the Twilight Witch King scarier by wounding Frodo OR he makes himself that much harder to deal with. He almost beats Countryside single-handedly by taking their burdens, preventing any healing. So, why don&#39;t you just always play this deck and win everything? Well, traditionally Rohan has owned Twitch King for many reasons, Merry&#39;s Sword is mean, the mounts mean at most you&#39;ll wound Frodo 2 times and then die, they have Arrow Slits to take the Fell Beast and they can have a large fellowship without fear of Enquea. <br />
<br />
Not Easily Destroyed solves almost every single one of these problems, except Arrow Slits. What, you expected Rohan to NOT be able to deal with something? :)<br />
<br />
In most of my games with this deck, the game went something like so:<br />
<br />
site 2 - Nelya with a Sword + pumper, usually means a dead companion.<br />
site 3 - usually not much goies on here, but if you can get some wounds to stick past Sanctuary, go for it.<br />
site 4 - Brutes, Cantea and Nertea are great here. Brute sets then up for a site 5 King/Beasting, Cantea makes them deal with him and Nertea is sometimes better than a Brute. If you&#39;ve got 2 Kings and a Beast, go for it.<br />
site 5 - ALWAYS want a King Beast here, usually with back-up. In all of my games, this site resulted in either a dead Frodo or a lonely one. <br />
Site 6 - Frodo dies. <br />
<br />
Some questionable cards<br />
<br />
Cantea - why not play threat boy? I&#39;ll admit, there have been some situations where he&#39;d have been nice, but without a large commitment to threat adding the WEB is better. In the late game (site 6, that is) it&#39;ll often come down to Cantea or a Brute on Frodo, and FTW just doesn&#39;t do the job. <br />
<br />
Frodo, SoD - with 4 copies of Legolas in the deck, I need a way to guarantee the ability to cycle them. Plus, gives me a way to heal Frodo if I need to (Mirror Match or something)<br />
<br />
4 Legolas? - gotta get him early, every game. Often times he STILL doesn&#39;t show up. Essesntial.<br />
<br />
No 8th and 9th companions? - don&#39;t need them, as Merry and Sam rarely get played as it is. I also do not have any room to play gear for more Rohan companions, let alone the space for them :)<br />
<br />
Well, in the end I am happy with the way the deck played, though I am surprised by it&#39;s HUGE weakness to Moria. I do not know if this will be a viable strategy post-SOG, but it seems to be able to deal with the Black Captain better than straight Rohan (Arwen can still fight him). Seems like Corsairs would be tough. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments/questions.<br />
