Inspired by Anti-Euro Meta and a love for the Hobbitses, the deck features Super Frodo at QB, the Gay Wizard in the backfield and 7 other scrubs who make a solid offensive line.  They can win you the game but most likely won&#39;t have to, as this team is all about defense.  Apparently Moria can move by day now which is nice seeing as how the outdoor stadiums are taking over where the Moria-dome left off.  Granted nowhere is quite like home-field, The Cave Troll doesn&#39;t need home field advantage to kick some @$$, he just drained his knees and he&#39;s ready to go.  Luckily enough the refs don&#39;t call too many men on the field anymore, because Moria is all about the swarm pass rush.  The Troll comes up the middle with fire in his eyes with his good buddies the Keyward and Chieftain coming up the sides.  Enquea and Nertea are in the secondary for protection while the Guard Commander calls the only play: &quot;Everyone Blitz&quot;...  This team is almost unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Bid 1 and go second if you win the bid or the coin toss.  If you lose the bid or coin toss you will probably be kicking because most people want to run against Moria right away to avoid them setting up.  I say, go ahead, because unless they get a super draw, eventually that decision will bite them in the @$$.  Play your conditions but don&#39;t let them see your playbook just yet.  Unless you have an Early troll or Flanker and Swarms, I would save the minions for 4.  The key in LOTR is aggressiveness.  If you are aggressive you can control the game flow, and when you can do that, you will win at least 80% of the time.  So throw fellowship cards to get out an extra minion when you can, and double move against Saruman if you can, be smart, but with this deck, what seems weak to others should seem very strong to you.<br />
<br />
Here&#39;s some card choices for both sides:<br />
Companions<br />
Frodo, OBH: Heals the bounder every turn and more importantly is foil...<br />
Aragorn, Ranger of the North:  Best stealth in the game... defender +3, Aragorn dies.<br />
Boromir, Son of Denethor:  Hobbit boosts are essential when running.<br />
Faramir, Son of Denethor:  Savagery avoidance, Easterling burden avoidance, and extra chump.<br />
Legolas, DH:  Ultimate protection from all possible events... plain annoying to most people.<br />
Pippin, JAN: The other one adds burdens which I don&#39;t like.  This one take out an Uruk-hai, which 95% of people play... okay maybe not that high, but they should be :)<br />
Merry, LG: The other one removes a sauron orc... it was a real close decision in the end...<br />
Sam, PP: Defender +1, Ring-bound for Easterling decks, heals w/ Sam&#39;s Pack and Stealth events work<br />
Allies<br />
Dreary: pretty much shuts down Isengard site control...  pretty much accidentally.<br />
Bounder: I like a permanent safe-guard... He gets healed by Frodo, which means he&#39;s always available... sure &quot;Severed&quot; does the same thing, but it is an event...<br />
Elrond/Galadriel/Ottar:  The card drawing engine inspired by Anti-Euro Meta.<br />
Thrarin:  Always Good.<br />
Filibert:  Always Good.<br />
Artifacts:<br />
G&#39;s Staff:  More skirmish cancellation and it makes Wielder of the Flame free, which means less twilight to cancel my cancelling.<br />
Mithril Coat:  has 3 uses... a little archery protection, a little wound prevention and a little swarm protection, all sound pretty good to me.<br />
Events:<br />
Suddenly Grown Tall: no exertion.  Sure it&#39;s downright insane expensive, but does it look like I really care about twilight?<br />
Wielder of the Flame:  TECH!  Double up guys, then cancel skirmishes... double up guys when they die... double up guys and then discard to cancel... all equally fun, and equally powerful<br />
Possessions:<br />
Sam&#39;s Pack:  Once again... do I care about twilight?<br />
Sting:  STILL the best card in the game.<br />
<br />
Sites<br />
1.  Best One for Me.  Aragorn not important, better that he come later in the game anyways.<br />
2.  Gets Woody... pretty important for me.<br />
3.  Doesn&#39;t hurt me, might hurt you<br />
4.  Doesn&#39;t hurt me, might hurt you<br />
5.  Doesn&#39;t necessarily kill me, non-Uruk friendly (note to Decipher: I think Isengard needs some real help in the next set... just to even the playing field...)<br />
6.  Underground!  What the?<br />
7.  This site actually seems Moria friendly... Who knows if it was supposed to be, but it&#39;s underground AND really screws non-archery decks against me : )  This is usually where you end up winning the game.<br />
8.  This site blows, but what else are you going to use?<br />
9.  Gets Nertea... if you are going to make a last stand, you are going to need Nertea!<br />
<br />
Minions<br />
Ancient Chieftain: From the why not category.  Especially when you play like 9 or 10 Orcs with him...  This is guy is better than the guard commander was like 4 months ago... no one remembers what he does!<br />
Backstabber:  I like killing guys without overwhelming.  It really causes headaches during their assignments...<br />
2 Enqueas:  Because I thought the current state of the game called for 2 in a moria deck.<br />
3 Nerteas:  Because 4 seemed a little TOO crazy... I think 3 is the minimum i would ever use now.  Once you see him in action you will understand.  i played 15 minions at once yesterday on a 7 man fellowship... without Nertea it wouldn&#39;t have happened.<br />
Cave Troll:  Stopping power in a deck with very little of it.  Your stopping power is the fear that with 8 new cards you can do what you just did again... that and Goblin swarms is about all you have.<br />
Conditions<br />
2 Relics:  More for the card drawing engine... in bad draw cases where Elrond doesn&#39;t come out for the first 3 or 4 turns, Moria is going to have to get it done for you...<br />
Events<br />
Denizen&#39;s Enraged:  Very surprising to most people... thus perfect, easily subbed for Relentless, Moria Axe or some other wacky idea like Grima, Isengard Smith or Bill Ferny...  I like having 1 card on each side for a surprise or a meta-adjustment...<br />
Everything else is probably obvious to you, so I won&#39;t bother.<br />
