<br><br>
Start by bidding anywhere from 4-6 to take the first turn (I usually bid 5). Play as much as you can from your hand on the first turn (Use Sting first if you have it to see whats coming nd how much to deploy)and use Green Dragon to pull Sam and remove 3 burdens.<br>
<br><br>
Keep your party under 6 companions until you feel comfortable that the opponent is not playing Enquea (or you have a couple Versatilities handy). Going first gives you a huge advantage in this game. It will be very difficult for your opponent to double move versus your Uruks. As you move along the adventure path, your companions can suck up a ton of wounds. Don&#39;t be afraid to sacrifice them if you have to (always look twice before you do; there is usually some combo trickery you can do to keep people alive) but try to keep Gandalf and Aragorn alive as they are key.<br>
<br><br>
Why Son of Drogo? (He heals bubba!)<br>
<br><br>
Frodo, SoD is by far the best choice for this deck. You can use Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Boromir to heal Frodo as neceassary. This can be very helpful in concert with Sting (being able to see what your opponent has in is hand is HUGE!). It is also very useful against those rare Nazgul decks that like to wound Frodo. <br>
<br><br>
As for the minion side, the entire purpose of the Uruk-hai are to prevent your opponent from moving twice against you and slowing them down. You usually just drop as many as you can (you are playing with mostly cheap ones) and use strength adders to win your skirmishes. You will do enough damage that your opponent will be unable to keep moving. You will often kill some of your opponent key companions (especially early in the game) so watch for opportunities to overwhelm companions with strength adders. Use Spies to survive archery and Savagery to survive large companies. (Don&#39;t forget you can play Savagery on an Uruk not in the skirmish you are resolving...Thanks Hayes!)<br>
<br><br>
I would like to give credit and special thanks to Steven Lewis for constructing the core of this deck and gving me words of morale support over the phone just before the battle of the top 4, Michael Dalton for his help and suggestions in the days leading up to the tournament, and Scott Landis for helping me make the last minute tweaks to the deck and providing morale support as well throughout the day. Thanks also goes out to all the new friends I made at Vegas and those who cheered for me. I really appreciate it. <br>
<br><br>
One more last minute note: its very important that you discard a card every turn, even if its an Uruk. Don&#39;t let them clog your hand. You can get the big guys back with the Uruk Captain. The Shadow side does not have throughput other than playing mostly cheap minions and conditions. You have to cycle through your deck so you can see your Free People cards. Thanks.     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
