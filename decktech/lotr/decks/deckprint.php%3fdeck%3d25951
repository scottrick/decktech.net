Taken out one extra flaming Brand and replace it with a long knives. This is coz back in APAC Cons, i forsaw that there will be more Nazguls around day 2. Anyway here&#39;s the strategy.<br>
<br>
Bid : 4-5 - yes you can bid this high coz you will be taking out Sam to suck the burdens away. If there is a possibility, try conserving sam as long as possible to suck more burdnes off from the ring. Anyone who is carzy enough to bid as high as this is purely asking for trouble as you have the blades to punish them severly. Its not an easy task to take a nazgul who is fierce and Damage +1 whose Str is at an average 12. You will definitely want to move first.<br>
<br>
Move 1st. Site 1. Take out Sam and suck away 3 burdens. Aragorn or Gandalf will usually pop up early game &#39;coz there&#39;s so many copies of them. I never worry about getting my Ford out coz there&#39;s 5 cards which can change the site 3 to yours. Use Pathfinder and Nelya sparingly as you would want to preserve them for later usage. If i have pathfinder and nelya at turn 1, i will run to 3 straight... finish off whatever skirmishes, then pathfinder my moria stairway.<br>
<br>
Site 2: I prefer Weatherhills as it gives more twilights, and will somewhat manage to chill down the famouse choke decks around. With Gates, you&#39;ll get -1 casting cost nazguls. Better still Nelya coz he&#39;s not roaming at 2, thus making him only 2 casting cost.<br>
<br>
Site 3: There doesnt seem to be much of a choice for nazgul players, arent they?<br>
<br>
Site 4: Moria stairway? Why not Eregion Hills?? Well I have faced some situations whereby the extra 1 burden doesnt do much to players since they will be very extra careful playing against Nazguls. Stairway in other hand prepares your opponent for a punishing site 5 - Balrog. If you notice, my shadow packs in 4 Nazgul Swords and 1 Pale Blade. Witch King with his blade is like Damage +2 and fierce. Aragorn or Boro without an armor surely cannot withstand this.<br>
<br>
Site 5: Use Balrog to punish the already half dead company. They will hardly wanna move againif there&#39;s a significant amount of twilight as you will be able to pull out some riders on them at 6<br>
<br>
site 6: Caras makes it easier for you to move from 4-6, if you have a pathfinder in your hand at 4. <br>
<br>
site 7: there was a significant amount of moria players in APAC on day 2. And I have moria swarms. This site proves to be real bad for them.<br>
<br>
site 8: ARV&#39;s sometimes are still a pain for Nazguls especially when your opponent is playing archery. Archery decks need some time to develop and get themselves ready, so if they somehow manage to survive the onslought of your nazguls up to this site, you better run like mad.<br>
<br>
Site 9: Well, I guess its just a normal site for any fierce nazgul players since you can draw extra few cards for your shadow.<br>
<br>
Some notes:<br>
Why black breath and no blade tip?<br>
I noticed many people playing multiple copies of Aragorn and Gandalf since they are the 2 main man. So, its only feasible to play Breath as they will not be able to heal from time to time, and since most decks play around this 2 main guy, the moment any of them is dead, their deck will be wrecked. And on top of that, Tips can only be transfered if your riders wins skirmishes... which sometimes can be real hard if Aragorn or Gandalf is well packed.<br>
<br>
Why Son of Drogo?<br>
HTTWC, FOTSF and also Gimli in this deck works like a healer for Son of Drogo. If Gimli appears before 4, its a bonus. If he comes late game after 5, he can heal frodo.<br>
<br>
<br>
Other options to add/minus:<br>
These few cards are extra options i did consider for the deck. But since i prefer it to be thin, i opted not to include them.<br>
<br>
free people:              Shadow:<br>
Orophin                   Threshold of Shadows<br>
Calaglin                  All Blades Perish<br>
Rumil                     All Blades Perish<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That&#39;s all. Hope you guys will try it out. Maybe going up against me in Apprentice or something... :)<br>
