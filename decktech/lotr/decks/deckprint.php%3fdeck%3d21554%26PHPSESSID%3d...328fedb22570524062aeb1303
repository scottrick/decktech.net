<br />
"Double Bow!" a deep voice exclaims as the cute Elven Archer in Gauntlet Legends lets fly a machine gun like barrage of arrows, mowing down her enemies.  Here&#39;s a very powerful deck that replicates as close as possible that scene and even features Elven Babe Extraordinaire, Arwen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Top Cards: <br />
<br />
Shoulder to Shoulder is the motor behind this deck.  It fuels the huge card drawing capability of Master Elrond and the healing of your aimed Archers, Legolas Greenleaf and Aragorn .<br />
<br />
This deck plays almost like a Pokémon Alakazam deck, constantly shifting damage counters, but then sucking them down.  Shoulder to Shoulder is a maneuver action that siphons the damage off your elves and sticks them on Dwarven allies, Grimir and Thrarin.  You then enter the archery phase with fully healed archers and shoot everything in sight.  <br />
<br />
Legolas&#39; Frodo signet and Choice of Luthien round out the picture, now allowing you to shift counters between all of your fellowship.  Elrond, They Are Coming and Gwemgil burn through your deck quickly, getting to your needed cards for the Shoulder to Shoulder combo.  When the set up is ready, you are nearly unstoppable. The free playing Seen and The Unseen takes out harmful conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
How It Beats You:<br />
<br />
This deck beats you with one of the most powerful mechanics in any card game, card drawing, and one of the best Lord of the Rings strategies, Aimed Archery.  Oh, and healing.  Lots of healing.<br />
<br />
Agent Elrond is fantastic in nearly any deck, due to his ability to net you extra cards.  However, here his power is trebled as every turn you are shifting counters off him and onto his Dwarven buddies Grimir and Thrarin, who Elrond heals every turn.  Talk about symbiosis!  Now you can use Elrond&#39;s game text to the fullest, whipping through your deck and setting up your combos at warp speed.<br />
<br />
Every turn the opponent places down minions, take your maneuver phase.  Relocate your wounds with Shoulder to Shoulder and Choice of Luthien off of Legolas and Aragorn to your allies, then plug everything in site.  The Last Alliance of Arwen and Aragorn mop up any chumps who remain in hand to hand combat.  Repeat as needed.  A late game A Ranger&#39;s Versatility gives you the key double move to victory.<br />
<br />
As for healing, you&#39;ll be flushing 4 wounds a non-sanctuary turn when fully operational.  An ideal end of a turn would be to have Elrond, Grimir, Thrarin and Arwen with one wound each.  Remember, Shoulder to Shoulder works both ways, so when you fight at a sanctuary, take the opportunity to put some counters back on your fellowship, totally freeing up Elrond.  This will let you draw three cards next fellowship.<br />
<br />
This is a fellowship based deck, so the shadow side must compliment that.  The Nazgul, with their high vitalities and fierce ability, are masters of slowing the opponent down, especially early.  Although capable of killing companions, their job is to buy you a head start on your path to Mordor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Number 1 Card: <br />
<br />
Although it&#39;s hard to put Elrond Halfelven second to anything, Shoulder To Shoulder is the critical cog in this machine.  After shooting down endless swarms, you too will agree with the Dwarves and Elves: All You Need Is Love!<br />
