Let frodo die as soon as possible. By site 3 you should have Sam, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gandalf. That is it for the game, very little pool added after that.<br />
<br />
Underground, use Sam and his ability to stealth away minions.<br />
<br />
Once, you reach 6, use directed archery to split up wounds on minions to get them to 1 wound left. Then use Sam&#39;s Def +1 ability (or +2 since he has the ring) and path all the minions away (as many as 3 at a time).<br />
<br />
Keep wounds off of aragorn, because will need him to go def +3 before its over usually.<br />
<br />
This deck badly needs a map in it, but you have to keep it low in total cards to get what you want to. That is the reason for jank moria shadow side, just to get through cards, because the fellowship can run so fast.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is just what i pulled in a fellowship starter deck, so i figured i would go with that ;) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
