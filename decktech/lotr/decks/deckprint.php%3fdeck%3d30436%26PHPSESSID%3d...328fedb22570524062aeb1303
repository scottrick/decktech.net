<br />
&quot;Ah! he thinks he&#39;s clever, I&#39;ll prove &#39;im wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just to knock that thought out of your head, I mean no that I am clever, but only the title is intended to be &quot;something clever&quot;<br />
<br />
Ahem.<br />
<br />
So, by now I&#39;m sure most have checked out Matthieu Brochu&#39;s Ringbound Ranger deck and the Faramir Knows best deck that have been on here a good bit, and have been rated rather highly. I hereby give props to both of thos decks, and their builders, before I start to go into why this deck is good. They are the framework upon which this fellowship is built, so consider them agnowledged.<br />
<br />
The Ringbound Ranger deck (from now on RBR) has been apealing for a while, as they have the power to not only start 2 strong fighters but also have access to some of the strongest skirmish and wound cards in the game. The biggest problem has always been keeping the opponent roaming. Brochu discovered to all around key to winning wih these guys was in building the deck in such a way that the roaming, which is admittedly hard to maintain, should be approached as a bonus and not a requirement. EUREKA!<br />
<br />
Matthieu overlooked a few key cards when building his RBR deck, and those were quickly pointed out by the reviewers of his deck, and later by the poster of the Faramir Knows Best deck, who&#39;s poster I reluctantly cannot remember right now. The problems with this deck were in a heavy reliance on the wounding cards such as Ranger&#39;s Bow, Gondor Bowmen and Defend it and Hope and a lack of skirmish winning. I believe my deck bridges the gap between the two, and in every game I&#39;ve played I have yet to be in a situation I could not somehow get out of.<br />
<br />
Ahem. Geez, sorry thats a lot of stuff before any real strategy. Here goes.<br />
<br />
The idea of the deck is to bid somewhat high, depending on whether or not you feel lucky about Nazgul / Burdens, and then run like your butt is on fire. You&#39;ll be surprised at how much this deck can handle when the companions look so naked.<br />
You have solutions to most problems in your various wounding cards, fortifications and good old fight winning abilities. You have multiple defender +1 companions, some directed archery and the ability to make Frodo a giant via Dagger Strike. This makes for a very hard to kill fellowship, and one that, given the right draws, can double move 4 times to site 9 without batting an eyelash. Heres how:<br />
<br />
The CARDS!<br />
<br />
Faramir, CoG - besides being a bargain in your starting fellowship, he&#39;s a fighter almost on par with Eomer and allows you to start another fighter thats almost as good<br />
<br />
Sammy Haggar - starts for a measly 1 pool with Faramir and fights at a standing 10 with one card on him.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, Rotn - well, he&#39;s the catch-all against Moria and a Ranger to boot, which means he can use Ancient Roads as well as the weaker Rangers.<br />
<br />
Trent Reznor and Alan Rickman - sort of a fall-back against Saruman&#39;s Power, these celebrity lookalikes keep minions roaming even after you lose your conditions, which is great. Also able to exert for all the fun wound cards.<br />
<br />
Mablung, SoG - hmmm, 2 exertions for a dead fat minion seems like a good deal to me. don&#39;t forget that even if you don&#39;t have the Ranger&#39;s Bow yet, Mablung can use Citadel of Stars and Stone Tower in the same manner. <br />
<br />
Legolas, G - duh, he&#39;s only culture 3 and he&#39;s direct wounding in it&#39;s purest form. down-side? he triggers the stupid Insurgent.<br />
<br />
Sam, PP - even more defense against the possible worst matchup, Sam doubles up as a 2 minion hugger or a backup ringbearer should Frodo fall into shadow. NOICE!<br />
<br />
Questionable cards - <br />
<br />
Ancient Roads - while this may not seem questionable to some, I have friends who do not believe in this card. Combined with Gondorian Rangers, the Roads allow you to stay below 6 companions and still keep the minions uncomfortable. Absolutely KEY against Nazgul and Uruk-Hai, who can severely penalize you for ballooning the companions.<br />
<br />
Ruins of Osgiliath - the Trump card against Moria. I feel that between Proper Poet, RotN and this card I can survive at least 3 swarms, as long as one of them takes place at site 7. <br />
<br />
Bilbo, WSGH - as has been pointed out before, Bilbo is good condition removal in a culture that never before had any. Bilbo gives me the ability to kill the problem conditions such as Goblin Swarms and Relics of Moria that would normally give my deck trouble. <br />
<br />
MATCHUPS - <br />
<br />
Nazgul - the possible toughest matchup, due to one card. William Ferny. This guy absolutely can make a great day into a poor one. There are many ways to deal with Billiam, you just need to make sure you don&#39;t waste them on other things. Ruins can even wound Bill, but remember you&#39;ve got Defend it and Hope, Greenleaf and the Bows to kill him. Aside from Ferny, Nazgul are a relatively easy match, and one that you should be able to double on. Beware of All Blades Perish, as that can spoil your day. If your opponent doesn&#39;t look sad when you assign Mablung to the Witch King, use a fortification instead. <br />
<br />
Uruks - if it&#39;s trackers, it should be pretty easy. most of their minions die to your un-pumped companions, and if not they swing around again to makes sure you get a kill out of them. Saruman, BT AND Saruman, SotE can cause trouble, if they play the right one at the right time, but as long as you know when to go big fellowship and when to semi-choke the game should be yours. Big Uruks pretty much die to Mablung, but pumpers can pave the way until he arrives. <br />
<br />
Moria - Troll Moria is relatively simple. Kill their Relics with Bilbo and the Chain and Hammer are gone for good, which means you have multiple ways to kill Fluffy. Pure Swarm is harder, but you should play the game by ear. As long as either Ruins or Aragorn show up before 7, survival should not be a problem. If it&#39;s the Underdeeps deck, the fellowship will die before you do, as your shadow mauls them.<br />
<br />
Sauron - are they playing Eye of Barad-Dur? If so, be sad. If not, the game is going to be yours. You wil lose companions, but as long you play smart they cannot win.<br />
<br />
Raiders - Southrons have yet to prove themselves as a viable Shadow side. Easterlings will have to be packing 4 Gathering to the Summons to make a dent in you, and you have the most reliable burden removal in the game. As long as you are not Matthieu Brochu, you should not lose to Easterlings :)<br />
<br />
Dunland - a great deal of direct wounding cards combined with 2 Bows that straight kill them and the fact that 3 of your companions require a pump to beat makes Dunland a favored matchup. Your Ancent Roads will stay all game, as condition removal is rare in Dunland decks, so you can chill at 5 companions with Gorn, Legs, Sammy and Fara destroying the Dirties as they come. <br />
<br />
I think that covers most everything, but I&#39;m open to suggestions. On to the shadow!<br />
<br />
The shadow is something I saw my homes Chris Tubman played at a PSQ. While he did less than stellar with his version, the concept is still solid. People have become unconcerned with Wormtongue, which means they are either playing 3 cards or more on companions themselves, or are without a way to recover from a &quot;forced tongueing&quot; as I like to call it. While Dauntless Hunter can be a little bastard when it comes to conditions, I feel that 5 conditions that do not require spotting minions to play in a deck designed to win with fellowship is not a bad deal. Being able to set up the opponent to not win fights on a turn when they dump in the pool is advantageous in 2 ways. First, and obviously, you&#39;re going to do damage to their fellowship. Second, and more importantly, you clog their hand for the next time your fellowship moves. The swing that one Grima can cause is just gigantic.<br />
<br />
The other minions are basic cookie cutter Trackers, with the exception of Searchers, who are obvious switches out for the Chasers when I&#39;m playing search consitions. These guys are basically dealing 3 wounds when they fight someone with a Weary.<br />
<br />
The key to playing the shadow is knowing when to play what. When do you sandbag and save up minions, and when do you blow the load and try to kill someone. You have to know when playing a lone Saruman is the right play, to get the stop, and when you should play something they can kill so they WILL move again.<br />
<br />
CARD CHOICES -<br />
<br />
Ugluk - just a monstrous card, as he allows HUGE tracker drops on turn one. this can decimate an opponent before they have a chance to set up. also helps the biggest problem with Uruks, which is cycling. Ugluk helps you play twice the number of minions you would have early in the game, getting the fellowship going ASAP.<br />
<br />
Mauher - why only one? I find his ability, while sometimes powerful, is rarely needed. He&#39;s a good enough minion on his own to warrant a spot, but not more as he is unique.<br />
<br />
Hunter - a beefy Nazgul wannabe. with a Broad Bladed Sword and Saruman, he will kill something. <br />
<br />
Lurtz - the only non-Tracker Uruk in the deck, Lurtz is a stopper which is all the shadow side need to do its job. Lurtz with a Broad Bladed Sword on turn 1 is usually a stop, barring a ridiculous Free Peoples hand.<br />
<br />
Black Traitor - kill Fearing the Worst, Last Alliance, Gondor Bowmen or basically any condition that makes you sad. Grab the staff to make a good fighter! Yesh!<br />
<br />
Enquea - essential crowd control!<br />
<br />
So, that should explain the stuff that needs explaining, if anything did. <br />
<br />
The deck flows smoothly and cycles intself just right. In every game I&#39;ve played with it, I&#39;ve found myself moving into site 9 with about 10 cards left and a hand half minions and half free peoples stuff.<br />
