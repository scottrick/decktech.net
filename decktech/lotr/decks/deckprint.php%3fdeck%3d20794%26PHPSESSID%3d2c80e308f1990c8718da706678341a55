                       Strategy<br />
                       Strategy Section ***READ BEFORE RATING*** <br />
<br />
                       If you only read two points of this, read this: first, this deck was primarily designed to beat Uruk-hai, and also, the shadow side is not meant to kill, or<br />
                       be good. I’ll explain it later on in this section. <br />
<br />
                       First, the way you win with this is by racing to the finish. However, instead of a normal race to the finish deck, this one is designed to plow through<br />
                       everything in its path (preferably Uruk-hai). It also contains enough copies of companions to heal without stopping at sanctuaries. Start by bidding<br />
                       around 3, because you want to go first. Pull Aragorn. For those of you using the premium Aragorn instead of RotN, you MUST use the RotN. I’ll<br />
                       explain why in the beastly combo section. So, basically, go 2 sites a turn, and only stop at site 6 if you REALLY have to. Remember that you have 4<br />
                       copies of Boromir, 2 extra of Aragorn, and an <!--304-->Athelas. Try to get everyone with their weapons, and use <!--3-->Dagger Strikes to finish the opposition. This<br />
                       deck will always win by reaching site 9, never by killing the opponent (unless something absurd happens). <br />
<br />
                       Shadow side: I know what you are thinking – this deck is terrible, moria and nazgul? The point of it is to: a.) Unload all the orcs so that you can draw<br />
                       more cards for your free peoples, and b.) send out a couple Nazgul if the opponent is winning the race. Also, it is bad having a shadow side that can’t<br />
                       do anything, so I included them for some beef. Unless it is really key, don’t wait to unload your orcs. All you want is to draw more free peoples cards.<br />
                       (In the beginning of the game, if you don’t have Aragorn and Boromir, you REALLY want to draw more cards.) Save the nazgul for this situation: a.)<br />
                       either you really need some more meat, or preferably b.) opponent is going to move again, and surpass you in the race. If you play them there, they<br />
                       should stop the opponent. And, one more note: I don’t have the cave troll. If I did, trust me, he would be in here. <br />
                       So, don’t expect to be able to use the shadow side like a real moria swarm, only to draw cards. <br />
<br />
                       Beastly Combos: <br />
<br />
                       Aragorn + <!--303-->Armor + <!--2-->Coat of Mail + Ranger’s Sword. This combo is a must for most games. Opponent sends out too many beefy Uruks? Make Aragorn<br />
                       defender +1, assign him to 2 biggest guys, he only takes one wound, and doesn’t get overwhelmed. This combo is Frodo’s personal bodyguard for the<br />
                       whole game – use it well. <br />
<br />
                       Boromir +<!--303-->Armor + <!--305-->Blade of Gondor. Same as above. This is why the deck’s name is ‘Aragorn and Boromir take over the World!’ <br />
<br />
                       Swordarm of tower + Aragorn. Simply exert him to make the card +4, you don’t have to make him defenf two guys. <br />
<br />
                       Anyone with weapon + <!--3-->Dagger Strike. This is what lets you race to the finish while stopping all opposition. Don’t let those high vitality minions follow<br />
                       you; strike them in the face with a dagger – they take 3 wounds. <br />
<br />
                       <!--71-->Goblin Patrol Troop + <!--85-->Moria Axe. This deck doesn’t do much to stop opponent with exception of this and the nazgul. Would you want to continue<br />
                       with a power 17, damage +1 guy following you? I don’t think so. <br />
<br />
                       This deck was designed mainly to beat Uruk-hai. How? <br />
                       First, what makes Uruk-hai so good? High vitality, damage plus one, loading up the fellowship with wounds between sanctuaries, and high power. You<br />
                       have the tools to stop all of this. However, this deck will also beat other cultures, but Sauron might give you trouble. Just remember to save ALL your<br />
                       copies of companions to heal with. <br />
<br />
                       So basically, just let Aragorn and Boromir take over the world. <br />
