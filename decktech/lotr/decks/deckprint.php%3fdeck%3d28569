STRATEGY-OPEN FORMAT:<br />
<br />
Ok, I know...since the release of the card Evil-Smelling Fens everyone thought WOW! COOL! Every site can be a marsh....here come the tentacles, right?  Well, we shall see.  Hopefully this deck can make viable what was presented to us a little over a year ago in the release of Mines Of Moria.  So, I&#39;m hoping that with the advice and some constructive criticism from all who read this, the marsh-tentacle strategy can become one to contend with.  I&#39;ve only playtested this deck a few times, but the potential for a tentacle beatdown(or at the least, leaving a very damaged fellowship) is definately there.  So, here goes.  <br />
<br />
FELLOWSHIP:<br />
<br />
I bid zero or 2, as its preferable to go second (they go to YOUR sites). If you end up going first, no biggie, move slowly, and build your fellowship.  Legolas&#39; archery certainly helps, esp against Dunlendings (unless you are at your opponent&#39;s sites)  No need to race, although once the fellowship is relatively established you can fare pretty well.  Play what you can when you can.  Yes, you will be putting a lot of twilight into the pool, but you should be able to handle what comes your way.  HINT:  if you know or even THINK your are playing against Nazgul, BE CAREFUL what how much twilight you put out your first turn.  The Witch King, Lord of Anagmar did me in at site 2.  With only Frodo left to fend for himself, well...I learned.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, with 4 Aragorn&#39;s in the deck, it isn&#39;t necessary to pull him with the Riddermark.  I usually draw him or ANY companion within the first 2 turns. Any extras are good for healing.  The rest of the posessions, conditions, and allies can be played almost instantly.  Aragorn takes care of Uruk-Hai, <!--937-->Flaming Brand deals with nazgul (and can go on Eowyn if you happen to have it before any of the Gondor men). Haldir liberates sites (if necessary). Boromir pumps Frodo, Gimli reduces twilight at underground sites, Sam removes burdens, and Faramir usually sticks around for the long haul.  The Elves help my Gondor men, and with their exert-to-wound abilities they can reduce the damage from orcs or Uruks.  Elrond draws me cards and Galadriel heals allies and gives me free elves.  <!--845-->Foul Creation blows Uruks up, and <!--924-->Secret Sentinels finishes off the conditions.  Not playing against Uruks?  It&#39;s still good to look at your opponents hand, sparing Frodo the exertions from <!--194-->Sting.  Or you can toss them once you have <!--91-->They Are Coming out.  <!--198-->Thror&#39;s Map is still questionable...yes it is errated but still good to get YOUR sites.  <br />
<br />
SHADOW:<br />
<br />
Scavengers and Scimitars....any questions?  Host of  Thousands to get my runners or keyward or w<!--140-->Hatever.  I <!--140-->Hate not having what I need when I need it.   <!--963-->Foul Tentacle, <!--971-->Huge Tentacle and Watcher in the Water all a given. Cave Troll and Balrog for my underground sites...how many times do we see a balrog at site 9??? LOL I know, it is expensive, but with all the twilight that seems to get out there with open or Two Towers format i figured, hey, why not?  Nertea, <!--964-->Foul Things, Evil Smelling Fens, all get minions.  Only 1 Gollum?  Well, he is unique...nothing&#39;s worse than having more than 1 of the same unique minion in your hand!  Not to mention with We Must Have It I can get Gollum anytime, anywhere.  Why not the rare Gollum?  Well, I can&#39;t count on my opponent to have burdens, so as long as Gollum can survive to the regroup, BAM, instant exertion on a companion OR ally!  <!--303-->Armories give me twilight, Relics get me weapons (especially nice if I can get the spear for the troll or balrog!) <!--81-->Guard Commander can make ANY orc bigger by removing twilight, Keyward for a cheaper troll. <!--80-->Goblin Warrior takes care of those pesky Dwarven things. <br />
<br />
So basically, that&#39;s about it.  Even tho there is only 1 <!--91-->They Are Coming, I don&#39;t seem to face a problem with hand clog, or cycling, but a nice late game card. I don&#39;t really plan on my shadow winning me games, although a timely draw at site 7 can certainly cause a shut down :)<br />
<br />
So, there ya go.  Hopefully I can get to playtest this deck more and find out where minor adjustments are needed, but I think overall the desired effect can be achieved.  Feel free to test it yourself, and lemme know what you think!  Any comments or input will be most welcome.  Thanks for reading and have fun!<br />
