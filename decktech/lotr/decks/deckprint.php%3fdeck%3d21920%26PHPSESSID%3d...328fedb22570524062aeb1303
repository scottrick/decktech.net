Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir <br />
Arwen, Daughter of Elrond<br />
Legolas, Greenleaf<br />
<br />
I chose rare Frodo because of the gaffer. I would use bag end to get the gaffer and then go for sting next and just use sting like every turn. I chose Arwen because she is a good ranger that is proficient with an elven bow. I also chose her because Gwemegil rocks and here daddy is in here. I chose legolas, Greenleaf over the other legolas because direct damage is sometimes better. I put a bow of the galadhrim in because I felt that its pretty nice to get rid of the little creatures like runners and stuff. The extra point of damage sometimes comes in handy. I put 3 defiance in because i felt 4 would be a little to much because most of the battle would be won by archery. I chose to put in 4 elven bows because this is indeed an archery deck. I put in 3 lorien elfs instead of 4 because i would put one bow on Arwen. I put the last alliance of elves and men in because with all the elves, it would help aragorn. 1 rumil and 1 orophin is in here to help with the direct damage to orcs and uruks. 2 swanships are in here to let my allies do some dirty work. i put in one tale of gil galad cuz its cool with legolas special ability.I put in to elrond cuz he is da shiznit! him and galadriel and celeborn are awesome. With galadriel in the mix orophin and rumil get healed too!i put two aragorns in because im not starting with the prancing pony. ( i usually only play with one) Also i chose rotn because of the defender plus one thing. i chose one aragorns bow because i probably will not need to get it rite away and one rangers sword because i will be drawing lots of cards with ELROND!i chose 1 saga of elendil because the thing is cool with aragorn and aragorns bow. i chose 4 rangers versatility because... do u really need an explaination? i chose 4 power according to his stature because they need to be in every deck lol. i chose one common sam to get rid of burdens.(combo with the gaffer and frodo) i chose 2 thrors maps to ensure i get my sites. Y didnt i chose pathfinders? cuz thrors map is way better. u can use it more than just four times.i chose sting cuz frodo told me that he wants it. for my shadow deck i decided i wanted to play swarms so i put two swarms in. i put two cave trolls and his toys in because every swarms deck loves him. i chose 4 goblin archers to get rid of pain in the hiney archery. I chose 4 patrol troops cuz they usually dont lose skirmishes. i chose 3 goblin scimitars to draw some extra cards and pump someone up. 4 sneaks cuz they let me recycle and recycling is good for the earth. 2 moria axes because they are cool with goblin archers or anyone. 2 threat of the unknown to draw some more cards and 3 unfamiliar territories to get rid of pain in the hiney archers.<br />
The basic of this deck is just to hit and run to site nine <br />
