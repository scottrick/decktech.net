Use greenleaf and &#39;gorn to target shoot with max of 7 with tale of gil and saga .heal with elrond and galadriel.4 swordsman with bows and faramir with bow give max of 7 companion archery.4 double shot and 4 gondor bowmen has max of 12 archery. faramir exerts to kill men left over.2 last alliance, 2 brands (replace with rumil for orc wounding in standard)anduril, long knive asfaloth and bow of galadhrim for killing stuff that gets by.<br />
<br />
Moria orcs: kills unless he plays archers with pinned down.<br />
<br />
uruk: cost so much you&#39;ll most likely kill with archery. if any get buy thats what gorn is for.watch out for greed.<br />
<br />
dunlend: this is the toughest because of hides but you can win. that why i like gorn HTTWC.every little bit helps.<br />
<br />
sauron: kills orcs with rumil and just plain archery.hate hurts. if they get by u watch out.<br />
<br />
morgul orcs and nazgul: kills the orcs. watch out for enquea.vitality pumps are there for a reason.same as uruks but a little hard because they stop roaming fast.<br />
<br />
Shadow:Lots of archery.get your archers back with they are coming, host of thousands, foul things. scimitar to draw cards.Relics would help.oh well.<br />
scout play for free if elf is spotted and can take some freeps archery. runners to add twilight.<br />
<br />
Gondor:Lots of archery means no fortifacations (some times).watch out for gorn an faramirs bow.not much to counter those two.<br />
<br />
elf: scrabblers discard conditions.same as above watch for greenleaf. sack his tale of g.g. and splendours.if he plays condition removing u have only 4 conditions not a big deal.the archery will hurt. sack 4 cards to play pinned down (your choises).<br />
<br />
rohan: cant be exerted by horsys usually. if their deck exerts to do stuff like getting possesions back they are going to hurt.<br />
<br />
DH: choke is annoying. glad they banned pan though.not much to tell. do what you can.<br />
<br />
as you can see the shadows main problem is DH.freeps main problem is probably sauron or nazgul. all depends. if you have advice please let me know.please no hate reviewing.if you dont like it just say so.I dont like being told i suck goat *** ( directed towards Mr. Sweden).Thx.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
