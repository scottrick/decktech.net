<br />
The fellowship is pretty simple, and yes I know it only has a starting cost of 2.  That&#39;s sorta becuase the less twilight the better, but also becuase its just more fun to have Frodo, Sam, and Smeagol (but if you really want you cna throw in pippin and Merry).  but smeagol can beat most things suprisingly enough, with not listening you can add acouple burdens with no worries and if you have sting out exert frodo and move the wound to smeagol later since he shouldnt be takin em. and for when something like lurtz, witchking or balrog come along, you beat a weak minion, then add a burden, and -poof- they dissappear with dont follow the lights. I think at this point all the hobbit stuff is pretty self explanitory, but Don&#39;t plan on running with this deck, that isn&#39;t what it&#39;s made for.<br />
<br />
And the good part......the Shadow. <br />
It&#39;s very rare that this deck doesn&#39;t kill or corrupt frodo, It&#39;s got all the tricks it needs, even grima for those pesky, evermore popular rohan decks.  Hopefully with luck you will get gollum out almost every site, or all of them, and then you can use all of his wonderful cards.  Almost all the minions have something that adds, or works off of burdens, and they are all pretty nasty, archery decks are no worry with this deck, becuase gollum is easily one of the best anti archery cards ever.  Add, the burdens, throw out the legions, captians, beserkers and Enquea, and you are all set for massive destruction. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
