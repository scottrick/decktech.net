Valiant Man -- I had this in originally, but I had to get the deck size down. Maybe drop one Still Sharp and one Shards for two of these, but I think three is the absolute minimum on the Shards count. If you end up facing the Balrog (although with Gimli/WMGW, you might not), Valient Man it is probably the best way around it.<br />
<br />
Another Aragorn -- I was planning on bidding six with this deck, so if it gets outbid it&#39;ll almost have to be by a Green Dragon start, or another Pony start. Either way, you get Sam + Aragorn.<br />
<br />
RunnerTAC -- You either love it or hate it. With 4 and 3 respectively, you should be able to have access to one of each card by site five. Runners can often be *huge* at Hollin. If this was a 60-card deck, I wouldn&#39;t play it, but at 70 it is almost essential.<br />
<br />
Saruman/Spies of -- Last I checked there&#39;s nothing other than the Uruk Scout saying Saruman can&#39;t get nailed with ARV. Spies and Saruman both have a chance of getting you past the archery phae, but neither is a sure thing. Might be better to go 3 Saruman, 2 Spies, though, since Saruman is more useful in general<br />
<br />
-Free Peoples-<br />
This could probably use a bit of refinement, but I think the basic idea is going to emerge as one of the more popular strategies in the new set. Shards makes Versatility even better, and We Must Go Warily is down-right nifty. <br />
<br />
In the early game this deck is pretty stingy with the twilight. Heir to the White City will often cover all or most of your twilight costs. We Must Go Warily can make for an easy double-move into site five, especially against Moria or Uruks.<br />
<br />
At site six you&#39;ll want to swipe the necessary cards from the shards and be on your merry way. This stretch of the game will probably change quite a bit based on the opposing shadow. So, here&#39;s the matchups:<br />
<br />
Moria: Barring a good draw for them/bad draw for you scenerio, you should be able to make it to site six problem-free. You&#39;ll almost certainly want to move 3-5, and, circumstances permitting, might want to move 5-7 (with WMGW) so as to avoid a Swarm at the Wilderland. The conditions will hurt, but hopefull you&#39;ll be able to keep guys off the Swarms.<br />
<br />
Uruk-Hai: Probably the best matchup. Versatility hurts them bad, and twilight-choke hurts them even more. If you see Scouts, just make sure they don&#39;t survive to cancel WMGW. <br />
<br />
Isengard Orcs: These don&#39;t look all that strong to me, and should have the same problems as the Uruks against this particular deck.<br />
<br />
Nazgul: Orc Scouts are the x-factor, but you can always kill them in a skirmish, then Versatility the Nazgul at the next site.  <br />
<br />
Sauron: Possibly the toughest matchup, though the twilight choke can slow down the condition engine, and WMGW can severly limit the site-nine minion count.  <br />
<br />
-Shadow-<br />
The Runner engine makes use of the extra FP cards and ensures that big minions don&#39;t clog the hand against choke decks. <br />
<br />
Pretty standard stuff aside from that...<br />
