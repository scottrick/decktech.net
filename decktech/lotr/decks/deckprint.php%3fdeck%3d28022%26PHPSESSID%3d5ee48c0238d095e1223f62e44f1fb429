<br />
This is a fun deck, originally designed to just produce lots of archery, but tweaked to do more fun combos. It probably wouldn&#39;t survive and Uruk Bomb or a really good swarm, but that&#39;s why it&#39;s a &quot;fun&quot; deck.<br />
<br />
The idea is to get out the three Hunters, with some Elven backup, and use their abilities to generate lots of archery. You have the standard Bowmen, Bows, and Greenleaf, and also Quick As May Be and Baruk Khazad (these two help to defend against Grima, Enquea, and others too).<br />
<br />
Then the tricks come in. There&#39;s the Hand Axe / Elven Brooch trick, where you can discard the Brooch instead of a Hand Axe for the archery point. But you can also use Brooches to get extra uses out of Lembas and Athelas, hopefully making double moves easier. Then you can play These Are My People to get all those possessions back! Gimli, Arwen, Frodo, and Aragorn are all legal targets due to their signets, and the King In Exile can heal them too.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is a standard Moria engine, without Goblin Swarms, and with archery. Usually the weak minions are pushovers early on, but their low cost means that late game they can come back en masse through Nertea, They Are Coming, and/or Panatir Chamber. This deck can overwhelm with a well-timed Nertea, or do massive archery damage if you can get several Moria Archery Troops in play at the minion archery site 7.<br />
<br />
For added shadow fun, there&#39;s tricks like Plundered Armories. This is normally a weak card, but it&#39;s fun to put a Scimitar on a normally non-threatening Goblin Bowman or Archer Commander. All of a sudden, if an opponent kills them, you get to re-play the Scimitar, drawing a card and adding more twilight. Guaranteed to make your opponent think twice! And if they don&#39;t assign carefully, you can transfer Scimitars to minions fighting Frodo, etc. The other big shadow combo is just that if they turn the archery points into burdens via Isildur&#39;s Bane, site 9 is going to bite them. Playing a Nertea through the Chamber and then playing a bunch of archers for the kill is a nice twist on the Moria swarm.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and I hope you like the deck!<br />
