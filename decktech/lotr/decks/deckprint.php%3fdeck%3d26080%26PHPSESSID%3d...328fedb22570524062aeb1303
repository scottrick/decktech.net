tomato is right, the stealths wont help much in this deck. they were mainly for that common balrog, but i think aragorn with armor can handle that no problem. so yoink the 4 stealths, and put in 4 paths, since they will definetly help against moria. as for they must go wearily... i didnt know about that errata until after i submitted the deck, and i dont like it at all :(<br />

The object of the free peoples deck is obviously to move as fast as possible, while keeping the opponent from playing anything against you, and if they do, making them play as little as possible. With no stranger, bill and a talent, you can be moving for just the site number, not to mention the other cards in the deck that mess with the pool. since it&#39;s pretty obvious that the goal of the fellowship is to get to site 9, ill just cut to reasons for card choices.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Sam - makes promise work, and he helps with burdens.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Frying Pan and Sting - help boost your hobbits so they can be the best they can be.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Aragorn&#39;s gear - Supergorn is undeniably one of, if not THE best free peoples characters in the game.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Stealth - hobbits are a bunch of wusses.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
No Stranger, A Talent, and Bill - obvious...<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Must go wearily - such a nice card. all you have to do is exert aragorn, and all their guys are twilight +2 til next regroup! this works wonderfully when you double move, espically since they wont have much to work with in the first place. if you save this til the end, it can be the difference between a win and a loss to moria.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Deft in their movements - -2 from shadow number if youve already moved? sounds like a winner to me.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Might of numenor - this card get me out of so many binds that its not even funny. if you dont have the same luck as me with it, you could switch it out for a couple bounders or something else of your choice.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
as for the shadow side, its quite obviously a moria swarm, designed to ravage the tiny fellowships of the current uruk-filled meta of today. I feel that the shadow is pretty self explanatory, as you just try to get down a few more guys than they have and overwhelm key FP characters, or even frodo if you dont think they have PATHS.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
as for advice, id like to know what i should ditch from the FP side to add in some dagger strikes, and a bounder or two. other than that, I feel that this deck is pretty solid for a deck for someone who didnt buy many packs. thanks for your time!<br />
