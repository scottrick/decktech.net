This card would be so kwl as a suprise for them.<br />
<br />
But how could I make it work?<br />
Getting 3 cards in the death pile , 3 burdens , 3 threats and initiative + spotting a nazgul.<br />
<br />
Auch!<br />
<br />
Soz i started looking how I could solve this and came to sauron :]<br />
<br />
The heavy burden adding with gleaming , thin , and desperate defence could realy get me those 3 burdens fast.<br />
<br />
So how to kill sth then?<br />
Well that is where the Orc&#39;s earn their pay by enduring eviling , or hating them to death.<br />
The tower assassin can do the job too , hoping someone is stoopid enough to put down some allies , cse that would realy be a blast :]<br />
<br />
To get the initiative i decided to use secret art of flame , I didn&#39;t find an easier way to get that initiative going , but that I think is the most fragile part of the deck.However I think ppl won&#39;t realise what losing initiative is bad for untill it&#39;s too late.<br />
<br />
3 Threats? Site 9 easily dilivers that soz no probs there.<br />
<br />
A nazgul? Well I&#39;ve putted 4 guys in that each can do some harm on other sites aswell.<br />
<br />
Ok so when I started counting i saw I had 36 cards and that prolly my tech would be totaly ruined cse it never came out.<br />
<br />
So I decided to go with Gimli Gandalf start + Smeagol , cse it cylces like a beast and has a shot on dual moving aswell using smeagol.<br />
<br />
Agression and Delving can both get you the cards you need to filter out your hand to the essentials.If you ain&#39;t sure , don&#39;t move!<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoyed this and I&#39;d like to get some help here how to get that initiative thing work better.<br />
<br />
Cheerz!<br />
