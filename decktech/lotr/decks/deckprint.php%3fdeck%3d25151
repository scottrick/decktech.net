Bid 0 and do all you can to go 2nd.... <br>
<br>
first off for my shadow i DO not use Too Great and Terrible for one reason... <br>
1) everyone i play does not use Gandalf, they all use Gondor or Dwarves (i use gandalf in like 2 of my decks) they feel its too much to get a good gandalf deck going, so be it... <br>
Problem most nazgul have is they can&#39;t play more than 2 Nazgul per site... i fix that by making each one worth it... 1 nazgul out each site is all you need (trust me) then you have your weapons and Ferny to pump them to win.... You gates will get pretty funny when they have to exert or burden and exert up to 4 times with Ringwraiths Wake....  The key isnt to get to frodo by fighting him.. its to get 1 Nazgul to win and hurt Frodo (thus a burden deck) I have alot of high cost playables but no worries you have a fellowship deck that is made to burn through your cards to get only what you need....<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The fellowship of this deck is straight up archery with Merry thrown into the mix to survive the critical site 5 with the common Balrog..... Merry exerts twice to save Aragorn from being overwhelmed... then takes it for the team... Your pipes keep your guys healed whenever you need more than a Vitality 5 Elrond or Galadriel LOTGW. Sting and Aragorn keep the twilight low enough to keep them from playing anything Too huge and something else.....  Use directed archery when you need to but Splendour and Bowmen are in there to help if all you need is undirected high  archery (e.g. any type of swarm deck) Dear Friends is a good card for getting what you need site 8 (river) and 9. I use Dear Friends first to retrieve 2 ARV and then the 2nd to get another ARV and the 1st Dear Friends.... so it should be stacked like this.... (ARV, ARV, DF, ARV) You have mad discard skills with  Longbottom Leaf and Galadriel with ring... and dont forget almost everything can play that turn..... anything that can&#39;t you get 1 discard per turn.... if you burn your deck too quickly its fine just use the dear friends cycle of getting one back with another card you need.....dont worry about ditching ARV early you WILL get it back.... after you have your arv&#39;s in place you can go for any bowmen you lost or Longbottom leaf.... its a pretty good cycle ... i havent had a problem yet.... <br>
<br>
Anyone tried this yet?? let me know what you did and how ya did.... Wanna try it?? Remember to change what ya need for your meta first.... (Heck we dont even have the same Meta as they do 1 hour away) Gimme any insight you have on what you would do.... Remember once again that this has worked very well in my area..... so i dont want to hear &quot;where i live we would eat you alive&quot; and try to be constructive.....<br>
Later<br>
