Hobbits--they take a licking and keep on ticking. And, paired with Aragorn, they can get as far as site 9. And they can do it without rares. While it&#39;s harder to slow down your opponent, without rares, than it is to get to site 9 yourself, the shadow portion of this deck uses a combination the best of the uncommon minions and direct-damage cards to stall your opponent.<br />
<br />
TOP CARDS:<br />
Hobbits are weak, so they need to be sneaky. This deck features all 8 of the possible cancellation events to see you safely through site 5. From there, you&#39;ll need to fight your way to site 9, but using the prowess enhancement texts of the cancellation cards along with cards like There and Back Again and Dagger Strike, your hobbits will be able to win enough skirmishes to scclober by.<br />
<br />
*A Talent for Not Being Seen is a vital card in this deck. You&#39;ll reduce each site&#39;s Twilight Number  by 2. Moving to site 5, The Bridge of Khazad-dum, with 5 characters (normally 11 pool), that&#39;s the difference between an Uruk Slayer and a fierce Lurtz or just 9 Twilight, barely enough for  Lurtz who will no longer be fierce.<br />
*There and Back Again and Bounder. These cards aren&#39;t meant to win early skirmishes for you. These cards are meant to keep Frodo alive through the last few sites. Discarding There and Back Again to increase your Hobbits&#39; strength and exerting Bounder for a Hobbit Sword-wielding Frodo means the plucky little protagonist can endure as much as 23 strength before being overwhelmed. Even one Hobbit Stealth played to add to his strength will allow him to face as much as 29 power without being overwhelmed!<br />
*Ranger&#39;s Sword. Aragorn provides the hired muscle. Ranger&#39;s Sword is the best of the uncommon weapons. With it, Aragorn is Damage +1 and 10 strength. With a well-timed Dagger Strike, he can reach 12 strength and Damage +2. That&#39;s enough to kill most Nazgul.<br />
*Gondor&#39;s Vengeance. You won&#39;t be able to kill everything. This card will help you run away from early minions on your way to either Rivendell or Lorien, or it can help you on that last-turn push to site 9. By exerting Aragorn during the Regroup phase, you can discard ANY minion, even that Witch-king or Cave Troll.<br />
<br />
For your shadow side, you want to work a few, simple combinations.<br />
<br />
*Black Breath and Under the Watching Eye. Get Black Breath out early, and Under the Watching Eye will make companies suffer. With four copies of each card, your opponent will be strained to find characters to exert in order to move. If all goes well, you&#39;ll be able to exhaust all your opponent&#39;s companions and pick away at them with your better Nazgul.<br />
*Ulaire Lemenya will make each character burdened by Black Breath power -2, and Ulaire Ostea can exert to make any Nazgul (including himself) fierce.<br />
*Morgul Skulkers gel the deck together by allowing you to recycle fallen Nazgul and discarded Black Breaths.<br />
<br />
HOW IT BEATS YOU:<br />
Playing this deck, you&#39;ll want to bid high to go first. You should be able to slow your opponent down with your shadow side, but it&#39;s doubtful that you&#39;ll overwhelm Frodo against a good player playing a good deck. You&#39;ll want to work hard, then, to win the race. Bid 4 or 5, as much as 6, to get the Prancing Pony and play Aragorn. Exert Sam three times to remove burdens, and then move, using stealth events to cancel early skirmishes. Even if you own the rare Aragorn, Aragorn, King in Exile is the better version for this deck since he can heal either Sam or Merry at the start of each of your turns. Remember, each time you heal Sam, allowing him to exert, that&#39;s one less burden! Try to make an early run for Rivendell, but don&#39;t sacrifice characters too early. If you should lose a Hobbit, try to lose Pippin first (Sorry, Pippin!), then Sam (Poor Sam!). Three Hobbits don&#39;t do you much good. A Talent for Not Being Seen benefits you if you have 2 Hobbits, or 4. Give the first Hobbit Sword to Merry and the second to Frodo. With this deck it&#39;s important to remember that everyone&#39;s expendable EXCEPT Frodo! That means that when you face hordes of orcs at the last few sites, you might just have to let Pippin or Sam or Merry take one for the team. Save those prowess bonuses for your star, Frodo. You have enough skirmish events, cancellers and enhancers, and your Hobbits have enough toughness that you should be able to get to site 9. Play your cards right, and you&#39;ll win the race!<br />
<br />
AND THE NUMBER ONE CARD IS...<br />
Aragorn, King in Exile. Sure, the Hobbits are sneaky buggers, and I&#39;ve seen all-Hobbit decks that look OK. But this deck is better because Aragorn provides muscle, healing and event removal all for a very efficient few card slots. It may be Viggo Mortensen&#39;s scruffy 5 o&#39;clock shadow or his stiff-shouldered pose in the card photo, but--whatever it is--he&#39;s the man to inspire your Hobbits to greatness!<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />
