I had tested and tested Dwarves, looking at builds like Mike Ium&#39;s super fighters, Kyle George&#39;s toolbox companions, and Steve Jones&#39;s Super Healing.  I knew the deal with my deck was a shadow kill, and I knew that Smeagol took many less slots than Gandalf, and could help vs more decks.  Therefore, I decided to put him in with my super fighters (like some builds), and go with that.  I need to just survive, not run and win.  I have threat control in the deck just in case it is necessary against certain decks (my own perhaps), and I can win against most matchups.  The mirror match is a race for 9, and mirror/morcs can be a problem.  I can last long enough against morcs, and do well enough against Easterlings and Corsairs, so this was it for day 1.  And for people that played it, they did well.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
This is my bread and butter.  I tested the bejesus out of Enduring Nazgul, and I was so annoyed with certain cards (smeagol and faramir).  I learned that I couldn&#39;t play many minions in some matchups, had to max out their threats in others (threated certain characters to make them waste smeagol), and play enquea/BNAP as much as possible.  The key to the deck is to always assign.  That way you know you can have your fun with burdens.  I can add 15 or so burdens with the deck, and it owned day 1.  Chris Schoenthal used a similar build based on my urging, and also made day 2.  It was a welcome change from MORCS.  <br />
