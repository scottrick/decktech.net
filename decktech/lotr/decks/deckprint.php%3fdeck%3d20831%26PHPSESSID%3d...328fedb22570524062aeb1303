The fellowship is kept to a minimum, with Boromir, Merry and Aragorn, getting beefed up with their weapons and many strength-adding cards.<br />
This decks best way to victory is through the minions. Plenty of huge powerful Uruks, aided by Snows to prevent bad shimmer like Power according to his Stature and other strength cards. The Troop of Uruk hai (and Assassin)wins just about every skirmish with Snow, and Rampage makes each one Fierce. Many wounds are dealt as a result. <br />
Saurmans Snow is just large. Its so funny to summon up a blinding Blizzard right in the middle of the Mithreal Mines or half way across the Bridge of Kazhard Dunn.<br />
<br />
START: It&#8217;s nice to go first with this deck, so you can get the pony and pull Aragorn, who I important to get early. If they out bid you, theres 3 Aragorns so you can still pick him up early. A Bid of 2 is safe. knowing your local meta and what is bid is helpful. But as I said, there&#8217;s no need to break down and cry if you go second. The Trollshaw gives only 1 so an early No stranger or Talent, can Really limit them early. I like to double move to site 3 to put pressure n the opponent to move and increase the pool for you. If you see from their second site that they are playing Nazgul then its bets to stop at site 2 unless you have got god hand with Ranger sword and multiple Adders, stealth or something really good. Its often bets to just go one site at a time against Nazgul.  <br />
<br />
Mid game: By site 3 you would hopefully have got a couple Weapons out and have maybe a strength card for safety. As in most decks I have 1 sole Sam to come out and absorb burdens, block a big minion, soak archery, or even exert for Under the Watchful Eye. As I&#8217;ve said b4 I don&#8217;t like to move twice into site 5 cause Bad stuff like Uruks and Cave Trolls come out here. The Pass of Caradhras is a good site cause it limits the pool to the opponent (it can even be reduced to 0 with both conditions out) and it can play Saruman&#8217;s Snow from Draw deck. Heres the first site you want to start dropping Troop of Uruk-hai and dealing damage to the opponents Fellowship, particularly Archers and Gandalf/Aragorn. Snows stop Servant and other annoying stuff so theres no reason to fear dropping only one minion. Rampage can make a lone uruk fierce anyway. For the fellowship, the mid agme depends on whjat has come b4 it. <br />
If The minion have done their job and damaged the opponent and even stopped him then you can take it easy and just keep pace with him. If your hand is full of Safety stuff for your fellowship then you can double move through site 5 into 6 and heal most  if not all your damage at 6. If the opponent has lotsa archery you may need to use a Spies of Saruman at the Bridge to get through. In this case try to let the opponent move into your site 7 which stops his archery. In ideal circumstances site 6-8 (with both spies) will be no Archery. Lurtz as we all know is pure hiney and should come out b4 site 8 to deal damage in chunks (if the opponent somehow gets to site 9 you need more &#8216;swarming&#8217; characters like the Fighter and Warrior). <br />
<br />
By Site 8-9: The fellowship should probably stop at 7 if they meet any major resistance, you can double move next turn to win if necessary. Don&#8217;t for get the blade of gondor can Wound a bigger wounded minion. If they get to site 9 b4 you (which is unlikely cause you should have crushed em by now) they will move into the Slopes where your mioins are &#8211;1 to play. I&#8217;d save the minions and not deploy much at 8, forcing them to move or risk trying to overwhelm you. Then you should have sufficient minions to deploy real cheap and have no real trouble killing frodo. Snow stops all the stuff like PatHS and Bounder. Save your Saruman&#8217;s Power to destroy Thror&#8217;s Map to make sure they get your site. If Gandalf Deck is popular in your area add another Power to kill his conditions.<br />
<br />
All the card choices are pretty straightforward in this deck. Theres only one Savagery cause Snow would stop it anyway. Just there to beef up Lurtz or maybe drop it if you disagree. Armor is for Uruks and Cave Trolls. Aragorns bow is bests for killing  low vitality Moria orcs, though the Saga might be a good addition to help here.  Sarumans power is a staple card in my Uruk decks and depending on your meta you might want another one or 2. it&#8217;s a beautiful thing to play it on an  exhausted Aragorn and Legolas both carrying sagas and tales. They die, u see. <br />
<br />
I&#8217;d normally do a match up section, but I&#8217;ve already discussed key ideas to deal with the main thems out there like Nazgul, Sauron, Gandalf, Elf archery and mains. Against another Uruk deck the best way is to move slowly, denying their pool with No stranger and A Talent. Moira can make a puddle into an ocean when it comes to the twilight pool. So use Aragorns bow to kill off scavengers and each of your mains with a weapon and adders, can kill off just about any moria minion with minimal fuss. When the Cave Troll comes down, you can throw him Sam and the Armor reduces the wounds he deals. Merry can even win against the Troll with Boromir&#8217;s text, dagger strike and hobbit stealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion: so finally this deck is lotsa fun to play, with sweet Uruk-hai Beat squads and preventing most surprises from the opponent. The fellowship is strong as long as your in control of what your doing. You can win via overwhelming and by getting to site 9. And theres just enough tech here to keep them guessing.<br />
Enjoy the deck and thanks for your reviews<br />
<br />
Have a good one,<br />
