The Rohan Raider engine is also very dependable. Unlike the Rolls Royce engine which is very expensive, the Rohan Raider engine is a very cheap deck which is easy for beginners to make as it contains NO RARES. <br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
First I will look as what the Fellowship does and how it tries to win. It has lots of companions and all of them are expendable. There is no-one that you need to be too worried about losing. So you can afford to lose some battles and even have a few deaths. Don’t worry, you can come back from a really horrible position with this deck.<br />
<br />
Companions<br />
Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer makes your Hobbit Sword and There and Back Again cheaper.<br />
Eomer, Sister-son of Theoden is the oil that makes the machine work. Eomer heals Guma or Weland and they heal him. Sweet. Or if in a close skirmish he is pumped up by Leod or Hlafwine and next turn heals one of then so they can do it again.<br />
Eowyn, Lady of Rohan is just so good that she will see play in a LOT of decks. In fact considering site [7] King’s Room will be in a lot of decks people will be looking for a Rohan companion to put into a deck. Who is better? She even allows you to go to 6+ companions with little worry from Enquea, probably the only companion he will be able to kill is her unless someone is already exhausted.<br />
Theoden, SoT can be played from your deck by site 3 and will kill your opponent if they are playing a site control deck. He does NOT like Uruk-Hai!<br />
Ceorl, WH is the second part of your sire control denial. If your opponent is not playing site control just feed him to the first big minion you meet.<br />
Sam, SoH is so good he can still go into 90% of decks. Remove burdens and then go play with the Vangard. What other card can remove 3 burdens and block the biggest minion in the game? If you are getting towards the end you can even try and keep him making it much harder for your opponent to get a site 9 overwhelm.<br />
Faramir, SoD is another common card who is so good that he can go into almost any deck. Bring ring bound he is unafraid of Grima. Unlikely as it may seem Faramir can actually ride Brego. Give him Armor and he is almost impossible to kill. Leod can now pump him and Weland can heal him. Awesome.<br />
Elite Riders might not seem like much but think about it. Put them on a horse with a spear and unless your opponent has 1 vitality they will be STR 10! Kink of hard to overwhelm that! Don’t give them armor unless you are sure your opponent is not playing Grima.<br />
<br />
Allies<br />
Bounder can save you the game – once. Well worth one card slot.<br />
Filbert Bolger with Filbert and some spare wounds on Frodo you almost have an auto-win at site 9 unless you are playing against Moria. Also allows you to dodge really bad things like Vanguards in their fierce skirmish.<br />
Weland, SotR heals mounted companions and healed by Eomer and Well Stored.<br />
Leod, WH pumps mounted companions and healed by Eomer and Well Stored.<br />
Guma, PF heals Rohan companions and healed by Eomer and Well Stored.<br />
Hlafwine, VF x2 pumps Rohan companions and healed by Eomer and Well Stored.<br />
<br />
Possessions<br />
Eomer’s Spear is actually not much better than a Rider’s Spear and can be easily swapped.<br />
Herugrim is fantastic but watch out for possession removal.<br />
Rider’s Spear can go on your Elite Riders to make them tanks. With the effect of a Horse included your opponents will take 3 wounds per skirmish they lose.<br />
Armor is still the BEST card against Uruk-Hai. Put it on Faramir and he will never die.<br />
Hobbit Sword stops you losing the game. A second one for Sam.<br />
Brego not only hurts your opponents but heals the person it is played on<br />
Rider’s Mount wounds minions making the Elite Riders even stronger.<br />
<br />
Conditions<br />
There and Back Again protects your Hobbits and is one of the few things that will help at the Cavern Entrance.<br />
Well Stored heals an ally every turn, not even a dot card. <br />
Fortress Never Fallen is your condition removal. Will be effective against Moria but might not work against Uruk-Hai who don’t lose so many battles and have condition removal.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Easterling Guard and Easterling Lieutenant exert to add burdens. Even better the Easterlings don&#39;t need many to get going.<br />
Easterling Trooper with 3 burdens he is like a Uruk-Hai on steroids STR 9, Dam +1 and Fierce for cost 4.<br />
Easterling Infantry almost as good as the Trooper but the 8 STR is a big problem.<br />
Easterling Axeman with 2 burdens you have a STR 9, Fierce, Vitality 2 minion for cost 2. Great value.<br />
Men of Rhur a +3/+4 pump but the cost of 2 is a big disadvantage.<br />
Gathering to the Summons adds more burdens – essential against Ring-Bound decks.<br />
Ulaire Enquea, LoM is the ultimate punishment. Get them to five burdens and kill whoever they are most dependant on.<br />
Ulaire Nertea, MoDG always versatile and useful. <br />
Ulaire Attea, tE (twilight) not always the most fantastic minion but can make Bounder worthless, kill Ottar, Elrond, Galadriel or any other over exerted ally. Allows you to play...<br />
It Wants to be Found to add another burden.<br />
In total this deck can add 16 burdens excluding being able to replay some minions, now that combined with Enquea results in some dead people.<br />
<br />
Sites<br />
[1] Horse-Country if you draw a horse and your opponent has a bad draw then you can triple move. Denies your opponent Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli. The close alternative is Western Enyn Muil to help your shadow side. If ring-bound ranger decks are popular in your area you could consider changing to this.<br />
[2] Wold of Rohan if your opponent foolishly bid 3 thinking that was safe you could be having quite a few skirmishes here each one adding another TW.<br />
[3] Throne Room get Theoden. Stables is also tempting but I don’t like being stuck with Herugrim for too long. A close call.<br />
[4] Westemnet Hills in case you were really pounded going 1-3.<br />
[5] Hornburg Courtyard none of the sites here suit you. You DO NOT want to play Deep of Helm or Deeping Wall. Hornburg Paclobert and Helm’s Gate could hurt your minions which leaves this as best of a bad bunch.<br />
[6] Great Hall makes the double move 5-6 as easy as it was in Fellowship Block. This is a crucial site for the deck.<br />
[7] King’s Room can devastate your opponents if they have not been lucky enough to draw a Rohan companion yet. Fear of this can also make them go to 6 companions allowing Enquea to kick in.<br />
[8] Wizard’s Vale well we don’t want the Ring of Isengard do we?<br />
[9] Palantir Chamber they will surely have some burdens and if you can’t corrupt them then this is the time to go for an overwhelm. Many of your minions are very cheap and Nertea can get even more minions. Partially protects you from the last turn bad draw that loses you the game.<br />
<br />
This is a very fun and easy deck to play. Every turn you will be adding another Burden or two and getting your opponent a little closer to corruption or at least the Doom of Enquea. Meanwhile your Fellowship is solid with STR 10 disposable companions and regular healing. Try it and you may end up taking a few rares out of your old Rohan deck, I know I have. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
