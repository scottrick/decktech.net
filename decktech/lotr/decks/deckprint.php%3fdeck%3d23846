Bid 4 and go first if possible, pull Sam and take TWO(This is crucial, only 2) brudens. Sam CANNOT get exsusted if possible. Unless you get alot of gear/conditions to buff your guys, don&#39;t double move. Use your first couple of turns to set up and get cards out of your hands. After you get set up you won&#39;t lose to Nazgul or Uruk-Hai. Your minion side might look a little week... but it&#39;ll either stop them or overwelm, the few sneaks are there to get played a few times and get a few minions at the bottum of my deck for site 8-9. With the TACs you will be able to draw lots of cards. With the way my Shadow/Felloship works I always deck myself by site 8-9, so don&#39;t try to say my deck is too big.<br>
<br>
Match-ups:<br>
Nazgul: Once you get Aragorn with Flaming Brand it&#39;s be easy to double move. once you get set up most of the sites they won&#39;t be able to play more then one or 2 Nagul, and they will die to Aragorn. Just make sure you don&#39;t play stupid and lose someone at sites 2 or 3.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai: This is your easiest match up, Aragorn and Frodo after just a little bit of gear will just kill all of the Uruk-Hai they can play with the few Twilight I give em.<br>
<br>
Moira: Ah Moira, this is can be bad. Unfortunatly you usally can&#39;t move more then once per turn on them without having to sacrifice Aragorn, which is a bad thing. Get set up and try to live, usally if you can keep them to moving once per turn you will be able to out run them, this deck&#39;s good at living. If not, then you have to rely on your minions, so you gonna always wanna play every card you got in your fellowship(Like getting Stealths and stuff out of your hand).<br>
<br>
Red Eye:<br>
Red eye....not good. The conditions are bad, however I have found it to not be just an auto loss, it&#39;s just really really hard. Try to get Galadriel/Elven Cloak/Mithril coat as soon as possible. This ones not easy and it comes down to mainly draws(But hey, when isn&#39;t this game draws?).<br>
<br>
Card Choices(Yeah I know I play some ghetto cards, here&#39;s why):<br>
Elven Cloak: Archery     s this deck, but when it&#39;s neg 2(With the Coat as well) It&#39;s not so bad, if it&#39;s Sauron you can get rid of thier conditions as well so Archery won&#39;t hurt too bad.<br>
An Able Guide: This card makes it beyond easy to double move most of the time, it&#39;s very useful and also can get out of your hand as soon as the regroup phase comes around. <br>
The Trackers: This is the best thing ever, with all the extra twilight you have they get to be 3 extra minions, plus the Scouting Bands are just good(with the Tol Brandir). This has won me many many games. Props to Andy McClure for this TECH.<br>
