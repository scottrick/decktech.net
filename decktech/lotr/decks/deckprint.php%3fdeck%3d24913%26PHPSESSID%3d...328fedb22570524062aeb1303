&quot;Little Hamsters Big Adventures!&quot;    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">okay, first of all, I am NOT gay. Sorry about the title, but I thought it would catch your attention! Also, I work the Night Shift at a Hotel, so I am awake at 6:00 when Hamtaro comes on, and I thought, who better to name the deck after than Hamtaro? Also, Gimli is kind of like Hamtaro, you know, short, cute?, smelly and tough. It&#39;s fun to think about Hamtaro with Gimli&#39;s Helm, Axes, Bracers and Armor, truckin along the Adventure Path.<br />
<br />
AHEM!<br />
<br />
This deck is designed to win by either outrunning the opponent, which it is very capable of doing, or by overwhelming the opponents ringbearer(s) via tremendous amounts of burdens and a well timed Enduring Evil.<br />
<br />
Ways to accomplish Victory:<br />
<br />
1) Win skirmishes! You have 2 well equiped fighters, one archer(one of the fighters) and all nine companions, some of which are able win fights, some of which are support, some of which are meat. Gimli is your fighter, and once he is decked out, he will not lose fights. Legolas can injure the big guys, or kill the big guys, in the archery phase, and then take out the little guys in the skirmish phase, allowing him to wound the big guys with his bow. Gandalf can win fights, since he&#39;s a 10, and Merry, combined with Boromir, can pump ANYONE up enough to win a fight. By killing minions in skirmishes, you take the trouble out of double moving, and with Shoulder to Shoulder, you will able to clear the wounds off you elves and dwarves(your key fighters) every maneuver phase.<br />
<br />
2) Survive Skirmishes. Gimli&#39;s Helm, Bracers can save him from lethal wounds. Filbert can cancel fights with big nasties. Fror can often avoid being overwhelmed by all but the biggest Uruks, and Gandalf is worth at least 2 skirmishes. <br />
<br />
3) Overwhelm. You get enough burdens on Frodo, you have the game won. Below is a burden table:<br />
<br />
1 burden - overhwhelm Frodo with all minions except Ambusher.<br />
<br />
2 burdens - overwhelm Frodo with all minions in deck.<br />
<br />
3 burdens - overwhelm small companions<br />
<br />
4 burdens - Toldea begins to WRECK companions such as Legolas, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Dwarves<br />
<br />
5 burdens - Enquea is a machine gun, he takes out any and all comers<br />
<br />
6 burdens - heh heh. anyone who fights a Sauron Orc is dead. <br />
<br />
<br />
So, as you can see, the more burdens, the more dangerous the deck becomes. How, you say, do you intend to ADD these burdens?<br />
<br />
Desperate Defense of the Ring - this card is a win-win situation. You either rid them of cards they need for the skirmish phase, or you add burdens, which plays into your hands.<br />
<br />
Thin and Stretched - consistently adds burdens, bonus if they assign Frodo to a skirmish, which means he&#39;s dead.<br />
<br />
Eregion Hills - guaranteed burden.<br />
<br />
How the deck plays.<br />
<br />
Bid 1. You don&#39;t care who goes first, although you prefer to go second, for your sites. <br />
<br />
Play all cards you can from hand. If you have Galadriel, use her to conserve twilight in the early sites by playing elves for free. If you know what shadow they are playing, or have Sting, check to see what you can safely play, but try not to hold too many cards in your hand. <br />
<br />
Move to 3, if at all possible. You need to keep up. If your opponent stops at 2, you should as well, but use your judgment. <br />
<br />
Continue to move with your opponent, but stay with them at almost all costs. The only exception? Don&#39;t move from 3-5. Stop at 4, since it&#39;s a LOT easier to move 4-6 with all the site 6 allies in the deck. If you have a chance after site 4, pass your opponent. You need to get ahead so they can&#39;t go 6-8 and make you win with Shadow. You want to have options. I guess I am kind of contradicting myself, but basically you play it by ear and get ahead after site 4 when you can. If your fellowship is weakened, let them move to Tol Brandir and try to get ANYONE on Frodo, which should clench you the win. They might be able to play PATHS, but they&#39;ll need 2, and if they bid to go first, they should have already had burdens, which means yours are piling up.<br />
<br />
Card Choices<br />
<br />
SITES<br />
<br />
Groin Hill Country - useless, plus, you play 3 Hobbits, so it couldn&#39;t hoit!<br />
<br />
Bree Streets - if they bid high, your Nazgul come cheap, also might intimidate them into stopping. <br />
<br />
Ford of Bruinen - against choke decks, you might need to play a Nazgul. It&#39;s also intimidating, and psychology is a big part of the game.<br />
<br />
Eregion Hills - add a burden <br />
<br />
The Bridge - Gandalf must DIE!<br />
<br />
Caras Galdahon - meh, why not?<br />
<br />
The Great River - hurts Moria and Uruks, which I play neither of.<br />
<br />
Shores - if I can stop them at 7, I win.<br />
<br />
Tol Brandir - get back three trackers, can be an auto win if they aren&#39;t prepared for it.<br />
<br />
Companion<br />
<br />
RotN - auto win at site 9 with Filbert<br />
<br />
FotS - can actually win fights, since I play all 4 cultures<br />
<br />
Merry - with Son of Denethor, he can pump anyone to gargantuan proportions<br />
<br />
Fror - hard to overwhelm against Uruks. Could be Arwen, DoE if Nazgul are popular.<br />
<br />
Sam, PP - same function as Aragorn<br />
<br />
Minions<br />
<br />
Hunters - huge, high vitality, almost always survives archery phase. able to exert for multiple conditions.<br />
<br />
Slayers - my favorite minion currently. They aren&#39;t THAT great, but they&#39;re cheap, and great to play right before a sanctuary, where they have lots of wounds. Also, they draw archery fire, and the opponent will divert all attention to beating them. They are very cool minions, no matter what anyone says.<br />
<br />
Trackers - helps to have even a little cheaper minions early game with these guys, but the primary purpose is to recur them at 9 with Tol Brandir.<br />
<br />
QUESTIONS!?!!?!???!!?!!<br />
<br />
How will you survive when you are giving out so much twilight? <br />
This deck is very resilient, and often doesn&#39;t give off ANY twilight until it is ready to. Between Galadriel and Sting, you can actually keep the pool to a minimum. <br />
<br />
Uruks will destroy you!<br />
Against Uruks, you simply don&#39;t play more than 4 companions. Orophin and Legolas can shoot down 2 minions, 1 if Saruman comes to play, and Gimli will ALWAYS win his fights, barring a ridiculous amount of pumpers. Uruk-Hai are a tough matchup for ANY shadow, other than denial, so I don&#39;t want any low reviews simply saying URUKS WILL BEAT YOU. You must be smart, and don&#39;t take too many risks. Always get rid of No Business, so you can check their hand. <br />
<br />
Early Nazgul will Beat You!<br />
No ccloberarly Nazgul will beat everyone! Just kidding. The only situation where you should beware is if you get lots of allies, but no expendable companions, you shouldn&#39;t play much. Just move and choke em.<br />
