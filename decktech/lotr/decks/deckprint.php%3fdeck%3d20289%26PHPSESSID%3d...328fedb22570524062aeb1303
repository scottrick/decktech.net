<br />
Bid whatever you feel comfortable with, because with 3 Aragorns, it is not terribly important to go first. It is often safe to bid 0, in case of a Burden strategy, but it&#39;s really just up to your preference. <br />
<br />
Free Peoples Strategy - <br />
<br />
From the beginning of the game you should play Aragorn, his Bow, Legolas, Glamdring, and Ranger&#39;s Sword as soon as possible. You will usually play Elrond, Ottar, and Barliman as soon as possible as well, but with Elrond you may want to wait so that they don&#39;t have a ton of twilight, but Ottar and Barliman can come down just about whenever.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason this deck is playing so many multiples of unique cards is because some of them are very important to the deck baing able to make it through the later sites. I included Ottar because he is quite good anyway, but if you get him and Elrond together, you will not feel so worthless when you draw another Aragorn&#39;s Bow or whatnot.<br />
<br />
I play 3 Legolas, 3 Aragorn, and 3 Aragorn&#39;s Bow is because getting 2 archers out is essential to making A Ranger&#39;s Versatility work, and they pump Gandalf up to 9 power, and they are just great cards on their own. The extra copies of Aragorn and Legolas can always be ditched to heal themselves, and the Bow is just to important.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason I start Gandalf is because he provides a strong fighter in addition to Aragorn, so I can almost always win 2 skirmishes, plus his support cards are some of the best in the game. Servant of the Secret Fire is probably the best all around skirmish / power altering cards in the game, and Sleep, Cahadras is the best card at getting rid of Blade Tip, Black Breath, Thin and Stretched, Orc Bowmen, Under the Watching Eye, etc. etc. It is one of the few cards the Free People have for getting rid of conditions. If you put Glamdring on Gandalf, he almost always wins his fights.<br />
<br />
I have 4 Barliman Butterbur because it is just to good to pass up being able to play Servant of the Secret Fire 6-8 times a game. Plus he is 0 twilight, and can almost always be used. Against Sauron Orcs you&#39;ll be glad you can get your Sleep, Cahadras back as well.<br />
<br />
A Ranger&#39;s Versatility is considered by some to be the best Free Peoples card in the game, and they make a good argument. It&#39;s just so much easier to get through sites 6-9 with this card, and sometimes it&#39;s just not even fair. Usually they will play about 4 guys at site 8 and 9, and this almost always kills 2 of them, and Gandalf and Aragorn can easily kill whoever is left over.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Strategy -<br />
<br />
A good bit of the minions were chosen because of their discard ability, because they combo well with Desperate Defense of the Ring, making the opponent put more burdens on Frodo. <br />
<br />
Orc Ambusher is for playing at the early sites where you might not have enough twilight to play your bigger guys, so you get Desperate Defense or Thin and Stretched out. <br />
<br />
Orc Inquistor, Band of the Eye, and Tower Lt. were chosen for their discard ability and because they have a pretty good size to cost ratio, and have pretty good vitality of 3. The Inquisitor is sometimes clutch at removing a key card or making it where they don&#39;t have enough cards to discard their way around 2 Desperate Defenses. Band of the Eye may not use his discard ability to often, but he is pretty massive for his cost. Tower Lt. can put them into some tough situations involving Desperate Defense if the Ring. A lot of times he will win his fight (because of enduring evil), and the opponent has to decide on a burden and 2 discards or 5 discards.<br />
<br />
Orc Scouting Band is in the deck because he is the best tracker, making it a bit easier to play your guys early, and giving you a pretty good way of stopping them at site 9.<br />
<br />
Desperate Defense of the Ring and Thin and Stretched are for discard and adding burdens, mainly for the burdens, so the rest of the deck can run better, although the discard can sometimes catch up with the opponent.<br />
<br />
Ulaire Enquea (The Hitman)is too good not to play in this deck. He has pretty decent stats with 4 vitality and 11 power plus he is fierce, but the main reason he is here is to play at the later sites when you have them up to 5 burdens. You can usually kill 2 people with him, but he will always take out Boromir, Arwen, and Legolas, 3 of the most common companions played.<br />
<br />
Enduring Evil is to help the Orcs win their fights, and when you get them to 3-4 burdens can often overwhelm people with Band of the Eye. <br />
<br />
Conclusion - <br />
<br />
The deck is quite a bit rare intensive, so that may turn a few people away, but it is pretty fun to play. A card I have considered for the deck, but just can&#39;t come up with room is Toldea. I know I could play more than 60 cards, but I don&#39;t think it is worth making the deck bigger for him, because I need to see Orcs to play a lot of my cards, and my Free Peoples deck really needs an early Legolas and Aragorn to get things running. It just doesn&#39;t seem worth it to me, but I&#39;d like to know where everybody else stands.<br />
