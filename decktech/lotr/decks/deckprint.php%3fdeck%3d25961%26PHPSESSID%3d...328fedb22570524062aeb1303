Thanks to everyone who pointed out the 2 Filberts. Drop one of him for a Rumil, for more Swarm Protection. To whoever said to drop Celeborn, he is an extra shot for Orophin/Rumil every turn once Galadriel shows up, plus he can win some fights as well. Also, I can&#39;t use Lord of Rivendell because I don&#39;t wanna take the chance that I&#39;ll draw him before Galadriel and hers friends, cause then I wouldn&#39;t be able to play him. Also, I choose not to play with more Sentinels because 2 is enough against Moria and NOONE but me plays Sauron aroune here, and I don&#39;t consistently. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
As far as Shadow, I didn&#39;t mean that everyone can play UTWE, just the Ambushers and the Scouting Bands, but that is why I am only playing 3 UTWEs. I like Ambushers over Assassins simply because they are cheaper and therefore help my deck function against a choke deck. I, too, hate Orc War Bands, but I have like 75 of them and I wanted to try using them. They also fit in with the theme of free wounds, which Bands and Morgul Hunters fail to do, although I do like Morgul Hunters. I&#39;ll post an update tonight after it&#39;s been in a tourney. Thanks to everyone!<br />

EDIT #2<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Alright, I&#39;m convinced. Orc War Band SUCKS almost as bad as Uruk Spy. Take them out for Band of the Eye x 2. My girlfriend played this deck( cause I&#39;m testing "tech" for DCon ) and went 1-3, but all the games were actually pretty close. She&#39;s never played Sauron before and I am convinced that in the current Meta, Sauron has potential. One thing that is tempting is to get rid of the exert to hurt guys all together and go with Inquisitors(for aggravation), Assassin(to hurt Merry) and I don&#39;t know what else. Someone fun like Morgul Slayer. Or maybe Orc Scout, since he&#39;s cheap, but then you lose all the free wounds. So many options. The free peoples side is pretty tight, although I stick by my guns that Defender of Minas Tirith is a wuss. We ran his this week, just to see, and he gets beat down so easy! Some of the highlights were Hating off 2 companions at 9, killing two more with archery and having the rest of the minions end up on Aragorn and Frodo. It was cool. Another game, my girlfriend had a choice of playing a third Orc Bowmen or another guy at 9 and chose the guy, which would mean 3 guys on Frodo with only a pan. Unfortunately, the guy had some Hobbit Stealths to not be overwhelmed. She realized afterwards that he was using the common ring, and one more point of archery would have meant a dead ringbearer. Ah well. I plan on posting this deck again with a Nazgul Shadow, so check it out. Later.<br />
<br><br />
END EDIT<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
I decided to post this deck for the simple reason that I have been trying and trying, ever since ROTEL came out, to design a Horn Deck that works. Finally, I have been successful. This is simply the best incarnation that I have been able to think of for a Horn deck. I know lots of Horn decks start Greenleaf and Arwen, but with all the Uruk-Hai, I can&#39;t afford to start those two and then play Boromir and Aragorn, both of which are essential against Uruks. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Starting Merry gives Boromir extra protection against being overwhelmed(especially if you decide to use Defender, who is a wuss). If you don&#39;t like Merry, use Pippin who will allow you to bid a little higher. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
As far as Boromir, I use Lord of Gondor becauase he is simply the best fighting Boromir. Slap an Armor on and you are good to go against any of the biggies. No, you can&#39;t heal him as easily, but youy have Elrond for that and two sanctuaries. Besides, once this deck gets going you may not need the Allies, in fact, the Horn is a last ditch effort against minions you absolutely cannot destroy. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
The Shadow is chosen because I wanted something a bit different that is still decent against choke, which is popular these days. In the early game you can almost always still drop a minion and a condition and cause wounds. Thats the whole point. All but 6 of the 21 minions will cause at least one wound directly simply by being played, all but 2 of those will cause wounds the rest of the game by exerting to play Under the Watching Eye, and the other 2 will cause wounds by eliminating Allies essesntial to the Free Peoples Strategy. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Yes, Sleep hurts, but people have stopped playing it as much, in favor of Sentinels, or are only playing one, which they may never see. Bottom line, the wounds will add up and companions will die, leaving you the opportunity to stack several on Frodo. Don&#39;t forget that you can exert to hurt Frodo, and since he never gets higher than 7 in most games, you can cause 2 wounds, which will add up. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Hate is HUGE! Thats all.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
GAME PLAN!<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
1) Bid 1 and go first if possible. Play whats in your hand, but be sensible. If you draw lots of allies but no companions, don&#39;t play them all. Boromir and Merry can&#39;t block &#39;em all, unless you draw the Horn. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
3) Heal up and move. By now you should have some denial going, which means the move to 4 will be easy. 4 is a site to Pathfind against Uruks. You&#39;ll be surprised how much Uruks are hurt by roaming at 4.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
4) Move from 4 to 6 if possible. Your site 6 allies make this a little easier, even if you haven&#39;t pulled the Horn yet.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
6) PATHFINDER! Unless your opponent has been playing LOTS of allies, you need to play your site 7. Besides, your 7 hurts Uruks(Captain) and Moria. Move to 8 if possible, since the double from 7 to 9 is REALLY hard against Uruks. If it&#39;s Nazgul, you can afford to wait. Moria, you should try for 8. Sauron, play it by ear.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
8) Move for home! <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Your companions will be as follows:<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Frodo - 7 strength, a decent companion. O Elbereth is KEY against Nazgul, try to save it for 9<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Merry - purely a pumper on wheels. He moves for Free with A Talent and pumps in a pinch. Great at 9.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Boromir - 13 strength, 15 against Nazgul. Calls up allies, wounds Orcs and Uruks, un overwhelmable. The most important companion, because he represents 6 extra companions.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Aragorn - 14 strength, 16 against Nagul. Hatchetman. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Elrond - Troop killer, Cantea&#39;s daddy. Can be double Horned if nescessary to beat the biggies. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Heals Boromir in regroup to fight again. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
