This is it. <br />
<br /><br />
The key here is wounds. Ents have a lot of exertions cards (Treebeard, Skinbark, Crack Into Rubble, Merry and Pippin must exert, Ent Moot, Roused, et cetera) The thing that they&#39;re short on is healing. Sure, if they play Gandalf they can include four copies of &#39;Have Patience&#39;, but even so, it&#39;s hard, and sure, Merry Impatient Hobbit can discard to heal, but come on, everyone will be playing with companion Treebeard, not the ally, and I don&#39;t think a lot of people will waste deck space on four copies of KNocked on the Head. <br />
<br /><br />
THe idea is simple: Play machines like mad, pile tokens on them, then about site 5-6-7, detonate the bomb and watch the fun. Your Slayer is the king of all this. He gets +4 for the two exertions on himself, plus at least another two  for the wound on the companion, and maybe more of you detonated the Devilry earlier. King&#39;s Room is great because it doesn&#39;t hurt your Ring-bound Rangers, but all those Ents have to exert, as well as the Hobbits. <br />
<br /><br />
The best scenario is to set off the bomb in the Manuever phase, then use the Slayer in the skirmish. Use the Scaling Ladder to heal him, then exert to wound everyone again. I&#39;ve been play-testing this against Ent decks, and I&#39;ve killed seven companions in one turn using this. The Weapons of Isengard add more wounds during the archery phase. <br />
<br /><br />
Personally, I don&#39;t think that Assault Ladder is very good, because it required 3 tokens to use and your Berserkers don&#39;t win games by winning skirmishes, then win by piling up wounds on everybody. Berserk Butcher is very good, though, he&#39;s awesome against those mega-archery decks, Quick As May Be, Baruk Khazad, Defend It and Hope, plus at the skirmish he&#39;s even stronger because of the wounds on him. (I have a foil of him)  <br />
<br /><br />
For your Fellowship - I just want to pause here and thank God for the Ancient Roads. Before this card, Ring-bound Rangers sucked, now, they&#39;re going to be viable. It used to be you had to pack four Gondorian Rangers, and then you never drew them, and they were wimpy companions, as well. I have a total of five +2 site numbers in here, which is enough. The two Gondorian Rangers are there so if halfway through the game Saruman&#39;s Power gets played, you&#39;ve still got a chance. Generally, they&#39;ll combine to keep everyone roaming until site 9. <br />
<br /><br />
Mablung gets his Ranger&#39;s Bow, and can kill anyone with just two exertions. i.e., Cave Troll, Balrog, Uruk Vanguard, et cetera. The Rangers of Ithilien are strength 10s with their swords and when they&#39;re skirmishing roamings.<br />
<br /><br />
Smeagol is awesome. Frodo can exert five time using Sting, BH, and add burdens fearlessly because you remove them again with his text throughout the game. Smeagol can go up against the Balrog, and Cave Troll, and take no wounds at all. The four copies of Poor Wretch are to get him up to a respectable seven (and be capable of fighting the Balrog)  <br />
<br /><br />
As you can see, I have a big deck here, with 38 cards per side. This is partly because machines play very fast, and also partly because I have two copies of Don&#39;t Look at Them. This is great against Nazgul. This is a Standard deck (Note: When playing Towers or Open, add at least 1 Flaming Brand) and isn&#39;t that great against Nazgul, except for this card. You can get rid of access conditions, machines, or anything with this, and bump off Nazgul minions easily. <br />
<br /><br />
The Ruins of Osgiliath are very important. Something that hurt me bad at our territorials was facing a Moria swarm with Cave Troll at Caverns of Isengard, where none of my skirmish events work. I prefer not having that site at all, which is why I have Pathfinder to bypass it. But you might not draw Pathfinder, or you may get one in your opening hand and need to discard it for card-flow reasons. So at the very least, Ruins makes all of your Men defender +1 at site 7, which can really help. <br />
<br /><br />
Faramir is an 11 against roaming minions, and his cloak makes everyone skirmishing men -1 strength. His bow is to add archery, kill Dunlendings, and anything else needed. He&#39;s Ring-bound, so Grima can&#39;t touch him. He&#39;s awesome. <br />
<br /><br />
Arrows Thick in the Air is wonderful against Moria decks. It can kill nearly every minion out there, at the cost of only two exertions. But remember: After site 3 Moria minions aren&#39;t roaming until they&#39;re assigned. So you have to wait until the skirmish phase to use it, which means you have to be careful about your assingments. The Shadow player might let everyone die and use Goblin Armories to save the two minions on Frodo, who you don&#39;t have protection for, so watch out! <br />
<br /><br />
I didn&#39;t include PATHS, which is great against Moria, because I didn&#39;t have very much deck space, I think I can handle Moria efficiently, and I&#39;m already be going to be adding a lot of burdens with Smeagol. However, some more playtesting might reveal I should add one, and I will. <br />
<br /><br />
*Some changes to make if you play Open or Towers: Well, certainly add a Flaming Brand, also probably two copies of No Stranger to the Shadows. Choking guys is great, because once again you&#39;re Grima-safe, and you can easily kill anything they get out. If you do decide to use choke, make sure you add Bill the Pony.  <br />
<br /><br />
Well, that&#39;s basically it. I hope that you try playing a version of it and do well, and give me all the credit of course. It hurts Ents, which a lot of people want, so it&#39;ll probably do pretty well. <br />
