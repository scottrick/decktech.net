Isengard Orcs and Hobbits to Boot by RightFist    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, where to start. You&#39;ve got to like the chances of this deck to overrun the opponent&#39;s fellowship with isengard orcs. Only Saurman cost 4 twighlight and the rest are no more than 3, making it very easy to drop a few minions a turn. <br />
This decks obvious flaws are that it is week to both minions and fellowship archery. Big deal, it is for fun. If you want to strengthen the shadow side, add some actual Urukai since they can take more wounds. As for the fellowship, there&#39;s not much you can do, but there is some twighlight denial, so you shouldn&#39;t be to hard off. <br />
This deck really can&#39;t double move a lot, but if you feel like taking a chance, or you don&#39;t get a chance to use The Prancing Pony, your fellowship will be all hobbits so you can take full advantage of Buckleberry Ferry. <br />
Most of the sites are chosen to help the fellowship side of the deck. Using Hollin would be useless since all of the minions in this deck stop roaming at site 4 anyway. Site 7 is helpful since this deck has no archery in it and if you find yourself with an extra armor in you hand or No Stranger at site 8, ditch them through the site to heal Aragorn. The site 9 was chosen because I was going to originally put some urukai trackers in here, but since there are ery few, the 9 twighlight it adds to the pool can prove to be very helpful.<br />
Using Saruman, try assigning 2-3 minions to one companion (like Aragorn or an archer if they are giving you trouble) and you can usually overwhelm them. If you can not assign more then one minion to a companion, (due to some rule I am unaware of) then forget what I said and throw your weaker minions at the bigger companions so you can damage the little guys.<br />
Try to keep your hobbits alive as long as possible. Use the Intuitions wisely, but if you find yourself being destroyed by the Balrog, take out the Dagger Strikes and put in 3 Hobbit Stealths. Aragorn will heal one companion with his sigent at the beginning of each turn, if you haven&#39;t already noticed, all the companions have his signet. <br />
This deck is just for fun, so deon&#39;t expect to win a whole lot with it, or at all. It does stand a chance against some decks and I have posted it with the assumption that everyone who reads it understands it is more of a template than a finished deck. That is why I say &quot;if this&quot; and &quot;if that&quot; a lot. I am jsut throwing some ideas of how you can make it work better given certain situations. Have fun. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
