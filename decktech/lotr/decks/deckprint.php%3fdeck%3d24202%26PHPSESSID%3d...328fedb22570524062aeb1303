Please keep that in mind when making comments.<br />
<br />
First things first: bid 0 burdens and start Merry and Boromir. If you are forced to go first the East Road will serve as a nasty surprise to your opponent.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples:<br />
You start both a Ranger and two Hobbits (Frodo and Merry) so nearly anything in your free peoples deck (the Ranger&#39;s sword being the only exception) is playable before your second move.<br />
A minor amount of twilight denial keep things towards the down-low on early game minions, and Stealths deal with the few that appear.<br />
Late Game should see Aragorn and Sam come out and play, at which time you are set. Exerting Sam and Elendil&#39;s Valor should deal with some of the swarming that may go on, depending on your opposition. Dagger strike, playable potentially on every companion in the deck, proves extremely useful for a late game strength and damage boost, and in conjunction with Hobbit Stealth&#39;s +2 late game strength bonus can be just sick.<br />
<br />
Shadow.<br />
Denial is the name of the game, and this shadow deck specializes in deck denial. Lurtz, the only archer in the entire deck, should be played in conjunction with his sword for maximum results. At least the Uruk Captain helps recur him, or any other minion you need.<br />
With Saruman&#39;s Snows being present in the deck too many combat pumpage cards are really not a good idea, so Savagery, even if I had any, would not be a good idea. I do, however, have two Ambitions in the deck, which can be used early to empty a card from your hand and used when Snows isn&#39;t around to pump your Uruks up. Someone (I can&#39;t remember exactly who, but credit goes to them) suggested in their deck to use a cheap Uruk-hai and Snows in conjunction with the Balrog, and that&#39;s just evil enough to work, so do it on the bridge if you can.<br />
In case you&#39;re wondering, Uruk Fighter and Warrior eat large fellowships, and playing Uruk-Hai Swords on them with the Snows tends to lead to pain for even the super friends.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#39;s my so-called strategy for an unorignal deck done in an original way. If you wish to comment, please do so. Any ideas would be appreciated. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
