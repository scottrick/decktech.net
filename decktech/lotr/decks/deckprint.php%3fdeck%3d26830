 This deck is based around doing direct damages to the opponents minions (and fellowship on your minion half). The old archery based decks saw a fall in popularity around the time of the ROTEL set due to cards like saruman KOI. However post TTT a lot more fellowship direct damage has been introduced into the game (whether this is a good thing or not remains to be seen). The new card  Quick as May Be, is possibly the most broken card since ARV. it cost no exertion, and a mere 1 twilight post shadow phase and couples well with the old Legolas Greenleaf. These 2 cards can dispatch most nazgul and uruk-hai minions on their own.<br />
Combined with mass indirect archery from Gondor Bowmen very few minions will make it thru to the skirmish phase. However if some minion do survive u have plenty of companion to suck up the damage. Gandlf and rare Eomer can be big in this deck and beat most minion less then 10 power, gimli can pump these guys too.sam is still the best companion to block, while faramir and boromir can be used for gondor bowmen and defend it and hope, then take dirt nap if the need arises. Legolas and aragorn should be kept alive for archery if possible.<br />
The 3 ally elf brothers, rumil, orophin and calaglin are still useful here for direct damage, though they cant block at site 6 anymoreL these guys are still well worth it. Galadriel is possibly extraneous, but I like her to reload the elf achers and can play these guys for free too. Needless to say thrarin can block some big nasty minion who happen to survive archery.<br />
Uruks will still be big in TTT environment so there are some extra cards to deal with them. Defend it and Hope wounds a uruk twice, either killing a minon outright or at least using up sarumans exertions so legolas or G/B can kill the minion off. Foul Creation is a kinda cheesey card but works to take saruman out off the picture before he hits the table. Use it on an ally rather than legolas if possible.<br />
This deck runs riot over swarm like moria and dunlend, those 1 vitality minions get chewed up by Aragorns bow, goblin armory and hides only go so far and will run out long before u run out of direct damages.<br />
Nazgul get owned by this deck too. QAMB+legolas  can pick off specific minions, and gondor bowmen should clean up the rest. All Blades Perish sees little play these days, it&#8217;s the only real protection nazgul have against direct damage.<br />
Duirng play testing this deck has shown only weakness to its shadow half lolz. Cause all the archers exert raggy and lego before they can kill off the minion<br />
<br />
SHADOW: <br />
<br />
I like this deck a lot cause it uses minion from 4 different cultures. i think that&#8217;s nice. The aim of it is to direct archery damage to key companion like Aragorn, Faramir etc, and then kill them off using that event Hate or in skirmishes. You Bring Great Evil is like a sauron Black Breath but u can lay it on who u want in the shadow phase.it prevents the bearer healing at sanctuarys, but he can heal at other sites. In this way the damage sticks. I tried using 4 OrcBowmen in place of YBGE but I find its better to make sure u can kill the guys u want. Desert Lord can exert 2 companion and is big enough to win his skirmish too, so that&#8217;s 3 wound from 1 minion. If u are n00bi player and don&#8217;t have a lot of rare cards, u can sub in southron bowmen for desert Lord but obviously the deck will be weaker. Grima is important these days and works well with YBGE. Even if they keep only 2 cards on their unbound companions u can lay a card on that guy and then grima will bounce away his FP cards. Morgul Hunter is a big minion and has plenty of vitality for Hate etc. Morgul slayer is such a gay card, but he is cheap and if he somehow survive to regroup he can kill some exhausted characters. I have a lot of this crappy card so I like to use him if I can J.<br />
The natural response to direct damage is to play a lot of companion down to spread around the wounds. Enquea and nertea are in here to punish the big companionships.<br />
Ithlien Wilderness protects again choke decks and can be used to pump a raider so its never useless. Likewise, Enduring evil punishes a lot of burdens at site 9 or when ever.<br />
The only bad thing I have found with this deck is Eowen canceling Hate. This is no big problem, either use your hates anyway and pick more up later, or try and use ur archers to exhaust her and use hate at the next site.<br />
<br />
MAIN STRATEGY:<br />
<br />
I suggest a bid of 0, ur minions can do a surprising amount of damage early, an early YBGE sets aragorn up for a quick death before site 4-5. plus moving on uruk camps guarantees a safe 1-3 step V uruk-hai decks. I try and move with no more than 5 companions and replace ones that die later. And don&#8217;t have more than 2 gondor bowmen don&#8217;t at once cause Sarumans power can wreck them. This deck can win with both FP and shadow, mow down all on-coming minions and win the race with the fellowship. Its surprising how easily your minions kill companions, mainly due to the fact that this deck ignores weapons, stealths, events, and allies. 80% of the damage occurs outside the skirmish phase. Hornburg Paclobert really helps ensure the double jump from 4-6 as the extra archery makes a lot of deference even though it gives a lot of gold away. The neg 1 minion total doesn&#8217;t hurt as the DL and EA don&#8217;t add to minion archery after they exert. Likewise, the cavern entrance doesn&#8217;t hurt your companionship at all as u can kill all the opponent minion before your frodo is in danger during skirmish. Quick as May Be is really broken, no significant cost to u, while it kills minions so easily. O and Burrows of Edoras is nice to set up a good minion hand for the site 9 killing.<br />
