I started working on this deck back in the days of Towers. The problem was Uruks with Broad-bladed Swords were prevailent back then, and could really hurt this deck, which can play Open but really shines in Standard. <br />
First- the Shadow <br />
<br />
It&#39;s my own mix of Moria and a little other archery. I could probably use another Armory or two, but that&#39;s all I have it it works very well. I don&#39;t have to rely on them to kick butt. Straight archery wins most of my games, but occasionally I can get out a good swarm and win that way. Enquea can deal 3 wounds each time he&#39;s out, if the guy has 5 burdens or 6 companions. If you&#39;re lucky, Enquea + archers come down a site 5, Enquea kills, he takes 3 or more threat wounds, and then the archery, and then the skirmishing - even the site 6 sanctuary won&#39;t help much! <br />
Bitter Hatred is in there because everybody plays Greenleaf around my area, and it can kill an exhausted one, or simply add another wound. <br />
<br />
For the Freeps, it&#39;s pure wounding. Your ultimate site 1 pull is Elrond + Bow + Vilya + Splendour. You&#39;re indestructable after that. If you can get that combo set up before site 5 you&#39;re golden. Arwen and Gorn add archery and can fight, if the need be. Shadow between heals Lego every turn.<br />
<br />
Matchups: <br />
<br />
Nazzies: Wound&#39;em. If any survive, Frodo can pick them off with PATHS or Arwen can trample them with her new horse. <br />
<br />
Moria: Bilbo cans their conditions, and they&#39;re screwed by archery and the Pan. <br />
<br />
Southrons/Easterlings: Kill&#39;em with archery, and Sam removes the burdens. <br />
<br />
Sauron: Everyone&#39;s talking about the Besiegers, that&#39;s what the 3 Stand Against Darkness are for. You can take out minions, possessions, and those darn Troop Towers with this card, and if you don&#39;t use it it becomes discard fodder for Shadow Between. <br />
<br />
Dunland: Overwhelm them with archery. If they get out Hides early, you&#39;ll have to slow and take them down with your Shadow side. But not too big of a threat. <br />
<br />
Uruks: If you&#39;re playing against Saruman, KOI, you shouldn&#39;t be. This is a Standard deck. But it&#39;ll still do a good job. Trackers - most have low vitality. Kill them off via archery. <br />
<br />
I&#39;ve been playing this deck around for quite a while and it&#39;s undefeated except when my sister played me using it and I beat her (barely). <br />
<br />
Enjoy! And happy wounding! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
