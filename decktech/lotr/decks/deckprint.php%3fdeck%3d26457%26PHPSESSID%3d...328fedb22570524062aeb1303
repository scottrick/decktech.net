I decided to call it Brego is a slut because he lets EVERYONE ride him. Anyways, Brego is just a really good card, and I urge everyone to consider him in ANY deck that uses a decent amount of Rohan people. <br />
<br />
Well, this deck is designed to RUN, and it can do that with EASE against Uruks, Nazgul and Raiders, and it destroys Moria. The two that give it trouble are Sauron, cause it doesn&#39;t expect it, and DUNLAND. DUNLAND is the Devil. More on that later.<br />
<br />
You start Eomer and Eowyn, cause they are both 2 of the best companions around. I choose to use the Rare Eowyn cause not only does she have a better picture, but she is nearly impossible to kill, as long as I want her to live. Give her her sword and a Brand, and she mows down Uruks left and right, cause they are hesitant to use pump on her, since it won&#39;t do any good. But I digress. Eomer is the main reason, and he will win the game for you against Uruks. <br />
<br />
Eomer is usually going to be an 11 against ALL Uruks, except a Troop. In the case of a Troop, well, they&#39;ve only got 4 right? :) Theres a reason they are the best minion in the game. <br />
<br />
Your fighters are going to be Eomer and Gandalf, with Boromir and Eowyn batting POST Cleanup, which is to say they kill the little guys. With Boromir, Frodo can even handle the bigger guys(cough, Vanguard, cough). <br />
<br />
Now, on to the star of the deck: BREGO.<br />
<br />
Brego is so good. He is used for many reasons in this deck, he heals first of all, he can stand in for Firefoot until he shows up, and he combos well with Boromir and the Blade of Gondor, while that is more oeasterlingood idea in theory than reality. <br />
Brego also makes Gandalf an additional Damage +1, if you need it, and can be put on Eowyn so she can exert a tougher minion(Troop) and take wounds, then let Eomer finish the job if they&#39;re fierce. He&#39;s just an awesome, versatile card, and anyone who knows me knows how much I LOVE versatile cards. Besides, everybody loves a slut!<br />
<br />
Specific cards? Hmmm, I guess I can do that.<br />
<br />
Treebeard- this guy is amazing. First of all, he makes the double to 8 easy as pie, as long as you aren&#39;t hurting TOO bad. Secondly, he wins the game for against Uruk Archery. I have 9 copies of unbound companions in this deck, and Treebeard lets me heal whoever I need to, no matter who&#39;s in my hand. Need Greenleaf for some reason? Pitch Boromir. Need to exert RotN more than he is able at the moment? Pitch that Gandalf and exert Treebeard, and your one less minion on Frodo. <br />
<br />
Boromir- I am in love with Son of Denethor, ever since DCon, and all the drafts and Sealed&#39;s I played in. He just makes Frodo nearly unkillable, and we all know how cool that is.<br />
<br />
Simblemyne- why use this? well, Eomer is my most important Fighter, and instead of playing multiples of his stuff, I use these cards so I can get whatever I need when I draw the Flowers.<br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
<br />
The whole point of my Shadow is to make my opponent stop, and the Uruk Trackers do this well. First of all, between Mauher and their Fierceness, they make skirmish events all but useless, which means that the opponent must use possessions. Grima combined with the search conditions makes the possessions a whole lot less cool, which means my guys are going to be winning a lot of their fights. Winning fights means that my minions stick around, which makes it a whole lot less appealing to my opponents to move twice, which is cool with me. Worry adds the extra pain to my guys winning, and Weary makes it tough to even ASSIGN, much less win fights, and makes Ringbound Rangers less intimidating. Leechcraft is there because it&#39;s so versatile. Shut down Faramir, Aragorn RotN and against Ringbound, slap it on a Gondorian Ranger to see your guys win EVERY fight. Sweet.<br />
<br />
Enquea- everyone is playing huge fellowships, and this guy is money<br />
<br />
Nertea- see above.<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power- yes, I DO have lots of conditions, but sometimes it&#39;s worth it to get rid of Trust Me, since that card is one of the few ways they can win skirmishes consistently against me. <br />
<br />
Well, I think that this deck is really good, and if you have any suggestions, questions or limericks, D-Mail me and I&#39;ll answer as best I can. Thanks for looking.<br />
