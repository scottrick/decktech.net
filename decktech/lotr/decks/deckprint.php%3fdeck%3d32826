I hate Dauntless Hunter!!! Ask anyone I play with and they’ll tell you that I absolutely abhor Dauntless Hunter. I even built an archery deck with Bitter Hatred just to kill that pesky little punk (I’ll post it some other time.) There&#39;s nothing that will annoy your friends more than this fellowship. Just try to have a good time watching that little lost puppy look (or the bitter hatred look... that&#39;s even better) that they give you every time they get to their shadow phase. The strat goes as it usually does with a few twists I worked in, of course. Let Folly be Our Cloak is a Gandalf event (it does not require Gandalf to use) that allows you to exert x companions to remove x. Blood of Numenor can then, during the maneuver phase - depending on how expensive the card you reveal is, heal x companions later. It is a little risky, but it adds some fun to a normally boring fpp side. Faramir is there for one reason and one reason only: Ninja Gollum. I really dislike Ninja Gollum shadows. Faramir just gives that Gollum Ninja the finger. Well usually I do anyways, but I don&#39;t count as a character in the game. These are my people counteracts possession removal on a large scale. I have it in there just in case those Corsairs or Dunland fools get rid of my stuff. <br />
<br />
On the Flip Side: <br />
<br />
The Destructive Power of Ulaire Lemenya: Use Lemenya to keep bringing companions back into the fpp’s hand. TThis gets rid of everything on that character plus clogs up a spot in your opponent’s hand at the same time. And the annoyed look on your opponent&#39;s face? Priceless of course! With Misadventure on the table (Misadventure, what a crap rare AHAHAHAHA) each time the companion is replayed he/she will cost 2 more twilight than normal (at 6 out of 8 sites.) Not so Easily Destroyed and All Blades Perish will help to keep your beloved Lemenya alive long enough to carry out this action. Even more hand clogging will occur with your fellowship being the perpetrator. Remember to use your Uruks to play tMoMU or it will be useless to you later. If your buddies don&#39;t at least mutter a curse word or something during a game against this deck, they must not ever get annoyed with anything or anyone! Enjoy! [DD]<br />
