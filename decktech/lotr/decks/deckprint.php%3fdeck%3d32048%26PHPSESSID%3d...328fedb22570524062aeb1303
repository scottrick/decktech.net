<br />
Ever since SOG came out , I started mixing Mr Gandalf with each possible companion to see what would be realy strong to start.Given that you can start with gandalf and start using all his great gear so fast was to tempting to resist :].<br />
<br />
So why start it with Sam?<br />
Well the Sam start is excellent to make Dunland work.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
1. You go first , without the threat having to much burdens.<br />
2.He can force a double move at any time , by sacking frodo if needed.(So your opponent will feel pressured if you keep running).<br />
3.Running only 4 companions and some spares you hardly give off any pool and beat up alot.<br />
4.Denying opponent to start with their site that kills your ability to play hides or your conditions early :]<br />
<br />
The point of the fellowship is to use alot of pumps to kill of the minions and run fast , giving off few twilight.Extra companions were added , so Mr.Gorn and Mr.Sam can force the double moves you need to win the game.(Boromir can do his share aswell :] ).<br />
<br />
Bounder makes it impossible for any swarm deck to win this , and Sam takes out any chance burden adding decks have on winning.<br />
Grown Suddenly Tall is a real mean card these days , cse more and more ppl focus their shadow around conditions , esp. with the new Sauron threat and the revival of classic Sauron Grinder.<br />
<br />
The Shadow&#39;s point is to realy fast take sites and then either set up a kill via No Retreat / Constantly Threatening.<br />
The Elders are huge once you take your sites.(which is easy as pie in this deck + the new site gives you a site aswell). <br />
<br />
The Siege troop tech i saw from Ryan Jones really impressed me alot.I started testing it myself and saw that it can realy own hard againts large pool fellowships , can absorb the necc. wounds , can assure sites and can overwhelm companions.<br />
What more do you need?<br />
<br />
I hope alot of ppl will read this and send me their suggestions.I will be testing alot since ive got about a month to go.<br />
<br />
Cheerz All<br />

(spec. thnx for Ryan and his great tournament report and for all the ppl out there making good startegies and making lotr a fun game to play).<br />
