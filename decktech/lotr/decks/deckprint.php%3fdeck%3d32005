<br />
<br />
well this deck went 6-1 on the day to win me the 42 or 47 player toc last week in michigan.  i got some pretty good matchups.  it was built to beat nazgul and swarm, and it beat those.  it did well against besiegers too, since they are similar to nazgul (big, fierce minions).  it goes about 50/50 vs sauron.  dunland and corsairs seem like tough matches but without playing the matchup who knows.  <br />
<br />
the deck needs some stuff added, another gst, some roll of thunder, enquea, butterbur, ect.  but i wanted to keep the deck small so i had to cut stuff<br />
<br />
so anyway some of you may have tried telepathy before, its pretty fun.  the basic idea of this deck came from adam huber and brian fred.  mega props to both of them, thanks guys.<br />
<br />
anyway<br />
<br />
so i bid 1.  i want to go first if possible, but it didn&#39;t happen that often.  the randomness of a cave troll or balrog can get stops well.  also it can kill stuff.  so shaodw wise sneak some guys if you need to shadow kill, along with a troll or something.  the fellowship is really gimmicky. you use gandalf to put cards on top of your deck.  then you use forearmed, or galadriel to use those cards on the deck to pump.  like you put a balrog on top, then forearmed makes a minion -14 power.  pretty cool<br />
<br />
random card choices:<br />
lembas- laets you recincile for the double so gandalf can do his thing more. too bad new cantea can discard it lol<br />
skinbark- hes a 7 to flip for telepathy, plus a decent blocker to fetch with wiz isnt late.  but i think quickbeam would have been a better choice maybe.<br />
new asfaloth- well i was expecting some underground sites which hurt old one.  didnt run into any though.  the skirmish text of this one isnt that bad though.<br />
site 7/the number must be few- well i wanted the shadow to geet more stops than kills so i used that site 7 instead of the swarming one, and dropped a minion for the number must be few.  <br />
<br />
so i used 8 companions which can help vs wounding or swarm decks.  glamdring (old) and curse thier foul feet lets you know whats coming.<br />
all my games i won by racing, except the final where i killed with a troll. that was cool<br />
well there it is.  this deck is whack , dont play it<br />
<br />
peace<br />
dont ban fellowship block<br />
