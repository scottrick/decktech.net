<br />
INTRODUCTION:<br />
<br>Your man, Aragorn, will race your company over the Rivers and through the Woods as to Site 9 they go. He knows the way to carry the day while Uruk-hai make your opponents move slow(ly).<br />
<br><br />
<br>TOP CARDS:<br />
<br>By now, pretty much everyone understands the principles of Target Archery. Legolas, Greenleaf and Aragorn, with his Bow, can each exert to place wounds on opposing minions at your discretion. Combined with Strength of Spirit, which prevents your characters from taking wounds for exerting, your archers become akin to rapid-fire machine guns. This is nothing new, nor is combining Target Archery with A Ranger&#39;s Versatility which can exhaust up to two minions at a River or Forest. What is unique about this deck is that it is *extremely*, *tightly* focused on going to as many Forests and Rivers as possible (thanks to Thror&#39;s Map) and using all of the Strength of Spirit and A Ranger&#39;s Versatility possible.<br />
<br><br />
<br>HOW IT BEATS YOU:<br />
<br>You will bid high to go first, bidding 5 if it seems like a safe win, higher if need be. Part of the strength of this deck is that it forces your opponent to catch up to you. Pull Aragorn from your draw deck with the Prancing Pony&#39;s game text if you don&#39;t have him in your hand. Gandalf is key to the use of all your spells, so you have 3 copies of him and 3 copies of A Wizard Is Never Late to help fetch him early. Play everything you can in the first turn, exert Sam three times to remove as many burdens and begin the race. The first couple of sites are generally safe because your early archery and the sacrifice of Sam, if need be, are enough to get you through even if you draw poorly. After Rivendell, you should have your standard company set up, with Gandalf at 11 prowess for spotting 3 races and bearing Glamdring. Legolas and Aragorn mow down selected opponents, and Gandalf and Aragorn whack the reaminders with their swords. Your opponent will be forced to chase after you, so your high-prowess / high-vitality Uruk-hai will start to give some wounds and kill companions. Double moving against Uruk-hai is typically dangerous. However, in the late game, with Thror&#39;s Map and A Ranger&#39;s Versatility you will be able to exhaust up to two minions at each site and can double-move with relative ease for the Site 9 victory.<br />
<br><br />
<br>NUMBER 1 CARD:<br />
<br>A Ranger&#39;s Versatility. It&#39;s hard to believe this card is only an uncommon. It is possibly the most "broken" card in the set. In combination with Target Archery, it means that even the Witch-king and Cave-troll are impotent outside of Moria. Thror&#39;s Map would be a close second for allowing you to play your own sites to make the best use of A Ranger&#39;s Versatility. They work in combination.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
