I was supposed to play a final confrontation but the dolt of a TD went against what it already said was on the Internet and decided to have the top 8 players play a single-elimination three-round playoff, which meant we wouldn&#39;t get home until 1:00 A.M. I got draw screwed and lost in the first round, this eliminating me. But that is TR stuff... <br />
<br />
Basically, I was looking for a deck that would do great against everything out there. I used Greenleaf+ Faramir IR start with ROTN for a while and that was good but lacking somewhat, so then I decided to use Dauntless Hunter instead. It took some doing because the whole discarding thing uses up 9 valuable card slots but in the end the final product is worth the headaches it caused. I discard the biggest vitality minions, everyone else dies to archery, I move and repeat. That&#39;s it, in a nutshell. Beat a threat Nazgul deck, Dunland, Corsairs, Moria swarm, stupid swarm, everything. <br />
<br />
The shadow is your basic dunland site control with some extra twists for added fun. The Siege Troops make taking sites even easier and once you have 2 the Elders become absolute beasts. The arsonists are great because if you have no pool left you can get out the elders for free, who fight a fierce skirmish, then make the FP player double-move. All five of my wins at the TOC came from shadow kills - and in all but one game my fellowship was ahead and doing great, I merely killed them before I reached 9 myself. <br />
<br />
any questions about cards d-mail me...I&#39;m exhausted. and remember...it can beat your deck.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
