Relatively simple strategy.  The point of the deck is balance: in a tough game, i can win by reaching site 9 first or by corrupting/killing the Ringbearer.  both sides are fairly strong.  Usually i bid high to go second, using Sam to drop those burdens.<br />
<br />
The Fellowship relies on the power of Rangers and Elves to pull through to site 9.  While Aragorn can be moderately powerful, the focus is on Arwen.  Just through possessions, Arwen can reach power of 10 (13 vs Nazgul), with No Mere Ranger and Gwemegil discarding allowing her to go even beyond that.  But before you even get to the skirmish phases, there&#39;s ARV and Legolas Greenleaf, plus two elven bows for Arwen and Haldir, so that&#39;s a possible 3 archery (4 at site 6) to take care of all the minions every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Every deck now has to deal with facing the Balrog.  Obviously the best way to get past the Balrog is to restrict twilight to the point where the Shadow players can&#39;t play him, but those decks aren&#39;t really my style.  Another way is to try to actually beat him using either Gimli with Helm or Gandalf with Staff Asunder.  I don&#39;t quite have the cards (or the guts) to try pulling that off, so i go for a couple tricks.  First off, the easiest way to get past the Balrog is to throw companions at him.  By this point in the game, Sam has outlived his usefulness, so he&#39;s first up for sacrificial lamb.  In the fierce skirmish, check and see if any of your companions have a chance at living through a Balrog attack.  Occasionally Arwen or Aragorn can live through it if the Balrog isn&#39;t playing with all his toys.  If you can keep Arwen from being overwhelmed, Hosts of the LA should help you stop her from taking too many wounds.  The best possible way to get past the Balrog, however, is to find a way to kill all the other minions running around, finishing off the last one with an archer and playing Dismay our Enemies to force the Shadow player to discard the Balrog.  Just make sure they don&#39;t have (3) to cancel it...<br />
<br />
The Shadow side of the deck is my favorite.  It focuses on corrupting the Ringbearer with all the cool new Nazgul.  All you have to do is make the Ringbearer put on the Ring twice, and you should have him corrupted.  alternatively, if you manage to get enough Nazgul out at once, have fun smashing his fellowship to bits.  You should at least be able to slow him down enough to take the lead and win.  and that&#39;s the point.  but corruption is very, very fun.  I pack the Pale Blade specifically because of O Elbereth Gilthoniel, get rid of it early.<br />
