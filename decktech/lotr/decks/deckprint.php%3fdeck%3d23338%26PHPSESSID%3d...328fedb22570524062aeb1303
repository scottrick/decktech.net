This deck is a lot of fun to play, but it can be nerve wracking if you let it get to you.  Fellowship is directed archery with ARV and a Raging Flood for the nazgul decks that are sooo popular in my area.  shadow is direct damage sauron orcs, with a few bigger guys thrown in to mix it up.  getting 4 hates was no easy thing, but they work great in this deck.<br />
<br />
I usually &quot;bid to go first&quot;, but by that i mean bid 3 max.  if they go first, oh well, you&#39;ll kill them all in good time, and probably catch up.  last tournament i went to, Nazgul were heavy in the air and more than half the kids were playing them.  so i tried to stay under 4 burdens, and it worked great.  never lost a skirmish to nazgul.<br />
<br />
moving should go 1-3, then just 4, 5-6, and 7-9 thanks to Gift of Boats.  all you need to pull of gift of boats is 2xARV in your hand and Thror&#39;s Map on the table.  map your site 7 and 9, and you&#39;re off the hook, usually.  even if they use scouts, which i notice a lot of people don&#39;t, tol brandir just means you have fun shooting more minions, and your Raging Flood and ARV work great at that site.<br />
<br />
the worst move is into the balrog&#39;s chamber.  i have some protection against him but not much.  against a dumb opponent, you can hope for something as simple as an exhausted balrog and legolas w/bow killing a runner and then the &#39;rog himself.  not likely, though, so i put in some balrog chew-toys, in the form of Thrarin and Boromir.  Boromir is great against the Common Balrog or even Rare w/ no weapons, especially wearing his armor.<br />
<br />
all the strength stuff is for Aragorn.  naturally, you want him out soon, with his bow, sword, Last Alliance, even armor if you can&#39;t get Boromir.  that way anything that gets through your arrows will die facing him.<br />
<br />
secret sentinels, that&#39;s a no-brainer.  kills Fill with Fear and Spies of Saruman before they touch you.  simple as that.  just remember to leave a free exertion on Elrond (or rumil).<br />
<br />
Rumil and Bow of the Galadhrim because i have an irrational fear of Moria swarm b/c my brother played it so well for so long before finding his true love, Lurtz.<br />
<br />
as for the Shadow side, it&#39;s not brain science.  get UtWE on the table and Hate whoever&#39;s closest to death, unless they have Gandalf out.  Gandalf is target number One for Hate, due to his Sleep Caradhras that can really dent your deck.  so take him out first.  then when they finally start to assume that they&#39;ll win every skirmish and they grow lazy, drop the bigger minions on them and watch the companions die.  the Balrog is usually pretty good at this, although most people pack protection against him now (finally).  sometimes i&#39;ll skip the Balrog and clean out my hand instead, but not usually.  the chance at killing somebody is too good to pass up.  with enquea, wait and see if they get 6 companions or 5 burdens, then drop him and gloat, and don&#39;t forget he&#39;s fierce...<br />
<br />
and if all else fails, you have Tol Brandir.  more than once i&#39;ve had an opponent lulled into false security by my seemingly powerless shadow minions, only to find themselves at Tol Brandir, facing enough trackers to fill a concert hall (don&#39;t ask, i&#39;m tired).  naturally, they exert Raragorn to take them all on...and i Hate him.  gotta love it...<br />
<br />
the most important thing to remember with this deck is cycling your hand.  before you get to site 6, you need to have over half your deck gone through, b/c you absolutely MUST have certain cards in order to make that final rush downriver.  Thror&#39;s Map, enough ARV&#39;s, obviously Aragorn&#39;s Bow and hopefully Splendour and a Bow on Arwen, Gift of Boats and an ally...etc.  so discard and draw whenever you can, and deploy as much shadow crap as you can to draw s&#39;more.  because that&#39;s what will turn the game for this deck.  even with just 64 cards in the draw deck, that&#39;s almost too many, and i&#39;d take out a few if i could figure out which ones could stand coming out.<br />
<br />
well, thanks for looking.  so far this deck has only 1 defeat in tournament play, but i have a feeling i&#39;ll be switching it soon to keep my fellow players on their toes...<br />
