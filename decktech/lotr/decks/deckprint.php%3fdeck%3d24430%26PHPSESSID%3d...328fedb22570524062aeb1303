<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Anyway, bid one or none, depending on preference. I usually bid one just in case my opponent bids zero, and I choose to go first. This deck can win by either completing the adventure path or by killing off your opponent, which it did in most of its wins. I am not going to explain the fellowship half of this deck, as it is the mirror. Yes it is abusive, yes it should be banned, but until it is, I will still play it. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
As for the shadow, I was pretty pessimistic about the Isengard Orcs until Mike Kessling and Stephen Michael showed me the power. These minions are amazing. With high vitality, low cost, and cards that pump them and heal them, the strategy behind them is simple, use Saruman to assign them to fights they can win, use Coming for the Ring on those that took wounds, wound them to wound a companion and use The Trees Are Strong to make them into suicide bombers (On a side not, when you use The Trees Are Strong, you must slam it on the table and yell "GOBLIN BOMB" at the top of your lungs, it makes it far more devastating.) Wash, rinse, repeat. Most of the time I try to set up a 4-5 minion hand with a Trees. Or if your opponent is foolish enough to double move with minions on the table, all the better. In two out of the three games my shadow won (by killing Frodo) my opponent would move into a site with 6-8 companions and end his turn with 2 or 3. THESE MINIONS ARE THAT... D@MN... GOOD!<br />
<br><br />

I know it would be great if I could put in Spies of Saruman, Tower of Orthanc, No Business of Ours, or any other card you can think of. Right now there is no room. Trust me, this works great as is, but if you feel the need, change cards as your preference dictates, but PLEASE give Isengard Orcs a try, they are better than you think.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
