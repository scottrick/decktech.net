This is a pretty ordinary deck, but I’m just trying to get it perfect (or as near as humanly possible). Please let me know your suggested modifications – cards to take out as well as cards to put in.<br>
<br>
In response to some of the Reviews (thankyou all)... <br>
<br>
I would like to add another Flaming Brand, but what should I take out? Don&#39;t really want to make the deck any bigger. <br>
<br>
I think maybe I should take out the Guard Commander for a Relics of Moria.<br>
<br>
Uruk-hai? No, I don&#39;t really have problems with them. One of the best match-ups actually. Uruk-hai are roaming while my fellowship sets up and then I have the versatilities with archery, armor and incredibly high power companions (even Uruk-hai have trouble with 14Str and 12Str companions). Moria and Sauron are actually more of a problem.<br>
<br>
It&#39;s true that Moria does have real trouble with big fellowships, but the shadow isn&#39;t really the focus of this deck. It can win, but it shouldn&#39;t need to. The goal of the shadow is more in the way of card cycling. The deck which provides the most speed compatition is a similar deck to this and Moria works pretty well against it.<br>
<br>
Archery or Power? I find it very dangerous to rely on one or the other. A single Spies of Sauroman can spell the end of an archery deck, and power decks have serious trouble with Moria. The card cycling from They Are Coming/Scavengers/Scimitars, 3 Elronds and 1 Gwemigil ensures that I&#39;ll see enough of the deck to boost up my companions for both purposes. I&#39;m always open to suggestions if you can think of anything to take out though...<br>
<br>
<br>
Fellowship <br>
Bid 5-6 to go first and pull Sam. If you get stuck going second, Bree Gates will hopefully let you catch up. Using a combination of equipment and directed archery with ARV should let you move very quickly at the end. You should move 1-3-4-6 and then hopefully jumping 6-9 with gift of boats. Going second try to go 1-4-6-9. Obviously if you are playing Choke or Nazgul you&#39;ll need to adapt. The card-cycling should let you set up pretty quickly. Remember not to play both Men before you kill off Sam or you&#39;ll suffer for it. Also don&#39;t over exert Elrond before playing the boats or you may lose him to an ally killer. Elrond and Aragorn are very expensive and the total cost of the equipment is pretty stellar so don&#39;t expect to move too quickly at the start, especially against Nazgul. <br>
<br>
Shadow <br>
Moria isn&#39;t as quick at slowing down your opponent at the start which can make things difficult, but later on when you are speeding up they should slow down your opponent pretty well. Sauron are also good at slowing down your opponent on the last few sites, but the card cycling of Moria will make your fellowship significantly more powerful. Most of the card choices are pretty obvious. The few variations are: Guard Commander will let you use up all the extra twilight put out by The Nine Walkers decks; Flankers are great for archery protection as well as paths and directed archery; doesn’t everyone play Enquea in Moria these days? – good against big fellowships which is the best defense against Moria.<br>
<br>
Sites <br>
Bree Gates should let you catch up if you go second (usually against hobbit decks so they won&#39;t be able to use it). The Council Courtyard over the Waterfall as you usually don&#39;t want to move 3-6 through the hottest sites. The Stairway is lower in twilight than the others and makes all your minions with scimitars deadly, as well as helping out the Troll and your companions. Unfortunately Dimrill Dale would seriously hurt your fellowship side, so Valley of The Silverload it is. Silverload Banks is the only site that doen&#39;t hurt you and Pillars of The Kings is the least nasty site 8. I&#39;m tempted to put in Tol Brandir for ARV, but against Sauron... Anyway Summit of Amon Hen is easier than the others. (of course I will be mapping alot of my locations out). <br>
<br>
Thanks for any and all advice you can give me. <br>
