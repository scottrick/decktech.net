By that I mean that you won&#39;t win any races, but your shadow&#39;s effectiveness is increased by your fellowship.<br />
<br />
Most decks are very reliant on a healthy stream of new cards and good throughput.  This is why you will hear the phrase &quot;I only lost to a random bad draw&quot; often in deck profiles.  This deck takes advantage of that, practically stopping throughput of minions and clogging up your opponents hand with minions, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of their fellowship (in turn increasing the effectiveness of your shadow).<br />
<br />
The fellowship is pretty obvious.  It is built to keep Frodo and Sam alive and keep the minions from catching up to them.  Making it to site 9 will not be easy but might not be necessary.  Deftness in their Movements should get you a double move into the bridge giving up 2 twilight... even with leftovers from the move in it&#39;s going to be tough to get out a balrog, or even 2 uruks.<br />
<br />
The Shadow is designed to take advantage of this.  I know someone will complain about the overuse of Blade Tips due to massive condition removal being played in most decks, but the hand choke helps keep those cards in the deck.  With 7 conditions, it&#39;s going to be hard to keep up w/ their Secret Sentinals and most decks w/ Sleep only pack 1 or 2 tops.  In the time between both cards being played Blade Tips prove very effective.  Black Breaths perform 2 functions.  Firstly, they make Blade Tip that much better and keep wounds on companions, but secondly, choke your opponent even more if they get on a Gandalf, Aragorn, or Boromir.  Those extra copies will be clogging their hands along with minions.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
Sam, Faithful Companion: Ensured Bill when you need him.  Proper Poet is great too, you could easily replace w/ any version of Sam, and it would not hurt the deck&#39;s effectiveness.  I just think Bill at the right times is worth the sacrifice of the other great Sam game texts.<br />
The Gaffer: Helps combat Blade Tip and Sauron... and oh yeah, you won&#39;t be winning too many skirmishes...<br />
Bounder: One of the best commons in the game!<br />
Frying Pan: THE best common in the game.<br />
Deftness in their Movements:  SOOOO good.  The only problem is that I always seem to get 2 or 3 in my opening hand...<br />
Frying Pan over Hobbit Sword: Because a Moria Swarm on Sam early is very possible even with minimal twilight.  Stealths don&#39;t always come at the right times.<br />
Sting: I am a little iffy on this one.  Sting is my favourite card in the game, but I would try and avoid it&#39;s use as much as possible.  I don&#39;t use much twilight, so I can&#39;t remove a lot usually, so it&#39;s best used in regroup before deft in their movements, removing anything left from stealths/intuitions/moving, etc.  I also don&#39;t like that it doesn&#39;t play on Sam.  I would like to change it to a Hobbit Sword, but I just know that I would end up complaining about a situation where sting would have won the game... so Sting it is.<br />
Thror&#39;s Map: The same argument as for Sting.  I would love to have 2 Sting&#39;s in the deck, but being a multiple, it was the easiest card to bump out.  Thror&#39;s map would be a lifesaver to avoid the slopes of amon-hen, anduin confluence, or Shores in some instances so it gets the nod... though it would be the first card out if i started tinkering.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Balrog: how many times have you seen a bad draw resulting in Legolas and Arwen dying to the Balrog at the bridge due to an Aragorn-less fellowship.  Not to mention the Balrog can really hurt full blown archery decks.<br />
Lemenaya: easy overwhelms w/ BB/BT and plays for only 4... a good second level nazgul to put with the Witch King or Attea<br />
Nelya: defining the site path is ALWAYS nice.  Also another good second level nazgul.<br />
Relentless Charge: Anti-archery... Ninja&#39;s don&#39;t like cheesy deaths... just cheesy voice overs.<br />
Too Great and Terrible: okay... maybe Ninja&#39;s like cheesy deaths... only sometimes though!<br />
<br />
One last note:<br />
<br />
This deck performs better than any when &quot;on the edge&quot;.  Sometimes you actually want Sam to die because it increases the effectiveness of PATHS.  With 4 PATHS and Intuitions/Stealths and Bounders, your Frodo alone should last AT LEAST 2 extra sites, so don&#39;t think game over when Sam dies.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and thanks for your reviews.  Keep in mind I know that O Elbereth and There and Back Again are missing, they were sacrificed for the good of the deck as a whole, mostly because they had twilight cost and because they are only good in key situations that may never arise.  Stealths, Intuitions and Filibert do the job in those situations almost as well, but are always useful. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
