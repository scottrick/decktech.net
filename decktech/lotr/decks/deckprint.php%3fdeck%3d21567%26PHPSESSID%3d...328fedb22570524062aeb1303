So i started looking at decks.  Saw Dom&#39;s deck and liked the fellowship alot, seemed like access to his fellowship cards was limited though cuz all his bad guy stuff(gimme a break i&#39;m new) came out cheap at site 6.  So i figured:<br />
<br />
play dirt cheap baddies that you always can just throw down and then you&#39;ll have almost instant access to your fellwoship cards.  alot of peopel try to do this the other way around but  this deck obviously runs like no other so you need to have access to those cards.  <br />
<br />
So fellowship plays like this, bid high, pull the pony, pull aragorn.  move out fast (1-3 obviously) and use your stealths and intutions to avoid the baddies.  Archery too...i really like the saga and tale cuz thye are huge boosters to archery.  Because the nature of the deck, you&#39;ll get boromir and armor out fast, then you start you have the loop of boromit taking one wound and aragorn healing him.  Nice, that with the intutions and archery means you get to site 6 fast, and with little damage.  In the meantime just keep dropping your whole ds hand every turn and most liely having them die.  <br />
<br />
So the you get to site 6, if you have the map you can double move cuz of ranger&#39;s versatality being sooo good.  Path is also good but i reallyshoudl add in sting to  make it fool proof.  Altho Paths is almost never needed until you run out of arrows.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Aight so the deck runs and you run fast because you have huge access to your fellwoship cards because your darkside cards flow from your hand so quickly.  Thats teh game plan.  The troll and hammer are in there because they&#39;ll prolly try to keep up with you by double moving and a cave troll at site five if tehy doubel move can be huge.  Hammer is so underrated cuz if you get it you can kill someone, instead of jjst wounding them where they can be healed the next site.  I dont understand why more peopel dont play the hammer.  The lone nazgul is in the deck because in the rare case that you lose the bid(in which case you want to start aragorn), you can drop him and kill legolas and then you have a much better chance to overwealm.  Thats about it, itsmy first deck and i would appreciate some advice thanks.--h2O </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
