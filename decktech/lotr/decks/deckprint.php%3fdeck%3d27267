sup? couple more things that people have mentioned...oh yeh, 3 things, Nazgul, Moria and adding mo bigger Uruks.<br />
<br />
Moria - Moria is an issue, which is why I have included Go On and Get Away. I think I mentioned that, but really the only way Moria can kill me is if they set up the Isengard Warrior/Other Orc combo AND get out more than 6 minions. If I have out Eowyn, Eomer(w/ Firefoot) Legolas, Frodo and Aragorn, that means that Nertea can only pull one minion. That means that not only do they have to have at least 1 of the 2 IsenOrcs in hand, but they also need Nertea and 4 other minions in hand. While I realize that that isn&#39;t the HARDEST thing to do, it is more difficult than pitching the IsenOrcs for throughput and pulling them back with Nerty.<br />
If they don&#39;t have the IsenOrcs, then Greenleaf and Gorn will shoot down as many Orcs as I need to, and I&#39;ll move again. <br />
<br />
Nazgul - Keith mentioned adding Elbereth and Brands....Elbereth wouldn&#39;t be bad, but I don&#39;t think I need more than 2 Brands.....with Help and Eomer, Legolas and Gorn, the only Nazgul that I don&#39;t always beat is the King, but as long as I have Help, he ain&#39;t winning neither. Just to be blatantly obvious, if they play Cantea, I shoot him once with Archery then assign him to someone who has a Horsey and BAM! no eating my weapons!<br />
<br />
Uruks - two guys mentioned the Orthance Champion. He ain&#39;t bad, but I prefer to not have TOO many non-archers, since it is an Urukery deck. Also, since I have no room for BBladed Swords, the Champion tends to just get shot. 1 Lurtz and Captain are enough, because if they are needed, then thats what Nertea is for. In fact, the only reason the Captain is in is so I can use the P. Chamber to pull Nertea, use Nertea to pull Captain and use Captain to pull whatever I need. Saruman&#39;s Power is VERY nescessary, because believe it or not, Fellowship archery can hose Urukery. Since most Uruk Archers are wusses, they don&#39;t need to weapons that they aren&#39;t playing to win fights. <br />
Elite Crossbowmen are in for sure. They win games at 9 by exerting to off unbound. I know they are expensive, and trust me, theres no reason for them to cost 7, but there are those instanses(sp?) where wounding 2 unbounds is SOOOOOmuch better than Lurtz.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the good words guys, I am trying to keep up with what everyone is saying :)<br />
<br />
oh yeah, BTW, the title of the deck is a line from a Thursday song called Understanding a Car Crashimmer was also a headline on the Daily Show, but that was after I posted the deck, which is freaky.<br />
<br />

<br />
The biggest question I have been getting has been why I do not play One of You Must Do This. I understand, because that card is huge and can allow me to do 4 wounds for 1 twilight and an exertion, but in this deck I decided that I would sub out the One of Yous for Can You Protect Me and Berserkers, which can end up causing in the long run more wounds. The problem with One of You is that, while it wrecks Trust pretty badly, it is a marginal card at best against non-trust decks. Specifically, against Ringbound decks and Help decks(like mine) it is 1 pool and an exertion for 2 wounds AT MOST.<br />
<br />
Not the best usage of cards.<br />
<br />
Also, Can You lets me play Uruk Camp without fear of getting clogged, since it requires no exertion. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I used to play Savageries(2) but I find that, while they will win you some games, this deck flows better without them. If you must, take out one Tower and one No Bus for 2 Savageries.<br />
<br />
The other thing was that a couple of people suggested Theoden + Herugrim. hmmm, sorry, can&#39;t do it. Playing Theoden puts me at 6 companions, which I cannot have. That means that Enquea can eat Eomer, which means I then have a much harder time winning skirmishes. <br />
<br />
Weapon Store is a card that has occupied the final slot many times, is place of Go On, but I find that, unless I pair this deck with Moria(which works beautifully :) I do not usually need to get back weapons, because I rarely lose them :). Also, if you don&#39;t like Go On, I have been using healer Elrond lately instead(Moria has fallen out of favor) and he works great.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, oh yeah, Devonator, I use Hlafwine because she is a pump for my Rohanians, she makes Eowyn damage +1 and she is a speed bumb at 4 if needed. I don&#39;t like putting 3 cards on anyone, so I like the damage +1 from her sword, and the extra one, like you mentioned, means that she must be pumped on to lose, which is the goal. If they waste a pumper to make me discard cards from my hand, then thats awesome, and that probably means that Aragorn and Eomer will win their fights. <br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who reviewed.<br />

alright, first of all, the two idiots who gave me 1/2 star are the reason that decktech is going to the crapper. too many people who are more interested in seeing their decks in the top 10 at the expense of actually helping other people play the game. the guy who said I copied this from his judge....I don&#39;t know ANYONE else playing this deck, much less did I copy it from ANYONE. John Irving posted a deck with the Eowyn/Lego start using 4 Simblemynes, and that is the only influence my deck has from ANY one else. <br />
<br />
Also, I have 34 cards on both sides. maybe the guy who thought I had 32 Free Peoples should look at Eowyn and Legolas, which I listed as STARTING, since I START them.<br />
<br />
The reviews that I DO think were valid are next.<br />
<br />
Many people mentioned Site Liberation, and I know that some Site Control decks can really get going, but this deck sets up fast enough that they shouldn&#39;t EVER take control of a site, much less enough to make the Southron Archer bomb worth 12 twilight. I have Fortress to take care of Attack on Helm&#39;s Deep and Down to the Last CHild, as well as No Retreat, which is really the only way for Dunland to win right now. I have played against some really good site control decks, and I feel that they do not pose enough of a threat to include Theoden. Easterlings could pose a problem, but they lose badly enough to common Faramir and aimed archery that I don&#39;t worry, especially since I am playing with lots of aimed archery.<br />
<br />
Another guy mentioned playing more Eomers or starting him. The point is that I need NOT start Eomer, since with 4 copies of Simblemyne he will come out quick enough. Trust me. <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the last thing was that someone said having out 6 companions will let Enquea kill someone. I never go to 6 companions unless I KNOW that Enquea is not a possibility. That is one of the reasons I am playing Shards, so that Boromir can hang out there until he is needed (eg. Legolas or Eowyn dies).<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, since Atlanta DPC is passed and I didn’t get to go, thanks to a last minute case of some virus or something, I decided I’d post the deck that should have won, or at least done well at, the event.<br />
<br />
I have been playing with this Shadow for a long time, and it always does very well, even against denial. You only need 6 Twilight to do as many as 5 wounds, which is a lot against a denial deck., and it does even better against large fellowships.<br />
<br />
The Free Peoples is something that I have been toying with, thanks to John Irving, and it is quite solid. You start off with Legolas instead of Eomer, which makes moving faster against Uruks easier. It also makes the deck a bit more versatile than any other Help deck, since it has the answer to Moria at the beginning of the game. With 4 Simblemyne, you’ll get Eomer out a tanked up about the same time you get Aragorn going, which should be by site 4 or so. Heres the general set up:<br />
<br />
Eowyn – Her Sword and a Flaming Brand. Uruks need a pump to beat her, as do Nazgul<br />
<br />
Eomer – Spear and Firefoot. Eats Uruks for dinner. Against Nazgul, consider giving him a brand, but watch for Grima.<br />
<br />
Aragorn – Bow and either a Brand or the Sword. If Grima is nowhere to be found, give him Brego and both Hand weapons, but against almost every matchup, he should get the bow.<br />
<br />
Boromir and Legolas are pretty much throwaways against everything but Moria, where they tend to be more important than Eowyn. <br />
<br />
I use shards to store Boromir and Sword of Gondor/Flaming Brand. I also use Shards so that I do not have to play multiple copies of Help, which means that a well timed Saruman’s Power will only wipe out 1 Help, instead of killing my ability to win skirmishes entirely. I find that Shards makes the deck run about 3 times smoother than it does without it.<br />
<br />
Fortress Never Fallen- I know that this isn’t the best condition removal out there, but it saves me having to play with too many allies and it is the best removal against Moria, as long as I draw it up early. This card can win games against Trackers and Nazgul, but only if you’ve already started winning skirmishes. I think that it is a necessary evil for the deck to be competitive.<br />
<br />
Go on and Get Away – my answer to the Moria problem. If you see them playing Moria with the Isen Orcs who prevent archery abilities, get rid of Lego and play Boromir, as long as you have Get on to get rid of the Cavern Entrance. Beware though, because it DOES set up a minion at the Palantir Chamber. BTW, since you should have bid 0-1 at the start of the game, adding 2 burdens should not be an issue.<br />
<br />
The Shadow is fairly straightforward, but I will explain generally how it works. You want to cause wounds. A lot of wounds. The way you do this is to play archers, who cause wounds, and then play conditions and events, which cause wounds. The following cards are integral to this process:<br />
<br />
Weapons of Isengard – 2 wounds for 2 pool is a great deal. Unfortunately, your opponent will have condition removal, so try to use them as soon as they make it through a maneuver phase. The only exception would be if your opponent is about to stop at a sanctuary and they have less than 5 wounds. <br />
<br />
Can You Protect Me? – either cause a minimun of 1 wound on Aragorn(sometimes as many as 4) or give yourself a minion at the P Chamber. Also, helps to activate Berserkers and Enquea. <br />
<br />
Berserkers – a big minion who will often win his skirmish. Also, when they get burdens, which happens fairly often against archery, gives you Free wounds on a character of your choice. <br />
<br />
Other important cards in this deck are:<br />
<br />
No Business of Ours – this deck was designed to play in an environment where Foul Creation is a popular card. If you never see FC, drop one of these, or both, for something mean. Otherwise, you already know how important your opponent not seeing your hand is.<br />
<br />
Tower of Orthanc – HUGE. With Can You Protect Me and lots of archery, people will be exhausted VERY often. This means that each Tower allows you to afford another minion.<br />
<br />
Tower Assassin – kill Dreary before he kills your Weapons, off Filbert so that Lurtz has a bigger impact, kill Treebeard to prevent healing of companions….just an incredibly useful card.<br />
<br />
Saruman’s Power – essential card to stop denial decks from choking you too much.<br />
<br />
Abandoning Reason for Madness – helps to cycle your hand so that you can prepare for whatever you need to do. Is your fellowship ahead? Play a minion and pitch all the rest of them. Need to Shadow kill? Pitch all your stupid Freeples cards and decimate your opponent. VERY good card.<br />
<br />
The shadow should cause stops at 3 and 6 every game. This makes it easy for you to pass your opponent by going 5-7, which means you win. Your Free Peoples, once set up, can kill anything and keep going. That’s how you are usually going to win. On the other hand, against some opponents, the Shadow will kill them at or before site 5. You can usually tell when this is going to happen, so play the Free Peoples accordingly. <br />
<br />
This deck is VERY strong, and it isn’t all that hard to play. D-Mail me if you have any questions. Thanks.<br />
