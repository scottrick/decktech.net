As the title points out, this deck won the southern CA TOC.  It went a combined 7-1 including the final.  I called it So Cal&#39;s Bane on my decklist because I had come from San Francisco and I was one of 2 northern CA players at the So Cal TOC.  So us northern Californians had to represent.<br />
<br />
I posted the deck since people seemed to be curious about it, despite the fact I bascially gave a decklist in my TR.  The game I lost was to a shadow very similar to mine.  The game was the closest a LotR game can get; skirmish at site 9, where Frodo died, and gave the ring to Sam, who then died in the fierce, so I lost.<br />
<br />
The fellowship is nothing special, it certainly isn&#39;t what won me the TOC.  Bid 3-5 to go first, pull Legolas, remove 2 burdens (and 1 more with Pippin), then move as far as your stealths or choke allow you.  Try to stay ahead, but its ok to fall behind.  I just wanted to play a small, choke fellowship, and this is about as chokey (new word!) as you can get in standard format.  Also, it is rather hard to kill Sam and Frodo in this deck, and I just wanted to be able to survive and not die to some fluke draw my opponent might have.<br />
<br />
However, the fellowship can still double-move when needed, thats what There and Back Again is mainly for.  Also, the deck chokes 2 off each site most of time, and that helps, and if you have Escape then they have to save pool or you can cancel their skirmishes.  This is the only reason I rated this as an advanced deck, because you have to know when you can double move, and you should play accordingly, such as using There and Back Again, and saving stealths, using Merry, the order in which to resolve skirmishes, and so on.  You do have to think a little.  But only when double-moving.<br />
<br />
Many people believe that I should play Elrond/Vilya, but that&#39;s only if you are really that concerned about Moria or Sauron.  My feeling is that Thror&#39;s Map is enough for Moria, as I will hopefully never hit the Caverns.  Also, just slap the Pan on Merry and it will be hard overwhelming him, and if they DON&#39;T pile on Merry then you can always use him to save whomever they ARE trying to overwhelm.  Moria always guns for Merry, so Escape can help him out too.  The key is avoiding the Caverns of course.  Merry + Severed means its hard to kill a hobbit.  Better stack on Legolas.<br />
<br />
But the bottom line is that this is a CHOKE deck, so Elrond just doesn&#39;t fit.  Yeah he works by bouncing conditions, but remember its a TWO card combo, so many times you will add 4 pool for playing Elrond but you will not be able to use Vilya for another 2-3 sites AT LEAST, until you draw it.  Meanwhile, your opponent has used the 4 pool to play another condition or 2.<br />
<br />
As for other matchups; its virtually immune to corruption decks.  Fierce minions give it a hard time, but there are things you can do.  Against trackers, There and Back Again is big, because if you have weapons (or Promises) out your hobbits can usually beat down all trackers on table, if they can&#39;t play pumps; but if they can, then use Merry to help out.  Against Nazgul, setup the PATHS/Cliffs combo.  I love saying &quot;take an archery, I&#39;ll play PATHS, and use Cliffs.&quot;  Normally they can only play 1 nazgul per site, so killing that nazgul allows you to double.  And you probably wont be seeing TOO many breaths and Tips with you choking the pool, so its not like ALL your guys will be tipped and breathed.  Just try not to let Sam get Tipped.<br />
<br />
Wargs are VERY tough, since you rarely have enough stealths for all the skirmishes.  And Sharku exhausts Legolas VERY fast.  All you can really do is use the choke to your advantage, so they can only play one warg per turn.  Hopefully you can give Pippin the Pan, use him to kill a warg, then move the Pan later on.<br />
<br />
What won me my games was my shadow.  I wanted a shadow that was fierce, that much was certain, because I just like fierce minions.  I HATE stealths, and fierceness is a built-in counter to stealths because it forces them to use TWO stealths per minion, or fight the minion.<br />
<br />
After much testing, I chose Uruks, mainly because they can better handle Rohan than the Nazgul.  Hence the spears to dismount people.  Also, I realized many uruks can be fierce with little effort.  So most of my uruks are fierce when either at a battleground, or when a certain number of companions are out.<br />
<br />
I have posted the deck as i played it, but looking back i would probably take out Saruman and the Champion.  The assigning ability was never that great.  Enquea could probably go too, but I like him in there because I bid 3-5 to go first, so if they bid higher and don&#39;t remove the burdens right away Enquea is a HUGE 1st turn draw.<br />
<br />
Other things about the shadow:<br />
<br />
Site control: Yes, my only site control is ONE uruk stormer.  Site control just isnt that great.  I tried playing with more uruks who work with site control (stacking uruks, uruks who deploy -1 per site, etc), but it just wasn&#39;t reliable.  If you didn&#39;t draw your site control cards, your uruks sucked.<br />
<br />
Weapons: Some people like BB swords over the spears, that&#39;s a question of what your opinion is.  I would not be averse to adding 1 or 2 swords, taking out maybe a spear and/or ferocity.  But for this TOC I was more concerned with Rohan rather than archery.  Defend It and Hope is also a real pain.  Saruman&#39;s Power helps against archery though, getting rid of Gondor Bowmen and any fortifications.<br />
<br />
I can&#39;t stress how effective the shadow was for me.  Many games I wished I had gone second because I almost had my opponent killed, but I was at site 8 and so when my turn came I moved to site 9 to win.  Very rarely did anyone double-move against my uruks, even at site 2!  That kept the pressure off my fellowship, and there is no way ANYONE will beat a Dauntless Hnuter deck if you can&#39;t force them to double-move.  And anytime my opponent moved ahead of me, they of course ran into a BATTLEGROUND, which means FIERCE uruks (and they&#39;re not weak either, power 10 or 14, combine that with 4 ferocities and you can see how they&#39;re hard to top), and if they have 5 or 6 guys, then they&#39;re all fierce (although those uruks are a bit weaker, thats what ferocity is for).<br />
<br />
The uruks are fairly solid overall, but they can have trouble with archery.  So if you really fear archery, throw in some BB swords and have at it!  The uruks are fun to play!  BTW, if you think choke decks beat uruks, think again!  the Patrol is only 5 cost, many other uruks are only 3.  My only loss in the TOC came to an uruk deck.  And since the only way they can really choke is by playing hobbits, your fighters (who will usually be fierce) and fierce battleground uruks will make short work of them.  And of course don&#39;t forget SARUMAN&#39;S POWER hurts the choke decks as well.  As I said, its solid overall.  Good luck! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
