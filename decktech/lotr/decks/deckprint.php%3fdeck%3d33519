I don&#39;t think anyone is playing this, and if they are, too bad.<br />
<br />
I was sort of fascinated with the deck that ended up being 2nd place at Comic Con for two reasons. First was that it managed to cycled enough to win with a 39 card deck and 2nd because it abused new Eowyn to her most. I managed to trim the deck and in the process of playing a lot on SDA with several people made some changes that seem to be for the best.<br />
<br />
The basic premise of the deck is EOWYN GO BOOM.<br />
<br />
Legolas puts some wounds on a guy, Eowyn destroys him and all of his friends. <br />
<br />
While this sounds really good, and is especially combined with all of the healing in the deck (Nenya, Shadow Between, Aragorn, Elrond) there are hitches in the plan. You need some way around wound prevention such as Polearms and High Vantage and even Broad Bladed Sword. Hence, all the extra companions in there specifically to take the lumps so that important people don&#39;t go splat when Eowyn can&#39;t go boom. <br />
<br />
I think the most controvestial choice was taking out Cirdan. The problem I had was, in trimming the deck smaller, I had to take out some of the Elven Events that made him powerful. Also, I lot of the time Galadriel dies and then I have a companion thats not immediatly playable. At first I took Cirdan out for Gandalf FOTS, but at the suggestion of a certain Mr. Mascola Faramir went in. Faramir helps, along with Arrow Slits, to make Easterlings very winnable.<br />
<br />
Eomer makes it in as he is another Rohan dude for the Slits and he&#39;s pretty good vs. Enduring Minions, which seem to be relatively popular. Aragorn is insanely useful, besides being a 9 strength companion he moves a wound every turn, making Eowyn/Legs even more sickening. Radagast is pretty self explanitory, if you cannot triple move you cannot win. Sam is a must.<br />
<br />
Gimli&#39;s Axe seems like a natural, as his &quot;drawback&quot; makes sure that whenever GImli fights, he&#39;ll be 11 strength and kill what he beats.<br />
<br />
First turn for this deck generally consists of bidding Zero, pulling Nenya, playing whatever you&#39;ve got and moving to 3. There is very little set-up involved, with ELrond being the only truly &quot;empty&quot; pool that the deck gives. <br />
<br />
The shadow is a twist on Besiegers, trying to pull out a bomb combined with Din of Arms at site 5, 7 or 9. Site 9 guarantees the 3 threats to pull 3 guys with TMC. There is some strategy involved, but basically you want 2 Keepers and either an Agitator or a Swarm stacked when they move to 9. The Swarm obviously is busted against large fellowship, while the Agitator can pull back an important Engine (usually Tower Walkway) to finish them. <br />
<br />
Orc Captain gives some hand extension, and is surprisingly good. <br />
<br />
Trolls would be nice, but 34 cards is as big as I want it. <br />
<br />
I guess thats about all for now, enoy.<br />
