Today, the reigning Empire remains at war with various rebel factions, causing unrest among the related parties. Nonetheless, the world is striving successfully to rebuild itself from the perils of War.<br />
<br />
However, the Empire has grown curious and power-hungry for the ancient power known only as &quot;magic&quot;. Their leader and a slightly insane general crave this power, and are willing to destroy anything that comes in their way. With the finding of an ancient Esper, a seemingly vital source of &quot;magic&quot;, the Empire is poised to take full control of this mysterious power.<br />
<br />
Several warriors, from all walks of life, must band together despite their differences in order to save the world from one who would conquer it, and who would destroy it.&quot;<i><br />

Locke, womanizer and thief-extrodinaire, promises the girl to take care of her and escorts Terra to Edgar, spear-wielding, Warrior King of Figaro. The Empire is desperately searching for Terra and moves to Figaro. Forced to flee, Edgar, Locke and Terra, with the help of Edgar&#39;s brother Sabin, seek the aid of the Returners leader, Banon. Kefka, agent of the Empire, and his soldiers are relentless with their pursuit, forcing the team down the Lete River. It is here that the vile creature, Ultros, first appears and disbands the party.<br />
<br /><br />
Sabin gets taken by the current during the battle and floats down the river, alone. Locke, the stealthy thief, splits from the remaining group who travel back to Narshe. Locke, the sly dog, steals a merchants clothes, leaving him in nothing but his B-day suit and sneaks into a town controlled by the Empire. He meets up with another young woman, Celes, an ex-General of the Empire. Meanwhile, Sabin unites with a ninja, Shadow, and Cyan, Keeper of Doma and the three travel through a haunted land and ride a Phantom Train. Washed down the river, they find Gau, a creature-child, who offers to guide them out of the veldt...<br />
<br /><br />
Once everyone has regrouped, the truth behind the ancient powers of magic surface and we learn the evil intent of Emperor Gestahl and his cohort, Kefka. Tricked by the Empire, Terra and Locke travel to Thamasa, where Strago, last of the Mages of Old, joins the quest to stop the evil power-hungry maniacs of the Empire.<br />
<br /><br />
It is on the floating continent, where the Ancient Statues of the Gods have been recovered that the fate of the world will be decided. Only by destroying the Atma Weapon can you stop Kefka and this madness.<br />
<br /><br />
*notes on deck vs. game accuracy:<br />
<br /><br />
1. 4x Ultros (you fight him 4 times) <br />
2. 2x Chadarnook Demon (not only does the demon look like a wraith but it fights as two forms so thats why there&#39;s 2x... the other form it fights as is a woman tho if u remember... that doesnt look very much like a wraith does it precious?)<br />
3. Balrog makes a good Ifrit<br />
4. Evil Smelling Fens ="World of Ruin" (When Kefka scorches the earth)<br />
5. Cantea = MagiMaster (When u fight this guy, you&#39;re in the magic tower, so ur weapons are no good)<br />
6. Lemenya = Siegfried (Siegfried looks like a wraith, but only has 100HP when u fight him so I had to pick the weakest rare Naz)<br />
7. Tower Assassin = Steriodite (small resemblance)<br />
8. Plus all the obvious similarities from the story... hope u enjoy!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
