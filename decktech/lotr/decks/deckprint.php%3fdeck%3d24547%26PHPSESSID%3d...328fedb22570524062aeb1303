Once you get His Cruelty and Malice out, you can exert all of your orcs to exhaustion to overturn a card from your opponets draw deck.  A Morgul Hunter wins a skirmish, thats 3 cards you overturn. Orc Inquisitors and Tower Liutenants get cards out of your opponets hand, as well as the Towers of Barad-dur when your opponet moves. Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to get all the sleeps and Secret Sentinels out of their hands or out of their draw decks before they can use them. There are no trackers, but usually opponets play a lot of allies, so Our lists of Allies Grows Thin give you the extra pool so you can play more orcs. Sites 7 and 8 are the only sites you have to worry about versatility if you get behind, and at 7 they wont die to archery.<br />
<br />
Every member of the fellowship has the Gandalf signet except for the grey wizard himself. I only need 3 for Trust me as you once did, but most of them fit in well.  Arwen is a beast with 3 site 3 allies out, and I play with all of them except Silinde.  Legolas is good against nazgul, the deck doesnt use much archery, and with the knives and bow he is good against orcs and urak-hai. Gimli wins skirmishes on his own or with help from gandalf, and then nobody tosses a dwarf helps take cards off of your opponets draw deck.  Aragorn is just in there to take on a lot of minions in the late game. The fellowship can run, and win skirmishes, and as you move to the last couple of sites, your opponet probably will not have many, if any, cards left to throw at you.  There really isn&#39;t a bad matchup for the fellowship if you have Gandalf and Trust me as you once did out. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
