I added a few cards from MoM, and also changed a few card counts around, etc. Heres what changed, and how I play it.<br />
<br />
At the start of the game, bid about 5 or so. You more than likely will win, and if not, they are more than likely playing Green Dragon Inn as well, so either way your plan is uauslly the same. 1st turn pull Sam and remove 3 burdens. Between sites 1-3, where against everything but Nazgul you won&#39;t need to heal any wounds, use Aragorn to heal Sam, and get the rest of the burdens off. <br />
<br />
Free People Startegy<br />
<br />
For the free peoples half start Arwen and Legolas. You will probably draw an Aragorn by the time you get to site 3, and you really should not need him before then. Either way, play him as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
The only thing this deck got from Mom is the new Frodo, and the only reason I have him is because of the signet, and No Mere Ranger. No Mere Ranger is almost a Servant of the Secret Fire for Aragorn. Everybody but Legolas has the Aragorn signet, and if you plan on playing more than 60 cards, I&#39;d probably throw a couple more of these into the deck. With Choice of Luthien out, it really doesn&#39;t have much of a drawback. <br />
<br />
One of the main changes to the deck was not including Elrond. I decided not to put him in because I really wanted to play 3 Gwemegils, and those are usually enough to make sure I see the cards I want to see. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can add about playing the deck is to be careful when going through site 5. Always try to have Aragorn with no maore than 1 wound, and a fully healed Arwen. Otherwise, the Balrog is taking somebody with him. Sam is a good to sacrafice here as well. PATHS will come in mighty handy at the bridge a lot of times as well. Make it through the bridge and all will be well.<br />
<br />
A lot of people may be concerned about the new minions that cancel ARV, but I would be more concerned about Spies of Saruman if I were them.<br />
<br />
Shadow Stratgy<br />
<br />
The shadow deck got a few more cards from MoM than the Free Peoples half. Mainly Uruk Capt. He is pretty friggin good. He makes it where you don&#39;t need as many Lurtz, and is pretty bruatl at site 9 as well, and pretty good everywher else. <br />
<br />
It may seem that 1 Uruk Scout is not enough to matter, but when combined with the 2 spies, it usually means I have 3 cards to help fight ARV, plus that card has not been as popular here lately as it was in the past. <br />
<br />
I play the Shaman over the Fighter for additional archery/ARV defense as well.<br />
<br />
The last new card in the deck is Hollin, the new site 4. It is obviously good for this deck. <br />
<br />
As for old cards, Savagery and Ambition are both still amazing cards, and I still feel that Spies is among the best cards in the game.<br />
<br />
As a final note, it may be a good idea to drop the 2 shamans for 2 Tower Assassins if Allies are huge in your area (i.e. mirror decks, elrond, ottar, stuff like that.) In fact if I was going to play this deck in an environment I wasn&#39;t sure about, I&#39;d add two just to be safe. The shaman is just better in my area. <br />
<br />
Comments welcome,<br />
Thanks for looking,<br />
