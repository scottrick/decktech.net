Instead of Legolas and Gimli, why not use the bigger Rohan guys who work pretty well with Gandalf... so you lose a few Gandalf signets?  You make up for one with Gandalf being one, and you should have him and Aragorn out with Frodo all the time anyways...  The Rohan companions allow the use of mounts which are very powerful.<br />
<br />
I chose to go w/ 9 companions because with the big Uruk-hai that are around now, I would much rather feed them someone than have one of my main fighters die.  The mains in the deck are Gandalf, Aragorn, Theoden and Eomer w/ Eowyn being in for Enquea protection and Faramir for Easterling burden protection.  Boromir is a strong Gandalf signet so he finds his way in, and Greenleaf still deserves to be in almost every deck.<br />
<br />
Rather than use sleep and discard my conditions, I chose to go with Fortress never fallen, because a) it gets out of your hand right away b) doesn&#39;t require exertions on Gandalf and c) because my Rohan guys (Eomer especially) will be winning their skirmishes so tokens will stack up quick.  Hearken to me is too good not to use in a Gandalf/Rohan deck.<br />
<br />
Simblemyne is a good way to get out the one piece you need to start double moving, and is too versatile not to use.<br />
<br />
For the possessions I decided to go w/ Brego and the new sword for Aragorn.  I find this is a great anti-uruk strategy...  Shadowfax is in because it is not a hand weapon, so Cantea has no effect.  The Rohan ones are obvious as is Sting.  I want to keep my companions below 3 cards on them, to avoid Grima... obviously he can still get you, but he&#39;ll have to play a condition to do it.<br />
<br />
For the shadow side we want to take control of sites, stack on them, and then set up the Dunland bomb at about site 8 or 9.  The Hill Chief draws you a couple of cards and is good at 10 strength and 2 vitality, Wulf helps w/ site control.  Hillman Horde is THE guy in Dunland.  The Looters and Rabble stack and come back later for much cheaper while Ransackers and Tribes control sites.  I only use 1 Saruman because he doesn&#39;t fight, and I can play him twice a game with only one in my deck.<br />
<br />
For the conditions I use only 1 of each because site control isn&#39;t 100% reliable, so I don&#39;t want to waste space on cards that really only key off site control.  Constantly Threatening is a good card, but if you need to use it, it&#39;s usually just better to stack minions in your hand for next turn.<br />
<br />
Burn every village is a +4 boost if you control a site, which is a companion or two in the course of the game if they aren&#39;t careful.<br />
<br />
Hides is a must as is War Club.  The best thing about War Club is it&#39;s price!<br />
<br />
Overall Strategy:<br />
<br />
Bid 1 and go second if you have the choice.  This gets your sites out, and thus helps you do some good early damage.  Try and Keep the site control guys for your second turn.  I realize going second hurts the site control, but Dunland takes control of sites very quickly, so against an Uruk site control deck, I believe you still have the advantage.  All you really need is one or two sites and you are set.<br />
<br />
If they stop at 2, you stop at 2... If you are barely set up at all, stop at 2... Other than that, you should try and bust a move past them later in the game.  Once set up, nothing should stop or slow you down except maybe a Saruman and some Troops.  <br />
