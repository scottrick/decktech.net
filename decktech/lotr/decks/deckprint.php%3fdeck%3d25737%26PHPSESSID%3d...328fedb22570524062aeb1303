<br />
The Fellowship is pretty much a solid 6 companions, which will get your @$$ beaten down by Enquea, so letting Arwen or Legolas die off early can be a good thing.  Aragorn and Gandalf provide the usual solid power with Boromir and even Arwen to back him up.  Aragorn, Boromir and Gandalf w/ weapons and possibly Last Alliance force any Uruk deck to spit out pumps just to win skirmishes, and with the size and strengths of the fellowship, Moria swarms won&#39;t bother you too much.  Sauron will have trouble putting enough wounds on your big characters and Nazgul doesn&#39;t have a chance against the huge companions w/ Trust to back them up.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
3 Boromir, 3 Aragorn, 3 Gandalf:  This deck concentrates on each companion equally, and thus it makes it hard for a shadow deck to hurt you by focusing on any of them.  These three together prove an unstoppable force.<br />
Gimli, Son of Gloin: The Throw away companion that lasts a couple moves... He is also a 4th Gandalf signet (just in case) not to mention makes Gandalf strength +1.<br />
Sam, Son of Hamfast: Because going first wins games, sometimes your shadow will just not do anything to someone, so it&#39;s nice to be able to still control the game when your shadow is doing nothing for you.<br />
Albert Dreary: Fights Moria, and w/ Elrond he can wipe out pretty much every condition they have... oh yeah, he also gets rid of Ambitions... and oh yeah... he can come to die w/ the horn when required.<br />
Elrond: Heals companions, Heals himself, and comes to fight when requested.<br />
Galadriel: Heals companions, and gets your site 6 and 7 if she&#39;s out.  7 is most important, but if you lose your allies, it won&#39;t hurt you too much.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t decide between either one.  On one hand you have a solid Uruk deck, that half of you play, and on the other hand you have the suprisingly effective Isengard Orcs.  Right now my choice is the Orcs mostly because fewer people play them, and because the amount of Uruk hate is almost disgusting... I mean, 3 Armors in a deck not to mention some people are playing Foul Creation!?!?<br />
<br />
The Orcs are susceptible to sting, but Armor is wasted against them, Trapped and Alone can neutralize weapons damage bonuses (although that is not a focus here) and their boosters don&#39;t quite match Uruk-hai boosters, but nobody treats them as a big factor, that&#39;s why they can be.<br />
<br />
Shadow A:<br />
<br />
This shadow wins games by putting the opponent to endless decisions, your job is to make them pay for every single wrong decision they make.  The key card is Wizard Storm.  Yes, there are only two, but you will save them for the right time.  If you play one crappy minion and a Wizard storm at a point where your opponent SHOULD double move, you have done your job.  Most people will stop to avoid it&#39;s effect, but if they move through it you hammer them.  Not convinced?  Exerting every single companion once is bound to really screw you down the line... and no Orc can do that kind of damage.  You win directly by eventually cleaning out the fellowship because of that double move, or you win the race because they couldn&#39;t keep up.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
2 Smiths:  Personally I don&#39;t find this guy all that good, but the thing is a lot of people hate this guy and will do CRAZY things just to make sure he doesn&#39;t take away those precious weapons.  He doesn&#39;t fit that well into this deck theme, but he causes a stir.<br />
4 Isengard Warriors:  No special archery actions! No Gondor Bowman, no Splendor, and best yet, no Greenleaf or Aragorn&#39;s Bow.  But it&#39;s the regroup ability that has me sold.  With 4 of this guy in my deck I WANT you to use Sting and take extra wounds on Frodo.<br />
Isengard Shaman:  A Good suprise... If you get a bad draw and only have this guy and say an overseer or smith, just use this guy&#39;s ability to make sure you get to use the Overseer&#39;s text.<br />
Trapped and Alone: absolutely brutal against decks with no condition removal (i.e. choke decks which coincidentally hurt all Isengard races)<br />
2 Wizards Storms:  yes, I know I said this deck was ALL ABOUT the wizard storm, but more than 2 is just overkill, not to mention will prevent you from dropping minions in many cases.<br />
One of you Must Do this:  I haven&#39;t really played Isengard Orcs a lot, but I haven&#39;t seen this card used in many Isengard Decks... I think this card is great, because you can use it with any orc, and it really hurts superfellowships and your average Gandalf deck.<br />
Balrog: Always... well almost always :) wins skirmishes.  For emergency only!<br />
<br />
Shadow B:<br />
<br />
Well, this is just solid... it&#39;s used by many because it is so solid.  Saruman can stop you just by shear intimidation, so 4 is necessary.  Even choke decks will get stopped just by playing Saruman.  Ravagers are great w/ Saruman, and pretty good Uruks as it is.  Troop is the best non-unique minion in the game, and if you don&#39;t agree name one better...  Captain and Lieutenants are great supporting cast, and Lurtz is always fun to play.<br />
<br />
The only surprise (well maybe) is the Tower Assassin, whose soul mission in life is to tell Filibert Bolger to pi$$ off.  Beyond the Height of Men is stylin against most choke decks (unless of course they pack the pre-explained 3 Armors).  Lurtz&#39; Battle Cry is always great to play just to see the look on someone&#39;s face... and Power is a requirement in today&#39;s condition heavy game.<br />
<br />
I understand that this shadow shows no signs of creativity, but you can&#39;t deny it&#39;s gosh darnit good.<br />
<br />
Well, tell me what you think.  Which shadow would you play with?  What do you think about Gimli, Son of Gloin in this deck?  What one card in the fellowship is most expendable (besides Gimli)? (I can go down to 30 in either shadow quite easily)  And most importantly... rate my last deck while you aren&#39;t busy (&quot;Moria is Back&quot;) because I love that gosh darnit deck and it&#39;s gotten no reviews in a week : ( </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
