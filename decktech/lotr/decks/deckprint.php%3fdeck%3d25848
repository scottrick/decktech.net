<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
the basic idea behind the fellowship is to give them very little twilight, so the minions you hafta face are easily killed by aragorn (and sometimes frodo, who can be a pumped 10 power).  then, on the double-move, play a deft in their movements to ensure that you wont face anything.  my favorite example of this is as follows: at site 3, you&#39;re all set up.  you have aragorn, sam, frodo, and gimli, as well as talent for not being seen, bill the pony, and no strangers.  move to site 4, giving the opponent just 4 twilight.  after mopping up anything he plays (and sometimes using dinendal to soak up any extra twilight left over), play deft and double to the bridge, giving the opponent just 4 twilight!  deft makes the site -2, gimli makes underground sites -2, and talent, no strangers, and bill round out to -3, effectively canceling the twilight number of the site.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
card choices:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
galadriel: plays for only 3 (play her at the council courtyard to consternate your opponent), and then plays the rest of your elves for free.  plus she heals automatically, and has 3 vitality for secret sentinels.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
2x Aragorn&#39;s bow, armor, and flaming brand?  its extremely important to get these out early to avoid being killed by cheap uruk-hai.  once aragorn is pumped, you generally dont hafta worry about uruks, since their hand will be clogged with saruman and troops (almost unplayable until sites 8 or 9).  <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
A Promise:  if you dont like it, replace it with gondor bowmen or something.  its frodo protection at its best.  it plays for free, thus helping the deck cycle well, and it boosts frodo and sam, who are generally weak.  unfortunately, its susceptible to saruman&#39;s power.  but then again, every condition is.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Bounder/Frying pan: moria is one of the only shadows with a chance against this deck, and so hobbit overwhelming protection is needed.  frying pan kills orcs left and right.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Why Song of Durin and not a 4th secret sentinels?  cause its fellowship phase discarding.  a bunch of moria scouts/goblin runners/goblin scavengers stacked on goblin swarms?  discard it before he can play them.  then secret sentinels his armories.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
no hobbit stealths/intuitions/PATHS????  no room.  if you constantly face moria, then add 4x PATHS instead of the A Promises.  but stealths and PATHS just sit in your hand until used, prohibiting good cycling.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
other cards you may consider: gondor bowmen, shards of narsil, orophin, banner of the white tree, valiant man of the west, mithril coat.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Shadow:  while the opponent is cursing cause he&#39;s holding 2 troops and a saruman but doesnt have enough twilight to play them, swarm the heck out of his fellowship.  this shadow is good.  it has an answer for everything.  the opponent playing song of durin?  use goblin warriors to get rid of it.  big gandalf fellowship with 5+ companions?  use enquea to slice it down.  oops, did you already discard enquea early?  use nertea to pull him back out.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
card choices:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
no cave troll&#39;s hammer??  any good moria player knows that its not worth it.  armor prevents it from working, and that +3 usually wont help the troll overwhelm frodo, since frodo usually has mithril coat to stomp out the weapons bonuses.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
instead, i use the cave troll&#39;s chain.  make the opponent think twice about letting archery fly.  plus, the +2 to strength gets around mithril coat and boromir&#39;s shield (like anyone plays the shield though).<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
goblin flankers/moria axe: its a non-fierce balrog.  exert him twice and he&#39;s 17 power, damage +1.  ouch.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
Guard commander: i love this guy.  he once won me the game at site nine.  plus, people alway forget about his game text.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
goblin scrabbler: get rid of that annoying tale of gilgalad, or splendor of their banners, or all those other annoying elven conditions.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
goblin warrior:  byebye thrarin!  or get rid of song of durin.  or golden light on the land...oh wait, no one plays that.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
everything else is pretty much self-explanatory, and if you have questions, d-mail me and i&#39;ll be glad to talk strategy or describe actual game scenarios this deck has been in and won.  like pathfinder-ing my own site 7 (skip archery phase) against an excellent moria player, which nearly killed me, but won me the game cause my galadriel wasnt discarded so she could secret sentinels away armories.  ah the memories.<br>
