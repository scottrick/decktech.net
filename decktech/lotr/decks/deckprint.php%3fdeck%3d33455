<br />
darnit.<br />
<br />
THEY ARE!<br />
<br />
The fellowship should be pretty self explanitory, you choke pretty well, build up 2 very beefy ringbearers and use Galadriel to keep conditions and possessions in check. The fellowship is well teched against Easterlings with Nine Fingered Frodo, Frodo&#39;s Cloak and 2 Phials. The only bad matchup for the fellowship is Besiegers, since the Gorgoroth Assassins will likely kill of Galads and Merry ASAP, with Pippin soon to follow. I think if I played it again, the CtFF should switch to Stand Against Darkness, just for the hell of it. <br />
<br />
Frodo, RA - add to the choke<br />
Sam, GEW - beefy sam!<br />
Merry, FtS - is there another merry?<br />
Pippin, FtF - makes it so a Saruman;s Power doesn&#39;t completely ruin your day.<br />
Galads - duh<br />
<br />
The Shadow is the new thing, so more on it.<br />
<br />
The idea would be use Seasoned Curlies on a Lord or Elite Archer to exhaust the fighters, then noone can fight yer giant Mumak Riders. Of course, Vilya can cause some problems and directed archery/wounding can stop the beastliness of your Enduring monstrous guys.<br />
<br />
High Vantage is the key card, it makes Elf.Eowyn less scary, since Greenleaf doesn&#39;t do anything and you can exhaust Eowyn. It also makes 5 vitality Legs easier to play with. Ships of Great Draught cycles like a monster and allows you to restack High Vantage in the matchups where you need it.<br />
<br />
SOuthron Fighter and Veterans - these guys give you another place to put the Curlies AND dole out a ton of wounds in the right circumstances. <br />
<br />
Field of the Fallen often wins the game by it;self once someone dies.<br />
<br />
Pulling back Bold Men and Grim with Curlies is tech.<br />
<br />
Good Fun.<br />
