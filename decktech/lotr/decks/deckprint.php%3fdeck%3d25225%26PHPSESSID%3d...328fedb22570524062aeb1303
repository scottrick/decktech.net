<br />
The story begins in Bree, with 6 Dwarves, and Two Hobbits.<br />
<br />
 ".....So then the bartender says..."  <br />
<br />
"Oh will you shutup Fror?  I&#39;ve had to listen to that dumb joke all year long.!"  Gimli screamed in agony at his kinsman.  "It&#39;s bad enough I&#39;ve left all my possesions, such as my helm and axe at home.  We&#39;re still not any closer to Mordor to drop the ring off either."<br />
<br />
"So?" Fror said, "I might as well tell Farin the joke anyway, he hasn&#39;t heard it."  <br />
<br />
Gimli, Farin, Fror, Thrarin, and Grimir, along with a friend from Moria who Guarded the gates from Orcs (And was fired for obvious reasons), were off on a task to destroy the One Ring with Frodo and Sam.  <br />
<br />
But what&#39;s this?  They have almost no updated weapons or helpful plans to aid them along the way!  OH NO!  Sam and Frodo had lost Aragorn, and Legolas in a poker game at the Prancing Pony.  Sam learned a valuable lesson.  You have to know how to play poker if you wish to win.  <br />
<br />
"This is all that stupid, fat hobbit&#39;s fault!"  Screamed Thrarin.  "If it wasn&#39;t for him, we&#39;d have an excellent ranger to guide us, and an elf to defend us.  It&#39;s times like these that make you want to cook him for dinner."<br />
<br />
Frodo noticed Farin trying to pick-pocket him.<br />
<br />
"What are you doing?!?!"  Frodo exclaimed.<br />
<br />
"Oh, Mr. Baggins, I&#39;m marrying someone next week, and the misses said she doesn&#39;t want and Onion Ring from Burger King as a wedding band again."<br />
<br />
All of this arguing wasn&#39;t getting them anywhere.  In fact, they were still in Bree.  Frodo had decided to walk ahead, and the Dwarves trotted behind him.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Gimli had an idea.  "Young master hobbits, I have a proposition for you.  It&#39;s quite clear we are without and means of defeatng Orcish armies by ourselves, what if I use summoning spells to get our own Orcish army to fight for us?  I know such spells as Delving, Beneath the Mountains, Welath of Moria, and we can use Grimir to help us, since he has turned to the black arts..."<br />
<br />
"..have not..."<br />
<br />
"Quiet.  Well?  What do you say?  My Dwarf companions will equip ourselves with Axes, Armor, and Blade definers crafted by the Lord of Moria himself.  Me, Farin, Fror, and his friend will guard you for as long as it takes to destroy our opponents."<br />
<br />
It sounds fine," Frodo said, "but how do you intend to summon our orcs wit the many roaming penalties on cell pho..I mean, spells these days?"<br />
<br />
"Ahh, Mr. Baggins, I thought of that.  All I have to do is summon a Tracker, and after that, you can play as many orcs as you want with a lower roaming charge.  It may be so, that we only have one token in the pool of spells...."<br />
<br />
Grimir broke in, "You can&#39;t get much for 1 twilight token these days.  So just dial O-r-c-a-m-b-u-s-h-e-r, and get all of your minions for only $.99...I mean, one cheaper, and two cheaper after that for up to two Trackers."<br />
<br />
Frodo notced Sam lying in a ditch motionless.<br />
<br />
Sam had just died of a heart attack from the uncooked bacon he ate, so it was time to throw the plan into action......They buried him in a corn field next to a blind man&#39;s house.  But Farin was hungry, and decided to dig Sam up.  Since there was obviously no avoiding the event of digesting Sam, they had to choose whether to boil, broil, microwave, bake, shake, stir, bread, and what not, to Sam.  Rock over scissors, bake won.<br />
<br />
After everyone was well fed, they were off to start the plan.<br />
<br />
Well, as you might have guessed, it failed miserably.<br />
<br />
Gimli slipped on a rock climbing up the moutains and cracked his head open without his helmet.  Fror&#39;s axe broke during a battle, and the minions took him prisoner and tortured him for 17 weeks until he died from chickenpox.  Farin got into a fight with the Dwarf Guard, and they argued for days until Frodo couldn&#39;t stand it any longer and payed Gandalf to do a mob hit.  They were found in the Anduin River two days later full of staff bruises.  Grimir and Thrarin died in a freak summoning accident. Grimir had summoned a Tracker, and Thrarin was testing his new Hand Axe, Dwarven Axe, weapon combo in the mountains, when the Tracker came down, saw the axes and was infuriated.  Grimir tried to stop him, but the blood was getting into his eyes and he fell off the cliff 13,095 feet.  No one knows where his left foot and two arms are.<br />
<br />
So, to end the story, all of the Orcs had a party at Studio 54 and splurged on a 45 month killing spree of all the people in Middle-Earth.  As an end, it would be silly to let all of the orcs run rampant while Aragorn and Gandalf still draw breath.  VERY silly.<br />
<br />
Aragorn the judge walked towards his booth while Gandalf sat nervously in the sitness chair.  <br />
<br />
"Will the defendants please rise?"  Judge Aragorn askd, and the orcs stood up and growled with anger, and started running towards the stands.  Gandalf gasped, grabbed his stick, but tragically suffered a heart attack and fell to the ground in a stiff, white, clump.<br />
<br />
Aragorn was shuffling through papers, eyeing the orcs assailent reports.  <br />
<br />
"...now I believe it says here that you..."  Aragorn glanced upwards and was shocked to see Gandalf being torn to pieces and 40,000 orcs run towards him.<br />
<br />
"OH MY GOD!!! WHAT THE..."  The orcs destroyed him, and amongst the screams, you could hear the orcs laughing and hollering.  "OH NOOO!!!  Get OFeasterlingGHGHGHH <br />
<br />
The End.<br />
<br />
Editor&#39;s Note:  This isn&#39;t really a deck I want reviewed for winning purposes.  I just fancied writing a story about how crappy Dwarf decks are and did&#39;t know where to post it.  Thanx.<br />
