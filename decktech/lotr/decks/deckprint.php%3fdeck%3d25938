<br />
<br />
Okay heres my deck that I’ve been working on for some time I finally put it together through many tests and I think I finally have it down. I wanted to make the Shadow side first and I couldn’t find a fellowship that could compensate for the fast discarding/drawing of the Moria and to make it worthwhile… A Friend of mine Wilson always plays Hobbits and had a deck that I liked, and since Hobbits work well with a lot of card cycling I thought I’d put it together.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
So a friend of mine Gabe and I get together and make the deck… after trying it we take out 10 cards, yes 10 to make it what it is now… I still think a few more can come out and that will make it a little smaller but I don’t know just yet so I will leave it as it is until I decide otherwise.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
So some choice of cards as your probably wondering…The obvious hobbit allies to heal the companions and the obvious stealths to get past the big beasties… but I couldn’t think of anything else to make it work… then I remember A Promise… ah right make Sam and Frodo bigger, badder and better… so I decided to throw them in as well<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The rest of the cards in the fellowship half of the deck are just simple and plain useful cards. Oh, I’m going to add Thror’s Map because I can make that work as well. The only other cards that are there are Legolas, Greenleaf, Aragorn, Ranger of the North and Boromir, Son of Denethor. Their in there for sacrifice, which if you read my report you’ll see how handy that was… Legolas for site 4-5, drop, plink sacrifice. Aragorn for site 7-8 for defender +1 and sacrificing and finally Boromir, he can hang out for a while because he makes my hobbits stronger.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Now your probably wondering why there’s no Bilbo Baggins in the deck, he was originally in the deck, but he got cut, along with him there was Stone Trolls as well for more beef, but they just didn’t make the cut in the end… and it still works as well without Bilbo. I tried it both ways and this way works better.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
As for the shadow side, well it’s all about Dark Places. If you don’t know what that does then here’s the game text for that card:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Dark Places<br />
<br><br />
Deploy 1, Condition<br />
<br><br />
Plays to your support area.<br />
<br><br />
Each unique [Moria] minion is strength +1<br />
<br><br />
Shadow: Spot an opponent’s site to replace it with your marsh or underground site of the same number.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The whole premise of the deck is to get 3 or 4 of them out and then have your Unique Goblins strength +3….w/the Chieftan he can be HUGE… ever see a Strength 21 Ancient Chieftan… it’s amazing what he can do to Gandalf. :) <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The basis oeasterlingoblin deck is the same premise as mine Relics for weapons, Armories for twilight, weapons for well strength increase, Swarms for keeping my guys around a lot longer, They Are Coming to get more Goblins.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Essentially, dump weapons, get them with Relics or Scavengers… put them on Unique guys and make them work…as for the deck itself it’s main enemy is of course Sleep, but a lot of people stop using that. As for Secret Sentinels, well most people usually take Swarms, Relics, They Are Coming or Goblin Armories… not the Places… but hey if they don’t then my dudes get a little more stronger and that’s always good.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
As for the Nazgul, well their there for killing weapons and being fierce and well just there for beating someone down when they least expect it.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Well enjoy and let me know what you think.<br />
<br><br />
Thanks,<br />
