<br />
I think this fellowship is well suited for just about every opponent:<br />
<br />
Swarm Decks:<br />
Glamdring & Sting along with No Stranger to the Shadows should give them less to work with for twilight, and aimed archery will make it pretty hard to swarm.  The Bow of Galadrahim is in here for this exact reason.  Any good swarm will most likely include a couple Goblin Scouts, the Elf Killer.  It&#39;s especially annoying when you have to assign Legolas to this guy and take a wound from such a weak minion.  The bow not only helps him win, but you can take out another Scavenger with his trusty Scimitar.  Feeding the Balrog shouldn&#39;t be a problem because Sam&#39;s sour taste, and Aragorn/Boromir&#39;s armor should leave him in need of TUMS.  <br />
<br />
Uruk beatdown:<br />
Armor as well as Aragorn, Gandalf and Boromir on steroids should be enough to make your opponent want to cry.  Spies of Sauraman could really be a problem though, so don&#39;t rely on ARV/archery too much...<br />
<br />
Nazgul:<br />
Once again, beefed up Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir, and now Arwen help, and Athelas gets rid of blade tips/black breaths.  ARV and Archery can really piss them off too...<br />
<br />
Sauron:<br />
Probably my biggest weakness due to my lack of condition removal and healing, but &#39;round here, not many play Sauron, so the worry is a lot less.  Exert to wound orcs are easily contained by archery and tough companions, but discard decks could do some damage here.<br />
<br />
One last note on the fellowship:<br />
The Elrond / Boromir&#39;s Horn combo is really the only thing in this deck that you haven&#39;t seen a million times.  I like it because it gives me one more fighter if I need it, or one guy to take a massive hit if needed, example: I am at site 5 with no armors, and no power-ups for either aragorn or boromir and don&#39;t want to lose either, bring in Elrond.  Although this situation is unlikely, it is a good back-up plan.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
ADD BURDENS, and then exploit them like MAD!<br />
Relentless Charge beats out Hate any day of the week unless they are playing Dwarfs, and if they are, your orc bowmen and exert to kill orcs are going to be that much more effective...  You want your opponents to fight, and fight often. <br />
Winning skirmishes doesn&#39;t matter, as long as you do some serious burdening and direct damage to slow them down.<br />
<br />
Overall, your Shadow side could win you the game, but it will probably just slow the opponent down for your fellowship to win it for you.<br />
<br />
Move 1-3, 3-4, 4-6, and then depending on how your opponent is doing, single or double move as required.  <br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
Why no PATHS?  Simple, I don&#39;t have it.  If I did, at least one would be in here.<br />
Why no HATE?  Once again, I don&#39;t have it, but I think Relentless Charge is just as good if not better.  Most people play Aragorn&#39;s Bow, and he is usually a great choice to wound, because probably 75% of decks out there are centred on him.  Wounding Legolas is always huge, because he&#39;s really only good for archery against you, and archery can be a problem.  Against most decks, you will be against at least 2 archers, possibly 3 or 4 with their bow possesions.  Exerting a vitality 3 nazgul to wound all of them can sure kick hiney over exerting a vitality 2, exert to wound Sauron orc.  But hey, that&#39;s for you to decide.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading my deck...  hope to hear some feedback!<br />
