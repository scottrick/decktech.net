Don&#39;t go judging it because of that. In game play and tourney play this deck has only lost 3 times out of many. <br />
Starting start with gimli, merry, and pippen. I usually 4. This ensures me the get legolas out. I don&#39;t use the hunter because i found that he really did nothing to help this deck. this legolas is a game saver. The built in pump is great. He lets gimli do his wounds, and when gimli does his wounds aragorn&#39;s ability is that much better. After you get legolas play a aragorn if you draw one. The deck uses 4 to ensure i get one early.<br />
Around site 3 you should be all set up. Aragorn gimli, legolas, the hobbits should be out, and gimli or aragorn should have a weapon. now gimli and aragorn are just pumped and u get to wound minions every move phase. <br />
The great part of the hobbits  is knocked on the head. This card is the key to the deck breaking  or just walking to site 9. Its great because its a regroup. Now u discard them to cancel the skirmish, than regroup get than back, than u wound minions with aragorn. This is one of the most powerful parts of the deck. Also canceling skirmishes, Aragorn&#39;s gauntlets, escape and the hobbits ability&#39;s. They will run out of tokens soon enough. Also an other way to to keep gimlis strength way up is get gandalf to bring the hobbits back. There is many ways to wound minions in the deck, with quick as may be, legolas, cliffs, and just winning skirmishes. When in the skirmish phase, don&#39;t always think win win win skirmishes. Think how can i get the most minions off the table. Think about Aragorn&#39;s ability, how many hobbits are going to be left during move phase, and how many wounds are going to be dealt out. <br />
The best shadow side out there right now i think is the urik archery.. this deck has no problem with it. just put archery on aragorn the hobbits.. bring them back with knocked on the head... on other 3 wounds u can take. Also reveal aragorn to heal him. This deck has no problem with it. The urik that says hobbits cant be discarded is a pain but usually can be dealt with. Just use stealth or take a wound on aragorn or something... easily over come... regroup wound him so next site u can use hobbits again.<br />
Always thing of double moving this is how the deck wins, all it does is run to site nine. <br />
<br />
Now for the shadow. The shadow is very basic. Use hides to prevent the wounds. do what ever you can to take a site. The i usually get a site on site 5. I save a hillman tribe or wulf to that site. using the bumps or saruamn, i get the site. at site 6 play the no retreat make them double move= game over for them. Almost all the guys in the deck are fierce if they win, that&#39;s why there is no +4 fierce card. There is only 2 things against weapons in the deck. No defense is just huge. This card is great... and left over tokens put a token on there. or just save some for hides. Anyways other than than that the shadow is basic.<br />
<br />
As i said i have only lost 3 times, going 5-1 in last tourney coming 1. have fun with it </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
