*******STRATEGY EDIT*********<br>
<br>
The Ruling Ring is supposed to be Isildur&#39;s Bane<br>
And there are supposed to be 2 PATHS<br>
<br>
*********END EDIT************<br>
<br>
First of all, let me just say that this deck was designed to be a capable single player AND multi player deck.<br>
<br>
Some of the card choices in this deck may seem strange to you, but most of these cards were chosen so that I can have an extremely flexible start.  Because I believe that the start of the game is where over half the games are won or lost.<br>
<br>
Now, you might notice that I have Sam and Legolas listed as my start.  They are my default start.  If this deck works the way it is supposed to, they will comprise your opening fellowship.  However, you might also notice the lone copy of Aragorn, Ranger of the North.  In a particular, not ideal circumstance, the Ranger of the North will be your opening fellowship.  Let&#39;s start by looking at the bid.<br>
<br>
You start by bidding 5 (maybe 6).  You should go first.  However, bidding aggressively for suicide Sam is all the rage these days, so it is possible that you might tie or lose the bid.  If so, wait to see what your opponent&#39;s site 1 will be and respond to that.  If his site 1 is the Prancing Pony, Shire Lookout Point, Farmer Maggot Field, or Bag End, continue as planned (You should win most bids against these anyway), however if your opponent&#39;s Site 1 is the Green Dragon Inn, start Aragorn Ranger of the North, and then pull Sam.  Otherwise, with a standard opening fellowship, there are still 8 cards in your deck that can lead to your big heavy hitters.  You should have one of them out by site 4, and that&#39;s where the real threat begins.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you start your site 1.  Add a burden to play Aragorn, King In Exile.  And exert Sam twice (possibly 3 times) to remove burdens.  Aragorn will heal Sam at the start of each of your turns, so you should have no problem keeping Frodo unburdened (hence Isildur&#39;s Bane).<br>
<br>
Next, you get to play your hands.  You&#39;ll notice that there are only 2 Gandalf&#39;s in the deck...well that&#39;s all I have.  But that&#39;s okay.  It works.  A Wizard is never late pulls Gandalf, or it pulls Barliman, or it pulls Albert Dreary.  The AWINL makes the Gandalf portion more efficient.  Plus, if you really want to, you can use AWINL to pull Barliman, and then use Barliman to retrieve it, then use it again to pull Albert or Gandalf (you never know...it could be an effective strategy).  Anyway, you should have no trouble getting Gandalf out early...plus, you&#39;re playing Moria.  So, you should have an incredible throughput to get to those cards that you need.  Use Strength of Spirt and Servant of the Secret Fire to keep your fellowship almost completely untouched.  The Cave Troll with his hammer can be a pain, but in that situation is where Sam shines.  Sam flesh is a delicacy, so serve him up to their biggest minions in a pinch and keep the number of wounds you take to a bare minimum.  For the shadow side, it&#39;s a simple Moria swarm with some Cave Troll action to do some massive damage and slow the fellowship down.  The Goblin Armories are key, and they make for some nasty looking swarms towards the end of the path.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this deck is very reactive.  That&#39;s it&#39;s strength.  You should start the game, and you want to start the game to ensure Aragorn.  However, you would probably prefer to be behind and just keep pace with your opponent.  You should be able to stop your opponent with the shores of Nen Hithoel if you don&#39;t overwhelm them earlier.  So, I would suggest that you only move 1 site turn 1, try and lull your opponent into pulling ahead.  Then keep pace for the remainder of the game.  If you can&#39;t overwhelm.  Stop your opponent at site 8 and slingshot past him.  You win!<br>
<br>
Now let&#39;s look at my Adventure Path:<br>
<br>
Prancing Pony: You want Aragorn as soon as you can get him.<br>
<br>
Breeland Forest: There really is only one circumstance in which your opponent should beat you in the bid--if he has multiple hobbits.  Therefore, stealth events are a possibility.  Hence my site 2.  Otherwise, it never gets played.<br>
<br>
Rivendell Waterfall:  I&#39;m just trying to lull my opponent into pulling ahead of me and moving multiple times through Moria.  Under no circumstances should you ever use this text (well maybe if you&#39;ve used Glamdring or Sting and know something).<br>
<br>
Moria Stairway: I thought about the Mithrill Mines but with Scavengers there&#39;s a good chance that I have a weapon, so make the orcs damage +1.  It might deter my opponent from trying to double move.<br>
<br>
The Bridge:  Yeah, I know the Bridge sucks...but what can you do ;)<br>
<br>
Dimrill Dale:  Moria deck...nuff said.<br>
<br>
Anduin Wilderland:  I might have picked the wrong name.  It&#39;s supposed to be the site that makes every companion exert if there is no ranger.  I chose that site, because it won&#39;t hurt me, but it might hurt my opponent.<br>
<br>
Shores of Nen Hithoel:  If you can&#39;t get 5 orcs out by site 8, chalk it up to the LotR gods, because they&#39;ve just screwed you.<br>
<br>
Summit of Amon Hen:  More cards equals cake with a Moria deck.<br>
<br>
Cards I would like to add:<br>
<br>
I&#39;d like to add an Armor, perhaps another Athelas, and perhaps another Servant of the Secret Fire.  For the Shadow, I would like to add Ulaire Enquea or Orthanc Assassins/Troop of Uruk-hai.  Any of those three could do some serious damage in this deck.<br>
<br>
Quick multi-player strategy:  Multi-player games require a lot more skill and thinking than single-player games.  And again, the start of the game is where over half of the games are won and lost.  Pay attention.  Take your time to get your deck in order and watch for the people who lay their fellowship down.  You should know deck types, so if you see a fellowship that will start the Prancing Pony, bid aggressively and choose that person to go first.  Going first is a big disadvantage in a multi.  Then, you basically still get your start, and you&#39;re in a better position to win the multi-player game.  Outwit your opponents and you will win.<br>
<br>
All constructive criticisms are welcome.  If you try the deck out, I hope you enjoy!    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
