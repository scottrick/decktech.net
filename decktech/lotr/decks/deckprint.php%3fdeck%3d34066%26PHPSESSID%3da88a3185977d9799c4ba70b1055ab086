<br />
The fellowship is built around the new Pippin, Brave Decoy from Shadows, Aragorn ROTN and Borne Far Away. Other than three abovementioned cards it’s a pretty straightforward Gandalf-Gondor deck with Elendil as the main fighter with high strength and high vitality and Gandalf canceling skirmishes with his staff and sometimes even winning them and removing burdens with the new Glamdring. However, after double or triple move when things get really messy, it’s time to resort to Aragorn ROTN and Pippin. If the fellowship faces the number of minions too high too handle, it’s time to use Aragorn ROTN in maneuver phase and make him defender + how much is necessary. With Anduril he is able to take on up to five minions. After assigning minions on Aragorn, have Pippin replace him in the skirmish and die in his stead, so Aragorn can take one for the team in the fierce skirmish if there is one. <br />
<br /><br />
Ideally, you should have the following companions on the table: <br />
<br /><br />
-	Isildur, with the Ring, Scroll and two other artifacts on the table is resistance 11<br />
<br /><br />
-	Gandalf, with his Staff (and later Glamdring and/or Narya, only one is necessary against a non-corrupting shadow side, no need to tease Grima, W)<br />
<br /><br />
-	Elendil with Narsil, with strength of up to 15 and 5 vitality<br />
<br /><br />
-	Aragorn ROTN, with or without Anduril<br />
<br /><br />
-	Pippin<br />
<br /><br />
The rest of the companions are there to serve either as a fuel for Pippin’s and Aragorn’s comeback from the dead pile (use Borne Far Away to replace them with the dead Aragorn or Pippin), for the faster setup of the fellowship using Saved From the Fire, and to fulfill the 5th slot in the fellowship as contingency.<br />
<br /><br />
With a little help of Saved From the Fire and Borne Far Away, Radagast can make a move limit +2 or more if necessary.<br />
<br /><br />
Note: NEVER move with more than five companions on the table! You don’t want to get hit by Anduin Banks, E. Pillager or Enquea and you need to use the companions for the sacrificial purposes.<br />
<br /><br />
Bid zero, go second if able in order to play your sites.<br />
<br /><br />
Since you start with Aragorn, Strider and not Aragorn, ROTN, you should place Strider in your dead pile soon, either using Saved From the Fire if you have it in your opening hand or by letting the minions kill him. Ideal situation is having both Saved From the Fire and Borne Far Away in an early hand – than you can burn Aragorn, Strider to fetch Aragorn ROTN, Elendil and Boromir BoC, have Boromir replace Strider in your dead pile, play Aragorn ROTN, play Elendil and at the end of turn discard Strider. You have your fellowship set up, you’ve flooded the twilight pool, but thanks to Aragorn and Pippin you can survive the onslaught of  seven fierce minions (which of course in reality you won’t face).<br />
<br /><br />
Fellowship has sufficient possession, condition and burden removal, some wound prevention and high vitality companions. <br />
<br /><br />
Gandalf is crucial for the deck and if he died your chances of victory would be zero, however, with 2 copies of Staff to cancel skirmishes and add vitality, a copy of Narya for vitality he is very hard to kill. In addition, with Radagast in play you can use Borne Far Away to bring Gandalf back. The site Pinnacle of Zirakzigil is a God-given for this deck, so use it wisely and do not play it until Gandalf is killed. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The Shadow side has the ability both to swarm and to corrupt, but its additional strength is grinding the fellowship with wounds, with a little help from Gollum and Led Astray. Large fellowships will be forced to deal with Anduin Banks (archery total +2 for each companion over 4) up to four times in a game, while smaller fellowships will be running circles around the Neekerbreeker’s Bog, which exerts each companion with resistance less than 5. In order for Neekerbreeker’s Bog to work only two burdens need to be added against the majority of fellowships, and that’s a piece of cake for this deck. <br />
<br /><br />
As for the corruption part, four copies of Enquea, four copies of Keening Wail and four Morgul Brutes will have no trouble adding enough burdens to corrupt any alternative ringbearer and even Frodo if there is no efficient burden removal, but Brutes can efficiently turn burdens into wounds if corruption is infeasible.<br />
<br /><br />
Shadow side draws cards (Otsea, Ithil Stone), generates twilight (Black Marshal, Led Astray) and keeps the fellowship size in check (Anduin Banks, Led Astray, Cantea FTW), so swarming is a very good possibility.<br />
<br /><br />
The shadow also generates and utilizes threats very well, using 3 copies of Cantea FTW and 4 copies of Morgul Destroyer, discarding possessions and converting threats into wounds when appropriate.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The choice of sites is straightforward, primarily helping the Shadow side. Three 0-cost sites and three 1-cost sites are their to help the Shadow side due to their text (condition removal, playing minions from the discard pile, punishing large fellowships, fellowship exerting, anti-choke, ally discarding), The Prancing Pony is there primarily because it costs 3 twilight, but it can also be used to play either Aragorn ROTN, Faramir or Boromir. Pinnacle of Zirakzigil is a must in any deck that revolves around Gandalf and this one is no exception. The remaining site is here because it costs 3 and nothing else.   <br />

Enjoy!<br />
