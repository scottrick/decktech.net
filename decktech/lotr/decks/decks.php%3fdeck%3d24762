STOP, LOOK, DONT JUST SCROLL TO THE STARS<br>
<br>
Ok, I&#39;m going to go ahead and post my old strategy article because it was very long and detailed and most of it is still accurate (the fellowship is kind of different though) It still gives a lot of information on how to play this deck, and frankly PLEASE don&#39;t review this unless you have read that as well. Anyway I will start out this strategy by letting you know about some changes I made. <br>
<br>
Ferny - I found that what a lot of people said is true. Ferny does tend to get shot out of the sky by legolas and aragorn a little too much. Therefore I removed 2 copies, leaving one which I use against decks that dont use directed archery, or just to have a guaranteed exertion on legolam.<br>
<br>
Morgul Gates - Once again thanks to those who mentioned it in the review. I have found that the addition of this card (although hard for me to find room for) really helps it out a ton. Twilight denial used to hurt, but now it only takes 6 twilight to play the king. Anyway the fourth one I couldn&#39;t really find room for, and I found that 3 just seems to be the magic number that fits. Any more, and I get them stuck in my hand without minions.<br>
<br>
Wraith World - 4 was a bit too much. A lot like Gates, 3 just seems to fit the magic number. It doesn&#39;t clog up your hand as much as 4 does, and 3 is really enough to add that killing blow of corruption that this deck needs. <br>
<br>
Return to Its Master - Once again (thanks guys) someone suggested adding this. Instead of the fourth Wraith World I decided to stick this in. While I can&#39;t use it with the witch king, If I manage to pull a resistance, and get the ring on, I can do some serious damage. <br>
<br>
No regular Enquea - I found that this guy really didn&#39;t do me too much good. When I was trying to find room for the morgul gates, he just kind of popped out and ended out coming out of my sleeves. Big fellowships usualy dont hurt this deck considering I dont need to kill companions to win with it. This is the same reason I changed my site 8, just to give me more twilight.<br>
 <br>
Not as many strength boosters - Once again after some serious playtesting I discovered that they really weren&#39;t worth the hassle. My nazgul either win or they don&#39;t. To corrupt this deck needs an average of 2 skirmishes won per game, and that is fairly easy to do with this lineup, and the witchkings already high strength. <br>
<br>
Otsea???  I added him because he makes the witch king/enquea do their thing a lot faster. While it may take a ton of twilight, it effectively doubles their use, and has won me several games already.<br>
<br>
Anyway I think that covers about all of the changes. Oh one more thing. I found that His Terrible Servants is just plain raw as hell. Archery is a pain in the backside, and this card goes a long way to evening the odds. I added the second copy because it is essential against decks that use archery (that and its just fun having the opponent exerting aragorn 3x thinking he will kill the witch king only to discover that by removing 3 twilight all of those wounds were just canceled. Anyway I guess Ill let you know some stuff about this deck. I played in a tournament on the 28th, and went 4-2, tying for 4th out of about 14. This was no ordinary tourney as the winner got their choice of either a replica of Glamdring, or a replica of the Pale Blade, so the competition was pretty fierce. Out of my 6 games, I corrupted 3, yes count them 3 times. Notably a Mirror/white arrows/shoulder to shoulder deck (very fun to beat), a crazy hobbit deck, and a ranger deck. The other game that I won was when I was so far ahead of my opponent that I just moved to site 9 easily for the victory. Out of the two games I lost only one was really responsible for my shadow. One of them I made a completely stupid mistake with my fellowship side, forgetting to heal boromir and using sting to see my opponent&#39;s hand, and thus dieing to worry. The sad part was that I had a pretty good guarantee of corrupting my opponent on the next turn (all of the cards were right) if I had just not made a stupid mistake with my free peoples. The one game that I lost and was my shadow&#39;s fault was very unfortunate, because if I&#39;d just drawn one more minion (the witch king was out) I would have corrupted my opponent. Not being able to draw a mininon cost me the game as I could not get out anyone else at site 9, and didnt have anyone to exert for my resistances. Anyway enough rambling, I just wanted to let you know that this deck has a pretty good record of corruption, and it does work against popular decks that are out right now. Now since the free peoples has changed a ton since the old version I will do a bit of updating on that. <br>
<br>
This deck is basically designed to put the stopper on Uruks. You want to bid 6 to go first. You will almost always go first thus getting the pony and aragorn, and getting an early headstart. One of the hopes is that your opponent will do the old trick of bidding 5 and using the green dragon to pull sam. If they bid 5, they are stuck with no way to remove burdens till they draw sam, and you get to go first with Sam already out. Once you hit site 4 (and site 2 in some cases) you want to ditch sam so that savagery loses its effectiveness. One of the fun things about this deck is that even though you are going first you still have a good shot at playing your site 2, and if not site 2, then your site 3. While going first loses the advantage of playing both of your first two sites, it does make it easier to run. Pathfinder is the key. Once thought useless, now that Thrors map has been nerfed, this card is pretty good. By playing 3, you will almost always draw it if you stop at site 2. (if your opponent moves again, you get your next site anyway) Pathfinder is also great in the later sites. The fellowship (once sam gets killed) usualy does pretty well against uruks (the current meta around here, about 70% of people play them) No strangers bring out the denial, and keep the minions you have to face turn to turn down to two or at most three. I wanted to find room for another No Stranger (to draw them faster) and Bill the Pony, but I didnt want to take out anything. The main fighters in this deck are boromir and aragorn with arwen there to take hits from nazgul, and fight if you draw gwemigil. I play three armors in case BTHOM discards one, and just so I can draw it fast. The key to the fellowship is careful pool management. You always want to figure out what your opponent probably has in his hand (think popular stuff ie. Troops, saruman, lurtz) and make sure that you dont give enough for multiples to come out. I took out the site 6 allies in favor of site 3 allies just because overwhelming tends to be a bigger problem with the uruk decks I play. Orophin really cant put a dent in a troops armor, but Saelbeth can make all of those bred for battles, savageries, and ambitions wasted if you just subtract 2 from its strength. Its more of just a matter of opinion. are Anyway thats about the size of it. To find out more about how this deck works, go ahead and read below, but some of the info below is outdated, and no longer applies. The shadow strategy should still be pretty accurate, and the free peoples (except for the site 6 allies and gandalf) is also. Anyway hope this deck tickled your fancy. I&#39;ve actualy recieved some really nice comments from people about it, including a local player who copied my deck and played it against me. That was a fun experience, and frankly a little flattering that he was inspired.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading this strategy, now go and review my deck. Please leave some helpful suggestions. Thanks a lot. -Sean <br>

<br>
Ok, this is going to be a really long strategy, and I do mean LONGGGGGGGG. If you are not interested in learning how this deck wins, dont bother reading, but if you want to find out how corruption can be viable, and the best way to go about it just read on. <br>
Lets start from the beginning. At the beginning of the game you want to bid 1. If you bid 0, it will be terribly obvious that you are playing nazgul, and the opponent will probably choose for you to go first. If you bid 1, he will believe you just have no burden removal, and are trying to be safe. Anyway so lets say he outbids you and decides to go first. You play gandalf, and wait for his site 1. Odds are it is the Prancing Pony (which helps you) or the green dragon inne (Which also helps you believe it or not). Lets hypothetically say they bid 5, get sam SOH and remove 3. This leaves exhausted sam, frodo with one exertion (to get Sam) and two burdens. Anyway they play their companions/allies/possessions, lets say it adds four twilight, and move on to your site 2. This gives you 2 from Sam, 4 from possessions(probably more, 3 from the site, and 3-4 from their companions.) This gives you 12-13 twilight which is more than enough. At site 2, you will almost always have either a twilight enquea, or witch king in your hand. Often Ferny as well. Try to play one of them. They are now fierce and very likely to win a skirmish doing wounds to frodo. If you get out ferny before the witchking, ferny is basically free because you would have had to pay the roaming anyway. Ok. So lets say you get out your witch king and ferny using 10 twilight. If Frodo is unboosted, you want to assign Ferny to him, who will most likely add yet another wound to the ringbearer. If your witch king looks like he won&#39;t win a skirmish (very unlikely at site 2) put ferny with him, or put ferny with the king if you can overwhelm someone. Either way the withcking is going to win his first skirmish. During the maneuver phase you want to play resistance Becomes Unbearble if you get it (usualy draw 1). Anyway after all of this your witchking is going to win both his skirmishes (exhausting frodo and maybe adding some burdens) probably killing Sam for fear of Ferny + King, or just making them get rid of that early O Elbereth to save companions. At this point Frodo should at least have a few burdens on him, even if things didnt go as planned. The whole point of the first site is to get frodo in pain hopefully exhausted, remove the first turn O Elbereth that hopefully they did not play, kill Sam, and maybe add a burden or two if the cards are right. If you don&#39;t draw the witch king, you will get enquea, who does practically the same thing, just not as good. After site 2, you want them to have so many wounds on frodo, that they wont be able to heal all of their companions at site 3 unless they want to risk leaving wounds on frodo. No matter how bad your first draw is, you will at least get one of these parts down <br>
1. exhausted frodo and a few burdens <br>
2. Dead Sam <br>
3. Wasted O Elbereth <br>
4. Morgul Skulker puts YBGE on Frodo <br>
5. Dead Companions <br>
Anyway the turn ends and you go to your fellowship phase. Play as much as possible, not worrying about twilight unless you dont get another companion out. Try to empty your hand up so you can draw some good shadow cards for site 3. Move and then stop at site 2, so you can get your site 3 out. Oh I might as well explain my site 1. In case they make you go first, you have this site 1 which you can use to play your site 2. While this really doesnt help your shadow, because they can just exert to play their own, it does add one more exertion to Frodo (probably) and some people forget that they can use it to get their own site 2 out. So anyway on to site 3. Unless you got the worst draw of your life at site 2, the fellowship is probably hurting with a minimum of 2 wounds/exertions on frodo, and 2 on the rest of the companions. Site 3 is basically the icing on the cake. You preferably want to get twilight nelya out, who will be fierce and damage + 1, but if you can afford another witch king//enquea go ahead. Twilight Nelya&#39;s purpose is just to add a few more wounds, so that if they want to fully heal frodo, they are going to leave some on the rest of their companions. Ill pause up a second and explain something. You may be thinking as you review this deck, (He&#39;ll never get those draws at those sites, this is too slow to work, blah blah blah) I&#39;ve played six or seven games with this deck, and just about every time I draw Ferny, Witch King, and a Resistance Becomes Unbearable in my opening hand. The reason lies in that I only play 64 cards, and my card dispersion is excelent. When I don&#39;t draw a first turn witch king, I get enquea, or I get another twilight nazzy, and two resistances, either way, Im going to do at least a couple of wounds to frodo. So before you judge what kind of draws you THINK I will get, consider that. Anyway so ends site 3. You reconcile. Let me mention something else. You have probably drawn a wraith world in your opening hand. At this point you want to start stockpiling wraith worlds in your hand (but don&#39;t go above 3 and usualy 2) Everything else you want to play. Always make sure to discard something at the end of your turn though. Anyway, you go ahead and move to site 3 without much resistance, again, playing whatever fellowship stuff you draw. Stop at site 3. Up comes site 4 for your opponent. There is no way they are going to be able to heal frodo, exhausted sam(if hes still alive) and anyone else that took wounds valiantly defending frodo from the king. So they pick and choose which to heal (all the better if they pick sam over frodo) and move on to your site 4 adding a burden. Hopefully they are around three burdens at this point, but even 1 is ok. Site 4 hardly give you any twilight, so realistically you will be lucky to get out 1 nazgul. If you can, this is the point where you want to play a skulker (getting back a witchking, and maybe a resistance becomes unbearble, and slapping down You Bring Great Evil on Frodo.) This only takes 5 twilight which is not hard to get. Go ahead and let them kill the skulker. Anyway, if you dont get to do this at site 4 you want to do it some time between site 4 and 6. YBGE hinders frodo, and all of a sudden each time you play Resistance, Frodo gets closer and closer to corruption. Site 4 is also the time when the opponent usualy starts to get out his flaming brands, swords, and last alliances. Hold in there, but your nazgul arent going to be winning skirmishes for a while. Anyway so you finish off site 4, and go to your fellowship which does its normal thing, playing stuff then moving trying to minimize twilight with aragorn/sting/glamdring. You add a burden putting you at 2. Big deal. Anyway you regroup, and go ahead and stop. (Only move twice when your opponent does) So going into site 5 your opponent is probably getting pretty pipeweedy. He looks down at his aragorn with Brand, and Sword and just laughs at you. He sees he only has a couple of burdens (Minimum of one) and figures he is safe. He moves to the bridge. Now you start putting on the heat. You usualy have another witch king by this time who gets played along with either Ferny or a Pale Blade. Your witch king WILL win a skirmish. You probably play a Resistance making frodo take a wound, and when your king wins a skirmish you bring it up to 3. If your opponent uses the common ring he is now exhausted, and you get to play a wraith world or two (probably two) If he is using Isildurs Bane, all the better because those burdens are about to come a lot faster. Anyway your opponent does a little double take, and looks pissed as his stops and regroups. Meanwhile you continue to play elven allies, and combat the opponent shadow the best you can at the bridge. You will probably survive :-P Now comes site 5. If your opponent is using KIE aragorn he gets a slight advantage and gets to remove one of those wounds. Big deal. Frodo still has 2. They move to site 6. At this point depending on how much twilight you get you either want to continue building the heat with twilight nazgul, and resistance, or if you are getting choked, just play a skulker (no more roaming) and YBGE on Frodo if you didnt do it earlier. The skulker gets back stray withckings, enqueas, wraith worlds (if common ring) and resistances. Your opponent just laughs and woops up the skulker and is happy he is finally at a sanctuary. He stays. You move to site 6 and shouldnt have a problem with your elf allies helping out. Stay there. On to your opponent&#39;s fellowship. They heal (not frodo though :-P) and are starting to get pipeweedy, because they probably have very few burdens on Frodo, and no wounds on their companions except frodo. They move to site 7. This site gives you a nice reprieve from archery if its been hurting you recently, and is when you start hitting hard. Most likely this is the turn where frodo gets exhausted, and you start adding burdens with the witch king. Lots of burdens if they were dumb and used isildur&#39;s bane. Frodo suddenly isn&#39;t looking so good. Oh my goodness Wraith Worlds. Those cards you&#39;ve been holding the whole time finally come out and add a LOT of burdens. Frodo is probably exhausted with about 7 burdens now (1 from site 4, 6 from two wraith worlds), and the opponent isn&#39;t looking so pipeweedy anymore. They stop just because they are pissed off. Next you move your fellowship (hurt only slightly by no archery phase and once again stop. You smile sweetly and say (your shadow is really good, I can&#39;t seem to double move) hahaha. Yea right. Your opponent is mad now, and moves again. Now is where they get screwed. You&#39;ve just pretty much emptied your hand last turn, and have a fresh shadow side. They are moving to site 8 where if they&#39;ve been going over the 4 companion limit they suddenly have a lot of archery to deal with. And the best part is, not a single wound can go on frodo. Hahaha. You don&#39;t have very much twilight, but as usual play what you get. Enqueas, witch kings, atteas, nelyas whatever. Resistances if for some reason frodo isnt exhausted yet. Hit wraith world if you have it (which should end the game, but if things arent going as planned, which they often don&#39;t, just let him whipe the floor with your nazgul and feel good about himself. Flaming brands hurt. Anyway he might even decide to move again. If he does not, your fellowship is faced with the tough choice of either having to run to site 9, or to empty your fellowship cards, and hope to draw a winning shadow hand. Anyway if they do move to site 9 heres what you need to do. First watch the pool carefully, you need every twilight token in order to play events like resistance and wraith world, and use boosters like ferny and All Veils. Now is when you will hopefully get one of those witchkings you shuffled back earlier. You play him, and whatever else you can afford. If they just moved twice a realistic lineup is king + Bill + another twilight nazgul with enough left over to play your events. Now you have to decide whether or not you need to make the king fierce or not. The exertion could kill you. Hopefully somewhere down the line you played His Terrible Servants so you can deal with directed archery, and put the rest on the other nazzy. Anyway so the king goes up. Put Ferny with him. Hopefully you made the ring bearer put the ring on with Resistance, and are holding an all veils removed. The witchking is almost guaranteed to win a skirmish, and once he does 7 burden exhausted frodo is screwed. Or if you still dont have enough burdens play another wraith world. All the possibilities are too many to count, but it is very possible to make the ringbearer go from 1 burden to 10 at site 9. 3 held wraith worlds does the trick. Thats about it. Now for a recap <br>
<br>
site 2- play a witchking add too many wounds on companions to heal all of them. <br>
site 3- play nelya, continue to add wounds <br>
site 4- site adds a burden, play whatever you can afford <br>
site 5- continue to add the wounds to frodo, but dont expect anyone but the witch king to win a skirmish. Even he only wins if you get ferny, a blade, or an All Veils Continue to play your twilight nazgul and Resistances <br>
site 6- Play a skulker to get cards back. Play YBGE on Frodo <br>
site 7- Pile every wound you can on the sad little hobbit. <br>
site 8- Make them pay for using a big fellowship. Continue triggering events. Make sure Frodo is exhuasted going into site 9. <br>
site 9- Witch king does his thing, Trigger all of the wraith worlds you&#39;ve been holding adding tons of burdens <br>
<br>
Thats about it. Now for some things people might say <br>
Sam - Sam can cause problems, but not too much for this deck. this deck adds a ton of burdens all in one turn, and Sam either gets eaten by then, or isn&#39;t going to be much help. Sacrificing Frodo so Sam can be the ringbearer is unlikely because Wraith World will have corrupted him first. <br>
<br>
Phial of Galadriel - 2 more burdens is not hard to get. My opponents are usualy in excess of burdens anyway. Plus, I have yet to see someone play this as most underestimate burden decks <br>
<br>
O elbereth - Does it hurt? Yes. Does it suck? Yes. Does it end the game? No. If they get it early on I usualy make them get rid of it because they are afraid to have a companion overwhelmed. Very few people play two. If they get it at site 9 or something? No big deal, my nazgul dont win skirmishes very often anyway, and I don&#39;t need them to win to get frodo to put the ring on. Thats what Resistance is for <br>
<br>
Gandalf&#39;s Staff - It hurts a lot. The ability to cancel skirmishes completely really sucks for me. The best way around it is to make them use it and think that it will save them all game just healing at sanctuaries, and then to play YBGE on Gandalf. While this reduces your chances of getting it on Frodo, it pretty much kills gandalf. <br>
<br>
Frodo Son of Drogo - Ouch is all I can say. they just pas the wounds along to their many companions with the frodo signet. The ups of this are that very few people play son of drogo. Maybe more will start if Nazgul burdnes becomes popular. The only trick you can do against this is to use regular enquea to take out the characters he is passing the wounds to. If he doesnt play 6 companions, then those wounds he is passing along will add up pretty darn quickly <br>
<br>
Narya - While it may hurt decks that add burdens over time, this ring actualy helps me. If they remove a burden from frodo it just gives me extra twilight, and that one burden per turn is rarely going to make the game deciding difference with this decks ability to add so many burdens at once. <br>
<br>
Flaming Brand - This card did not make nazgul useless, rather it took a broken strategy, and stopped it before it could be used :) Aragorn + Brand + sword = 13 strength. The Witch King still wins. Aragron + Brand + Last Alliance = 17 stength maximum. The witch King + Ferny = 18 strength. The Witch King + Sword = 17 strength. Big deal Aragorn. So what you can beat up an unaided witch king. Thats ok. The witch king really only need to win about 2 skirmishes per game, and you are sunk. Its not hard at all to win those skimishes with the strength boosters I added. <br>
<br>
Archery - Archery tends to hurt a lot because it prevents my nazgul from exerting. The best shot you&#39;ve got is to get His Terrible Servants out quickly, and make good use of it. The only upsides of archery are that you are likely to have more twilight than usual, and the likelihood that they found room for flaming brands is less. If I face too many archery decks I may consider adding 1-2 more His Terrible Servants. <br>
<br>
Arwen - Arwen + horse + sword is still only 13 strength and gets beat by the king. Thats all that matters. Arwen can&#39;t do much else. <br>
<br>
The One Ring, The Ruling Ring - While this may slow down the twilight witch king&#39;s and enquea&#39;s wounds in the long run it helps me more than hurts me. It is now much easier to exhaust frodo and thus trigger wraith world. While the ring may not be as great to have out, it still doesn&#39;t hinder very much. Not to mention almost every skilled player uses Isildur&#39;s Bane. <br>
<br>
Event Strength Boosters - Ok, I have not played a deck in a very long time that has used strength boosters outside of stealths and intuitions. I&#39;m sure that some people do, but even if they did I doubt they have room for a sword, and a brand as well. If they are having these things clog up their hands the likelihood that they will draw them is less too. <br>
<br>
Hobbit Stealth/Intuition - Yes it hurts at the early sites, but if I am playing a hobbit deck, I at least no they have limited choices regarding other cards. Hobbits = no brands. Good hobbits :) Stealth only lasts till site 5 anyway :) <br>
<br>
The Gaffer - The Gaffer would be useful if he didnt have two vitality. He exerts to heal frodo? So what. Twilight Attea comes out and wounds the gaffer. Bye bye gaffer. <br>
<br>
King in Exile - While most don&#39;t play him in favor of one of the other Aragorns, he still is annoying. With the ability to heal frodo each turn, he does become a nuissance fast. In reality he only slows you down. Make sure to remind them they can&#39;t use king in exile&#39;s healing ability at a sanctuary while frodo has YBGE on him. If they forget to heal at the start of the turn with him and want to take it back, don&#39;t let them. Even if it is only a friendly game (unless you are realy a nice person), a lot of times this can be a deciding factor. Either way, he doesn&#39;t hurt too bad. <br>
<br>
Condition Removal - Does it slow me down? I suppose, but I only play two different conditions. YBGE, and His Terrible Servants. They can use a secret Sentinels if they want and get rid of them, but its also an extra two twilght that I get to play my events. If they really want to waste a Sleep Caladhras on one condition, they can go ahead, but it also gets rid of O Elbereth, The Last Alliance, and Vitality boosters. Does it hurt? Yes, but not enough to stop this deck. <br>
<br>
The Mirror - Well what can I say, it hurts everything. Not much to do about it because adding any counters to it would just take up space, and would probably get discarded anyway. One nice thing is that you can usualy get back your discarded cards with skulkers anyway. <br>
<br>
Now for some card choices you may want me to add <br>
<br>
It Wants to be Found - No no no no no! The whole idea of this deck is to add burdens quickly in one turn, not to do this once per turn burden crap. That doesn&#39;t work. Between narya, sam, and everything else out there, adding burdens slowly just isn&#39;t viable. While my deck only has a couple of ways to add burdens (Witch King, Enquea, Wraith World, Ferny against unboosted Frodo) it does it quickly. If the witch king exerts to wound frodo twice it is adding 4 burdens if it is isildur&#39;s bane. Wraith World adds three at a time. Adding any other cards to this deck would just slow it down. <br>
<br>
In The Ringwraith&#39;s Wake - See above <br>
<br>
Twilight Otsea/Blade Tip - Dedicating all of those cards (at least two otseas, and two blade tips, as well as ways to get him to win skirmishes) is not worth the one burden per turn hassle. One burden at a time is just too hard to pull off. <br>
<br>
More twilight Enqueas - I have found that he just isn&#39;t good enough to add more than two. Its just two hard to get him to win skirmishes to be worth the 1 extra wound. I play two regular enqueas for a couple of reasons. It stops big fellowships by removing their heavy flaming brand-bearing hitters, and once they hit 5 burdens I can do the same. <br>
<br>
More His Terrible Servants - I am seriously considering adding two more just because archery sucks so bad. When I update this deck you will probably see at least one more. The reason I only play one at the moment is because it costs a fair amount of twilight, and is easily removed with SS/Sleep. <br>
<br>
More Strength Boosters - I&#39;ve thought about it, but its not really worth it. I don&#39;t need to get my nazgul to win too many skirmishes in order to be effective. The occasional witchking/enquea with ferny and All Veils is usually enough. <br>
<br>
Morgul Gates - No. For one thing I don&#39;t have enough room. For another, its one of those cards that will just stay in your hand if you dont draw a nazgul and its effects aren&#39;t all that great. Don&#39;t get me wrong, its a great card, but it just doesnt fit with this nazgul burden deck. <br>
<br>
Take out the Skulkers and YBGE - I&#39;ve considered it, but its a real downer when you&#39;ve spent all that hard work getting frodo exhausted, and then they just heal it all at site 6. The Skulkers serve a purpose too. With Skulkers I can get back the witch king whenever I need to. They are also great because depending on the deck you are playing you will get something different back every time. If you are having trouble winning skirmishes you bring Ferny back. If you are winning skirmishes, but the burdens just arent coming fast enough put in wraith worlds. If you are having trouble getting frodo exhausted you get back Resistances, and if you are running out of your minions, just pull them back. <br>
<br>
Anything Else - Believe me there are a bunch of a cards I want to add to this deck, but I&#39;ve found with this exact number/variety I almost always draw what I want. <br>
<br>
Now for a little bit on the free people side. <br>
<br>
Against Uruk-hai <br>
This is the most prevalent decktype around right now, at least in my area. The trick is to stay at 4 companions (dont play greenleaf), try to fish your armors out early, and heal boromir every turn. With only 4 companions out, and aragorn removing each time you move the chances are you wont give up too much twilight. Only move once per turn no matter what your opponent does, and you will get spared Hollin. Just keep adding strength boosters to your companions, and the wounds will come less and less. When push comes to shove, You can use Orophin, and Aragorn&#39;s bow to kill off that nasty lurtz. If you happen to lose one of your companions, go ahead and put out greenleaf who just does wounds and becomes fodder <br>
<br>
Against Swarms (any variation) <br>
Getting swarmed sucks. Site 4 shouldnt hurt as bad because its not underground, but it always hurts. Key cards to make sure to get out against swarms <br>
<br>
Greenleaf - I put him in there because I hate swarms, can take out 3 minions by himself and still only be exhausted. <br>
<br>
Aragorn&#39;s Bow - Essential, same as greenleaf, but aragorn is a lot less likely to get wounded and die. Kills three guys then takes one of them on. <br>
<br>
Horn of Boromir - with 5 allies, he can easily call 2 (3 with saga) out per turn and have them defend frodo&#39;s honor. Heal him with his text next turn. <br>
<br>
Rumil - Same as Legolas. Get out Galadriel too, and you&#39;ve got and easy extra minion dead each turn. <br>
<br>
PATHS - The Ultimate anti-swarm card. If you manage to draw it (you probably will) save it till site 9 if you can then just PATHS away all of those stupid runners. <br>
<br>
Armor - Keeps the Balrog/Troll from being too annoying. <br>
<br>
In all likelihood you will draw one of these cards by site 5, and will be able to make it through the bridge. As you keep moving on you will draw more of them, and have less of a problem with the goblins. <br>
<br>
<br>
Against Sauron Conditions <br>
Secret Sentinels. Thats all that needs to be said. Go ahead and play greenleaf (only hold him against Uruks) Get an ally out early, then hold your secret sentinels until they get two annoying condtions out. Essentialy gets rid of any annoying UTWE, Bowman. Be liberal exerting frodo for UTWE. Try to keep everyone with at least 3 vitality left so unless they store up Hates they won&#39;t do very much damage. Sentinels gets rid of the conditions. Thats all you need to remember. <br>
<br>
Against Sauron Burdens <br>
Simliar Strategy if they play some conditions, however make sure not to go over two burdens. You start with 1 from your bid, and get 1 from site 4. So at most Enduring Evil subtracts 2 from you. If they play Thin and Stretched go ahead and assign frodo to skirmish on of the puny trackers as long as he has O Elbereth and Sting on. If they play desperate Defence, just assign someone else to fight. This is a hard match-up, but holding those enduring Evils in their hand, and roaming minions will probably lead to bad fellowship draws and ultimately corruption via your nazgul. I don&#39;t see this deck played very often, but if I start to, I will add a SOH, and a Narya so that burdens can get removed. <br>
<br>
Against Isengard Orcs <br>
I have yet to play someone using Isengard Orcs. Stay at 4 companions so at most the smith will remove 1 weapon. Let them assign whoever they want to skirmish with saruman, but you still should be able to win. If my deck starts to have problems with Isengard orcs, I will probably add some counters to it, but at the moment I do not see it becoming much of a problem. Just play with your shadow. <br>
<br>
Against Nazgul beatdown - Brands, O elbereth, gandalf&#39;s staff, legolas. Those cards will win you this matchup. With 4 companions the most they should get out is 3 nazgul even if they all get gated. Armor solves the damage + 1 problem, and all of your weapons and boosters solve the overwhelming thing. Nazgul players usualy bid 0, so just force them to go first, and go to your site 2 instead of theirs. Try and save your o elbereth till site 9, and just use it to save your ass. <br>
<br>
Against Nazgul burdens (my shadow) - The saver here is gandalf&#39;s staff. Whenever it looks like they will win a skirmish use the staff to cancel it. O Elbereth should be saves for a last resort. Use your Brands, and in general just play the same way as if you were playing a nazgul beatdown deck. King in Exile should be played rather than Heir to the City because he can heal Frodo. Like I said this is a tough matchup, it will hurt, but you should be able to pull through because most nazgul burden decks play those silly cards like It Wants to be Found. So what. Adds burdens too slow to be effective. If they happen to be playing a deck similar to yours, just hope you can corrupt first. <br>
<br>
A few more things before I wrap this up <br>
<br>
Why The Grey Pilgrim? <br>
Card advantage. I only have 2, (3 at the most) different races in the fellowship, so Friend of the Shire Folk isn&#39;t worth playing. Gandalf is mainly in here for the card advantage he offers (a lot since this will probably be a slow once per turn game) and the fact he can remove twilight with his sword. One card a turn makes for a huge advantage. <br>
<br>
Why no Sleep Caladhras? <br>
I really don&#39;t like sleep. Having to discard your own conditions (O Elbereth, Last Alliance, Saga) really sucks. Two Secret Sentinels can essentialy accomplish the same thing by stopping sauron conditions. <br>
<br>
Why one KIE, and two Heir to the White Citys? <br>
Generally I like to play Heir to the White City. I don&#39;t really like ROTN, because I find that when his text could be useful, you can&#39;t exert him. Heir to the White City does the nice job of removing twilight each turn. The reason I have 1 King in Exile in here is just because he does a nice job of healing. It is really situational which one I want to play. KIE reduces the effectiveness of my own shadow side, and heals gandalf with his staff. Basically, it just depends on my mood which one I put out. <br>
<br>
Why Defender of Minas Tririth? <br>
Lord of Gondor is good, but my boromir rarely gets overwhelmed anyway. I really like the combo of boromir + Horn, and then healing him next turn. The healing thing is just great. Son of Denethor doesn&#39;t fit in my deck very well. His ability is useful, but then again I can find better uses for those exertions. <br>
<br>
Why the Elven Allies? <br>
Elrond - Card drawing is great. You can see by which Gandalf I use how much I like card drawing. <br>
Galadriel - Plays all of my elves for free. Heals Rumil and Orophin for next turn wounding <br>
Celeborn - Lets Elrond draw 2 cards per turn instead of 1. Lets me use Rumil and Orophin twice per turn. <br>
Rumil - Swarms. Enough Said. No really, I find that the extra two wounds per turn is essential against orc decks. <br>
Orophin - Uruk-hai are really rampant right now aroun here. This guy can help kill Lurtz if backed up by aragorn or legolas. <br>
<br>
All the elven allies give my gondor guys boosts when they have on the last alliance of elves and men. They can be pulled into battle with boromir&#39;s horn. <br>
<br>
<br>
Well thats about it. This deck does fairly well, and has a pretty successful corruption record. If you have any questions or comments e-mail me at halcannonucf@homtail.com <br>
Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you got something out of that long strategy. Took over an hour to type it out. Please be kind in rating this deck, and realize that nazgul, despite what your parents tell you (lol) are mean and nasty.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP" COLSPAN="2"><font class="bfont"> <a href="/lotr/decks/decks.php">Back to Decks Directory</a> | <A HREF="/lotr/decks/decks.php?reviews=24762"> Read Reviews </A> | <a href="deckprint.php?deck=24762" TARGET="BLANK_"> Printer Friendly</a></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><a name="review"></a><font class="h2font">In order to review decks you must be a registered member. <A href="/lotr/main/join.php">Sign up for free!</A></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
