You are going to want to bid high enough to go first and play your Site 1. It&#39;s alright to bid high on burdens because Sam has the ability to remove them. It is very important that you go first so that you can play Bilbo from your draw deck. This opens you up to play Practically Everyone Was Invited and get your other allies. Once you get some Hobbit Party Guests out and allies like The Gaffer and Rosie Cotton then you will be able to take wounds off of Frodo and Sam and move them to the Guests.  Since the Guests heal at the beginning of every turn, you have a channel to constantly get rid of wounds from Frodo and Sam. Thror’s Maps are not as helpful now that they have been changed, but they will still prove useful in moving to some key sites. Low twilight, Stealths, and Intuitions keep Frodo and Sam safe at sites 1-5. After that, Promises pump up Frodo’s and Sam’s strength along with Sting, Hobbit Sword, and There and Back Again. Finally, with the Bounder, it becomes extremely hard to overwhelm either Sam or Frodo. If Frodo happens to get killed (which wouldn&#39;t happen until very late if at all), Sam can carry the ring.<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is designed to kill the opponent mostly with conditions. It is important to get out your Under the Watching Eyes and Orc Bowmen as soon as you can. You have the ability to make the opponent exert 4 times for moving and then take 4 wounds in archery, and that is all before they have to deal with the minions. Band of the Eye and Morgul Hunter are powerful minions that will also do some damage, especially when you make them Enheartened Foes. Late in the game, their companions should be exhausted or close to it from moving and archery. This is when you use your Hate to kill off their companions.<br />
