Well Starting off... The people I chose to start with were: <br />
Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir <br />
Arwen, Daughter of Elrond <br />
Legolas, Greenleaf <br />
I chose Arwen because she is a good ranger that is proficient with an elven bow. I also chose her because Gwemegil rocks and her daddy is in here. I chose legolas, Greenleaf over the other legolas because direct damage is sometimes better. I put 2 bow of the galadhrim in because I felt that its pretty nice to get rid of the little creatures like runners and stuff and 2 because so i can get it faster. The extra point of damage sometimes comes in handy. I put 2 defiance in because i felt 4 would be a little to much because most of the battle would be won by archery. I chose to put in 4 elven bows because this is indeed an archery deck. I put in 2 lorien elfs instead of 4 because i would put one bow on Arwen and one on haldir. I put the last alliance of elves and men in because with all the elves, it would help aragorn. 1 rumil and 1 orophin is in here to help with the direct damage to orcs and uruks. 2 swanships are in here to let my allies do some dirty work. i put in 2 tales of gil galad cuz its cool with legolas special ability.I put in two elrond cuz he is da shiznit! him and galadriel and celeborn are awesome. With galadriel in the mix orophin and rumil get healed too!i put 1 aragorns in because im starting with the prancing pony. Also i chose rotn because of the defender plus one thing. i chose 2 aragorns bow because i probably will need to get it rite away and 2 rangers sword so i can get one quicker.i chose 1 saga of elendil because the thing is cool with aragorn and aragorns bow. i chose 3 rangers versatility because... do u really need an explaination? i chose 4 power according to his stature because they need to be in every deck lol. i chose one common sam to get rid of burdens.i chose 2 thrors maps to ensure i get my sites. Y didnt i chose pathfinders? cuz thrors map is way better. u can use it more than just four times.i chose 2 stings cuz frodo told me that he wants it. for my shadow deck i decided i wanted to play swarms so i put two swarms in. i put two cave trolls and his toys in because every swarms deck loves him. i chose 4 goblin archers to get rid of pain in the hiney archery. I chose 2 patrol troops cuz they usually dont lose skirmishes. i chose 4 goblin scimitars to draw some extra cards and pump someone up. 4 sneaks cuz they let me recycle and recycling is good for the earth. 4 moria axes because they are cool with goblin archers or anyone. 2 threat of the unknown to draw some more cards and 3 unfamiliar territories to get rid of pain in the hiney archers. I also added 3 goblin armories, 4 scavengers and 4 runners. the reason 4 the 3 armories is to get more shadow. the reason for the runners is to get more shadow and scavengers speaks for itself<br />
The basic of this deck is just to hit and run to site nine  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
