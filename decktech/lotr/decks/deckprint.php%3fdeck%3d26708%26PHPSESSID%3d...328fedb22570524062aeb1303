    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings... at first glance your probably saying that it&#39;s to big for a burden deck, well your wrong it&#39;s not. I&#39;ve played this deck in the past 2 tournaments that I went to and it went undefeated... It can add burdens which is what it&#39;s supposed to do but it&#39;s <b>NOT</b> a Corruption deck. It&#39;s designed to get the burdens on and then use Ulaire Enquea to kill them off. Then at the end I can remove the burdens to get more guys out of the lost pile.<br />
<br /><br />
The reason I chose these specific cards was quite random actually I was watching Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers for the 4th time with a friend of mine and while I was watching it I was thinking of what to do with my deck and well it hit me to make this deck so I did and here it is.<br />
<br /><br />
Now your probably looking at some of the cards and wondering why they are in there so I will give you a quick rehash of them and why they are there so here&#39;s the deck again w/o the numbers...<br />
<br /><br />
Frodo, Old Bilbo’s Heir - to heal my allies that heal me so that I can use Sting more and more.<br />
The One Ring, Isildur’s Bane - the only ring to really use<br />
Eomer, Dritter Marschall Der Riddermark (German) (start) - kick butt fighter<br />
Elite Rider (start) - another good fighter<br />
Aragorn, Heir to the White City - a fighter, Uruk killer and removes twilight.<br />
Faramir, Son of Denethor - um, no Skirmish events or special abilities... Cantea anyone.<br />
Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith - Hornboy and heals himself.<br />
Legolas, Greenleaf - plinker for Moria Swarm<br />
Gandalf, Greyhame - get back Pippin<br />
Pippin, Just a Nuisance - Anti-Uruk-hai, nuff said<br />
Orophin - plinker<br />
Rumil - plinker<br />
Galadriel, Lady of Light - heal the plinkers and can use SS<br />
Bounder - Keep Frodo from being overwhelemd<br />
Treebeard, Earthborn - put Pippin back for repeat performance<br />
The Gaffer - heal Frodo<br />
Elrond, Lord of Rivendell - draw cards and fight for the hornboy.<br />
Filbert Bolger - keep Frodo from getting fierce&#39;d skirmished<br />
Ranger’s Sword, Blade of Aragorn - duh!<br />
Sword of Gondor - duh! again<br />
Aragorns Bow - plinking<br />
Faramir’s Bow - wounding<br />
Sting - um, yeah if you don&#39;t know why... then play something else.<br />
O Elbereth! Githoniel! - see above...+ cancels nasty Nazgul fierce skirmishes.<br />
Eomer’s Spear - duh!<br />
Rider’s Spear - duh, for the 4th time.<br />
Firefoot - um, yeah see the spear<br />
Brego - see firefoot, who see&#39;s the spear<br />
Horn of Boromir - get Allies up.<br />
Swiftly and Softly - stealth if you flood... useful<br />
Secret Sentinels - get rid of those nasty conditions<br />
<br /><br />
Easterling Trooper - beasty<br />
Easterling Captain - EXTREME beasty w/burdens<br />
Easterling Lieutenant - beasty<br />
Easterling Skirmisher - AWESOME - oh, burdens, cool add to the twilight.<br />
Easterling Guard - See others<br />
Easterling Infantry - See others<br />
Easterling Axeman - See others<br />
Easterling Trooper - See others<br />
Desert Legion - Usefull when Burdens are out.<br />
Vision From Afar - Assign to Frodo, cancel add a burden<br />
New Fear - Interesting card, if they run a large fellowship then you can make them add burdens or discard companions I got it to work once so far, and it was critical.<br />
Ulaire Nertea, Lieutenant of Morgul - Large fellowship equals more minions for me.<br />
Ulaire Enquea, Messenger of Dol Guldur - duh! (5th time) 4 burdens or large fellowship =&#39;s kill kill kill.. and Nertea can get him back.<br />
Morgul Hunter - nasty against large fellowships and 4 vitality for (DDotR & Hate)<br />
Band of the Eye - Big guy and discards when he wins<br />
Orc Pillager - Anti-Faramir... everything on him makes him -9 str. heh! not really for him but makes guys that have a lot of stuff weaker.<br />
Tower Assassin - killer of Allies<br />
Hate - killer of hurt companions at key times quite usefull<br />
Desperate Defense of the Ring - duh! put it on their respective fighters and then either dump 3 or add a burden... quite usefull in both accounts.<br />
<br /><br />
So that&#39;s why the cards are in the deck for their reason as well. The deck moves quite quickly believe it or not. Give it a try and let me know and please if your going to rate me a 1 or 2 please email me first and let me know why so that I can try to explain things to you if I have to.<br />
<br /><br />
Hope you enjoyed and good luck.<br />
