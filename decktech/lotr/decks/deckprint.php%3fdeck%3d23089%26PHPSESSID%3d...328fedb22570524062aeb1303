The Fellowship deck was originally designed with the intention of playing most (if not all) of your Fellowship cards every turn to facilitate more card-drawing.  Therefore play as much as you can from your hand on the first turn and use Green Dragon to pull Sam and remove 3 burdens.  But be sure to keep your party under 6 companions until you feel comfortable that the opponent is not playing Enquea (or you have a couple Versatilities handy).  I generally move 1-3; 3-4; 4-6; 6-8; 8-9.  Therefore, your opponent can only pass you one of three way: bidding over you (unlikely); using Durin&#39;s Secret or Gift of Boats; OR by skipping the site 6 sanctuary, and since your minions pack their biggest punch at sites 5 and up, that makes the latter options very difficult.  And through all 16 games I played over the Atlanta DPC tournament weekend, I only got outbid once.  Otherwise, just win as many skirmishes as possible and don&#39;t worry about sacrificng your characters as necessary to survive (but usually try to keep Aragorn and Gandalf alive since they are you main focus).<br />
<br />
Why no Armor or Saga of Elendil?<br />
Armor and Saga can clog your hand if you don&#39;t get Aragorn (or Boromir) soon enough so I took them out in favor of a smoother deck.  Also, you don&#39;t really need the Armor since you have so many characters.  I played against several Uruk-hai and Cave Troll decks and never had a problem finding places to put the wounds.  Armor is not necessary.<br />
<br />
Why no Thror&#39;s Map?<br />
I have played this deck for months and have never NEEDED a Thror&#39;s Map.  Sure it would be nice to have every now and then, but it is not necessary to function in your fellowship and would merely slow the deck down.  Just let the opponent have his own sites and don&#39;t bother with this.<br />
<br />
Why Son of Drogo?<br />
Frodo, SoD is by far the best choice for this deck.  You can use Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Boromir to heal Frodo as neceassary.  This can be very helpful in concert with Sting (removing LOTS of pool).  It is also very useful against those rare Nazgul decks that like to wound Frodo.  I used to use Reluctant Adventurer and the premium Aragorn, but needed the switch to deal with swarm decks, and this Frodo works very well.<br />
<br />
Why Raragorn?<br />
I use Ranger of the North to help against swarm decks, which can be the most difficult match-up.  You can substitute the premium Aragorn, but you will struggle more often against Moria swarm.  And besdies, having this Aragorn at site 9 unexerted is often an auto-win.<br />
<br />
As for the minion side, the entire purpose of the Uruk-hai are to prevent your opponent from move twice against you and slow them down.  You usually just drop as many as you can (you are playing with mostly cheap ones) and use strength adders to win your skirmishes.  You will ordinarily do so much damage that your opponent will be unable to keep moving.  You will often also kill some of your opponent key companions (especially early in the game) so watch for opportunities to overwhelm companions with strength adders.  Use Spies to survive archery and Savagery to survive large companies.<br />
<br />
Why no Balrog?<br />
Your native site is the bridge, so why waste it on one minion when you can usually drop 3 or 4?  Also, moving twice against the Balrog is easy (since he goes away) so he doesn&#39;t accomplish what your minion need to accomplish.<br />
<br />
VS. MORIA SWARM<br />
Organize to where you win all the skirmishes you possibly can to keep the Orc off of swarms.  This deck will do very little damage to you in the early-game so move as often as possible and save your strength adders and archery to protect Frodo later.  You have Albert Dreary, Boromir, SotSF, Merry, and Raragorn to help keep Frodo alive.<br />
<br />
VS. MORIA STRENGTH and/or URUK-HAI<br />
Moria Stength decks (Orcs with weapons and Trolls) are not too bad.  They don&#39;t usually do ALOT of damage to you so you can take the wounds, and with your own strength adders, you will win most of the skirmishes anyway.  Same goes for Uruk-hai, but watch out for opportunities for the opponent to play Savagery on you.  Just take the wounds wherever you can and win skirmishes as much as you can and you will be all right.  You can also use Al Dreary against the Spies and Snows and Ferny/Frost if necessary.<br />
<br />
VS. SAURON<br />
You have two Sleeps to help against the conditions, but even if you don&#39;t get them out you have 9 companions to drop and take wounds if necessary.  You will win most of your skirmishes also.  The only potential problem (usually) against Sauron orcs is at site 9 with the three trackers.  Try to keep the pool to a minimum when you move into nine and hold onto a couple Frodo-helpers (SotSF, Boromir, etc.) to help against a possible swarm at 9.<br />
<br />
VS. NAZGUL<br />
This matchup can be difficult since you will rarely win skirmishes.  ARV and Firebrand can help alot, and Arwen (win Gwemegil and/or Asfaloth) will help you keep them at bay.  Sacrifice companions as necessary.  Most games, stopping at site 2 will be no big deal since your opponent will rarely pass you and play your site 3.  After the first couple turns, you should have enough stuff out to get you through the end, so play it smart and you&#39;ll be okay.<br />
<br />
VS. BURDEN DECK<br />
You can usually identify a burden deck on the first move, so save Sam if possible and heal him at site 3 to get your burdens to zero.  Burden decks are not very potent and can rarely corrupt, especially when you can win skirmishes.<br />
