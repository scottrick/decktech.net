<br />
Ahem, well this deck has had a lot of things I feel I need to comment on. first off, this deck is still really huge, but I have yet to run into a good Moria deck is Standard. I know people keep winning with it, but I just don&#39;t see how without Nertea. Maybe I just have some sort of Stigma?<br />
Anywho, heres I go wit da comments:<br />
<br />
One Copy of Vilya - I agree that theres a possibility of not drawing Vilya all game, BUT I can&#39;t find the room, nor do I feel it&#39;s nescessaary to add another one. Thats one reason I play Sentinels.<br />
<br />
Bidding - I usually bid 4 with this deck, and it is most often enough to go first. If you know your opponent isn&#39;t playing Nazgul, bid 5, but a first turn Toldea would end the game immediately. Between Cliffs and Sam, you should be okay on burdens, but there&#39;s always a chance someone will start Sam, SoH. I just can&#39;t find room for more Aragorns. Also, if you DO lose the bid theres always the chance you&#39;ll draw up Nelya before you get a turn and then you can switch to your site 1 :)<br />
<br />
Taurnil - someone suggested Taurnil, but if I added him I would not only need to add at least 3 of him to get him fast, I&#39;d need at least 2 elf bows. Not only that, but he isn&#39;t exactly a strong fighter, so basically in order to get the +2 to possessions(which is HUGE, I agree)I would need to find 5 card slots AND go above 5 companions, which means Leggs is gonna die. It&#39;s not worth it.<br />
<br />
Leg&#39;s Sword/ White Arrows vs. Long Knives and Bow - This is purely a preference thing. Uruk Trackers could be an issue, and if you see them a lot the Long Knives and the Bow might be the best choice over the White Arrows and Leg&#39;s Sword. I like the aggravation factor/manipulation that comes with White Arrows, and Legolas can usually NOT die vs. a minion. Bow of G would help vs. Moria. Another mentioned Elven Sword and that it could keep Legs alive vs. a Steeded Attea. Hmmmm, so I could discard like 6 cards from my hand to keep Legolas alive? Nah, Elven Sword ain&#39;t too good cause you can only use it when the person with the sword is fighting a minion. This deck cycles pretty well on it&#39;s own.<br />
<br />
Saruman, BT and his Staff - I still think that this guy is good if he shows up at the right time. Take away There and Back Again at site 9 to get a kill, kill Help or Trust to win fights you wouldn&#39;t have. He just offers versatility at site 9 that Nazgul do not bring themselves. I know that Palantir Chamber might be better sometimes, but lately people have been bidding low/removing lotsa burdens and making the P Chamber useless. If you are fiercely against Saruman, go with Fortress for 9, another Nelya and another Unferth.<br />
<br />
My Shadow vs. Dauntless Hunter - I thought I explained my strategy vs. another version of this deck, but here it is again: exhaust him with Desert Lord, Relentless Charge. Couldn&#39;t be simpler. <br />
<br />
Aragorn&#39;s Bow - why not? mainly because I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s nescessaary, but getting Gorn bounced can ruin my whole strategy, so I&#39;d rather just do without the bow and be safe from Grima. Yes, it could help vs. Moria, but like I said I haven&#39;t been convinced yet that Moria can work in Standard. I could very well be wrong. If someone can show me a Moria deck that can get around a deck running Eomer and Firefoot + Aragorn HoE that stays below 6 companions, please by all means do. <br />
<br />
Citadel or no Citadel - this card is SO important against Dunlend, and against them it is infinitely better than Aragorn&#39;s Bow. It will only kill one minion, but it is a guaranteed kill when you need. See above reasons for no Bow.<br />
<br />
END EDIT.<br />
<br />
<br />
The SkraTeGy.<br />
<br />
Standard format, a new dillema for all Lord of the Rings players, especially those with dreams of competing at the highest level of competition. By now, everyone has probably played in at least one tournament in Standard, and at least in my experience, the Nazgul are as tough as most feared they would be. So, obviously a deck that will be competitive in Standard must be able to handle Nazgul, not only surviving them but double moving on them. This is not an easy thing. This deck does it, but not only does it do well against Nazgul, it does very well against all of the other strong strategies in Standard. Here’s how.<br />
<br />
Legolas, Dauntless Hunter – this guy is just huge. Not only does he slow down almost all strong minion strategies, but he helps you to assign confidently, since you’ll always if and when your opponent will be able to afford to play a pump card. Often times, your opponent will have to decide between playing a minion or playing a condition, which is absolutely HUGE in the early game, and even more so in the late game.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, Wingfoot – this guy is underplayed, and always has been, until VERY recently. I have seen him begin to spring up on the net in peoples decks, and it makes me glad. Wingfoot makes any deck into a double mover, simply because he destroys whichever minion you could not handle in the skirmish phase and paves the way for a double move. Wingfoot is huge against Dunland, making them save pool for Hides not only for archery and skirmish but for moving as well. Wingfoot also serves the purpose of being Aragorn, the companion with the biggest potential for fighting in the game. Ranger’s Sword and Last Alliance make him capable of defeating all but the biggest minions without any help, and combined with Merry, FtS, you will not lose any skirmishes that you do not decide to lose. Aragorn’s wound while moving ability almost makes your Hobbits effective skirmishers in combination with Stealths, since they don’t die and then Aragorn kills their tormentors.<br />
<br />
Merry, FtS – perhaps the only companion in this deck that IS widely played. Merry is a very efficient companion, because he is a Hobbit and a strength booster. This allows him to be the target of stealth events, subtract from the twilight number of a site with A Talent, add to the twilight cost of events and condition through Legolas and all the time wait around until Aragorn needs his help to kick minion butt.<br />
<br />
Pippin, HoSI – pippin does not do much in this deck aside from making the shadow player mad, but what he does do is crucial. Pippin allows you to bid one more than anyone not playing Pippin and go first, which gets you your Gorn and in turn helps you to double move quicker.<br />
<br />
Elrond, Herald to Gil-Galad - Elrond is truly a pimp. Not only does he have a hot daughter, but he can apparently makes lots of clones of himself that attack Bill S. Preston Esquire. Elrond heals the heck out your fellowship. Not only that, but once he feels pretty, that is, gets his ring, he can take care of any problematic condition that shows up between Fellowship and Maneuver Phases. Elrond also inspires Aragorn to fight harder. Elrond is cool. And a cross dresser....I mean whats with the Tiara?<br />
<br />
Now that I have outlined the players, heres how the deck wins:<br />
<br />
Denial. <br />
<br />
One of the biggest things that changed with the switch to Standard was the loss of No Stranger to the shadows and Aragorn, Heir to the White City. With the loss of these cards, supposedly denial is dead, since all we are left with is Hobbit denial. While it is true that without No Stranger this deck cannot truly choke, it can force an opponent relying on conditions and events to make some tough choices. Bill the Pony and A Talent reduce the site number by 2, which means that once this deck gets set up, which it does quickly, the opponent will receive no more than 11 twilight until site 9, where they get at MOST(assuming they are playing the Fortress) 14. Against a Nazgul deck, 11 pool is enough for one “big” Nazgul such as Attea or Toldea and one “medium” Nazgul such as Cantea or Nelya. If the opponent wants to play a Nazgul that beats Aragorn, which is only the Witch King, then he will arrive alone. Since Morgul Gates is a non-issue thanks to Dauntless Hunter, the opponent must may full price for their Rags. Against any other Shadow strategy, the same is true. Uruks can afford 3 typical Uruks, one of which will die to Aragorn, one of which will most likely wound Legolas twice and one of which will either take an archery and be dealt with by Cliffs, be hidden from via Escape, wound Frodo twice, since I can assign with confidence, or at the worst kill poor useless Pippin. If this happens in the earlier game, Stealths make it an easier thing to handle. Getting the denial aspects of this deck set up quickly are of the utmost importance, and are the reason I am playing 2 of each of the denial cards. <br />
<br />
Solutions.<br />
<br />
This deck has solutions to most of, if not all of, the major Shadow problems in standard. I think the example above deals with Nazgul and Uruk-Hai nicely, but I think some more explanation is needed for others.<br />
<br />
Dunland – Vegas showed everyone how good Dunland can be, and BOHD made them even tougher, since the cheap Dicard guys are tough combined with Constantly Threatening. Thankfully, Dunland is hurt by denial, since they cost as much as Uruks( though they stop roaming sooner) but need twilight to deal with archery. Stealths and Wingfoot make double moving on these guys fairly easy, while Aragorn gets big quick enough to win most fights. If they start controlling sites early, which they shouldn’t, you could be in trouble. Stealths help lots, as does the solitary Citadel of the Stars.<br />
<br />
Moria – Moria lost a lot with the banning of Nertea. I mss him. Because of Dauntless Hunter, Vilya and the Sentinels doubling early should be easy. This should facilitate single moving late, because they have the potential to swarm the heck out of you. Trolls can be tough, but Merry + Gorn + Legolas’ Archery can kill it. Stealths help again. I don’t expect to see a lot of Moria in Standard, but if you do find room for a Thror’s Map to skip the Cavern Entrance. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Sauron – these guys still rely on conditions to be effective. Whether it is for site control, wounds or swarming, Dauntless Hunter will slow the arrival of their conditions. This combined with your choke will keep their minions coming in small numbers, and White Arrows will work a number on them in the earlier game. Watch for Hate.<br />
<br />
Raiders – Easterlings can be trouble, but you can assign with confidence to Frodo again and again, and they will have to save pool for Gathering to the Summons. Southrons are hurt WAY too much by choke to be a problem, especially when you are playing Stealths by the boatload to get a big jump in the race. I don’t expect to see these guys a whole lot, in any form, except as a splash like my Shadow side. If burdens do become an issue, you can always kill off Frodo and give the ring to Sam before too late. <br />
<br />
Uruk Archery – Bwahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Dauntless Hunter makes them overpay for their conditions, which makes them a not-as-good deal, and your non-Gorn companions will be winning skirmishes left and right. Galadriel and Elrond, as well as Legs’ sword, will keep your fighters healed, and Vilya gets around siege engine nicely. This is an easy matchup, without a doubt.<br />
<br />
The only thing I have left to say about the Free Peoples is my comments on the White Arrows. This is one of the most aggravating cards in the Lord of the Rings. This one card can win the game for you. If you get the choke running early this card will kill Shadow cards, which will make double moving easier in the late game, when they run out of cards. If they play most of the cards in their hand, this card makes killing and stopping their Fellowship even easier. You will not use White Arrows in all of your match ups, but the ones you DO use White Arrows in, this single card will make a huge diference.<br />
<br />
Stupid Galadriel is in exclusively to heal Legs and to give me another Elf so Aragorn is bigger.<br />
<br />
Stupid Galadriel.<br />

ShIznaDOw.<br />
<br />
Well, Standard is all about the Nazgul, right? I mean everyone and their Grandmother has been talking about the usefulness of Attea on a Steed at the Wold. While this is a nasty image to think about, most decks that give the pool for that combo are going to be able to handle him. They might even be able to defeat him somehow…..chuckle. Anywho, I hate traveling the road that everyone else is on so I went with the whole Tip/Breath package, except instead of the Breaths I went with WOUNDED. This card is quite nasty. It can be the answer to many problems that the Nazgul can have, such as archery(Gondor Bowmen) skirmishing(No Help!) and support characters(RotN, Boromir, SoD). While it can only play on men, show me a deck that doesn’t have at least one Man in it. The other benefit of running the condition route is that, not only is it not what most are going to prepare for, it is the best counter to what is considered the best culture against Steed Nazgul….Rohan. Get a tip on someone early and watch them die. If you can Tip Eomer, you have the game already. <br />
<br />
The down side to running all these conditions is playing against Dauntless Hunter, who has been quite the popular fellow of late, at least in my area. That is the reason I have included 2 copies of Des(s)ert Lord and of Relentless Charge, to take out the pansy Elf ASAP. These cards will prove usefull against other archery decks, and also prove useful in exhausting a Tipped person, causing them to die on the following turn. Des(s)ert Lord is also a decent minion all around, and causes more wounds than a typical <br />
Nazgul on a good day.<br />
Heres the lineup!<br />
<br />
The Witch King, LoA – well, what else can I say? It’s good to be Da King, but also expensive to be him. While the Witch King has the potential to be the biggest Nazgul, he will not always be the preferable play. He will get a stop a lot of times, but you may not be able to afford him early on, thus only 2 copies.<br />
<br />
Ulaire Attea – this guy is the buzz lately. He has the ability to overwhelm almost anyone without a weapon, and most with one. He is also the bane of any deck running Gandalf, TWW since he can steal enough twilight to shrink the silly old man to tiny proportions. 4 may seem like a lot of a unique minion, but you will not be swarming with this deck and usually when you want to play a minion, Attea is a good choice.<br />
<br />
Ulaire Cantea – take the weapons, chew them well and watch your opponent be unable to win fights against him. Crucial to winning against Frodo in the late game, and in making your opponent think in the game against you, which is mean. <br />
<br />
Tom Berenger – he’s a Sniper! C’mon, tell me you got the joke! Anywho, Enquea is a straight up pimp now that Flaming Brand is gone. Not only does he have tons of vitality, but he is crowd control, a Nazgul that’s tough to kill and a cheesy movie reference all in one. SOOO important to winning against large fellowships, and it’s too good to pass up drawing him opening hand and smacking up an opponent who started disposable people to go first. <br />
<br />
Toldea –meh, he doesn’t do much anymore. When he DOES do something, it’ll be really cool, but he won’t do anything special most of the time. Someday, this guy’ll be replaced with a Black Rider. The threat of Toldea is much greater than Toldea himself, much like Grima, CC, except that Toldea wins skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Nelya – originally, I couldn’t find a second Unferth to put in, so I put in Nelya. I don’t really need the second Unferth, so Nelya fits nicely. He’s better than the Twilight Dummy cause he’s always fierce, and he can be useful in switching sites to hurt my opponent if they happen to be playing Path Control. He’s a decent minion, but a Black Rider would be better J<br />
<br />
Grima, W – exert to Wound, that’s the purpose. If you happen to be able to bounce someone, more power to ya. Shifty.<br />
<br />
Unferth – see above description, except it’s cool to play him and Griam and cause 2 wounds.<br />
<br />
Saruman, BT – better than just about any Nazgul at site 9, since he only costs 4 with his Staff at the Balcony. Gets rid of a condition and is a decent little fella all around.<br />
<br />
Matchups are mostly the same, special instruction included below:<br />
<br />
Hobbits – pretty easy, since they can only hold so many Stealths. Your fellowship will ALWAYS outrun them, but they can clog you a little bit with the denial that is still available to them.<br />
<br />
Dauntless Hunter – Relentless Charge plus Des(s)ert Lord = Dead Elf.<br />
<br />
Archery – save the charges until you can kill at least 2 archers. Wounded will help, as Chris Tubman says, keep the Bowmen in their support area.<br />
<br />
Rohan – can be tough, but wounded and Des(s)ert Lord make any exerting hard to do. If it’s the Rohan Circus put a Wounded(or 2) on Theoden and then Grima him and watch him die. The Laugh.<br />
<br />
Gondor – if it’s Ringbound, you’ll hurt them a great deal at site 2 and 3. Most Ringbound decks run 9 companions, so Enquea will be huge. Don’t be a fool, kill the Gondorian Rangers so they canoot keep you roaming, and therefore cannot win skirmishes. It it’s Knights, you’re alright. Knights suck against everyone but Wargs and Dunland. <br />
<br />
Gandalf – Trust can be problematic. Luckily, Trust takes a while to get set up and gives a ton of pool, allowing you to dump Nazgul and stop them. Make sure you run with the fellowship, cause as soon as they get set up it’s gonna be tough to win fights. If they play White Wizard, Attea owns him. Gandrawlf(BadBeef, essentially) is going to try and set up the Shadow, but Nazgul are a tough Matchup for the Beef since they need twice the Stealths, and you have 3 Enqueas. <br />
<br />
Well, that appears to be everything, although I know I have missed some thing. I believe that this might be the best choice for Standard, although obviously it has some weaknesses. I don’t wanna list them, I’ll leave that up to the people who aren’t me. I’ll try my best to keep up with the updates on this deck, though I didn’t on the last one. <br />
<br />
Feel free as usually to D-Mail or E-mail me with any questions you might have about the deck, I hate having to delete stupid reviews, and since I went and bought the Morgul Blade I can’t spare the Tech Points. Thanks in advance for any help or compliments you give, and I hope you enjoy the deck.<br />
<br />
Later.<br />
