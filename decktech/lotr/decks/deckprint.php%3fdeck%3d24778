It&#39;s different from most of the other tournament decks you&#39;ll see, but it wins and it&#39;s fun. I don&#39;t know what more you can ask for! The fellowship uses its ally contingent to move quickly while using a few other tricks to win just about every skirmish. The Shadow side piles on burdens and overwhelms companions by the bucketloads. <br>
<br>
It&#39;s not really necessary to go first in this deck. Your starting site allows you to pull Gaffer, but it&#39;s not necessary to your game. In fact, it&#39;s a good idea not to bid high as the deck has only one type of burden removal &#8211; Narya. The shadow side of the deck should be able to slow your opponent down to where you can pass them by. <br>
<br>
The first thing to notice about the fellowship in this deck is that every companion (except Gandalf) has the Gandalf Signet. This allows you to use Trust Me As You Once Did to great effect. With his Staff and Narya, Gandalf can afford to exert a lot &#8211; even though you won&#39;t often need to &#8211; every character is a strong fighter on their own. Once you get Gwemegil and Asfaloth on Arwen with the Elven Ally Train running, she can overwhelm any strength 8 minion. Aragorn is in the deck, not as a constant companion, but as a Get Out Of Jail Free card. If you are facing a horde of minions, exert Aragon several times and have him take on as many minions as you need him too. The allies in this deck all have important roles to play. Aside from the benefits of Arwen&#39;s text, they can be used to further your quest along the path. Elrond&#39;s ability to heal a companion during the Regroup phase makes him one of the strongest cards in the ROTEL set. Often, he will be healing Gandalf of exertions. Elrond can also be used as condition removal once you get his ring out. Golradir and Saelbeth both will help your companions win skirmishes. Galdor will make sure that if your opponents want to face you down with a Witch-king or Cave Troll at consecutive sites, they&#39;ll have to pay for it! <br>
<br>
Burdens are a hard strategy to play &#8211; you have to continually punish your opponent with them. You have to make him race to you the end of the path so he does not have time to heal the burdens or remove conditions. While he is racing he will hit a lot of big minions. The Orc Pillager is a great minion to play against those ranger decks or Dwarf decks that load one or two companions down with a mass of conditions and possessions. He basically negates Flaming Brands and Hand Axes, and penalizes your opponent for carrying things like Armor, Aragorn&#39;s Bow, or Endurance of Dwarves. With a base strength of 10, a few burdens and an Enduring Evil should overwhelm any companion. There are two primary ways to add burdens in this deck &#8211; Desperate Defense of the Ring and Gleaming in the Snow. Gleaming in the Snow keys off the idea that your opponent will play a Gondor companion &#8211; these days you are likely to see at least one of them. All your minions have high vitality and high strength, ensuring that someone will be around to exert during Regroup. Just in case you get hit with A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, you&#39;ve got Orc Scouts to protect you. <br>
<br>
Using your Shadow to scare your opponent into moving slow, you should be able to get out in front and outrace him to the end of the path. If you get lucky &#8211; you may get a corruption win as well. Either way, you&#39;ll play something different than your opponent! <br>
