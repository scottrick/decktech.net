This deck used to run 2 copies of a talent, but as you all know, I cant use that anymore . I switched in 2 more copies of narrow escape as the substitute, and boy did I ever make the right desicion. Although the choking abilities of a talent will be missed, narrow escape is much better in my mind. I will explain why in a bit.<br />
<br />
Here is some card break down;<br />
<br />
Frodo Ra: I obviously chose this frodo for the choke deck.<br />
<br />
Sam Gew: is there another sam?<br />
<br />
Merry Fts: Should get the first narrow escape and the last sword, he is great in a fix.<br />
<br />
Pippin: The real star of the deck! I love choking my opponent so much so that he can only play out 1 big minion, and then sending that minion to hell with pippin make haste combo. When you play pippin again you get some healing or burden removal. Yay!<br />
<br />
The narrow escapes are their for the double move (as well as DITM) and to stop grond and issy orcs. also comes in handy if facing that wraith card, shapes slowly advancing.<br />
<br />
This deck is very fun too play and is quite tough, but if ninja gollum is popular in your area, I suggest throwing in some clever hobbits.<br />
<br />
The shadow side is based on the new orc corruption decks that seem too be growing in popularity.<br />
<br />
Its pretty simple:  Bound to its fate will hopefully add burdens most of the time. Isengard underling allows you to reuse bound to its fate. Goblin hordes allows you too resuse isengard underling.<br />
<br />
Porter troll, mocking goblin, and orc miscreant also add to the eventual corruption of your opponent.<br />
<br />
If your opponent is playing with alot of events, you may have a problem, most decks dont though.<br />
<br />
I have never faced elvent with this deck, I have a feeling it might be a problem, so if those decks are played alot  you might want to stick in some undisiplined and entrapping orc to deal with the little hoe. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
