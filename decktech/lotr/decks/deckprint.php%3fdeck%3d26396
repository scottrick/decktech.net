I’ve seen a lot of decks lately that say “Ring-Bound Rangers with Uruks” or “Rohan Beatdown with Dunland”.  Nobody is really taking advantage of the awesome combinations that exist between cultures - Uruk AND Dunalnd Site Control, anyone?  Easterlings and Nazgul?  Where are these decks?<br />
<br />
For my deck, I’ve chosen two great combinations - Rohan Beatdown with Fellowship Mega Archery, and Uruk-Hai Undirected and Southron Directed Archery.  Lots of Archery, basically.  More of an article for the strategy section, here’s how it goes:<br />
<br />
Bid low, 1-2.  We don’t want to give burden/Nazgul decks a head start.  Go first if you get the choice.  If you get the Riddermark, play Aragorn.  Feel free to play more companions, but don’t get too excessive with the twilight.  Any mounts you get go to their respective companions.  With Symbelmine, you should be able to get set up fairly early.  Use it to get Eomer’s spear, then Firefoot, then it just depends on what you need and what you have.  King’s Mail is great, too, and should go on Eomer.<br />
<br />
For the fellowship, once Eomer has a mount and a spear and backup, he can kill just about anything, as a 4-wound companion.  Legolas is there to make a stray Lurtz -1, and to get his double shot archery on for more strength bonuses to Eomer and the Elite Riders, and even use Bow of the Galadrhim with the Long Knives, if necessary, to finish off exhausted minions.  3 of him in there because he will take a lot of wounds and exertions, so healing is a must, but feel free to sacrifice him at any time - he is not at all key, just useful.  Aragorn is his big brother - once he breaks out the bow, the brand, and the sword, he can shoot stuff down and finish off the rest with power 11 death.  I chose Heir to the White City to reduce the twilight that I give off.  With so many possessions and cost 2-3 companions, -2 every turn can cut down a minion, or a least force them to choose a less beastly Uruk.  He’s also in there for Gondor Bowmen, which is just an awesome card.  The general idea is to use some mega archery to kill things, and have everything else exhausted for Eomer to finish.  4x Symbelmine insures that you’ll be well set up very early.  The Elite Riders are great against high vitality minions - Got a Troop problem?  A shot or two from Lego and the Bow, and an exert from the mount makes your Elite Rider power 10-12 against him - Eomer doesn’t even enter into it.<br />
<br />
Against Uruks, your four companions should be Eomer, Legolas, Aragorn, and Frodo, until you spot the 3rd savagery.  Lose the Elite Rider somewhere - he’s nice, but not awesome enough to warrant getting Savageried to death.  Plus, if Lego dies, you have another in your deck.  If your opponent is not playing or using burdens, don’t play Sam.  Why give off the extra 3 twilight when you can just as easily discard him at the end of your turn?<br />
<br />
Matchups for fellowship:<br />
<br />
Nazgul - move 1 site at a time through the early sites.  Your archery and Eomer and Flaming Brand should be enough to make double moving very easy.<br />
<br />
Burdens - Double move like crazy to prevent them from getting their burden-adding cards out, and shoot down anything that will add a burden.  If it’s conditions, play more companions, but watch out for Enquea.<br />
<br />
Archery - Could be tough, but you have directed stuff, and archery shouldn‘t be winning too many skirmishes.  Use Aragorn to gun down minions that add a lot of archery/direct archery.  Double move to sanctuaries, and take a few burdens with IB.<br />
<br />
Uruk Beatdown - Eomer beatdown.  More vitality = more death to the minions, and anything terrible can die from Bowmen/Double Shot.<br />
<br />
Site Control - With Uruks, same as Uruk beatdown for the most part.  Dunland, unfortunately, has lots of low vitality minions.  Shoot them.  Specifically gun down anything that says “Take control of a site”.  Save the Gondor Bowmen for when Dunland tries to swarm you.<br />
<br />
Moria Swarm - Not as effective with the new sites, but the archery and the large number of companions should handle it anyway.<br />
<br />
For the shadow, it’s simple.  Your Uruks with Weapons of Isengard are archery machines that can skirmish as well, meanwhile you can exhaust powerful companions with Southrons.  Basically, play WoI as you get them, and then play 2 Uruk archers.  If you get 2 cost 3 archers, 2 WoIs, then you have, for 8 shadow, 6 archery, and 2 power 8 damage +1 minions.  Use the Southrons to prevent characters from using special abilities, like Aragorn’s Bow, Trust Me, etc.  Leave yourself a little shadow, and play Whirling Strike to finish off exhausted companions.<br />
<br />
Generally, when playing against an archery deck, your opponent will try to drop as many companions as possible, as wound sinks.  Thus, our Uruks must be savage enough to match their numbers.  Once Savagery shows up, your opponent will definitely think twice about playing that extra Faramir or Boromir, which is exactly what you want - less companions = less vitality = more archery death.  Also added in recently was the Southron Commander, who is basically Enquea, but can’t really be killed by directed archery.<br />
<br />
Tech - you can play the bows on your Southron Archers, and they can exert and still add to the archery total.  But it’s better to play on the commander.<br />
<br />
Against Trust, this archery just rocks.  Savagery and the commander keeps the companion count down, while the archery adds up on poor G-Man, with Whirling Strike to finish him.  Southrons take away his ability to dish +3 strength bonuses very quickly.  Trust decks have never been known for their healing capacity.<br />
<br />
This deck is fresh out of the pot, and needs some playtesting.  Unfortunately, my friends don&#39;t like proxies and I&#39;m broke.  So if anyone wants to build this deck, tech it up for a tourney, please D-Mail me and let me know how it goes.<br />
<br />
Your sites:<br />
1 - Grab the ‘gorn<br />
2 - Sanctuary if you got Nazgulled<br />
3 - If you’re not already fully mounted, you are now.<br />
4 - If they get here first, it prevents them from playing extra companions, good for your archery, slows them down, too.<br />
5 - More fellowship archery.  Use your Southron’s directed stuff at this site.<br />
6 - Get set up for the final run, and draw cards for it.<br />
7 - Extra Archery<br />
8 - Not much choice/Still a nice site.<br />
9 - Isildur’s Bane will take a lot of burdens from undirected archery.  You can play a Commander to remove some last minute companions, or you can beef up your archery total, or you can get the directed stuff on, or you can play an Uruk or two to trigger Weapons of Isengard.  It lets you pick and choose your minions depending on the situation.   NOTE:  If they’re at 8 burdens w/ exhausted Frodo, then leave the burdens.  If Frodo loses his skirmish, you will win that way.  If that doesn’t look like a problem, leave him.<br />
