<br />
Sick of the typical “power” decks? Want to play something different? Don’t want to sell the family car to make another deck? This deck is for you. An all Hobbit deck that contains no rares. Only a Hobbit would be brave enough to try this. And it’s fun!<br />
<br />
What is the typical deck today? A large number of very strong and powerful characters who beat the minions consistently in one to one combat or who give them so many wounds that they never reach the end of the combat. There are so many tough decks out there with such strong characters that it is time for a change of pace. Instead this deck uses very few characters and all of them are weak.<br />
<br />
This is a deck for beginners and teaches them some important concepts and strategies. That does not mean it is a simple deck to play. Even an advanced player will often have quite a bit of thinking to do in order to get through each turn alive. This deck is so much fun to play that even if you never play it in a tournament you will often get it out when sitting round for a casual game or two.<br />
<br />
Companions<br />
Frodo, Son of Drogo can be healed by Merry and Pippen who don’t need their wounds anyway. Needs to exert to discard Merry so needs a way to get those exertions back. Seems only fair that Merry repays the debt by healing Frodo and allowing the cycle to continue.<br />
<br />
Sam, Son of Hamfast gets rid of burdens created by Pippen. Never put a wound on Sam lightly as he needs every bit of burden removal he can provide.<br />
<br />
Merry, Learned Guide heals Frodo, lines up against the biggest nastiest minion in a skirmish, exerts Frodo to be discarded, is played again, heals Frodo etc.<br />
<br />
Pippen, Wolly-footed Rascal fairly much the same as Merry but adds burdens which Sam must remove. Can heal Frodo. <br />
<br />
Strategy Tip: This is the advanced tip that beginners need to learn for this deck. While you are resolving one skirmish you can do things in another skirmish that hasn’t happened yet. For example at site 3 Frodo is fighting one Dunlending and Merry another one. Both Dunlendings will become fierce if they win. You don’t want this. If a skirmish is cancelled no-one wins. If one side is discarded DURING a skirmish the other side wins. So you start Frodo’s skirmish. First action discard Merry. As his skirmish hasn’t started yet no-one wins. Next action play Swiftly and Softly to cancel Frodo’s skirmish. No Dunlending won a skirmish so none will become fierce. Neat hey?<br />
<br />
Allies<br />
Bounder can save you the game – once. Well worth one card slot.<br />
<br />
Filbert Bolger is yet another way to avoid some skirmishes, especially against those really nasty minions that you used stealth or a discarding Hobbit against to cancel the first battle. <br />
<br />
Bilbo Baggins, WsG is almost your only condition removal. He is of little value against certain deck types but crucial against others. Only use him to get rid of big problem conditions like Worry, They are Coming, a loaded swarm, No Retreat,  Pillage of Rohan, Attack on Helm’s Deep with counters, etc.<br />
<br />
Hobbit Party Guest can be completely useless but is crucial in combination with Three Monstrous Trolls against certain minion types like Moria and Easterlings who attempt to add tokens to the pool. He also can heal Filbert or Bilbo if needed. If he is useless just throw him away for They are Coming.<br />
<br />
Thrarin, DS is not a Hobbit but is one of the few things you have to try and survive if your opponent plays one of the 2 most feared cards against you. There are 2 cards that really destroy this deck: Snows of Saruman and Cavern Entrance. When you encounter one of them, use Tharin, There and Back Again and prey.<br />
<br />
<br />
Possessions<br />
Hobbit Swords are for Frodo and Sam. I don’t give one to Merry or Pippen until the game is nearly over.<br />
<br />
Frying Pan is so good against Orcs and Moria is one of the most dangerous foes for the Hobbits and it looks like Sauron will be back so this is great. Don’t forget to share it around a bit. You MUST kill scavengers and runners and not allow them to stack onto Goblin Swarms.<br />
<br />
Bill the Pony saves you twilight, can be the difference between one more minion.<br />
<br />
Conditions<br />
A Talent for Not Being Seen saves you 2 twilight per site. A fantastic card, you could easily put two in here.<br />
Three Monstrous Trolls as noted on the Hobbit Party Guest the gametext will sometimes be crucial but often will be a bit useless. At worst it is a cost 0 tale that Bilbo can use to discard a shadow condition.<br />
There and Back Again protects your Hobbits when everything is going badly and is one of the few things that will help at the Cavern Entrance. Can also be used by Bilbo.<br />
<br />
Events<br />
<br />
Seven We Had is the only way for Hobbits to remove conditions like Black Breath, Blade Tip, Desperate Defense of the Ring or You Bring Great Evil. If this looks unlikely dump it on They are Coming.<br />
Severed His Bonds is your first line of defense. Cancel skirmishes up to site 4 and make them triple you after.<br />
Swiftly and Softly cancels up to site 5 and while less useful after don’t ignore it as you can often survive a fight against an Uruk-Hai by taking less wounds.<br />
Hobbit Intuition a +3 pump at any site that makes overwhelming much harder.<br />
Dagger Strike only +2 but the damage +1 often means a dead minion and a much better chance to move on.<br />
Knocked on the Head lets Merry and Pippen come into play many, many times and even be discarded twice in a double move. <br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
The aim of the shadow is not to kill everyone or even win the game. It first of all lets you have the best chance of extending your hand and then clearing your hand of shadow cards to set up your Hobbits with all of the events they will need. Second it often stops very strong fellowships who cannot be beaten in single combat but who fear an overwhelm on Frodo. It does struggle a bit against Trust Me.<br />
 <br />
Goblin Flankers are very cheap on the double move, making your opponent think about stopping.<br />
Goblin Runner add twilight. Awesome.<br />
Moria Scout spot an Elf to play for free. 2 vitality make great archery protection as well as a chance of surviving the first round.<br />
Goblin Scavengers always the backbone. Here they can scavenge spears as well as scimitars.<br />
Goblin Spearman this is the unusual choice. Give them a spear and for 3 twilight you have a damage +2 minion. They rarely win but your opponent must always deal with them seriously allowing others to do their job. Usually a directed archery magnet.<br />
Goblin Scrabbler kill an Elf condition – Shoulder to Shoulder, Last Alliance, Tale of GG. Splendor or their Banners etc. You will see many.<br />
Goblin Warrior kill a Dwarf condition or Tharin. Will not see as much use but in the occasional game will prove of great value.<br />
Goblin Scimitar makes your Orc +2, and gives a card for a cost of 0.<br />
Goblin Spear makes your Spearmen into killing machines.<br />
They are Coming lets you drop any useless cards, create a viable swarm or just clear your hand.<br />
Plundered Armories lets you play your weapons instantly again when your minion dies – a common event for the Spearmen.<br />
Host of Thousands always good.<br />
Unfamiliar Territory pump against archers. Spearmen need pumps a few people expect Moria pumps.<br />
Drums in the Deep same but a bit of variety.<br />
Ulaire Enquea is always needed by Moria. The number 1 defense against Moria is lost of companions. He fixes this problem.<br />
Ulaire Nertea is the only shadow card that you might want to hang onto. He gives you the best chance of an overwhelm against a large fellowship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sites<br />
[1] Eastemnet Downs denies your opponent Aragorn, Legolas or Gimli. It also slightly punishes anyone that has a lot of companions to play and might even prevent them from playing them helping your swarm.<br />
[2] Plains of Rohan Camp is there to help your Hobbits rather than hurt your opponent.<br />
[3] Golden Hall can really hurt the unprepared. You are prepared.<br />
[4] White Rocks is a safe bet that will never hurt you.<br />
[5] Helm’s Gate by now Frodo should have a sword and many of your minions also will.<br />
[6] Hornburg Armory is better than the other two.<br />
[7] King’s Room can devastate your opponents if they have not been lucky enough to draw a Rohan companion yet. Fear of this can also make them go to 6 companions allowing Enquea to kick in.<br />
[8] Wizard’s Vale is better than the Ring of Isengard?<br />
[9] Palantir Chamber. As long as they have at least 2 burdens you can replay Nertea who lets you replay even more minions making the overwhelm possible.<br />
<br />
If you could add one rare it would be Get on and Get Away to avoid the Cavern Entrance.<br />
<br />
This is such a different style of deck to play and is so much fun that you will play it again and again. It is a great way for beginners to create a deck that is cheap, fun and can win. I have played this deck MANY times against people using their best decks with 20+ rares and I regularly win. Try it. The Hiding Hobbits go to Hell but the just keep on coming back again. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
