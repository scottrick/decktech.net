<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
This deck plays Frodo and 5 strong companions, all with some kind of support, designed to keep moving.  I almost always bid one or two, if I go first, great, if not, have fun getting to Rivendell:)  The reason that my support cards are things like Defiance, Last Alliance, etc. are because they can be used by more than one member of my Fellowship, in case one or the other isn&#39;t out or has died.  I&#39;m prepared to lose one or two of my companions along the way, since I will never have more than 5 companions in play at any one time -- 6 is the risky number (Enquea, Greed, etc.).  My least supported companion would actually be Gandalf -- he&#39;s in there purely for Sleep (against Sauron and Moria) and to soak up minions.  If I don&#39;t get Sleep, he&#39;s also there to exert and soak Orc Bowmen archery.  Either way, he helps:)  The reason I use rotating, strong companions is because I don&#39;t like decks based on just one character -- for example, I&#39;ve SEEN what happens to a Gandalf deck that loses Gandalf early, due toi bad judgement or even plain old bad luck.  I prefer a more widely distributed load, that way if one pillar buckles the others can adjust to compensate.  The Mirror&#39;s in there because I already had Galadriel and Celeborn for Rumil-healing and fodder pulling out of the Bridge, so I can take it in a double.  I also use my Nelyas and Maps to make sure my forest/river sites are out for ARV.  Oh and ARMOR!  It&#39;s money.  Rare Boromir with armor can survive the Cave-Troll, Lurtz... or the Balrog, for that matter:)  Comes in handy on Aragorn, too.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The Shadow half is pure, quick power.  Most of the Nazgul support I play, I play to combat A Ranger&#39;s Versatility and archery (Relentless Charge, Wreathed in Shadow, All Blades Perish, Beauty is Fading for Aragorn&#39;s Bow.  Or the Mirror, for that matter).  Morgul Gates lets me bring them out relatively cheaply, and very, very rarely do I have a Fellowship make the double move to site 3.  If they have lots of Fellowship support out, they gave me enough to drop a pair... and if they have no support, just one can be enough.  I&#39;m rather fanatical on the idea of site control, so if I end up gong first I can generally make sure my site 3 is out.  Nothing intimidates like looking ahead at the Ford while there&#39;s already a Nazgul floating around... Nertea is there because he&#39;s cheap (lots of times you&#39;ll be a twilight or two short to drop 2 biggies) and he can also help when you get stuck with a bad Shadow hand (pull one from the discard pile). <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
74 cards may be a little on the big side, but almost EVERYTHING in the deck is useful (at least half the time:) and I have Gwemegil in case I get some sort of ungodly unbalanced or bad hand.  Because my Fellowship is so balanced, and most support cards CAN be used to bolster more than one companion, I very, very rarely get caught with cards I can&#39;t use in my hand.  My meta is also starting to lean towards discard decks, as well.  I&#39;ve played with it smaller several times, the deck would lose on occasion, and always because of something that I HAD had in the deck and taken out.  As far as my elven allies go, they have saved me too many times going into Lorien to take them out of the deck (the Bridge, as everyone knows, is a very painful site).  That is a crucial double move that the deck has to be able to do.  And maybe it&#39;s my luck, but I&#39;ll get the Mirror combo working in at least 50% of my games, and late game is when it can be the most deadly.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
Anyway, the basic, basic premise of the deck is to move twice on your turns while you limit your opponent to one move on their turn.  I went undefeated at my last tournament, winning 2 games by overwhelming my opponent and 3 by reaching site 9.  In either case, NO-ONE made it past site 7.  NO-ONE.  And that is exactly what the deck is designed to do, both overwhelms were due to me pulling away far enough that my opponent tried a very unwise double move to try and catch up.  This is exactly what this deck is designed to do.<br />
<br />
<br><br />
Aside from one very, very bad day when I decided to play in the first tournament I ever ran (bad, bad idea), this deck, and the variants of it I&#39;ve played, are undefeated in tournament play (4-0, 4-0, 5-0).  And as an additonal bonus, this deck is a ton of fun to play:)  Something new happens every game, some new combo, some new play, some new trick that keeps it infinitely interesting.  I&#39;m not sure how startlingly new or original or anything the deck is (not very, I suspect), but it&#39;s what I know and what I play, so it&#39;s what I post.  Enough people asked me for the decklist for me to try my luck posting it.  Feedback is welcome. <br />
