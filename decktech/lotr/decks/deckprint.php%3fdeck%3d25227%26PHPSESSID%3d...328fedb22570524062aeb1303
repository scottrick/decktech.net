Yes it is a 72 card deck.  You will get what you need and get set up in time to beat urks.  I played 8 games that day and 6 of them were against urks.  I didn&#39;t lose a single game against them.  You have to discard a card every turn.  You need to use the stealths to keep your companions from biting it before they get setup.  There are 3 companions that can fight.  Frodo can even fight at later sights if you need him to using the stealths to keep him from being overwhelmed.  The deck does work as long as you play smart.  Zwitter obviously doesn&#39;t or at least doesn&#39;t read the strat section.  This is a proven deck.  It did well losing only to a moria swarm deck at site 9.<br />
<center>********END UPDATE********</center><br />
<br />
This is an update of "Hag&#39;s Pile &#39;O Nazgul" to accomidate for ROTEL.  I&#39;ll first go over the changes.<br />
<br />
With the erratta on the mirror and the fact that its pretty much worthless now, it seems that I was a bit ahead of my time with this deck.  <br />
<br />
FELLOWSHIP:<br />
<br />
Take out:  The Galadriel that heals the allies and the archer allies.<br />
Put in: Galadriel (ROTEL) and Elrond (ROTEL) these allies will help keep your fellowship alive longer so that you can run faster.  <br />
<br />
Take out:  2 ARV&#39;s <br />
Put in:  Arwen&#39;s Fate.  This card may look like complete Jank, but it adds a little bit of Tech to the deck.  Whoever is winning the skirmish (Aragorn/Arwen) then use it to help the other out.  Also great when opponent uses 2 pump cards to beat you and you play your own to kill them.<br />
<br />
SHADOW:<br />
<br />
Take out: Beauty is Fading, 1x Not Easily Destroyed and 1x All Blades Perish<br />
*Put in:  Too Great and Terrible x3,  Fear x3 or Relentless Persuit x3.  You will want to select here whatever you would expect to see in your local gaming area.  For day 2 I thought that I would see a lot of Gandalf decks and so I selected Too Great and Terrible.  It was the wrong choice as Fear would have won my games for me.  <br />
<br />
The Fellowship in this deck is the same that was in my day 1 Comicon deck that helped me take 2nd on day 1 out of 96 people and also took my friend Cortney Haggerty to #1 that day after 8 games.  Seems pretty good considering that among the attendees there were some pretty big names such as Clint Hays, Kyle Craft, John Arendt, Gabe Alonso, Matt Berta and Alfred Dong, among many others.  <br />
<br />
Why no Boromir? Boromir is the 5th companion. When playtesting this deck with Hag and Nathan, we found that Uruk-hai rely heavily on their opponent having 5 companions. Without 5 they pretty much fall apart as they have a harder time winning their skirmishes and are fierce less of the time. You may be saying well then why Sam?? Sam is in the deck to die, plain and simple. If you get him early he can stealth at the bridge, taking on the cave troll, Balrog, etc. And then since his ability lasts until the regroup phase, he can take them again and die. He is also really good if you get him later as he can dirtnap it at site 7, 8 or 9 by going defender +1 and taking out two minions. He&#39;s better than Boromir as most people try to keep Boromir around, but you just don&#39;t need the traitor anyways. And since we expected to see a lot of Uruk-hai, this seemed like the deck to play. <br />
<br />
Why the ROTEL Elrond and not the FOTR Elrond. The deck cycles pretty good anyways with Gwemigil and pitching a card every turn. Pitching a card every turn is key to the decks survival. It makes it work so much better and faster, plus it helps you get through your deck quickly and efficiently. Drawing an extra card a turn is not as efficent as being able to heal any companion each turn.  It lets you sting more, use Arwens Fate more, gives you more archery with Legolas or Aragorn, it just makes the deck all around more versatile.<br />
<br />
How to play the game with this deck. I usually end up bidding 0 - 1, depending on my opponent and what I think my opponent will be doing (duh). If given the option, I will go first, it guarentees me Aragorn and I&#39;m already ahead, win win situation. Don&#39;t worry about getting your sties out, Nelya can do that for you so your opponent will still have a tough time getting to the Sanctuary. If I lose the bid and end up going second to a deck that doesn&#39;t start the Prancing Pony, I&#39;m not worried as there are 3 aragorns in the deck, you will have him by site 4. This just gives your opponent less twilight to play their minions with and the "Wonder Twins" can pretty much walk to site 3 with no problem. <br />
<br />
At the sanctuary you will move to site 4 and stop, unless you can tell that they are totally getting screwed and then move to 5. Sam can help at the bridge as can Thrarin if you need him. The double jump from 4 to 6 is more difficult now that you don&#39;t have any site 6 archer allies to help you out.  Be cautious, but you should be able to accomplishimmer with elrond healing you and Galadriel being able to fight at site 6.  With the demise of the mirror, I felt it was better to use the healing elves that help my fellowship move as opposed to the archer allies who compliment the Mirror of Galadriel so well.  I also didn&#39;t want to be using the mirror as I felt that it was still needing to be fixed and didn&#39;t want to play that way.<br />
<br />
A little bit of added tech here, if you draw Asfaloth before you go underground, give it to Galadriel and then transfer it to Arwen when you come out from the bridge. Mad tech going on here. <br />
<br />
The shadow in this deck is pretty standard. I love Cantea. Nobody likes seeing him come down and usually don&#39;t move against him. The All Blades Perish and Not Easily Destroyed pretty much are for heavy archer decks, although if they have a huge fellowship you can drop Enquea and with the Not Easily Destroyed he acts like a virtual machine gun as long as they have 6 companions. Kill whoever you want, Aragorn, Gandalf, the possibilities are endless. <br />
<br />
If you have any questions regarding the deck or the strategy, D-mail me and I&#39;ll be happy to answer them. If there is something you don&#39;t understand, don&#39;t just rate the deck poorly because you don&#39;t understand it. Ask me. I&#39;m more than willing to explain it. <br />
