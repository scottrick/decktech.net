90 Cards!?!?!  <br />
I use lots of doubles and triples that I can discard with they are coming which kills two birds with one stone... I play everything except Power Accordings, Valiant Mans and ARVs pretty much as I get them, so my hand doesn&#39;t get choked easily (don&#39;t allow these cards to choke your hand if you don&#39;t really have use for them), so I cycle through my cards pretty easily, also with a little help from my goblin scabs, I mean Scavengers, and Scimitars...<br />
<br />
Free Peoples:<br />
<br />
I think by looking at the deck you can see, this deck gives off hardly any twilight at all yet is still built to run, like the wind!<br />
<br />
Card choice is the main thing I should probably explain:<br />
<br />
Bilbo with Stone trolls and Consorting with Wizards is a powerful twilight and condition remover, as well as powering up Aragorn and Frodo if need be.<br />
<br />
Coat of Mail/Valiant Man/Armor/Swordarm:<br />
GREAT combos here... with a coat of mail, you can use all the Valiant man&#39;s you want, good luck to the shadow player in over-whelming you.  Armor should be played against Uruk-hai though... it&#39;s more important that your Aragorn take tops 2 wounds each move than making him hard to over-whelm.  You shouldn&#39;t be giving up enough twilight for an Uruk-hai deck to overwhelm you anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;Paranoia cards&quot;<br />
Already explained armor...<br />
ARV, to survive sites 7-9.  I don&#39;t mind losing Aragorn at site 8, because chances are with a PATH or 2 and a bounder out, you still win... but losing Aragorn at site 7 is pretty deadly...  <br />
Stealths are for the Balrog, Witch-King, CaveTroll, etc... I like wasting other people&#39;s big minions...<br />
Swordarms are a &quot;just in case&quot;, a +4 boost can help you actually win a skirmish, or keep you alive against a swarm.  (A smart swarm player would swarm Aragorn if given the chance...)<br />
Power Accordings... go into site nine with just Frodo and 2 PATHS... with one bounder out, I guarantee victory!  Keep paths unless you absolutely need them, because site 9 is the only tough site you&#39;ll see after the Ford...<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t think this shadow deck is half as well put together as the Free Peoples, but that said, I thought a Moria Swarm was the best compliment to the deck, mostly because of deck size and They are Coming discards...<br />
<br />
Please Rate my deck and please let me know what I could change on the shadow side to make it more powerful.  I don&#39;t have a Cave Troll yet, but I would probably rather stay away from using him just because he is kinda counter strategic, as far as massive discards, and twilight usage is concerned.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
