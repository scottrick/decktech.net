<br />
Free Peoples<br />
<br />
The goal of the Fellowship is to protect Frodo at all cost.  Protection comes with Sting, which gives strength +2 and I can exert Frodo to reveal an opponents hand.  This comes in handy against moria sworms, since you will probably only have 3 members in your fellowship.  Bounder is great and the rare Frodo heals him every turn and Boromir can exert to add 3 to Frodo if things get out of hand.  That means your opponent would need 27 to overwhelm Frodo, assuming they don&#39;t play any events.<br />
<br />
The rare Aragorn is broken.  Atleast that&#8217;s what most of my opponents are probably thinking when I make my two site jump.  I did this in a multiplayer game.  I had to make the jump to site 9 cause another fellowship was at site 9 and it had 5 members.  No one was going to stop that.  So I went for it.  I had saved three events that could target Aragorn.  Arwen is killed at 8 and only Frodo and Aragorn [he only has 1 wound] are left.  I move to site 9 and my opponents deploy three Nazguls.  I exert Aragorn twice to make him defender +2 til the regroup phase.  I play my events to make Aragorn strength of 20.  Aragorn 8, sword +2, +2, +4, +4.  20 to the 36.  He is not overwhelmed and he only takes one wound because of Armor.  All the Nazgul are fierce and I throw Aragorn at them again.  He is dead, but that&#8217;s game, I win cause Frodo is still there.<br />
<br />
Boromir, armor and the blade of gondor.  Great combo.  The Blade of Gondor can save you some games.  Other cards like the saga of Elendil can only help.<br />
<br />
Arwen is there for alittle help just in case Boromir dies.  Good against Nazgul and she can have No Strangers to the shadows.  If opponent is playing Moria, try not to play her.<br />
<br />
Against Uruk-Hai<br />
Get armor out fast as you can.  Don&#39;t forget to use the Blade of Gondor to eliminate the low vitality Uruk-Hai.  <br />
<br />
Against Moria<br />
This should be easy if you get out Sting and No strangers.  Get armor out for the Cave Troll.  Don&#39;t forget to use the Blade of Gondor!<br />
<br />
Against Nazgul<br />
Keep the burdens off of Frodo.  If you can&#39;t do that then get armor out fast.  Save your athelas cards for black breath and blade tip. <br />
<br />
Against Sauron<br />
Hardest match up.  Get armor out and never exert to exhaustion.  In fact never have more than two wounds on Aragorn and never more than one of Boromir.  Save your extra copies of  your fellowship guys.  Don&#39;t forget about sting.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
These guys are assassins.  They don&#39;t even need to skirmish to kill guys.  Hate is your friend.  Use them wisely.  Do not use it to just wound someone, but to eliminate them.  All of the minions are there for a reason.  I would have more Morgul Hunters in but they cost so much.  I use a wide variety of orcs and most have a 2 or 3 twilight cost.  The trackers are the key to this half of the deck.  Exert one to put the Watching eye out so that your opponent has to exert someone to move and use your site 9 to put out three from your discard pile.  Use You bring great evil to keep key members of the fellowship from healing at sanctuaries.<br />
<br />
The goal is to pick off the strength of the fellowship.  This is usually Gandalf or Aragorn.  Try your best to eliminate all of your opponents rangers before your site 7 so everyone has to exert.<br />
<br />
Use the Forces of Mordor to add to the pool.  Use the Strength of Mordor to cause extra wounds in skirmishes and use Enheartened Foe to make your stronger minions fierce.  Orc Butchery is in there because you&#39;ll eliminate a lot of fellowship if you play right.  You could discard the rest of your opponents deck if you play it at the right time.<br />
<br />
I have put 5 fellowship members in the dead pile before my opponent reached site 9, which is my personal record.  If your lucky and you play these cards right you can on average get rid of 3 to 4 companions before site 9.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only problem I see with the deck is my site 8.  My opponent could use that, but so can I if I some how get ahead.<br />
