Strategy  <br />
okay, the strategy is this: with Drawn to It&#39;s Power x4 in play (which you&#39;ll eventually get), it&#39;s pretty gosh darnited easy to burden frodo to death...and by then sam will probably be dead or something. if they do happen to make it to the 9th site, then all your guys are fierce. <br />
<br />
archery can be bad, but you&#39;ll eventually wear everyone down and hopefully kill their extra little archer mofos with your uber 4-wound nazghul. remember that as long as legolas has to exert, then you actually might as well be battling him and wounding him. i think the 7th site is the anti-archery place, so if you really need to, you can smack them when they get there. <br />
<br />
move slow with the hobbits (1 site/turn) and just stealth away. play boromir or thrarin if REALLY needed, and just have a big hobbit party to heal everyone. <br />
<br />
i haven&#39;t played against any really serious decks out there yet, but this seems to hold its&#39; own pretty well if i play it smart. i&#39;ve heard that sauron orcs are the shiz, wounding everything in sight, and i&#39;ve seen the moria orc swarm, and it&#39;s pretty vicious, but i think the nazghul look much cooler than those silly looking orcs and uruk-hai.  <br />
