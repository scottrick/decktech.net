<br />
The Fellowship Relies on Legolas , The Beast.<br />
You start by bidding 3 and go first and take D.Plateau as your first site , allowing you to get your Ever My Heart Rises and a start.<br />
<br />
With Ever My Heart Rises , you can set up both your fellowship or your minion side , depening what you think is most important to do first.<br />
<br />
The Felowship uses Gimli , to boost Legolas and Legolas beating up anything he wants , and heals Gimli in the process.Since You don&#39;t give off much pool it doubles like a nut , using dismay of their enemies to discard minions and the direct wounding to do the rest.<br />
<br />
If your my ax is notched comes out quick together with Final Count , you&#39;ll see your Gimli and Legolas rise to strenght&#39;s higher then the witch king.<br />
<br />
The minion side abuses the fell beast Twilight Witch king combo , wounding frodo to death real fast.You first start Dropping Brutes on him , then he will probably choose to take wounds ( burdens do the job also).Then deploy the witch king and either ferny skirmishes frodo , if they don&#39;t use the green ring and don&#39;t have a sword , and the Witch King fights the others exerting twice to deal 4 wounds to the ring bearer ( AUCH!)<br />
Gollem Adds threats and allows cantea to have a use , absorbs wounds like a mandman , and cycles.<br />
<br />
The deck is mostly depleted by site 9 , cse you can use so much cycling in this deck and set up perfect kills with this great combo.<br />
<br />
If you finaly think the Brutes won&#39;t bother you again , then the squealers just start brining them back , making them have more wounds or burdens , BAH!<br />
<br />
After they have taken their 5th burden ( Believe me it happens :] ) , Enquea can make a stop and Inpersonate Aragorn With Bow :]<br />
<br />
The New SOG boosts for nazgul are realy good cse they can discard a mount , which realy works well against Men / Elf and Rohan.<br />
<br />
Well I hope You enjoyed , I was truly amazed when i saw these strats , so I made it and adjusted it to make it a bit more solid in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Thnx Alot To all the ppl in Antwerps for being all so nice and having alot of great and original decks and being such nice players.<br />
<br />
Cheerz all ,<br />
