It gets wounds on minons thus allowing either Gandalf or Legolas to pick them off easily. The deck skirmishes well with Servant and Gimli, and can cycle with Moment of Respite and Questions. Glamdring is tech against the new Besieger decks, allowing you to see what&#39;s coming and get rid of all the pool you just gave them with a couple exertions, or even one. Bid 2-4, you want to go first to pull Preparations with your site. Unless you&#39;re facing Beasterlings, then under no account bid anything higher than zero. Sam&#39;s in there to get rid of burdens and then die - always good. <br />
<br />
For the shadow, it&#39;s mean, fierce, trackers. Ugluk gets powerful fast and can get early site swarms with just a decent amount of pool. If you&#39;re facing lots of archery and well-timed Broad-bladed sword will screw them bad, and Uruk Spear gets rid of annoying Rohan mounts. <br />
Greed is probably one of the most powerful cards in the game right now, especially with the new Merry&#39;s sword. My favorite uses usually involved site 5 where, with the help of site 3, there&#39;s a ton of pool out, 6 threats, and about 8 companions. You wound everyone up, kill Merry, let him take threat wounds, kill Eomer, and then if you&#39;re really lucky you get to kill someone else. If they get Fortress out early with tokens on it save it until the right site, play it with a cheap tracker, and throw wounds at them. Enquea can be played early and you can also recycle him at site 8 at the cost of 2 threats and with the help -2 twilight cost. Enquea + Greed at site 8 often kills up to 6 companions, because I&#39;ve done done it. <br />
<br />
Enjoy. <br />
