It also has done very well for me in tournament play and practice.  I have to say something, which I hope everyone remembers.  My decks often work for me because I am very LUCKY.  In CCGs, and especially Rings, it is way better to be lucky than good&#8212;and I am both! The light is a slight variation of Gabe Alonso&#8217;s DPC champion Deck. The dark is something I came up with.  Anyway, here goes: <br />
<br />
The only time this deck is weak, is when you draw more events then minions, which can happen. Twice I had like 3 savageries and 2 hates. The thing to do is dump them.  Always dump savageries over the Bred if they are under five comp, or opposite if they are at five or over. Use Arwens sword if you have it.  The hates you may want to hang on to if your opponent is nearing site 9, as a RECENT CHANGE was to add TOL BRANDIR to the deck, to pull those trackers and the hate people off at the end. It can be very devistating. As long as your opponent is giving you some pool, this deck should work very well. I added Balrog because, with these bigger decks, you can end up having fellowship clumps.  Overall, this has worked very well, and these days, its scary to go defender plus two with Aragorn if there are two orc scouts out!!!  Enjoy. <br />
