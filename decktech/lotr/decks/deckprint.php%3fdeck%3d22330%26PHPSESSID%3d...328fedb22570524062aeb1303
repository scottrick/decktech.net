It was also weak to speciphic races, moria and nazgul at it alive if they skipped archery.  now this deck doesn&#39;t run quite as much, and is just alot more solid.  lets break down the fellowship vs the 4 races:<br />
<br />
vs nazgul--<br />
this deck was built to beat nazgul, everyone plays nazgul in my area from what i&#39;ve seen and with 4 brands(not a liabilty to get stuck in your habd cuz you can drop 2 on each ranger) and the 3 sleeps and teh almost gurentee of getting gandalf out you are set...also aragorn being able to heal everyone but legos is sweettoo.  <br />
<br />
vs moria--<br />
vs swarm rely on going slow and letting your shadow beat down on them, archery should buy you time to cause significant damage.  3 bows is neccesary cuz this is the hardest matchup...vs teh balrog and a cave troll bormir comes in, with armor he is the mack.<br />
<br />
vs uraks--if uraks are really big in your area thrown in another sword and bormir&#39;s gun in as well...that will alow you win most skirmishes...and the ones you lose should be offset by armor, avoid 6 companions(as you should with nazgul as well) and sacrifice someone, usually arwen.<br />
<br />
vs sauron-- not much to stay, your fellowship is just solid so you will hold it together until late sites, aragorn healing everyone is huge and archery comes in handy when you need it.  <br />
<br />
oh..bid 1, and if you win make them go 1st, but like i said the deck is just solid so it doesn&#39;t really matter cuz the fellowship can catch up, and the shadown slows them down alot.<br />
<br />
The shadow is just solid, i dropped teh tips and breaths for charges and bill pherneys because thats a better combo in my opinion.  witch king is the mack, he comes out twice per game guerenteed, 3 times usualy.  charge is teh key to the deck though.  <br />
<br />
thats about it.  the one weakness the deck has s that it doesn&#39;t cycle that well but you play multiples of all the key fellowship cards you need, so if you get them you can run well and then drop your shadow later.  its solid so lemme know what you think--H2O </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
