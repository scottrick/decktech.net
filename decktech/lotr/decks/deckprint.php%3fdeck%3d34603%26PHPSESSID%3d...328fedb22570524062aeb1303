remove one the more the merrier and add one the tale of the great ring, completely forgot that i use that card!<br />
<br />
when i say transfered narsil, i was actually talking about transferrign the saga of elendil... that is a condition, and that can be transfered. mistakes happen, but wow, 7 starts for one is an harsh way to review something that weas meant to just make some fun.;.. if even i was goingo to play at worlds with that, but anyway...<br />
<br />
i았e inserted at the end of the strategy section a few lines about which rares to include to improve this deck. as it압 meant to be a starters choice, how could a begginer make it more reliable?<br />
<br />
***END OF EDIT***<br />
<br />
<br />
well, that was going to be just a way to use my commons and to play with my hobbits, but it surprised me against serious decks.<br />
<br />
the whole point of this posting is about the shadow, the fellowship is designed for survival but it can do more against some match-ups. if you can앖 stop them you can try to run, the hobbitses are very tricksy and nasty!<br />
<br />
the point of the shadow is to make a nice swarm, so you can get to the ring-bearer and kill him by columns of easterlings or overrun. in case you won앖 kill him in one shot, keep swarming to get their main characters out. its a nice shadows against noble leaders, as you can probably kill faramir AND denethor by site 4 (i았e done it more than once, believe me!), so getting to the ring-bearer will be easier eventually.<br />
<br />
some card choices:<br />
<br />
bold and cunning: nice card, it can be a terrible surprise, mainly against hobbitses.<br />
<br />
overrun: often a +4 pump card.<br />
<br />
pavise: tech for the toiling... and it can also prevent some of your key minions from being killed, as rampaging easterling for example.<br />
<br />
poleaxe: in case the swarm isn앖 ready, play a big minion with that to ensure he압 fierce. who knows if they won앖 stop?<br />
<br />
strange-looking men: so good, i았e killed a isildur once, because i transferred the saga of elendil while isildur was exhausted so game over!<br />
<br />
columns of easterlings: tech minion, there압 always someone to be overwhlmed, so play it right and they will be!<br />
<br />
that압 it, i hope you get the idea od the shadow. it압 a very cheap deck to build (except for the promises), so i hope it can help most of you that are starting! don앖 take the shadow just as a fun one, it can kill many decks that are prepared for a toiling and lurkering swarm.<br />
<br />
reviews are welcome, eventually i will edit it to comment them.<br />
<br />
EDIT >>> Ways to improve it:<br />
<br />
you can choose between some different rares, sometimes a big minion, sometimes a key lurker, sometimes a more swarming strategy... here follows 5 examples:<br />
<br />
1 - oath sworn + a shadow rises... thanks for pointing this dude!<br />
2 - grima, betrayer of rohan... nice lurker to include, get a pavise on him and let the big guys do the show!<br />
3 - easterling host... get a pavise on it and your other guys will get +8!!!<br />
4 - castamir, corsair vandal... tech!<br />
5 - mouth of sauron and countless companies... nice to make your pavises and oath sworn more reliable<br />
<br />
END OF EDIT AGAIN...<br />
cheers,<br />
