<br />
HI! glad you all liked it, some awesome suggestions in the reviews. First, Koji, Curse Them is HUGE! I had no idea that you could cancel Frodo&#39;s fight with this, much less at nine! Dude, MEGA props on that, who knew?<br />
<br />
Interesting way to get condition removal, starting Arwen instead of Faramir, but it&#39;s more important to have a Gondor guy in the fellowship at the start in 90 percent of games than to have condition removal, and Company of Archers is BAD condition removal. <br />
<br />
WoBaS ALMOST made it in, but I took him out for Athelas at the last minute. Basically, the Athelas slot could have been either WoBaS, a Second Orc Bane, There and Back Again or Athelas. It was Athelas cause I saw a lot of BB/BT in the Warm-up. Of course, it occurs to me now that if a Nazgul gets to the skirmish phase against, I&#39;m likely screwed or have a PATHS, so Athelas is OUT for Pippin, WoBaS. Also, switch the Ring to Isildur&#39;s Bane. gosh darnit Water Ring.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, what else, what else. I used the Battle Cries cause they get kills when your opponent isn&#39;t expecting kills, AND they scare your opponent. When they lose Arwen at site 3, they&#39;re not confident with their assignments for the rest of the game. City Gates was there to capitalize on the kills I usually got at site 5, but I realize in hindsite that the Pellanor Plain would be better since then Threat Naz can&#39;t strip my possessions. <br />
<br />
Citadel of the Stars is good, but I think 1 is the right number Ryan. It&#39;s unique, and I don&#39;t use it that much in reality. 1 Orc Bane seemed like a good number, though another couldn&#39;t hurt :)<br />
<br />
Thanks all, and yes Matthieu, I am a pimp. <br />
<br />
END EDIT.<br />
<br />
Well, this deck is a friggin pile.<br />
The only thing I claim any credit for is the Fellowship, as the shadow is basically a direct copy of something that either one of or both of the Freedom Brothers designed. It&#39;s beastly.<br />
<br />
The fellowship was created because Archery is a great matchup for Nazgul(usually) but a terrible matchup for Easterling Polearm of any kind. What Are They? combined with the Merchant and Second Level lets you raise the site number of any offending minion (ie: one with a Polearm or a Broad Bladed Sword) and then discard it. It&#39;s also surprisingly good against Swarm decks, it allowed me to discard a pair of Isengard Warriors and move through a Swarm through Snows that would have otherwise killed me. <br />
<br />
The deck&#39;s worst matchup is the ole&#39; Sauron Grinder, since I have little healing and practically ZERO consition removal. Bilbo is really only in there to kill Swarms or Underdeeps vs. Moria, but he can take out other stuff in a pinch. The only game at DPC Atlanta that my fellowship had any trouble was vs. Mike Blumberg&#39;s Sauron Grinder, and his Shadow made mincemeat out of this fellowship. It didn&#39;t help that I was playing Mr. Bubbles. <br />
<br />
some card choices:<br />
<br />
Orc Bane - Swarm is a bad matchup, which is why this is here. Plus, I hear it&#39;s great vs. Will Cruise =P<br />
<br />
Citadel of the Stars - kill a Dunland dude that happens to creep through my defenses or off pretty much anything that lives through my archery.<br />
<br />
Athelas - a little portable healing, but can deal with Thin and Stretched or anything like that causing problems. <br />
<br />
Sam, PP - well, again with the swarms. also, burdens are basically a non-issue since there shouldn&#39;t be a skirmish phase.<br />
<br />
Why Second Level AND the Merchant? - the Merchant is good, but in the late game it helps to be able to make minions roaming without dumping my whole hand. The Second Levels are great since I can store them up until I need them. Redundancy is good, I hear.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, you ask, what are the fellowship&#39;s weaknesses?<br />
<br />
Well, aside from the ole&#39; Sauron Grind and Swarms, the only thing that I can REALLY think of would be Relentless Charge. Assuming that multiples were played when all my guys were archers, that&#39;d likely be game. A Nazgul deck running Gollum AND Bill Ferny would mean I couldn&#39;t discard the Nazgul and there&#39;d be enough vitality to soak lots of wounds. <br />
<br />
Just in case you&#39;ve not seen the shadow before, it&#39;s basically a giant pile of Tech. The 4 Trackers and 2 Brought Back Alive kill unbound Hobbits dead. Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry often kills Arwen at site 2 before she gets set up. Shaman heals your Uruks to Spear mounts. Power is huge vs. almost every single Free Peoples out there. Broad Bladed Sword provides pump AND ensures that there&#39;ll be a skirmish phase.<br />
<br />
These Uruks are solid. <br />
<br />
This deck is far from perfect, but it&#39;s a solid Meta Choice, I think, as long as you know Sauron Grinder is a rare chance to see. It&#39;d prolly be better to find room for Elrond/Vilya/Sentinels to kill conditions, but that also gives a lot more pool than the deck gives currently. I&#39;m open to suggestions =P<br />
<br />
So far it&#39;s record is:<br />
<br />
4-0 DPC Atlanta Warmup tourney<br />
<br />
4-2 DPC Atlanta MSE (losses to Judge&#39;s Grinder and my teamate&#39;s version of the fellowship)<br />
<br />
0-1 DPC Atlanta finals (Blumberg again =)<br />
<br />
0-1 Fun game vs. Will Cruise. Will Cruise owns me.<br />
<br />
