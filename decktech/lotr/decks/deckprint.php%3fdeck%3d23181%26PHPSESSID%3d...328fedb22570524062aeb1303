<br />
Try bidding high enough to go first; hopefully you know what kind of deck you&#8217;re playing against so you can make an informed decision about which Aragorn to play when you bring out your Pony.  If you don&#8217;t manage to win the bid it doesn&#8217;t mean the end of the game for you, you have enough of Aragorn to ensure that he comes out quite early on.  This deck is set up to be raced, try going first and double move as often as is sensible.  If you stop early due to other circumstances it&#8217;s not a problem you can use that extra turn to pull the cards you need so that you&#8217;re set up when you get to the bridge. I normally try and move 1-3, 3-4, 4-6, 6-9 but it really does depend on what has happened, especially early in the game.<br />
<br />
This deck was put together for fun as I wanted to try something out after writing an archery article for the game, and this was as much archery as I wanted until the Elf Lords comes out, when I may try something that centres a lot more around Elves and archery.  The main thing here was the shadow side, I desperately wanted to try out minion archery as a viable option.  I think this side does this splendidly, I&#8217;ve only lost 1 game with this deck, and that was in multiplayer and it hasn&#8217;t lost in a 1vs1 game yet.  Of course my meta has been trying some new ways of dealing with my minions, including condition removal, although so far no-one has been using sleeps.  I guess it could have been placed elsewhere on the site but I think that it would have problems versus a high condition removal gaming environment.  I just really enjoy seeing people having to decide who to kill when they have to place 8 or more archery wounds in a turn.<br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Archery:  <br />
<br />
If you find out you&#8217;re playing an archery side, which should happen fairly early in the game you have a lot of points to soak the archery wounds up if you need to by playing all your companions.  Plus Shield of Boromir and Mithril Coat both help to lower the minion archery total.  <br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Nazgul:<br />
<br />
You have ARV, bows, Flaming Brands and Athelas.  Pretty much a standard idea for anti-nazgul, stay below 6 companions if you&#8217;re worried about Enquea and don&#8217;t have any ARV&#8217;s or the right site out.<br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Uruks or Moria Strength:<br />
<br />
Moria Strength decks are not too bad.  You can usually win the skirmishes or you can take them on people with armor to prevent the extra damage points.  It&#8217;s pretty much the same idea against an Uruk-Hai deck, only here you may want to keep a lower number of companions to prevent the possible fierce skirmishes.   You&#8217;ll also need to watch out due to the possibility your opponent may play Savagery on you.  <br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Sauron:<br />
<br />
Use your Elrond well and you can remove those nasty conditions with Secret Sentinels, don&#8217;t let him become exhausted and you should be able to avoid the possibility of him dying to the Tower Assassin, or if you can and need to you can use ARV against the Assassin.  Don&#8217;t be afraid to play out your companions and soak up the exertions then maybe kill some of them.  Allow yourself the possibility of killing a companion or two to keep the amount of twilight low at the final site.<br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Burden:<br />
Most burden decks need to win skirmishes in order to burden you up, try and prevent it as much as possible.  You should be able to spot a nazgul burden strategy early on, in fact you may be able to spot any burden strategy early in the game.  If you get Sam out use his ability to remove the burdens you have already and try and win as many skirmishes as possible.  You can use ARV and archery to prevent the skirmishes you can&#8217;t win.<br />
<br />
Fellowship vs Moria Swarm:<br />
<br />
If you know you&#8217;ll be playing against a swarm deck try and get the pony down, then bring out Aragorn, RotN.  Then use the Secret Sentinels to remove some of their conditions hurt them with your archery.  Try and move onto site 9 with Aragorn un-exerted, then you can either kill opponents with directed archery or make Aragorn defender +x.  Plus you may have your one PATHS card (Power According To His Stature) add a burden and kill most of the Moria minions who only have 1 point of vitality.<br />
<br />
Shadow side:<br />
<br />
This is pretty straightforward; use pinned down to prevent the archery total on their side as much as possible, Goblin Domain to stop them from bringing out too many companions after site 4, or if they do they come out exhausted and you can have fun with your high archery total against them.  Goblin Swarms is self-explanatory, try and get your goblin runners on there so you can recycle their helpful twilight abilities.  You&#8217;ll be surprised how often you can get out the Troll and Balrog at the bridge, especially if you use host of thousands, swarms or the Balrog&#8217;s own game text to bring as many Runners as possible into play.   Tower Assassin&#8217;s can be used to wound any of their helpful companions, especially Albert Dreary, and if they&#8217;ve exhausted someone you can kill them with just one exertion.<br />
<br />
Why not use Tol Brandir at site 9?  Well with the new Orc and Uruk Scouts the fact that you can use your ARV is cancelled by the fact they can pull these guys out with the site text and exert to prevent you using that card, plus I&#8217;m not using anything to force my site into play, if they&#8217;ve got here first you want to try and kill them and the possible extra cards from their burdens and Summit of Amon Hen&#8217;s site text could be the difference between a kill with archery plus overwhelm and them winning the game.  Hopefully the only way they&#8217;ve gotten there in front of you is by bidding really high&#8230;<br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t use Valley of the Silverlode as we don&#8217;t want their hobbits to heal when they move here just in case we can kill them with archery if they don&#8217;t have enough wounds left to soak all your arrows up.  When it comes to site 7, I am tempted to use Anduin Confluence and remove their helpful allies but then I would maybe not have an Elven ally to use my Secret Sentinels&#8230;plus the possibility that someone doesn&#8217;t have a ranger in play at this point just makes all those extra exertions a nice bonus when you&#8217;re playing minion archery.<br />
<br />
Why the Trolls instead of more archers?  Well I did have a couple more Moria Archer Troop in the deck for a while and could put in another Goblin Archer but I just found that sometimes the deck needed an extra kick.  Same with the Balrog, for a while I didn&#8217;t have him in but it just allowed me the liberty of pulling him from the draw deck should I have a bad minion draw at the bridge, and it&#8217;s better to have him out than only one runner&#8230;of course sometimes they will be stealthed and other things but they can be nasty enough when they do get through.<br />
<br />
Anyway I hope you like this deck as much as I liked making and playing it, and tweaking it.  It is slightly large but it does move through the cards quite quickly.  Plus I play it in multiplayer games as often if not more often than 1vs1 games and the extra cards can come in handy in those games.  Thanks for reading to the end.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />
