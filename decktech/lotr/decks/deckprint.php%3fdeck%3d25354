<br>
1) reliant on high bidding, which sydney players do lots, even with sam, they usually have 3 or so left over<br>
2) defenseless against archery, which i saw none of on day 1<br>
3) able to take advantage of the death of mass companions, which are also popular in sydney. no one expects to see nazgul pump cards, as they are already powerful enough.<br>
<br>
but i was completely wrong, as i took it on day2 and died totally, as well as paul v, who made the same deck for some silly reason. read the TR for more info.<br>
<br>
the FP side is more ore less lifted from Alfred Dong&#39;s FP comic con side, with extra flaming brands to tech against nazgul. the move is meant to be slow in order to cycle cards quicker for the shadow, but if you get like 3 servants in your opening hand, dont hesitate to make them catch up to you.<br>
<br>
the shadow site is built to create a threshold of burdens (3-4-5) after which your power adders and nazgul abilities kick in. with so many players willing to sacrifice companions, i thought this would be a good choice.<br>
toldea: 4 burdens = potentially 2 free kills, and another 2-6 burdens, putting them in enquea country<br>
enquea: guns down the excess companions at 5 burdens, at the higher end of the threshold<br>
nazgul sword/dark whispers: extra damage = gold, esp in a fierce skirmish when they dont expect it...hi ben may...LOL<br>
nelya: 2 burdens = fierce dam +1? total nails.<br>
<br>
thats pretty much it, see if you can make it more solid.<br>
<br>
respect,<br>
haakon<br>
<br>
PROPS:<br>
Robbo for the nazgul core of this deck, when we went out to lunch at maccas.<br>
<br>
Alfred Dong for his FP side, slightly tweaked<br>
<br>
SLOPS:<br>
me for building this pile and playing it day2<br>
<br>
robbo for ever thinking of this deck in the first place :P<br>
