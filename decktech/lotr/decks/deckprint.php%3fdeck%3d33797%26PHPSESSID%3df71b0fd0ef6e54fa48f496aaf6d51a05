I heard hobbits were good nowadays so I thought they would be cool, they have always been my fave culture anyway. I chose the shadow side because I thought nobody would expect it.  I thought right.<br />
<br />
The hobbits start out slow but by site 4 there always ready to run. play them like this: If you dont get anything that will ensure a double to 3, mulligan. This usually means a bounder or sam and probaly a sword. single to 4 and play out as much as you can on the way. With the doubles of tom and practically it is feasible that by now your ready to roll! Double with narrow escape and and heal up your hurt hobbitses with the healing circle.<br />
For burden removal I put tom in, two copies infact because he has saved my hiney more times than I can count. If your facing corruption and frodo is getting near<br />
the brink, kill him off and pass to sam.(hopefully this will be near the end of the game). This is why I only included 2 a promises (plus the deck was getting big and didnt know what to cut).<br />
The easterlings didnt know what hit them when it took 45 to overwhelm sam!<br />
<br />
The shadow side was mostly put togethr for the only purpose of making your opponents life hell.<br />
The conditions are only there to help out grima if your opponent is being stubborn and will only play 2 cards on their companions, although if you get a blade tip on someone it may be a good idea to keep there.<br />
Ulaire lemenya also helps out with the clogging madness! put  ring of rancor on him and have all blades perish to ensure he survives till the regroup phase and return who ever to thier onwers hand. Place him on flung into the fray.<br />
with grima coming out and lemenya doing his thang, you should be able to slow down your opponents cycling so they dont set up.<br />
<br />
This deck is probaly the most fun I have ever had in the game, and I hope you decide to try it out!<br />
By the way, There were no shadow kills with this deck, only me running, so dont expect the gulls to destroy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
