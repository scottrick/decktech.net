<br />
-=Free Peoples=-<br />
First, the starting party.  I normally don&#39;t like to use this Frodo, but in this deck I have no need for Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir (no hobbit allies), I&#39;d rather just have the one free turn of twilight, plus Drogo looks like a doofus.  And then the wonder twins.  I know it&#39;s not original, but both fit the deck theme (rangers and archery), and it&#39;s better to start 2 companions than just 1.<br />
<br />
The sites were chosen the way I like them, with good fellowship sites early then Shadow the rest of the way (since that&#39;s when they will be out for, right?).  Aragorn is the main focus, so Pony is a must...Trollshaw has the low twilight and good text, and the Courtyard means a free Elrond, or any other 4 twilight things due to Aragorn/site.  Site 4 is good for Moria, and 5 is...yeah.  6 is the best for Moria, and out of all the site 7&#39;s (skip archery, discard allies, no pulling from deck/discard) this one does the least damage to me.  Site 8 is a must in any Orc deck, and 9 is neutral and allows me to swarm better.<br />
<br />
The companions were choosen for efficiency, since Aragorn helps with the choking, Arwen helps archery/choking, Legolas is great archer (duh!), Boromir is the best out there, and Sam is a must in most decks...you need some sort of burden removal.<br />
<br />
The allies are the best mix of Elves and allow me to play my 2 events, plus makes Aragorn/Boromir that much bigger.  With Galadriel and the site 6 archers, you get free shots every turn since they heal, and you can move 4-6 with ease due to more archery and people to die.  Only 1 Elrond because I&#39;m playing Moria and I usually deck myself without him :).<br />
<br />
The possessions are mainly for the Rangers, because Legolas should never fight unless it&#39;s a Runner or something.  They all up the bearer&#39;s strength except the bows, which of course add to the archery.  Pretty simple, and 2 Stings cause sometimes Frodo has to fight :).<br />
<br />
The conditions are all essential.  Moving into site 9 with all 4 Bowmen and a fresh Aragorn/Boromir means an almost guaranteed win.  With all the stuff out, you have 9 directed archery vs. Orcs/Uruks + an additional 9 undirected archery.  If the minions survive 18 archery, then they are tough bastards and it will be fun killing them in battle :).<br />
<br />
And events...I don&#39;t like them, they clog your hand, and thus I am using the 2 that will help me the most.  Spies of Saruman sucks, along with Goblin Armory, Black Breath, Desperate Defense of the Ring, etc.<br />
<br />
-=Shadow=-<br />
Now the shadow is a lot simpler to use than the Free Peoples, and it&#39;s easy to learn.  In a nutshell, you throw down guys and draw lot&#39;s of cards, then a Troll comes out and you force them to stop.<br />
<br />
The minions are here to generate pool, draw cards, and allow &quot;Fluffy&quot; (is this official yet?) to pound pound pound!  Runner and Scavengers are the meat of the deck, and Moria Scouts are free 90% of the time.  Flankers are beefy and cheap early on, or if you bluff and they don&#39;t have Sting or Glamdring you could win with them.  4 Cave Trolls because he is the focal point of the swarm....you drop lot&#39;s of Orcs then he comes out (just like in the novel/movie...hmmm).  The lone Commander, Enquea, Nertea, and Keyward are all good in certain situations (the first 3 vs. big fellowship, 4th vs. choke) and the two nazgul are good for one turn smacks.  Commander has won me a few games and always finds a spot in my deck.<br />
<br />
The possessions are the essential ingredient to the Moria machine.  The scimitars are very, very good adding twilight with Armories, increasing strength, drawing cards...excellent.  The other 3 are great to pull with Relics, and the Hammer/Axe add with Armories as well, and a Troll with Hammer/Chain is really mean (power 20, damage +2, fierce, can&#39;t be shot at or your archer dies).<br />
<br />
The conditions are what I find the great mix for Moria.  Drawing them early and setting it all up by site 5 is great, and the 2 Swarms, 2 They are Coming, 1 Relics, and 4 Armories really make the deck flow.  Having a couple runners, scouts, scavengers, or what not on Swarms is almost game-winner, since everything on the Swarms can come out for free (with armories).<br />
<br />
The events, like with my Free Peoples, are the best and very few.  I just don&#39;t like events, and these are excellent to grab that one Orc you need, if you don&#39;t want to throw away 3 cards.<br />
<br />
-=Deck Match-Ups=-<br />
vs. Uruk-Hai:<br />
Since everyone and their mother seem to be playing these guys, I have gotten very used to them.  The cheap ones all have 2 vitality, and the big ones have max 4 vitality.  They have the advantage of Spies of Saruman, force pumps, Saruman&#39;s Power, and No Business of Ours.  These are all tough for any deck to overcome, and I try my best.  If they are packing Saruman&#39;s Power, then I will most likely need my Moria to step up, because my deck is condition reliant (Last Alliance, Bowmen, No Stranger).  Spies can be dealt with with Secret Sentinels, and if they get passed it then they still need to beat down Aragorn, Arwen, and Boromir.  Most times, in order to choke and allow them to not use Savagery, I will never drop Boromir and just keep the starting + Aragorn.  Sam is usually discarded too, they just aren&#39;t essential.  It&#39;s tough, but can be managed.<br />
<br />
vs. Isengard Orcs:<br />
These guys are...different.  They seem really good, but they need to get past Archery and Skirmishs, then do a couple wounds.  Choke hurts them (they remind me of Sauron orcs) and too much Archery means not too many regroup actions.  They are not very hard to beat, you just need to make sure you beat up the Commander and Smith and it&#39;s all good.<br />
<br />
vs. Moria<br />
Swarm is great and all, and with so many Orcs coming out, even if half die to archery, the other half is going to be mean :(.  If the deck is set up like mine, then lots of Orcs plus a Troll is a pain.  I will defientley bring out Boromir as soon as possible, and Sam can come out too if I don&#39;t think Enquea is coming soon.  Moria is not very popular in my area, and that&#39;s the reason behind building the deck to scare people again (one game, at site 9 I started with 10 twilight, got out 13 orcs + troll and had 6 twilight left!).  Not much experience facing them in battle, but might soon...<br />
<br />
vs. Nazgul<br />
Choke hurts them more than people think, and Arwen is a beast vs. them alongside Aragorn.  Without pumps, they can&#39;t beat my guys in single combat (king + another nazgul can&#39;t stand up to power 17 Aragorn (2 brands, last alliance)...nasty).  Relentless Charge is a pain, but there&#39;s no reason to do directed archery unless it&#39;s to Cantea.  Since I never bid higher than 2 (usually 0, I like moving into my sites) the burden deck&#39;s shouldn&#39;t be too tough, because with Sam in my hand waiting for Frodo to almost die then hoping out for the ring is a great plan.  Most of the time my Moria runs all over their fellowship so it&#39;s not too much trouble.  Just never double move into the Ford unless you sting and see 8 cards with no Nazgul :).<br />
<br />
vs. Saruon<br />
Man this guys are bad.  They roam too long, have no real focus, and can&#39;t stand up to Archery.  They can kill off an ally or two, but that doesn&#39;t do enough to me to stop me anywhere.  Choke rips them up because they get a hand clogged full of shadow and can&#39;t get to fellowship cards, thus Moria runs all over them.  I ahve never lost to a deck using Sauron in tournament play except once, where he had the perfect combo to finish me (was running aragorn/frodo only choke...he got a pillager with orc scimitar, and was going to overwhelm aragorn or frodo, and after i sruvived him with bounder/pumps he enheartend foe to kill my aragorn.  next site was tol brandir and he swarmed my frodo...I also didn&#39;t draw any of the 4 PATHS in my deck, and had about 25 cards left...argh).<br />
<br />
vs. Big Fellowship<br />
They give lot&#39;s of twilight and help my Commander, Nertea, and Enquea do their damage.  They normally have a beefed up Aragorn, Boromir, and Gandalf, but the rest will die to the orcs, especialyl when one of those three are pre-occupied with the Troll.  It&#39;s just a matter of time before they lose companions and you should be able to run past them.<br />
<br />
vs. Mirror decks (any kind)<br />
SO annoying.  It&#39;s not broken, it&#39;s not gay, it&#39;s just annoying.  The mirror is a great card, it lets you pick your fate, but with it being so meta&#39;ed against I decided not to worry about it too much.  Moria works great out of the discard pile anyway, and when I play with my Mirror deck moria gives me the most trouble due to their drawing and recycling abilities.  If they are smart they will get rid of my Fellowship cards and try to beat me down, and if that is the case then all I can hope for is good luck on the shadow side.  It sounds like I have no defense against the mirror (no direct counters in here) but don&#39;t give me -1 star for that.  It&#39;s just one decktype of dozens.<br />
<br />
vs. Gandalf theme (Trust)<br />
Trust decks are sweet.  They have a small fellwoship, and their guys almost never lose a skirmish, but Moria doesn&#39;t care about woudning people, it cares about Overwhelming and killing.  A would does nothing, but a dead companion is sick.  I treat these decks like regular choke decks (see below).  I haven&#39;t faced too many of these so I can&#39;t comment on their effectivenes.<br />
<br />
vs. Choke<br />
Choke! Choke does nothing! &quot;You get 6 twilight at the bridge&quot; &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll play my 4 orcs and Balrog&quot;  Seriousley, Choke deck&#39;s main idea is to clog the opponent&#39;s hand with minions and the ones they manage to get through you beat on.  Moria counters this since they have very cheap, pool-adding cards that are a built in counter to choke decks.  Believe me, I am a fan of choke and these orcs are annoying to deal with!<br />
<br />
vs. Others<br />
Others include anything other than Dwarf decks people will throw out at you.  Ranger decks, Archery decks, Ally decks, Hobbit decks, Elf decks, whatever it is, it is not top tier and will not perform as well as it should.  Against Dwarves, just run like hell.  Your shadow should not be able to do anything but get you decked faster, due to Greatest Kingdom of my People, Song of During, and beefy dwarves making me lose cards everytime an orc dies.  Just run with your fellowship and if you attack the dwarves, you need to do it with a bunch of orcs and the troll otherwise it won&#39;t do anything.<br />
<br />
PHEW...that&#39;s a lot of typing, and I hope I covered everything.  Normally I don&#39;t write such a big strategy but I am proud of this deck and think it is very strong.  Moria is my favorite culture, and I love making Aragorn a beast.  Archery is fun too :).  I hope you enjoyed it and I hope that my strategy section wasn&#39;t a waste of time to anyone! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
