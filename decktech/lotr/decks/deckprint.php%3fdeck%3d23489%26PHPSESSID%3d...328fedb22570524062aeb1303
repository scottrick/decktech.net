I&#39;ve been using this deck for about a month and a half and it has only lost one game in friendly play, and then the one game last weekend due to a HORRIBLE draw.<br />
<br />
Basically this deck takes all of the most powerful tools in the game and puts them at your fingertips. Then it takes counters to the most popular and powerful cards and implements them to make sure you do not fall victim to your own strategies.<br />
<br />
HOW TO PLAY<br />
Bid 2. If you win, do whatever you feel like doing. Going first, with this deck, really doesn&#39;t matter. If you end up going second you will try to set up the &quot;time-bomb&quot; effect, which is moving one site at a time, getting through your deck, until at site 6 (your site 6) you have drawn Gift of Goats and an ARV or two to let you skip 6-9 and win. That was the &quot;original&quot; intent when I first made this deck, but I quickly discovered that you cannot always plan on doing that.<br />
<br />
As the world turns you will find that all of your FP cards play pretty fluently, save the extra copies of weapons, which will either get discarded with Gwem or with reconciliation. Your minions will play and do their thing, keeping the opponent to one site per turn. That&#39;s what they are there for and they do their job well. Eventually (if you start behind) you will be able to take the lead, and if you start ahead you will be able to either move one site at a time comfortably or blow two or three sites ahead of the opponent.<br />
<br />
You take the lead by the following:<br />
playing a spare companion or two and using them as a shield (sam takes on all comers)<br />
using your site 3<br />
using Gift of Goats<br />
using site 6 allies as a shield<br />
<br />
In fact, you should almost ALWAYS double from 4 to 6 if game circumstances warrant, because you will have your allies there to die for you.<br />
<br />
So if you hold the opponent to one site at a time, and you are able to double (or even triple) once or twice in the game, you will win. <br />
<br />

CARD CHOICE FAQ<br />
Sting x3? My trademark. Sting does so much for so little that you dont just want to get it out early, you NEED to. You MUST. I could write a whole friggin article on this card and why 3 of it go in every deck i make, but i&#39;ll save it for another time.<br />
Gwem x3? in THIS deck, is also a must-have-early. Just in case your hand gets stuck, reset it - and make Arwen power +4 at the same time. And it&#39;s merits as a weapon are plentiful as well.<br />
Sam, Gandalf, Bozo? these guys are here to suck up some wounds and die. Basically your free move tickets against most shadow decks. Also dont forget to use your opponent&#39;s Green Dragon Inn to get Sam if the game starts that way<br />
Elven allies? do the following...<br />
1. Secret Sentinels for maneuver-phase condition removal (kill SPIES)<br />
2. each ally&#39;s text is useful as well<br />
3. site 6 allies provide shields at that site for easy double move<br />
4. Gift of Goats<br />
don&#39;t look at the ally list and say &quot;what if you don&#39;t get your Rumil out against Moria?&quot; and tell me to add another. There is one of each ally in there and that is enough. If i dont get Rumil against Moria i will get Secret Sentinels instead to kill some conditions, or maybe i&#39;ll get Elrond so i can draw more, or i&#39;ll get Aragorn&#39;s Bow to shoot orcs, etc. I DO NOT COUNT ON getting any card in this deck other than Aragorn.<br />
<br />
Shadow side:<br />
only two Lurtz? cuz more can clog your hand, better to play another captain or small guy<br />
not enough minions (too many events)? again, dont want to clog the hand. I would rather have a Troop, Savagery, Battle Cry, and Ambition in hand and be able to play it all than four Uruks and only be able to play two.<br />
THREE captains? he&#39;s huge, he acts as two-minions-in-one<br />
raiding parties are gay, arent they? I dont think they are, they work pretty well for me. If you dont like em, use something else, but the extra vitality can be game-winner. plus i dont remember how many times an opponent has moved to site 9 and given me a bunch of pool and my guys are -1 and i&#39;m wishing i had something better than a warrior or fighter in my hand.<br />
Scouts?? Cuz ARV is the best FP card in the game, and having a built-in counter to it in your minion culture is great. So what if he&#39;s power 7, i play pumpers<br />
Beyond the Height of Men? because Armor is the second-best FP card in the game...well almost. anyway Armor SUCKS and this card kills it, plus dont forget BTHOM plays for less with Ambitions </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
