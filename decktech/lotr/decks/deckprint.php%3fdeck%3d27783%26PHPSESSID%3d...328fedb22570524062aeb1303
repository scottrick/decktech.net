In this goal, don&#39;t hesitate to use mulligan too if you have less than 4 minions in hand or no Hides.<br />
The most important thing is to make your opponent discard lots of cards in the beginning to survive against your swarm.<br />
<br />
The free people side is a classic discard deck but strong enough to survive until the end. In the first sites don&#39;t double move<br />
as long as you&#39;re not ready. If you don&#39;t start, do 1-2,2-3,3-4,4-6,6-7,7-9 but most of time your shadow will do his job quickly.<br />
As i said above, the victory is bent to your start, so be lucky ;-)...<br />
<br />
As for the shadow side, i think new dunlends are great, that&#39;s why i built the deck around them but don&#39;t forget the bases of Dunlends :<br />
(Rabble Rouser and Hides ).<br />
Except that, i don&#39;t play anymore supply cards like Wild Man Raids because i want to keep my good cycling capacity.<br />
 I just decided to play cheapiest minions with a few big guys to worry the company.<br />
According to this, i added 4 Runners to make the difference very early (Site 4). <br />
Another tip interesting to apply, play your minions wisely. I explain : the fellow moves to site 3, you have lots of minions in hand <br />
and enough twilights to play them, so play  Rampager or Renegade in first, your opponent will understand that this guys are really <br />
strong and he will maybe discard cards even if you had not enough minions to overwhelm Frodo.<br />
<br />
Your opponent must feel that his victory depends on the cards he discards and that double move is the only one solution, but <br />
in front of him there is a swarm ...<br />
Another thing, don&#39;t imagine that Frodo Courteous Halfling will save you because i don&#39;t make you discard cards, it&#39;s only your choice :-p<br />
<br />
As all decks, there are free people which will double move without problems : the big fellow with lots of direct damage for example.<br />
In this case, you have to play all cards you have to give your fellow a little hope.... but don&#39;t dream :-)<br />
I don&#39;t know how i can deal with big fellow without slowing this deck, maybe Ulaire Enquea but a Nertea seems to be more efficient, <br />
<br />
Waiting for your reviews, <br />
