Cards that nearly missed the cut:<br />
Grown Suddenly Tall - this was a final cut, but if Mordor Wound and corruption decks, as well as Moria are popular in your area replace one copy of Out of the High Airs with it<br />
O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! - +1 on Frodo is always good + taking off the One Ring can save you against Nazgul corruption (Wraith-world) <br />
Curse Their Foul Feet! x2 - if there are many moron swarm or Mordor threat decks in your meta put those in instead of Out of the High Airs and Shadow Between<br />
Albert Dreary - good vs. Moria swarm, Moron swarm and Uruk based decks.<br />
Red Wrath - a killer card, but Discovered is money against the Knights, Dwarves, DH, even Gondor-Elf and Fierce in Despair is essential against any Gandalf - based fellowship<br />
<br /><br />
This is the newest version of the deck I&#39;ve been playing since Siege of Gondor (i.e. Saved from the Fire) came out. Before MD I used to start with Haldir.<br />
<br /><br />
Bid one, go first if able. The opponents who bid more than one will be punished by Castamir and co. on the site 4, unless they pull an early Sam.<br />
<br /><br />
The Free Peoples side sets up early thanks to the four companion start and 3 copies of Saved From the Fire. The first one to get Saved, or should I say sac&#39;ed to the fire is Galadriel, after which you should have a decently equipped 5 companion fellowship and millions of twilight for the shadow player to spend. Forcing the shadow player to waste his minions on early sites is good, especially with the cards like Gandalf&#39;s Staff on the table and Servant of the secret Fire and/or Roll of Thunder in Hand. Even if the opponent deals you serious damage on the site 2 your fellowship is flexible enough to survive and outrun the opponent (the most recent example being my yesterday&#39;s game against the Beasterlings, where I lost 3 companions on the site 2 but still managed to outrun the opponent). You should play Aiglos on Greenleaf (or Fagsy, as we call him in our area) as early as possible. Generally you should avoid running early in the game unless your opponent runs. Depending on the draw, one Saved could be enough for the entire game, but sometimes you have to use all 3. <br />
<br /><br />
Normally you shouldn&#39;t have more than 5 companions on the table because of Enquea, Greed and your own site 7, but there are exceptions (if all the following conditions are met: healthy fellowship, Deep in Thought in hand against any shadow containing Uruk-hai, you&#39;re either past site 7 or planning on running 4-7 or 5-7 and you&#39;re NOT playing against the Nazgul you may have as many companions as you wish on the table). Saved from the Fire helps limit your fellowship to 5, and if you don&#39;t have it get rid of the excess companions using Shadow Between and Gwemegil. <br />
<br /><br />
Once you&#39;re set up, you can run all you want. With 4 Servants you should survive anything and with Gil-galad, 2 copies of Aiglos, 2 copies of Out of the High Airs and Radagast, as well as healing with Elrond and Shadow Between you should have no problem running. For example, in a yesterday&#39;s game against Dunland (check out the site 5 lol) I ran 1-3, 3-4, 4-7, 7-9.<br />
<br /><br />
Use your Gwemegil, Shadow Between, Corsair Plunderers and Ships of Great Draught to cycle. This is crucial, especially once you&#39;re clear on how you&#39;ll win the game.<br />
<br /><br />
Shadow are the Corsairs, known for their stopping power. Whoever dares to run gets to walk the plank. This corsair deck is built to survive all the bad matchups, like my fellowship for example. 3 rare ships and 2 (maybe even 3) Boatswains give the deck a chance against fellowships that are heavy on possession removal. Lookouts and Marauders get rid of allies (Deor, Thrarin, Gondorian Merchant) and possessions respectively, clearing the way for Castamir with the Halberd coming to crack skulls, two per site to be precise. Two copies of Discovered on the round trip on the rare ship will get rid of Sixth and Fourth levels, Citadel of the Stars and Stone Tower, giving Corsairs a fair shot at the Knights. Preparations, Gondor Bowmen, Stronger and More Terrible, There and Back Again, Escape, The Tale of Gil-galad and many other annoying conditions will be Discovered for the pleasure of Captain Castamir and his crew. Although Castamir and Ali Baba (Black Numenorean) are the only fierce members of the crew, the rest of the shipmates can at least be Fierce in Despair (with the help of the Corsair War Galley if needed). After Fierce in Despair hits the table, and Gandalf, Durin or Eomer, 3rd marshal disappears into the void their respective decks crumble and the crew is ready to pick up the loot.<br />
<br /><br />
Matchups:<br />
Dunland - 4 copies of Roll of Thunder (+one for Barliman) for 4 copies of Hides and Aiglos on Greenleaf do a great job, Gandalf&#39;s Staff and fully equipped Arwen (with the help of Servant or two) deny them sites, 2 copies of Deep in Thought on Over the Isen in the case of emergency. <br />
Uruk-hai archery - With enough vitality, healing and condition removal you should be OK. Never play more than 5 companions unless you have Deep in Thought in the hand. <br />
Uruk-hai berserkers - Removing their machines is the key. Healing, Gandalf&#39;s Staff and running cards are very important in this matchup. Never play more than 5 companions unless you have Deep in Thought in the hand. <br />
Uruk-hai site control - Your companions are naturally stronger and you have better pumps. Use your Aiglos to prevent them from gaining a site. Take out their site controlling conditions. Never play more than 5 companions unless you have Deep in Thought in the hand. <br />
Uruk-hai other decktypes - Your companions are naturally stronger than their minions and you have better pumps. <br />
Isengard moron swarm - Try to open up as many companions as possible, but don&#39;t go over 5 unless you have Deep in thought in your hand, for the opponent might play a few Uruk-hai with Greed. Try to limit the pool with Glamdring. Use your Greenleaf if able, use your Servants wisely. You might go for the shadow kill here, especially if the opponent chokes himself with minions waiting for the site 7. If there are many such decks in your area consider putting in Curse their Foul Feet x2 and Albert Dreary (S. Snows)<br />
Moria swarm- You have enough condition removal, plus Greenleaf with Aiglos and Servants. <br />
Moria-Corsair swarm - 4x Roll of Thunder, 2x Deep in Thought, Barliman, Servant x4, Greenleaf with Aiglos. <br />
Other Moria decks - They are on the endangered species list right now. No problem running against something that doesn&#39;t exist.<br />
Corsairs - Use your possession removal wisely. Use Gandalf&#39;s Staff to cancel skirmishes with Castamir bearing the halberd. Watch out for the Red Wrath. Whenever there&#39;s a possibility of the opponent playing Fierce in Despair use your Aiglos and Gil-galad to deny the opportunity. You should run cautiously with the help of Aiglos, Gil-galad and Out of the High Airs.<br />
Beasterlings - Use your possession and condition removal wisely. You need a Roll of Thunder - Deep in Thought combo to get rid of Small Hopes. Once they get you to 2 burdens (and they will) you need to rely on Roll of Thunder on Polearm + Greenleaf with Aiglos. Cancel your skirmishes with Gandalf&#39;s Staff. Once Sam hits the table, keep him around and use him wisely. In about 80% of my games against Beasterlings Sam gets the Ring at site 8 or 9. Run if you have less than 2 burdens, but only if you&#39;re equipped. If you play everything right you&#39;ll be able to run in the late game with no problems. Be extremely wary of the Red Wrath.<br />
Easterling Corruption - Use Greenleaf with Aiglos, Frodo can fight with Sting and/or Servant around, never allow Gollum to win and keep Sam alive. <br />
Southron Archery - Keep to small fellowships (preferably 4 companions), pull out the healing early and use your condition removal. Be wary of the Red Wrath. Replace the companions as they die. You should open as many companions as you can before the final run.<br />
Other Southron decks - Use your healing, roll of thunder on Mumakili, Deep in Thought on conditions and you should be OK.<br />
Threat Nazgul - NEVER have more than 5 companions on the table. Use Roll of Thunder on the Pale Blade. You have enough healing to outrun them with the help of Out of the High Airs.<br />
Nazgul "smokers" (Black Breath, Blade Tip) - NEVER have more than 5 companions on the table. Use Roll of Thunder / Deep in Thought combo on their conditions. Don&#39;t run early in the game unless you are set up really well. You have enough healing to outrun them with the help of Out of the High Airs.<br />
Nazgul Corruption  - Use Roll of Thunder on Fell Beasts and Nazgul Rings. Use Gandalf&#39;s Staff and Greenleaf with Aiglos against the WK. Run with the exhausted WK on the table. Heal Frodo with Elrond.<br />
Morgul Orcs - Greenleaf with Aiglos, Frodo is the Ringbearer, Heal using Elrond and Shadow Between. Run with the help of Out of the High Airs.<br />
Sauron wound deck - Protect Gandalf, use your condition removal, heal with Elrond and Shadow Between, run when there is no more than one condition on the table. Watch out for sites 5 and 9 in case they play Morgul Ambushers.<br />
Sauron corruption - Use your condition removal, if Frodo gets Thin and Stretched fight, but keep a wary eye for The Eye of Barad-dur. Keep Sam around.<br />
Sauron initiative - Use the coindition removal, never give them initiative.<br />
Sauron besiegers - Engines (mostly conditions and Grond) are vital for the besiegers. Use Roll of Thunder - Deep in Thought combo to discard them. Try to stick to small equipped fellowship of 4 companions after you discard their conditions so they can&#39;t get them back. Use your Aiglos - don&#39;t let them control sites or stack minions on the site they control. <br />
<br /><br />
That&#39;s all folks, and remember, the deck is more fun if it&#39;s completely foiled.<br />
<br /><br />
EDIT:<br />
In response to some comments:<br />
1. Saved from the Fire is ESSENTIAL in a deck. It enables a quick setup, because of it I&#39;m able to keep only one copy of Arwen and Gil-galad for example and the deck functions as I have 4 copies of them (1 + 3 Saves). In addition it filters the deck thus enabling more effective Shadow pulls. It also limits the size of fellowship when needed. For example, you play against a Mordor wound deck and have 5 companions including exhausted Radagast in play, you want to play Sam from hand but if Enquea hits the table it would be a problem so you just sac Radagast and pull out whatever you need. Roll of thunder is also the key against today&#39;s meta as it gets rid of the Corsair ships, Easterling polearms and Raider bows, Grond, Ithil Stone plus it generates the pool for Deep in Thought. This deck flows BETTER than a 30-30 deck without Saved From the Fire.<br />
2. I&#39;ve experimented with the Binding Ring and Vilya before. However, the Binding Ring is a liability in a current environment full of Beasterlings - you want them to work two get their two burdens and not give it to them for free. Without the Ring-pulling ability, the Binding Ring is inferior to the Isildur&#39;s Bane. Vilya is a good idea (but the one which goes both on Elrond and Gil-galad and may serve as a pump), but the cards that are currently in the deck worked better for me before. I think that Narya would be an overkill against the corsairs as I already have 4 Rolls of Thunder (5 with Barliman).<br />
3. Corsairs are very much alive, just ask the people who played against me in the yesterday&#39;s tournament (4-0, 2 shadow kills). They provide the best stopping power out of all the existing shadows.<br />
