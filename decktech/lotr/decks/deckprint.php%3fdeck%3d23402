<br>
This deck is based loosely off of my earlier deck Devonator’s Moria Family Album.  I’ve broadened my arsenal as a Lord of the Rings player since I posted that deck and this deck reflects some of my new play philosophies.  (Also, I wanted to see how my super-fast Dwarven fellowship would accommodate my Sauron Hate Shadow.)<br>
<br>
“What does it do?”<br>
The fellowship survives and the shadow kills companions.  Then at site 9, when you’re at my Tol Brandir because you can’t exert to map your site 9 because all of your companions are exhausted, you’ll find that trackers have been on your trail from the beginning and they’ll jump on the Ring-Bearer. <br>
<br>
“Why are you playing [insert card here]?”<br>
<br>
Prancing Pony: I’m bidding to go second.  If I’m going first, it’s because my opponent has made me.  That means that he believes he has a very strong shadow side.  The Prancing Pony gives me another strong companion early to weather the storm.<br>
<br>
Trollshaw: True, my deck might benefit more from Midgewater Marshes, however I plan on stopping at site 2 to get more throughput.  The extra throughput will take me to more Bowmen, Hates, and Watching Eyes.  That strengthens my shadow.<br>
<br>
Balin’s Tomb: Again, I could play Dwarrowdelf, but I don’t want to exert Gimli.  Instead, by playing Balin’s Tomb, I gain a neutral site with a relatively high shadow number that could benefit me.<br>
<br>
Anduin Confluence:  Was there any other choice?  Aragorn dies quickly in my deck and my shadow relies on the Archery phase.<br>
<br>
Shores:  I play a large fellowship.  That translates Anduin Banks into pain.  Shores is the next best site.<br>
<br>
Tol Brandir:  It’s the “Make Frodo Dead!” site.  3 orcs from hand and 3 orcs from the discard pile after killing 2 companions means a site 9 overwhelm.<br>
<br>
Ranger of the North:  Refer to Prancing Pony.  This companion is NOT necessary!  He’s supplementary.  I do not rely on Aragorn!  He’s meant to die.  Furthermore, it has been said, “A fresh Ranger of the North at site 9 is an auto-win.”<br>
<br>
Legolas, Greenleaf:  Another supplementary companion.  But before he dies, his 2 arrows can buy you one more site.<br>
<br>
Son of Denethor:  He’s 2 blockers in 1.  He turns Frodo into a fighter and then dies.<br>
<br>
Make Light of Burdens:  This is such an underrated card!  Black Breath, Blade Tip, or Desperate Defense on Gimli or Gloin . . . use MLoB to discard them.  You can also use them if Saruman’s Snows are threatening to quench your Flurries.<br>
<br>
The Dwarven Armory: Gimli’s Helm is big minion protection.  Bracers are Hate, Archery, and Isengard protection.  Gimli’s Axe owns orcs.  Dwarven Axes force potentially game altering discards.  And Hand Axes are just all around useful.<br>
<br>
Flurry of Blows:  Get 2 axes on any dwarf and watch them go to town.  Why don&#39;t I play more Dwarf pumpers?  Because for the most part Dwarves pump themselves.  I really only need the Flurry when I&#39;m looking at a Cave Troll, Balrog, Lurtz, or Witch King.  So, with 4, I&#39;m getting them by the time I need them AND they&#39;re effective.  Any more pumpers would just be overkill.<br>
<br>
The Dwarven Literature:  Each Dwarven Tale is a free Gloin Pumper.  Greatest Kingdom destroys orc decks.  Stairs destroys Moria decks.  Till Durin Wakes turns the passage from site 3 to site 6 into one large sanctuary.<br>
<br>
The Shadow Side:  Direct Damage at its best.<br>
<br>
“You need Condition Removal . . . “<br>
<br>
The only sides where condition removal is really important is against Sauron and Moria, both of which are Orc shadow sides.  My deck owns orcs.  With Axes, Band of the Eye, and Greatest Kingdom, I’ve burned 97 cards out of a 100 card Moria deck before . . . and my opponent was playing conservatively.  Against a Sauron Burden deck, Make Light of Burdens and Boromir prevent the strategy from being effective.  Against a Sauron Hate deck, I have Bracers for the Hate and places to put the wounds.  That leaves Isengard and Nazgul.  Worry is a nuisance but only if my opponent wins his skirmishes.  Saruman’s Snows is a non-issue with MLoB.  And Blade Tip and Black Breath suffer the same fate as Desperate Defense.  So, as you can see, when I need condition removal . . . I have condition removal.<br>
<br>
“Okay, so you kill Orc decks.  Isengard and Nazgul still own you.”<br>
<br>
True, Isengard and Nazgul are tougher match-ups than Moria or Sauron, but I still beat them.  With 8 companions, I have a place to put all the wounds and replacements when a companion dies.  That means that I have protection for Gimli, Gloin, and Frodo who are my most important companions.  Besides, this fellowship’s primary purpose is to survive, which it does.  And if my opponent is playing Isengard or Nazgul, it generally means they’ve focused on a running fellowship.  My deck likes to kill fellowships that run.<br>
<br>
“Well, Gandalf decks own you.”<br>
<br>
Yes, a Gandalf deck is my most difficult fellowship match-up because of Sleep, but most Gandalf fellowships only run 2 copies of Sleep and rely on Barliman to bring it back.  Tower Assassins take care of Barliman.  And as long as you play your conditions intelligently, you should be able to overcome Sleep, regardless.  <br>
<br>
“Okay, so how does it work?”<br>
<br>
Early Game: Bid 1.  If you get the option, choose to go second.  Start Gimli and Gloin.  Set up your direct damage and discard trackers at the early sites.  Save your Hates unless it will kill a companion.  Move your fellowship to site 2 and stay there.  That way during your next turn, you’ll be able to play possessions and see a lot of cards that will help you establish your shadow.<br>
<br>
Mid-Game:  Start looking for occasions to kill a companion with Hate.  But save it if it isn’t a guaranteed death.  I generally start playing Hate around site 5 or 6.  Meanwhile, set up your fellowship with Tales, Weapons, and extra Companions.  It’s time to catch up.  With Till Durin Wakes and Flurry of Blows, it’s easy to double move through Moria.  I’ve faced a Cave Troll w/ Hammer and Balrog at site 5 and moved right past it effortlessly with this fellowship because I get to heal with my tales.  I’ve even doubled past both sanctuaries with only 1 wound on Aragorn to show for it.<br>
<br>
Late Game:  Put the fear of a double-move for the win in your opponent’s mind to hopefully force a mistake.  Meanwhile, keep killing companions.  Then, at site 9, bring some trackers back to close the deal.<br>
<br>
This deck is fun, because Gimli and Gloin get mean while the Bowmen, Watching Eyes, and Hates are just evil.  Try it and you’ll see.  Well, I guess it might not be very fun for your opponent.<br>
