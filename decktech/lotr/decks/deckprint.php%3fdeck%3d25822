Mostly because it doesn&#39;t exist anymore... :)<br>
<br>
I&#39;m posting this to get feedback on the Sauron half of the deck. As such, I&#39;ll only concentrate on that part...<br>
<br>
Minions:<br>
<br>
Band of the Eye - Str 12 and Vit 3. All I really care about :)<br>
<br>
Morgul Warden - I put this guy in since he&#39;s strength 9 base and 3 twilight. His ability doesn&#39;t get used TOO much but last night it helped me overwhelm Gloin (str 11) so he does have his uses. Once again Vit 3 orc.<br>
<br>
Orc Swordsman - He&#39;s an obvious one, lots of wounds and with a sword is str 13 (15 vs Aragorn), also, lower twilight so can play him in a bind or if I want to hate someone :)<br>
<br>
Morgul Hunter - Another obvious one. Min strength 10 and Vit 4, bit expensive though...<br>
<br>
Orc Trooper - When given 6 twilight (dang roaming), I can toss him down and have a str 14 minion with 3 vit. Not too bad. He&#39;s in to boost up the number of minions so I&#39;m not stuck like Nazgul sometimes get..<br>
<br>
Tower Assassin - Str 11, Vit 3, Can kill allies. Nuff said.<br>
<br>
Orc Pillager - This guy is gold vs. pumped up Aragorn and Boromir. (and platinum against dwarves) With a vile blade making him strength 12, it almost guarantees a win for the fight. It also makes it a little easier to overwhelm...<br>
<br>
Vile Blade - The deck is VERY twilight intensive, I felt there would be little left to pump up the scimitar.<br>
<br>
Enduring Evil - Useful for overwhelm or just plain winning if you really have to, I don&#39;t rely on it though. Now 3 in the deck.<br>
<br>
Enheartened Foe - Had success the first fight, come around again :) There is now 3 in the deck<br>
<br>
Thin and Stretched - Adds burdens, boosts Enduring Evil. Nice if I get it early, doesn&#39;t kill me if I don&#39;t. Added another to make 2 in the deck since I was relying on it quite a bit (Sam hurts when he comes out :P)<br>
<br>
Hate - There is now 4 in the deck (found some space).<br>
<br>
I forsee twilight denial decks as a major concern and archery decks as well. I&#39;m looking for suggestions that will help improve the deck. Large fellowships may cause problems, depends on if I can overwhelm their companions or not...<br>
<br>
I mostly play one minion at the earlier sites if I can and throw away one if I can&#39;t (and sometimes when I can as well :P). The goal is to win the fights and keep the fellowship from double moving (my friend double moved after easily winning his fights, I dropped another 3 orcs on him and killed all his companions except Frodo, whom I left alive since there was 2 minions in my hand for the next site). I use Hate to weaken his big fighters or to kill off a weakened fighter. Other then that, it&#39;s pretty self explanatory.<br>
<br>
This deck has definate problems against anyone that is capable of cleaning off the burdens as I need more Orc Banners to make the enheartened orc capable of overwhelming someone. Until I get some, I don&#39;t see this being fixed..  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
