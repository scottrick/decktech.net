    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is a pretty easy deck to play after you get used to playing it.  All the free people cards are made to be out of your hand as soon as you get to your fellowship phase.  Its a pretty big uruk hai deck so I put 2 Elronds to help with card drawing.<br />
<br />
<br />
The free people side is made to run.  It is large fellowship so you can dispense wounds throughout the entire group.  Make sure Aragon and Gandalf stay allive as long as possible because the deck has many cards based around them.  There are 2 A rangers versality in their to help fight aganst Nazgul which gives this deck its biggest problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Shadow side is only their to help my fellowship run without being hurried and being put into unfriendly moves because I have to catch up with them.  It slows most fellowships down by making their characters be afraid of the damage +1 and they only move sites one at a time.  It has wariness in the deck for people who use frodo at every site 2-5 but he never fights, with that they almost always lose the game from that move.  <br />
<br />
<br />
This deck is 8-0 so far in tournament play and its is going to hopefully lead me to a State Championship or 2. <br />
<br />
Have fun Playing it becasue that what this game is made for. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
