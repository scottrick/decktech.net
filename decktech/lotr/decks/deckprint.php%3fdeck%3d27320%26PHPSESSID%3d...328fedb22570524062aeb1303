<br />
To start off, I want to thank a lot of people who I never even met except over the LOTR list serve for helping me piece this deck together.  Also, this deck is posted for some of my locals who want to see the deck in print.<br />
<br />
Little background.<br />
<br />
I had heard of this deck that was practically a guaranteed site 5 win over the Net and I just had to find out what it was.  After some inquiry, I found out - it was called the Uruk Bomb.  It relied on a perfect hand at site 5 of Saruman, KOI, Regulars, and Ravagers to kill your opponent pretty dead.  I figured it was impossible to do - I mean trying to cycle the perfect hand seemed really dependent on luck.  Then I learned the trick - you use your fellowship side to manipulate your hand to the perfect hand.  After several days of playtesting, this is the deck as it has come about.  It has lost once out of 16 games so far - and that was to a site 3 Sauran swarm (don&#39;t ask - it was ugly and was all trackers...)<br />
<br />
The deck relies on a few things:<br />
<br />
First and foremost it relies on your opponent going first.  To do this, know your local meta - bid one above what everyone else normally bids then force them to go first.<br />
<br />
The second thing it relies on is your opponent revealing his game plan before site 5.  This is very important to force.  Find out if his deck relies on:<br />
<br />
Conditions<br />
Archery<br />
Skirmish abilities/events<br />
<br />
The third thing it relies on is your opponent not playing any adventure site path manipulation (ie - Pathfinder, Thror&#39;s Map, etc.).<br />
<br />
The fourth thing it relies on is your opponent playing no maneuver phase wounding abilities (ie Defend it and Hope) or Albert Dreary.<br />
<br />
The fifth thing it relies on is no discard strategy (thats why No Business of Ours is in there - Mirror kills this deck).<br />
<br />
So how does it work?  Simple.  Your fellowship side consists of cards that can practically all be played immediately.  The Frodo is chosen to prevent hand discard (really hurts the deck).  Some of those cards allow for you to draw extra cards (Elrond, Gandalf) or discard cards (Ottar).<br />
<br />
Early on play anything you get into your hand for fellowship.  For Shadow, you are trying to build the following perfect hand:<br />
<br />
Saruman, Keeper of Isengard<br />
4 x Uruk Regular<br />
3 x Uruk Ravager<br />
1 x Bullet Card <See Explanation Below><br />
<br />
So what are the Bullet cards you ask?  Simple - there are three in the deck:<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power<br />
Saruman&#39;s Snows<br />
Spies of Saruman<br />
<br />
If you see Betrayal of Isengard or Gondor Bowmen, cycle a Saruman&#39;s Power into hand.<br />
<br />
If you see uber-Archery, cycle a Spies of Saruman into hand.<br />
<br />
If you see a bunch of Skrimish events or special abilities (IE STEALTHS), cycle a Saruman&#39;s Snows into hand.<br />
<br />
Anything else you get into hand either<br />
<br />
A) Play<br />
B) Discard<br />
<br />
You will normally deck yourself at site 6 or 7.  The deck is small so that you can easily cycle the Wizard&#39;s Are Never Late into hand (to get Gandalf and Ottar) and start off with a relatively good shadow start to the site 5 kill.  However, unless your opponent gets lucky, you will beat him at site 5.<br />
<br />
The site path is chosen to hurt your opponent.  <br />
<br />
Site 2 adds twilight to the pool to prevent the decision to move on (giving you more time to cycle your perfect hand).  <br />
Site 3 gets rid of all weapons - very important as it makes just about every companion less in power then your Uruks.<br />
Site 4 exerts two companions - unless they have Theoden.  One less health is always good againstt the Uruks.<br />
Site 5 lets you get your Uruks out cheap<br />
Site 7 is more for those decks that have actually lived past site 5 - not many do so it is not really a big concern<br />
<br />
Remember - your deck relies on your ability to judge your opponents game.  Play your troops and warriors to force them to show their hand early.<br />
