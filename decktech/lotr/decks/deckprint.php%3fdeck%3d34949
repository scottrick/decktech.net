Please keep in mind that this deck only includes cards from the Towers Block, hence no Aragorn&#39;s Bow or Greenleaf. But you will want to use AoM as a powerhouse to heal Gimli (who exerts to pump Legolas) and your Lorien Swordsman. The Swordsman is also a key point to this deck. His game text will save you quite a bit of problems with high strength/vitality minions, since combined with an elven bow and his text, along with the help of Legolas, he can take out some tank minions. In fact, he could probably defeat the Witch-King, Cave Troll, Balrog, you name it. Since you are running a small fellowship, we are using HoE as our Aragorn, to help with high numbers of minions. Also, using Severed his Bonds can save your Frodo from having to skirmish. This deck also works very well with double moving, due to the fact that most minions will be taken care of with archery and the swordsman, and with Legolas, you can have a healthy fellowship for the double move.<br />
<br />
The shadow side was contributed to this deck by Patrick &quot;Patrick M. S&quot; Sullivan, it is a basic towers sauron swarm, and you will have to d-mail him for the strategy, since i don&#39;t have it.<br />

Thank you for reading, and please review!<br />
