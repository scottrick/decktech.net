<br />
Since the local meta has been primarily focused on Moria Swarm decks, and Nazgul and Sauron decks have fallen by the wayside for now, I usually can bid four or five burdens to go first and pull out Aragorn with the Prancing Pony.  The Breeland Forest is used to get an early overwhelm on one of the Hobbit Companions that everyone seems to be playing right now.  Without being able to sneak out, Merry or Pippin could very well die here.  The Council courtyard removes twilight as my Fellowship starts to move underground, which could help in the long run.  The Great Chasm gives the most Twilight for any Site 4.  The Bridge is the Bridge.  Dimrill Dale allows the first Moria minion to be played at -2 Twilight. The Anduin Wilderland gets my Moria minions through the Archery phase alive.  The Shores of Nen Hithoel give a huge amount of Twilight, and if I can play five minions, my opponent cannot double jump to Site 9.  Emyn Muil allows a few of my minions to be Fierce, and this can be crucial if your opponent makes it this far.  Fierce minions force your opponent to burn PATHS and the like to stay alive through the first Skirmish, only to be overwhelmed in the second Skirmish ( read my latest tournament report to see how this helped me win the last event I attended ) <br />
<br />
FELLOWSHIP STRATEGY<br />
<br />
Again, try to go first to play the Pony, so Aragorn can be pulled right away, if you lose the bid, don&#39;t worry, with three Aragorn&#39;s in the deck, he usually shows up by Site 3.  With the new Pippin, Aragorn AND Gandalf are played for only 2 Twilight.  I use the rare Aragorn, so that he can exert to be Defender +1, a powerful ability against a Swarm of little minions.  Swordarms make him Strength +4.  Rumil and Aragorn&#39;s Bow can get rid of a few smarming minions during the Archery phase.  Sting and Glamdring can be huge Twilight denial if played to look at the right hand.   Orc-Bane wounds all minions except Nazgul, and if playing against Moria, it usually kills off a few before your opponent gets any action.  Bounder is there to save Frodo from the minions that get through to him.  Power According to his Stature gets rid of minions piled on Frodo.  Armor protects against Uruks, cave Trolls and Balrogs.  Flaming Brands help keep you alive against Nazgul.  Sleep Caradhras can get rid of all conditions that are active, especially discardin Goblin Swarms with a few minions stacked on it, or Goblin Armories.  With these advantages, this deck runs over Moria Swarms, handles Uruk-Hai and Sauron, but can struggle against a good Twilight Nazgul deck.<br />
<br />
SHADOW STRATEGY<br />
<br />
Swarm your opponent at every Site beggining with Site 4.  Eventually you will win by overwhelming Frodo.  The Balrog and The Cave Troll are there to lend a hand in getting rid of big bad Gondor men.  If your opponent makes it to Site 9, make everyone you can Fierce, and assign extra minions to first kill off any Companions, letting all of the Fierce minions get to Frodo in the second Skirmish.   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
