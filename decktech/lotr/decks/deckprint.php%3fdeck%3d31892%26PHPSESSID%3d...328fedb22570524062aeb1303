And I also know that Dauntless Hunter chews it up. But fortunately with the emergance of Beasterlings, Captain Crunch + Polearm, Dauntless Hunter has become slightly less popular. <br />
The FP&#39;s side is archery and frantic exerting to wipe out the opponent&#39;s hand each turn with White Arrows. Elrond is your main guy since he can exert up to 3 times a turn. Arwen wipes out pretty much anything that comes her way once she has her sword and horse, and Legolas can fight as well. The archery will keep a pretty good cap on most minions, and just absorb the wounds - you&#39;re almost never going to get a Fellowship win, anyway. <br />
The shadow side is the real fun. My personal favorite is after they&#39;ve lost their hand at site 5, drop a couple Desperate Defenses on one of their comps. and assign Bill Ferny to them to add a couple burdens. Once that happens you can discard the top 5 cards of their deck with Desperate Measures. Your orcs exert and discard more and more cards, and often by about site 8  they have no draw deck left, and then it&#39;s just a matter of getting the burdens up there. Or, if you&#39;re ahead, you can double the rest of the way since they can&#39;t play anything. That happens rarely but has won me a couple of games. <br />
Even though this is just a fun deck, it still wins about 60% of the time and leaves your opponent dessimated. Nothing is more fun than when his 9-companion Rohan army is at site 9, there&#39;s only 1 minion out, and you corrupt Frodo for the win. Muahahhahahhahahah! <br />
