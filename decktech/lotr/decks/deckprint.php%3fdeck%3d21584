<br>
***STRATEGY EDIT 1***<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve already received reviews that "IF I don&#39;t get Gandalf..."!  Let me once again explain the concept of Throughput.  There are FOUR Gandalf&#39;s in the deck--1/16th of my deck.  My Nazgul cards play to the table fast in the beginning.  Therefore, by site 3, I should have gone through 15 to 25 cards.  Yes, there are 60 other cards in my deck.  It is conceivable that he would be the bottom 4 cards.  It is also conceivable that my deck will arrange itself perfectly by shadow half and free people&#39;s half...BUT it&#39;s not likely.  Probability says I WILL get Gandalf.  Yes, the anti-draw does happen, but it doesn&#39;t happen all of the time.  I WILL draw Gandalf in most games.  It&#39;s not an issue.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, if I don&#39;t draw Gandalf, probability says that it is VERY likely that I have either drawn Aragorn or Nelya.  Therefore, I will have Aragorn.  And in the event of the dreaded anti-draw, it is more beneficial to me to have Arwen and Legolas on the table than Gandalf.  From sites 1 to 5, the greatest threats are Nazgul and Moria.  Arwen and Legolas help vs. Nazgul and Moria.  This keeps my deck alive until the late game when Gandalf has made his appearance and makes it possible for my deck to make the end run.  That is why Gandalf does not start!<br>
<br>
***Strategy Edit 2***<br>
<br>
The deck has changed some.  Make the following tweaks:<br>
<br>
Add Albert Dreary<br>
Add 4th Ulaire Cantea<br>
Add A Wizard Is Never Late<br>
<br>
Remove 1 Servant of the Secret Fire<br>
<br>
Why did I make these changes?  <br>
A Wizard Is Never Late will get me to Barliman, Albert, or Gandalf depending on what the situation calls for, and since it can go get Barliman, it may as well also be an extra Servant, Sleep, or Strength.  <br>
I have wanted to add Albert since the very beginning, I was only waiting to get my 4th Cantea to add the extra card.  <br>
Cantea is nasty.  He forces your opponents into thinking about how they assign, and that allows your Black Breaths and Blade Tips to wreck.<br>
The choice to remove a servant over a sleep was a meta choice.  Sauron is becoming pretty popular here, and if I have to wait until the end of the game for Sleep, I may not be able to, because Gandalf may be exhausted from Under the Watching Eye.<br>
<br>
***Strategy Edit 3***<br>
<br>
In response to reviews that my deck will have trouble with Uruks and Trolls.  Well the Trolls will only come down so many times.  If it has the hammer, I&#39;ll shoot him down without a second thought (and in case you&#39;re wondering, Strength of Spirit will ensure that my archers aren&#39;t exhausted).  If he doesn&#39;t, I do have to think about it, but I may still.  Typically he&#39;s only going to hit the table and be effective from sites 4 to 6.  Afterwards, you have to worry about ARV.  Uruk-hai are a different story.<br>
<br>
First of all, the original design was a meta choice.  Nobody that I play on a regular basis plays Uruk-hai.  However, you will notice the change in Edit 2.  That helps a lot.  The other thing that helps is the realization that the magic fellowship number against Uruk-hai is 4.  Let Arwen die.  Then Savagery isn&#39;t as nasty and chances are pretty good that you&#39;ve already drawn out a Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry.  If not, keep the following things in mind.  You&#39;re opponent can&#39;t have both Snows and LBC/Savagery.  Therefore, be aware of the situation.  Also, you should have either Sting or Glamdring, so you can look at your opponent&#39;s hand to know when you have something to worry about.  There&#39;s still that archery thing to contend with, so the Uruks have to survive to skirmish.  LBC reduces power making Servants that much more effective, so you can save your Servants until LBC to be sure that LBC doesn&#39;t kill Gandalf or Aragorn.  Finally, remember that you&#39;re walking a shortened adventure path because the Nazgul are the strength of the deck.  This deck can beat Uruk-hai.<br>
<br>
***END EDIT***<br>
<br>
First of all, please don&#39;t say that the fellowship isn&#39;t original.  With only one set out currently, there aren&#39;t that many viable strategies.  The same holds true for the shadow, however the shadow is more versatile.  So, let me try to explain why the deck is the way it is, and then you can make your judgment based on the deck&#39;s merits.<br>
<br>
To start, let me give you a brief summary of my intention with this deck.  You want to go second to define the path and let your Nazgul pave the way for your fellowship.  Every Nazgul card "should" hit the table almost the moment you get it.  That creates throughput, which gets you to your important fellowship cards.  That strengthens your fellowship so that you can march to site 8.  Two A Ranger&#39;s Versatilities means that you should draw one around site 6.  You then use ARV with archery to double jump 6-7-8.  That forces your opponent to double jump 7-8-9, where he should be on the receiving end of 3+ fierce Nazgul.  You win . . . of course, that&#39;s only if you didn&#39;t overwhelm the ring-bearer before all that.<br>
<br>
THE ADVENTURE PATH:<br>
<br>
Prancing Pony: Pull Aragorn<br>
Bree Streets: My Nazgul NEVER Roam!!!<br>
Ford of Bruinen:  2-3 Fierce Nazgul at the Ford of Bruinen plus a Blade Tip or Black Breath means a dead companion before the first Sanctuary.<br>
Moria Lake: 3 Twilight is the most for a site 2.  Plus it&#39;s not an underground site.  Very important vs. Moria decks.<br>
The Bridge: If you have any suggestions for a better site 5, I&#39;m open!<br>
Galadriel&#39;s Glade: It&#39;s a neutral site.  It does nothing for me, but more importantly, it does nothing for my opponent.  It&#39;s not a forest, so no A Ranger&#39;s Versatility here.<br>
Anduin Wilderland: I&#39;m playing Archery, so this hurts me, but it hurts my opponent more.  Remember if I play my site 7, my opponent has gotten there first.  Therefore, I want to try and keep my opponent here.  Without an archery phase, A Ranger&#39;s Versatility doesn&#39;t cripple my shadow nearly as much as it normally would.<br>
Shores of Nen Hithoel: For the Shadow, this site gives me 9 twilight meaning lots of Nazgul, and when my opponent is considering double jumping, 2 fierce Nazgul following plus another one or two at site 9 is a tough force to overcome.  Hence, if my opponent manages to get to site 9 before me, I should be able to overwhelm the ring-bearer there.<br>
Summit of Amon Hen: With a hand of 10+ cards, I should have no trouble overwhelming the ring-bearer.<br>
<br>
THE START:<br>
<br>
First, don&#39;t tip your starting fellowship (Legolas and Arwen) until after site 1 has been revealed.  You want your opponent to bid as aggressive as he can.  As for your bid, bid 2 burdens.  You bid 2 because if your opponent outbids you, they probably want to go first, therefore you&#39;ll define the adventure path, AND your swords will make your Nazgul damage +1.  Therefore, you&#39;ve got a huge advantage.  If your opponent underbids you, you opt to go second to define the adventure path.  You won&#39;t get the advantage of damage +1, but your sites should be all the advantage that you need.  If your opponent doesn&#39;t double-jump to site 3, don&#39;t double-jump to get ahead.  Ford of Bruinen is too devastating.  If your opponent bids 2, it&#39;s a toss up.  If your opponent wins and makes you go first, he should add a burden to get Aragorn, making your Nazgul Swords damage +1.  Then, move to site 2 and stop.  When your opponent moves to site 2, don&#39;t play any minions (If you can, try to act angry at your deck), it should entice your opponent to double-jumping to site 3 meaning massive twilight at the Ford of Bruinen, and that equals lots of damage (or if you have a Nelya in hand, you can double-jump to site 3 and use him to play your Ford of Bruinen).  But any way the bid plays out, you should have an advantage from a bid of 2.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, when you go second, you want to get Aragorn and Gandalf out as soon as possible.  3 Aragorns and 4 Nelyas mean that you should have no problem playing Aragorn at site 1.  Furthermore, 4 Gandalfs mean that you should have one of your big guns out off of the bat. <br>
<br>
SHADOW:<br>
<br>
For minions, I use the 5 best Nazgul.  There is only one other Nazgul worth his salt--Ulaire Lemenya--but he&#39;s not fierce.  These 5 are.  Attea boosts to power 17 on his own (perfect for overwhelming).  Enquea kills excess companions.  Toldea potentially kills by assigning companions to him.  Cantea discards weapons ensuring that you&#39;re Nazgul are inflicting maximum damage.  And the Witch-King . . . he&#39;s the nastiest nasty of them all.  And when he&#39;s armed with the Pale Blade he discards Last Alliances, No Strangers, and Talents for Not Being Seen.  Between the Pale Blade and Cantea, the Nazgul should maintain their skirmish superiority.  Even a supercharged Aragorn or Boromir won&#39;t be able to defeat them consistently, and that means companions are dying . . . especially when you throw in Blade Tips and Black Breaths.  I considered adding Nazgul boosting events, but I opted instead for the Nazgul Swords.  Most reliable (i.e., non-burden dependent) Nazgul boosters add 2 to power and cost 1.  The Nazgul swords give the same boost for the same cost, however they add power twice since my minions are fierce, and they will often make my Nazgul damage +1.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m playing them.  But overall, my entire Shadow is fueled by Morgul Gates.  Nasty Nazgul for cheap is just disgusting, and it increases my deck throughput.  What this all means is that, with the exception of a few turns of surplus minions (which is a good thing), you&#39;re going to unload every Shadow card in your hand driving you to your important Fellowship cards.  This Shadow strengthens your Fellowship . . .  a lot!<br>
<br>
FELLOWSHIP:<br>
<br>
It&#39;s a standard start--Legolas and Arwen.  Of course, it is a solid start.  Arwen, Gandalf, and Aragorn are all strong enough to defeat Nazgul.  Legolas and Aragorn with his bow can easily handle Moria.  Sleep, Caradhras and Athelas will handle Sauron.  Uruk-hai are a bit of a problem since I&#39;m not playing Armor, however with Archery, a beefed up Gandalf, and Servant of the Secret Fire, you can win skirmishes, which will stop you from taking too many wounds.  Just move slowly!  And if you&#39;re still not convinced, you can pull one Servant and/or Sleep, and add Albert Drearies or Armors.  However, I assure you it can handle the Uruk-hai.<br>
<br>
The deck doesn&#39;t start Gandalf, but 4 of him mean you should get him quickly.  And Gandalf is the most important companion in the deck.  You need him for Sleep Cardhras, Servant of the Secret Fire, and Strength of Spirit.  Because of Sleep, I don&#39;t play No Stranger, the Tale of Gil-Galad, or the Saga of Elendil, but Strength of Spirit covers the latter 2 conditions.  But mostly, it means that there&#39;s never a bad time to play Sleep.  So, you can use it to wipe out Blade Tips and Black Breaths; Goblin Armories and They Are Coming; Orc Bowmen and Under the Watching Eye; and Saruman&#39;s Ambitions.  Strength of Spirit is nasty when used for aimed archery, and it&#39;s also nasty when used with Sting or Glamdring vs. Moria or Sauron.  Meanwhile, Servant of the Secret Fire is your all-purpose skirmish winner.  However, it&#39;s essential that you keep Gandalf alive.  Without Gandalf, you lose the benefit of all of the important events, and the events are the deck.  When you need to, it&#39;s easy to double jump if you&#39;re winning your skirmishes.  The events make sure of that, and Barliman Butterbur keeps those events coming back.<br>
<br>
So, in summary, Nazgul cards play to the table almost immediately getting me to my Fellowship cards.  I stack my fellowship with a beefed up Gandalf and Servant of the Secret Fire plus aimed archery with Strength of Spirit.  Thus, I walk slowly to Site 9 allowing my Nazgul, Swords, and Blade Tips and Black Breaths to wreak maximum damage.  If the game gets that far, I double jump 6-7-8 to force my opponent to double jump 7-8-9, which allows me to drop 3+ fierce Nazgul on my opponent to kill one or two remaining companions so that in a fierce assignment, one of the Nazgul gets to the ring-bearer.  I win!<br>
<br>
Thanks for reviewing!  Enjoy!<br>
