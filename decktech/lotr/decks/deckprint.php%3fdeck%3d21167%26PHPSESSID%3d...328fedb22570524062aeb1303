A few words on matchups here.<br />
<br />
Nazgul - BB & BT really aren&#39;t a big deal. Pippin will occasionally have to be sacrificed, but that&#39;s about all he&#39;s good for against Nazgul in the first place. Move one at a time, and *never* give five twilight going into site 3 unless you&#39;ve scanned the hand for Nelya. <br />
<br />
Uruk/Snows - This can be tricky, BUT: 1) I don&#39;t think its a strong deck against anything else. 2) There and back Again still does its thing. 3) With Talent out, they&#39;re getting a whopping 8 twilight at site five. That&#39;s two wimpy Uruks and a Snows. Should be managable, considering LBC, Savagery, Ambition, and BFB are all out of the question.<br />
<br />
Sauron & Moria - Not much trouble with these. Built-in healing & burden removal for Sauron and Stealth events and PATHS and Merry for Moria.<br />
<br />
A few words on card choices:<br />
<br />
No second They are Coming - It&#39;s good, but the Swarms, Host of K&#39;s, and the high-throughput fellowship offset the need a bit. <br />
<br />
No Bilbo - He was in there originally, but if he shows up before the Farmers, he&#39;s too expensive. 95% of the time, you won&#39;t want extra fellowship cards in the deck for the end-game.<br />
<br />
And a note on bidding:<br />
<br />
I&#39;d bid in the one to three range, and go second. If you like to live dangerously, try bidding a little higher and going first. It can be rough against Nazgul, especially if you don&#39;t draw your Stealth Events or Map early, but it does give you an advantage in that it pressures your opponent to double-move. You&#39;re taking a gamble either way, so just play as you like.  <br />
<br />
-End Update-<br />
<br />
We&#39;ve all seen decks that use the high-throughput Moria Swarm to fuel a solid, generally ranger-based fellowship. This deck goes the opposite route, using high-throughput Hobbits to coax the opponenet into a Moria-style beating at sites 4-6.<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious power-houses like Swarms and Goblin Armories, the real champs of the deck are two combos that I haven&#39;t seen preached anywhere else. They are: Plundered Armories/Guard Commander and Enquea/Goblin Domain. <br />
<br />
Plundered Armories lets you get extra twilight out of your Scimitars, assuming that your other Armories are out, and assuming that they&#39;re shooting your guys with Archery (both fairly likely). The Guard Commnader can put the twilight to work immediately, either overwhelming companions, or sending cheap Goblins to the swarm.<br />
<br />
Enquea is a card worth including in any deck, but the Domain just makes him that much more potent. This is a key combo against decks with lots of companions.    <br />
<br />
The synergy of the comes from the choking power of Hobbits. The Farmers make all the allies free, leaving Sting, Hobbit Sword, and There & Back Again as the only cards with twilight cost. Talent For Not Being Seen further reduces twilight yield (hence the three copies). The inability to get minions out of hand at sites 2-4 can lead to difficulties drawing essential fellowship cards early.<br />
<br />
Whenever possible, use Sting to check for nasty stuff - especially PATHS. If you see it, pile the spare minions on somebody else (Legolas is a safe bet) and make them waste PATHS on a lone guy, or try to accumulate enough Goblin Armories to negate it. <br />
<br />
The absence of the Cave Troll is not an oversight; it is Ranger&#39;s Versatility bait after five, and not garunteed to show up at five without serious changes - three Trolls a Hammer and a Keyward is a minimalist package, in my opinion. That many slots takes too much away from the swarm strategy. If your playgroup hasn&#39;t discovered the virtues of Boromir equipped with Armor, then feel free to swap in a couple of Trolls.<br />
<br />
The Fellowship side is designed simply to stay alive, though it can occasionally pull a free double-move thanks to Sting. Merry is the all-star of the fellowship. Don&#39;t be tempted by the measly power bonus from the common version: adding five (or seven) to any other companion (provided Merry survives) is the ultimate insurance against overwhelm attempts. Use him wisely. <br />
