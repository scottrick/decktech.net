Somewhere in here is the solution I found to flaming brand that I personaly haven&#39;t seen anyone play with in a long time. So read up THEN rate the deck.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
The free side is something you&#39;ve all probably seen before. Its an archery deck with strong companions to fight anything that gets through the arrows. Gandalfs cart is there to increase throughput. Usually keeps Frodo safe enough. I just came off of moria, so I have two weapons for each companion to make sure everyone has a weapon and everyone can fight with the somewhat slower throughput.<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
Bid 0. If the opponent wants to go second, they are probably playing nazgul, in which case you should play the pony and pull aragorn, httwc and try to get your possessions and archery going early. Their sites will be nazgul sites, so your shadow shouldn&#39;t be hampered. If they want to go first, they are probably playing the pony. If not, you have 5 gondor companions, you&#39;ll be fine. They will be moving to your sites, so have some fun. Weatherhills is there instead of Weathertop because the large majority of my nazguls are already fierce (only the 2 lemenyas aren&#39;t). Many people think that if they don&#39;t bid much, they won&#39;t have too much trouble. The truth is, if you don&#39;t bid much you&#39;ll have a bit of trouble. If you bid a bunch, you just hung yourself. Individual nazgul cards are important (there is only nine nazgul and they&#39;re all special), so i&#39;ll explin them card by card.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Cards:<br>
<br><br>
<br>
The Whitch-King - Big mean and ugly. I play with 3 because 4 is too many. If a cavetroll can overwhelm it so can the whitch-king.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Attea - Second strongest nazgul on average. transfers blade tip most often. Nothing quite wakes you up like a site 3 balrog.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Toldea - Toldea is the bomb. Most high biding decks try to avoid enquea&#39;s game text just barely, which leaves you with 4 burdens. Perfect. Use him to assign to small companions to punch them out of the game, or to large ones to black breath and blade tip them. Fairly strong.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Enquea - If you haven&#39;t been shut down by this guy at least once already, you either haven&#39;t played long enough or have been very lucky. Keps control over large fellowships. If the opponent bids 4, they&#39;ll have 5 with eregion hills, which equals a dead companion.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Cantea - On of the ways you could get rid of Flaming brand, but only if your opponent is left with no choice or has a sudden and violent attack of the stupids. Works best with another nazgul or a sword. Relativly cheap (5).<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Lemenya- I went to a no-rares tournament and had so much fun with this guy I thought I should put him in my regular deck. Oh no! Aragorn is power 16 against nazgul! he fights toldea with a sword! Black breath! only power 14 now! looses! Blade Tip! Fun! Also good if you want to overwhelm a lesser companion. For exaple, if the opponent thinks assigning lemenya to Greenleaf is safe, Black breath! legolas is power 4 and dies (assuming they forgot to support him enough). Also, he has the power of an uruk-kai for about the same price (4).<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Ulaire Nelya - I use the old version because its more important that he fights twice, and transfers conditions. The opponent won&#39;t always bid anything.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Morgul Gates - This is the card that lets you deploy multiple large nazgul. This card, blade tip, black breath, and gandalfs cart push the throughput in this deck to between high uruk-kai and low moria standards. A possible Whitch-King and Toldea for only 10 twilight. Don&#39;t use it until it will make a big difference. If you can play a nazgul with the twilight already in the pool, don&#39;t play Morgul Gates.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Beauty is Fading - My new favorite card in the game. Number one defence against Flaming brand.. or trust me.. or last alliance, some pesky bow, gandalfs cart, or any other possesion or condition you don&#39;t want the fellowship to have. The funest thing I&#39;ve ever done, however, was pulling this card in my starting hand and fading aragorn at site 2. Defenately worth the 5 twilight to play it. I think its better to have one nazgul win than 2 nazgul loose.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Wreathed in shadow - Anti archery. Archery realy doesn&#39;t hurt this deck too much unless they devote their entire deck to it, in which case they didn&#39;t put in enough cards to make their companions strong enough early enough so they get overwhelmed or blade tiped. Usually used in the later sites when their fellowship has had a chance to set up. Your nazguls may be entirely wiped out by archery at one site, but don&#39;t let it phase you, because they only need to win once per game.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Black Breath and Blade tip - This is why they only need to win once per game. Sure, you can cancel these with any number of cards, but not before they have had enough effect to make a big difference. In other words, you may take one damage now and one damage at the beginning of your turn and then cancel it, but I&#39;ve got toldea ready to finish you off. Try to play these strategicaly. If the companions is doomed anyway, save these for latter. Its not like they clog your hand.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Nazgul sword, Black steed, Threshold of shadow - These are basicaly pumps to send your nazgul to even greater heights. Don&#39;t splurge with these, try to make it so your opponent clearly remembers each card you used because of the companion it killed. Its more fun in after game conversation that way.<br>
