I got the deck from the Pre-Release Event and it is awesome. I took out 1 Mouth of Sauron and also added cards. <br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
First of all, you bid low so you can go second.<br />
Every Plains or Battlegrounds site you are at gives Eored Warrior +3 strength. Eomer is just helpful defensively and his Regroup Action which allows him to send an opponents minion to his opponents hand every time the Fellowship moves.<br />
The Free Peoples side of the deck is based aroun Eored Warriors.  Give them A Rohirrim Mount and A Rider&#39;s Spear and there at a Plains or Battleground site, There unstoppable.<br />
<br />
The Shadows side of the deck is based around the new men culture and Fierce Minions. I added Oath Sworn for some extra twilight tokens to help deal a good beating. A good Minion in this deck is the Frenzied Dunlending. With a solid strength of 12 he&#39;s pretty good. He is also Fierce at a Battleground. You should also definately use the Mouth of Sauron to get a Possession or Condition from your draw deck by simply exerting him. A good possession on this deck is Long Battle Bow which makes a man an Archer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all I really hve to say about this deck. It was pretty good as it was built to be.<br />
Don&#39;t forget to rate it. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
