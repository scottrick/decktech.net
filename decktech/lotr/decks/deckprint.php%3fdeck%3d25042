SORRY the 2 too great and terrible in the FP section are supposed to be Trust me as you once did of course!<br>

=================EDIT II===========================<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
As some ppl mentioned gimlis and legolas weapons...they WERE in there day 1 in the hands of tom huber...he told me he usually lost one of them (or both to replace them with boro and gorn against uruks) early and then their weapons cloged his hand...i switched gimlis helm for the second aromr (as its playable on TWO comps), added another gorn and ranger sword for the axes...don&#39;t remember what went in for legos weapons...but i just felt better with it that way, you need less chars, AND it doesn&#39;t hurt the deck at all to loose lego/gimli maybe even both of them early against nazgul...i agree especially gimlis axe is gosh darnit strong...<br>
add on...(edit 3) WHY blade of gondor then?...well cats was right it went in there instead of the third flaming brand (kindoff) BUT i wanted a second nazgul fighter...gimli isn&#39;t legolas isn&#39;t (especially lego cause he&#39;s not dam +1)...a third brand would be better against nazgul, but the blade can help big time against uruks...so i risked it AND...holding ONE weapon until the right char shows up isn&#39;t that much of a problem as loosing a char KNOWING there are three wasted cardslots in the deck now...imho<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
It IS a metagame deck...i usually played a 64 card version of it, but couldn&#39;t fit all the cards i wanted in there...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
It is build to beat uruk/gandalf signet or elf ally decks, but prooved to be very reliable against any other deck (like hotookoke, twi denial...)<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
for more details about how it worked in the tournament, read my Tournament report (amsterdamaged from 13th August => http://www.decktech.net/lotr/treports/treports.php?view=2&id=3906)<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
i found NO card useless during the tournament...everyone fulfilled its purpose at least once...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
strategy...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
I bit 1 to let my opp start, and have the edge to decide when he bis 0...i started ONE game the entire tournament, that was against sauron when i felt like running...it worked, as the fellowship is very strong when set up<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
The nazgul are killers at the beginning especially an early nelya wreks havoc among the usual bid 5 get sam start...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Too great and terrible, played on the second move kills gandalf 80%...unless he saw too great and stored the cards in his hand...well but you should realize when he does so, his hand i cloughed then and you should run!...or play too great to get rid of two servants...not a bad tradeoff either...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Try to slow your opp down and maybe overtake him on the move to 6 if you can&#39;t kill him, store too greats in your hand...two shoule kill for sure...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
card choices...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Why don&#39;t start gandalf? i like to have TWO comps especially against nazgul...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
why FOTS over the g-signet? well he is stronger, he wins skirmishes, AND with frodo lego and gimli i have already the 3 needed signet chars out from the start...especially against uruks (don&#39;t come over four comps...you know the deal) just replace whoever dies...but don&#39;t let gandalf die of course :)<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Aragorn ROTN over the new twi remover? well obviously because he has the right signet...and for swarm defense<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Sam son of hamfest, i don&#39;t bid high, but i wanna have the OPPORTUNITY to bid high...especially in such a big tourney when i COULD face an opp twice, and maybe want to run on the second go...AND ther were some corrupt decks floating around the days before...i had no time to test against so i thought burden defense isn&#39;t bad...nor is a tossable companion or a second ringbearer...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Filibert BOlger is a lifesaver! especially against saruman you nulify his bonus at the last location...just make sure frodo has two exertions left and you may sac all other comps on the first fight...obviously<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Servants is the backbone of the deck...save those whenever you can, take wounds (not to many) especially with armored boro/gorn, you&#39;ll need them for key skirmishes (overwhelm troops to double move and such...)...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Trust me...abuse it whenever you can (especially to save the servants), it won&#39;t stay for long when you face a power heavy environment...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Betrayal helped me against saruman big time once...a nice silver bullet, could be exchanged by a third trust me...(was NOT in the 64 card version...)<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Sleep Caradhras...you shouldn&#39;t play that card when you rely on trust me yadayadayada...i know...but this deck doesn&#39;t RELY on trust me...trust me is nice when you have it but not necesarry...you just need mass condidtion removal agaisnt moria, and holland IS moria country, i needed it desperately against sauron, and sauron bowmen/utwe HURTS the usual trust me deck big time...AND I decide when i play sleep...if i don&#39;t need it i drop it, if my conds are more important this turn, i play it next turn...so it just sweeps your conds away when you want it to...proved worthy in the fifth game...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Nazgul Swords...you need them to win skirmishes AND twilight nelya with sword (maybe backed up with a treshold) OWNS!...scenario at the tournament...bid 5 remove 3 with sam, sac sam, move to eregion hills...three burden and down he comes...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
A treshhold...force boost is always good...plus i hate it when greenleaf just takes cantea twice with an evil grin...with treshold he dies and you might get a shot on an armed char...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
too great and terrible and their power is in terror...these are the backbone of the shadow side...designed to break the neck of the expected metagame...and it worked where i needed it...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
why black breath and no blade tip? well no space...and i found black breath more important as having gandalf black breathed helps alot against trust me, and not being able to heal is in general a bigger thread then taking one healable wound imho<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
the minion choice is self explanory i hope...if you have questions just dmail me....<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
anduin confluence over anduin wilderlands...it depends wheter you fear archery or allies more...for amsterdam i was clearly more afraid of allies...but i think ARV WILL have a revival in the near future...we&#39;ll see<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
shores of nen hitoel of gates or argnoath...i run 5 lifesaver maneuver cards...i wanna be able to play them...and nazgul need the twilight...i still don&#39;t like the moria will stop you no matter who&#39;s site 8 lies part, you&#39;ll have to doublemove from 6-8 against moria...<br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
enjoy the deck!!<br>
