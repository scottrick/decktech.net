<br />
<br />
Free peoples <br />
Bid 3 or 4. Go first and play Pathfinder. I you don&#39;t have one, reconciel your hand; No matter what it contains!!!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a Ranger Ring Bound deck so you&#39;ll need to make the minions roaming. According to this, you have New Errant and Gondorian Ranger. <br />
<br />
Against Dunlands : You&#39;ll need to be carefull not to play too many weapons you can discard and play it with weapon store. <br />
You have 6 companions in play ( +1 since Eomer is Defender+1 with Firefoot), play them all. Don&#39;t forget archery phase and try to slow them by not permitting site control (win key skirmishies). <br />
<br />
Against Uruks : Difficult but they are roaming till site 5 so you can make them roaming easily. I&#39;ve never lost against them but I needed to be very carefull! <br />
<br />
Against Raiders : They will be less effective since you only have 1 unbound compagnion. Archers can be a problem.<br />
<br />
Comments on cards (same as in version 1): <br />
<br />
Pathfinder is a key card of this deck. You need to play first since your shadow side will be more effective. But you also need site 2 or site 3 to immune your dunlands to archery. So pathfinder makes the connection between your free people and your shadow. You can run like mad and play your sites to boost your dunlands. Very effective in this deck. <br />
<br />
Eomer is a great fighter and he&#39;s defender+1 when he has firefoot. I packed him in this deck for 3 reasons: <br />
- He&#39;s strong, <br />
- I can play weapon store to break down possession removal decks, <br />
- I can play Brego. A great combo with Gondorian Ranger (not a good fighter but needed for this deck) and a Ranger&#39;s Bow. <br />
<br />
Notice I now play 3 Eomer (thanks Treeplanter, you was right!)<br />
<br />
Shadow <br />
Dunland are strong for two reasons. Both are played in this deck. <br />
- Site control : It&#39;s a bit difficult but enormous when you reach 2 sites <br />
- Possession removal : THE reason why I play this culture. <br />
You need to be very carefull since this is perhaps the more difficult culture to play. <br />
No Retreat can be strong...<br />
<br />
Have a nice playing, <br />
Nico <br />
