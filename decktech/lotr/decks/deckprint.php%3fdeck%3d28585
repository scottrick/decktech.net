These new "Rubber Rohans" as I call them are a lot of fun to play.  Gamling&#39;s our man.  The more you give him, the bigger he gets!  Put a possession on Gamling during a skirmish then *BOUNCE* it right back into your hand in the regroup with the Rohirrim Scout.  With thanks to the Rohirrim Scout and Ecglaf, he will never be without a possession of some kind. Need more possessions still?  Discard an armory and get more! These new Rohan companions with their maneuver actions just really rock!  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I prefer to go first, so I usually bid zero or 2...I want MY sites out.  Be careful tho, as there&#39;s not much burden removal in here.  Give Eomer his spear and a horse and he&#39;s one tough guy.   Need to pick off an exhausted minion?  Discard a Rohirrim Bow and finish the job. Need it again? No prob!  There are so many cycling and play abilities with these characters and possessions that this really makes for a fun deck to play (in addition to kicking some butt)  If only I had Firefoot.....  Anyway Eowyn and Theoden heal my allies, along with Well Stored.  Are those Isengard or Dunlending conditions getting you down?  That&#39;s ok. Just win some skirmishes with Rohan men (thanks to Hlafwine and Leod) and stack tokens on Fortress Never Fallen.  With one sweep you can wipe out as many conditions as you want.  I’m not sure yet if a second one is needed.  Lindenroot is great for hand clog (not to mention you can always get your possessions back) and against Isengard.  Faramir is there for his Ring Bound-ness and Aragorn for his bravery to take on more than 1 minion.  Give it a try, you&#39;ll have fun (and bug  your opponent for using those "rubber Rohan possessions" LOL)  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
One thing I’ve noticed so far is the potential to have too many possessions in your hand and not needing to use them all.  Depending on what I am skirmishing, I can either play them all on Gamling and use one or both of my Scouts to bounce them back into my hand or just leave them.  I did, however, make sure to include different classes of possessions. Yea, Grima bomb will hurt, and I’ve been burned by that shadow card that makes a companion strength –1 for each card borne by them. Also, the Cavern Entrance will definately put a crimp in my plans, but by then, I will have some of my other companions out.  I feel that the fellowship can work a bit better, but not quite sure how.  I have only 1 Ring-Bound companion, so a burden strategy can really hurt me.<br />

SHADOW:<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Dunlendings.  What else can I say?  They&#39;re big.  They discard possessions.  They control sites.  They come back for more.  Can&#39;t kill them first time around?  Look out.  Control a site or two? OUCH!  No Retreat can be a game breaker.  No Refuge gives you the twilight needed to get out a swarm.  Constantly Threatening makes your opponent think twice about double moving.  Secret Folk discards those troublesome free people&#39;s possessions along with War Club and Dunlending Pillager.  Now if only there was a more consistent way to make them fierce...  I seem to be doing ok with just 2 Hides, but I think a third will really help things out. Now that I have a few more War Clubs in my collection, I’m debating whether to add a few more in.  Thruput seems to go well so far, which worried me a bit with the strategy my Fellowship has.  Over The Isen is a GREAT card!  Once it is out and you control a site, you can control the assignments, and therefore start targeting weaker or key companions.  The trick here is to get control of a site to begin with.  So far I’ve had a tough time getting control of a site, especially early game, but I hesitate to make the shadow a split of Uruks and Dunlendings.  Maybe a third Wulf?  I am still lacking on some needed cards, but once I get a hold of them I think it will really improve this deck (ie. another Hill Chief, Hillman Horde).  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Otherwise once things get set up, I think this deck holds its own pretty well.  If my shadow can&#39;t slow down my opponent or swarm  at 9, my fellowship can usually get Frodo home safely.  I really enjoyed building and playing this deck.  Hopefully with a few adjustments I can make it tournament worthy.  Thanks all for reading and lemme know of any suggestions!<br />
