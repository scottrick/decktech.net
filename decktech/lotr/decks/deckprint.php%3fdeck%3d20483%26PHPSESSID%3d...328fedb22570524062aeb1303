Restrict the opponents deploy, while dropping as many minions as possible to keep him from moving on. Simple huh? no...well read on. <br />
Ok this deck was made from 2 starters and under 10 boosters (i had to trade for the Lurtz and 1 sting, though). even with these limited resouces, this deck has placed second at my first Lotr tournament here in Sydney, since my falling away from swccg. in a 2 round 3 player tournament we held, with the 3 winners of each round going into the final for a play off, this deck won the first round in my group for me and placed second in the final under Ross Mathieson.<br />
It was based on Hayes&#39;s Cave troll control deck. i have found Uruk-hai to be the most underated of the shadow cultures, they can lay the beats with the damage +1, and many have fierce capabilities. Lurtz is just a beast almost as powerful as the Witch King and Cave Troll, thought much cheaper than either and he is damage +1, archer and almost always fierce. i play only 2 condiitons to help against archery, and 4 Saruman&#39;s ambition to pump up the minion strength. this card has the strength that it plays on table freeing up your hand, waiting for when you need it. unfortunatly it is vulnerable to Sleep, Carahdras. the sole Shadow event, Bred for battle helps in th early or later game to overwhelme an unwarey character, mostly for the ring bearer.<br />
the real fun part of this deck is the fly by the seat of your pants Fellowship!<br />
the idea is to give away and absolute minimum tokens for your opponent&#39;s shadow minions.<br />
No stranger to shadows and A talent for not Being Seen usually come out early to make every sites shadow cost neg. 2!! huge! Sting also helps to keep tabs on thier hand and further reduce the twilight pool. <br />
<br />
EARLY GAME: Start Aragorn with the Green Dragon Inn to screw with the dominate Prancing pony decks. use it to pull Sam, and remove some burdens which Aragorn can then remove. you should bid high, usually 4 but you can go as high as 6.<br />
double move 99% of the time to site 3, just keep your strength adders for NAZGUL. Hobbit stealth cards are important hear, thought not essential. with a small fellowship and atleast some of the pool removal cards should have come out by now.<br />
the othe rimportant thing with this deck is it is at a minmum 60 cards. this means that your chances of pulling what you need when you need it are increased( at least thats how it has worked for me)<br />
<br />
MID GAME: never double move to site 5. deploy move stuff and site at site 4, be wary of moria swarms now and Cave Trolls. i never deploy Legolas early cause free goblin scouts make me sad. oh and always keep a bounder till after site 7 cause that site that kills allies sucks. use sting to have a look and then double move to the site 6 sanctuary if they have enough to handle. now use your minions to keep the opponenets fellowship one step or more behind.<br />
<br />
LATE GAME: Take it easy, dont double move unless your sure the opponents minions can be handled. by now you should have no stranger to shadows and a talent for not being seen out to put a cap on the opponents pool. merry can be thrown down anytime cause of his low cost.<br />
oh and use Sam to remove as many burdens as possible b4 site 9 or The Summit of Auden Hen could really screw you.<br />
<br />
Further Card Choices:<br />
Elendil&#39;s Valor: sometimes it really helps to make Aragorn or Boromir defender +1<br />
<br />
Let Folly be our Cloak: its nice to remove another 1 or 2 tokens from the pot.<br />
<br />
Boromir: the only other real important free people to get to the table. helps Frodo and Sam survive. Legolas is a risk cause of the archer hate that abounds in every game.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats all from me. <br />
keep haveing fun (or at least try to)<br />
later<br />
