Telling me "Sauron can work" isnt so. First of all, WHO CARES? Does it have ANYTHING to do with the deck? NO. Can they work WELL? NO. And thus it apalls me why idiots like you are even allowed to rate a deck....this deck got me into day 2, and with your DT rating, your decks cant even seem to get you a win, yet you give me a 3. I WILL, though, address the other person and tell you that Too Great and Terrible was a last minute addition to the deck. I didnt think Trust Me decks posed too much of a threat, and if I come across a deck that doesnt use Gandalf heavily, it could just as easily be a dead card I dont need. Again, if Gandalf is strong in your area, add another. <BR><br />
<br />
<br>This is the very deck I used in DAY TWO at the Premier Series tournament at San Diego Comic-Con. The Day 1 deck is NOT much different, just simply switch out a card and take out 2 as follows:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br />
<br><br />
Betrayal for Sleep<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Remove Armor<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Remove Too Great<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
This deck&#39;s design comes from Mike Mendoza, and I give credit to him as such. This is my version of the deck Mike used to win the Northern California Terretorials earlier this year. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The idea of the deck is to keep your fellowship small, but strong, so they can pack a punch while not triggering counter cards such as Enquea and Savagery. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The deck is 62 cards, which is really small by today&#39;s standard decks. As such, the deck draws cards easily and you find the cards you need faster. Starting Gandalf nets you not only 1 additonal card a turn, but allows you to play your Servants right off the bat if need be. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The fellowship side is pretty straight foward, arguably the 3 strongest companions in the game, Sam is just there so you have the option of bidding high if the need arises(I generally bid 3, as with this deck, it doesnt matter whether or not you go first). King in Exile because every companion in this deck bears Aragorn&#39;s signet, effectively allowing you to skip santuaries if you need to. The deck is semi-choke, since everything you play doesnt cost a whole lot, and you dont have more than 4 companions out for most of the game. For you to be able to double move, you need to make sure the minions at your site are dead, which is why Sentinels is in there(why I chose Sentinels over the other pumps I&#39;ll explain later). Banner is there to get you out of tight spots, PATHS is for Moria and the ocassional Uruk deck, sparing Saruman, which is what Betrayal is for. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The shadow side uses Nazgul for a few reasons, first of which being that the deck is a small deck, and Nazgul can play off small decks without cutting anything remotely important from the Shadow side. Also, for Comic-Con, Origins, and most of the tournaments world-wide, Uruk-hai is the top choice for Shadow, and I needed something to catch my opponent off guard. Prior to Comic-Con, Nazgul have to slowly but surely slipping from the tournament scene, with every deck nowadays packing Flaming Brand against them. Nazgul force my opponent to equip early, or pay the consequences if they dont. My fellowship side also doesnt run as fast as other decks, so my Shadow needs to be able to slow them down to a halt at every site, something Uruk-hai cant even do sometimes. Other than that, its your standard Nazgul deck, 2 Tower Assassins for Mirror decks, Too Great vs Trust Me Decks, Nazgul Sword to punish people for bidding too high, and my site 4(its brutal when they both trigger). The Balrog is in there in case I cant drop a decent squad at the Bridge, and is almost always worth playing if your opponent doesnt have Armor by site 5. (Note that EVERY Nazgul in the deck is it&#39;s non-Twilight counterpart from FoTR)<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
The sites are your standard Nazgul package, Gates for anti-Versatility, Anduin Wilderland to counter archery.  <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
vs. certain Shadow - <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Moria - Moria doesnt usually possess a threat, as your Men and Wizard can win most fights against them. PATHS is HUGE here, as is Servants and Banner. Sleep is there to kill the conditions, but there&#39;s only one, as I didnt expect to see Moria at San Diego. Betrayal can also work in conjunction with your semi-choke fellowship. If Moria is strong in your area, consider adding another to the deck.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Sauron - Please. Sauron has ALWAYS sucked and it likely always will. The only time I lost to them PERIOD was at Comic-Con due to my own stupidity. With the way you choke them, your Men will be beating them down all the way to site 6, and then some. The conditions can be annoying, but they all cost Shadow, especially the Bowmen. If your area is pro-Sauron(heh, right), add in another Sleep.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Uruk-Hai - Uruk Hai-struggle against this deck, with the 2 Armors and the Pumps/Servants. By giving them just enough at the higher sites for 2-3 Uruks, they&#39;ll likely drop just Saruman and wait for you to double-move into him. Once you equip your Weapons, they need to pump just to win, at which point you pump, making them kill another of thiers to do a wound to you. Holding both PATHS can also be a game winner, and Betrayal always helps too. Savagery should NEVER work against you either.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Isengard Orcs - Getting your weapons here is crucial. The more the Orcs take in the fight, the less they can exert. Also, the Orcs are somwhat expensive, and thus your Choke can really put a hurt on them. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Nazgul - This the the deck&#39;s semi-weak spot. Nazgul have the tendency to run wild on small fellowships. I choose Sentinels over the other Gondor pumps for the sole purpose of Nazgul. Armor helps against Pale Blade and whatnot, but the Breath/Tip is DEADLY if they nail the right people with them. The advantage here is that you&#39;ll be able to make use of thier sites as much as them, so do your best to beat them at their own game. Your Fellowship generally CANNOT handle double moving against Nazgul, so dont try it unless you are desperate. (Keep in mind I tailored this deck for San Diego, where Nazgul werent to big, least on Day 1)<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Archery decks - Your Nazgul need to hit them early, as I dont pack Wreathed in Shadow to counter them. Once the Gondor Bowmen come out at the later sites, its over for Nazgul, so make the earlier sites count. Also try to go first against these decks, and outrun them if possible to site 9. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Trust Me - Too Great can be a game-winning card here for you(and it wouldve been in TWO of my games on Day 2 if it hadn&#39;t been in the bottom of my deck BOTH times, jacking off), but generally the companions start dying because Nazgul are FIERCE. They can only exert Gandalf so much, and they will try thier all not to assign a Nazgul to Gandalf. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Big Fellowship - Big Fellowship has declined alot due to just about every deck packing Enquea and 90% of the world playing Uruk-hai. If anything, more Shadow is more Nazgul, and if they want to double move on 2-4 Nazgul, by all means. You still choke thier shadow, and thus you could end up clogging thier hand with useless cards for a member of the fellowship not in play yet. <br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
Small Fellowship - You can easily out-run a small fellowship, as moving into just one Nazgul is deadly for them, especially with the Breaths and Tips. Nazgul run wild on small fellowships, so take advantage of it. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The whole reason on why I played this deck Day 1 AND 2 is because the deck is SOLID. It draws through the deck easily, it can handle almost any deck with little-no problems, and its got to super-fancy tricks to worry about. Please rate this deck accordingly, and read/rate my Comic-Con TR, already up on my page, to see this deck&#39;s performance. <br />
