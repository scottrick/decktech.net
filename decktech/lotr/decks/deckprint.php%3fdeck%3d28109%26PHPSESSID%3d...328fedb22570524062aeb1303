I hate playing the first week without new cards, so I worked REALLY hard to decide on a Free Peoples side that actually could win and that used a LOT of the new cards. This deck deck was what I decided on.<br />
<br />
One of the things that makes the Valiant Rohan apealing is that they have very efficient ways to do many things. They conserve twilight by not playing possessions until after the Shadow phase. They have good Frodo protection due to No Rest For the Weary, which is an efficient card in itself. They also have quite possibly the BEST condition removal in the game in Let us Be Swift, which requires nothing but spotting 3 Valiant Men and 1 pool to get rid of 2 conditions and Liberate a site. This is truly a great card.<br />
<br />
Heres how the deck works.<br />
<br />
Gamling is a KILLER. He just rolls over everything your opponent plays. Whether it be Cave Troll, Witch King, Vanguard or Moria Scout, Gamling kills them all. <br />
<br />
The basis of the deck is that you play the cards on Gamling to pump and kill the big boys, and then you use pumps like Thundering Host and the allies to win against the smaller guys, if needed. Also, you have Eowyn who can be healed easily and Theoden who will heal up your Allies. You also have 3 disposable Household Guards who look great becoming defender +1 and dying at site 7 to Moria. <br />
<br />
I think ALL of the cards are pretty self explanatory, so I&#39;ll spare you the break down. <br />
<br />
The deck can single move VERY easily and never die, and given either a good draw for the Free Peoples or a bad draw for your opponent, it double moves nicely. <br />
<br />
The down side to the fellowship comes in facing decks that either get out multiple big minions OR get out TONS of little guys, who end up swarming Frodo. In fact, the only deck that seems to be a REALLY big problem is Moria, since they can easily get out more minions than you have companions. The upper hand you have in that match up is that you have archery with the Rohan Bows, no Elves, so their Scouts cost, and Defender +1 that they cannot see coming. <br />
<br />
Seeing the weaknesses of the fellowship, I had to pair it with a Shadow that can stop the opponent relatively easily. Hence, the Dunlandings and COnstantly Threatening.<br />
<br />
By using the undercosted minions from BOHD, I am able to do two things. First is cycle my deck quickly, since I really only need a little pool to play multiple minions. The second is to build up an intimidating discard pile to feed off of with COnstantly Threatening. You see, it&#39;s easy to discard 2-6 cards from hand on the first move and not face ANY minions, but what do you do when moving again will bring those same undercosted minions back from the discard pile, along with any minions I drew up after dumping the hand the first time. Nasty.<br />
<br />
The rest of the Shadow is simply a Dunlanding Site Control deck. I realize that there aren&#39;t many cards that benefit from the site control, but the ones that do are a huge benefit. Know how good of a card Savagery is? Know how much better it would be if it was +4 all the time?<br />
<br />
Also, I play 3 Wulf because if you get him out with a Club and they can&#39;t beat him, thats gonna be a stop. <br />
<br />
Anywho, I realize that the Free Peoples is the best thing every, obviously it has some weaknesses, but I honestly think that it&#39;s the best thing that uses a majority of the new cards and can win.<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking.<br />
