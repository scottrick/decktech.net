<br />
Frodo&#39;s running solo, so here&#39;s your strategy:<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Bid High (4 or 5), and opt to go second.  The reasons for this are many:<br />
<br><br />
Your opponent will assume you are playing Nazgul, which you are not.<br />
<br><br />
You get to play your site 2, 3, and 4.  The Ferry dodges a skirmish where you can&#39;t handle it, and Silinde allows you to play stuff and then remove the shadow.  Hollin gives your Uruk-Hai some stopping power so you can keep up as you enter into the Moria terf.<br />
<br><br />
Your site 3 is not the Ford, which will generally kill you.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Your Uruk-Hai should pummel your opponent up to 5 burdens with Worry, AND THEN you drop Traitor&#39;s Voice.  Use the Bred for Battles liberally, but Hunt them Down comes out at a reasonable price only if you have 2 or more Saruman&#39;s Ambitions out, so try to keep them on the table (axe them if it means the difference between winning a skirmish or not for Worry, though).  I prefer HTD over Rampage because it&#39;s stealthy, and Ambition lowers its cost.  The high vitality guys (troop, raiding party) soak up the archery and do massive wounds with Bred for Battle, with the Wizard Storms threatening 2-5 wounds if they move again.  This deck is designed to stop your opponent, so lil&#39; Frodo doesn&#39;t have to run.<br />
<br><br />
<br><br />
(EDIT)Quick notes: Traitor&#39;s Voice makes move limits -1 (I had complaints about lack of stopping power), and I have yet to come across a copy of Savagery to Match Their Numbers, not to mention that it doesn&#39;t make minions consistantly fierce, which is why it&#39;s not included in this deck.(/EDIT)<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Tip:  Spot Gandalf/Bilbo to hold extra copies of TV and Worry.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Fellowship should try to keep up with opponent, but if it looks risky (check with Sting), then don&#39;t double-move.  If you&#39;re really falling behind, then your shadow is not doing it&#39;s job - start dropping those Wizard Storms and winning skirmishes so you can TV them, fool!<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Here&#39;s the deal:  Frodo heals a bounder every turn, and the Gaffer heals Frodo every turn, fully.  With Mithril, you cannot take more than 4 wounds per turn, really, and that&#39;s only with a double move and feirce opponents.  Don&#39;t give them too much shadow to work with, because it&#39;s just Frodo out there.  Moria Swarms are a problem - discard the Swarm/They Are Coming using Bilbo as soon as it comes out to remove the threat of Runners.  Same goes for any important-looking conditions of any other culture.  There and Back Again is not that essential, my friends, and unless you spot Uruks, neither is Stone Trolls.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Tip:  Never, should your opponent have enough for a Cave Troll.  Ever.  At all.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
We run into a problem with Archery.  Mithril makes it -1, but a Moria Archer deck will be able to drop 5 on you at about site 8.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s little to be done about this, except by killing their fellowship.  You might throw in some Hobbit Swordplays to kill low vitality archers in manuver.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Other than that, you have to play the game as sting calls it.  You will be able to tell exactly what you can handle with it (with only one companion, you can see how it&#39;ll work), so you can double move or not based on that.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
There he is.  Doesn&#39;t work too well against strong shadow, unfortunately.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
