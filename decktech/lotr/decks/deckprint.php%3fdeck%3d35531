There have been a few posts out there about an all Sméagol Freeps deck and I’ve used these as a way to build my own.  I have, of course, added my own “flair” by adding in the Not Listenings, Déagol, Fishing Boat and Gladden Homestead.  So to all who have already put forth an all Sméagol deck, I say thank you for the inspiration!  When I sat down to put mine together, I decided that I wanted one that was ONLY Sméagol/Gollum.  So that’s all that&#39;s in here.  You’ve got Sméagol cards, you’ve got Gollum cards, and that’s it.  Anything else would bastardize the deck.  This is the true epitome of a mono-culture deck!  Unlike other decks where the Freeps and Shadow are independent of each other, the two actual tend to work in union.  So I won’t strategize a Freeps and then a Shadow as if they’re two decks; the two strategies will be presented together.  So here goes!<br />
<br />
Going first is KEY with this deck.  Going first will allow you to control the twilight your opponent gets from you.  You have plenty of ways to control the site path, so don’t fear in that regard.  You also have a couple cards to eliminate burdens, so don’t fear to bid up to 2 so you can go first.  In the unlikely event that you don’t have any copy of One Good Turn or Still Far Ahead (perhaps just Follow Sméagol), use your Dammed Gate-stream as site 1 so you can play One Good Turn.  Then, add a burden to get it back into your hand.   No matter what, I will play the Dammed Gate-stream first.  Typically, I’ll use it to go get There’s Another Way or Don’t Look at Them (if I’ve got more than one copy of Another Way).  I’m not too concerned with discarding for Don’t Look since the Incited on the Shadow side will let me go back and recur any one of my cards.  Usually, Déagol is a good discard-fodder card.  This also will let you discard Gollum, Her Sneak without reservation.  Once Déagol and Her Sneak are in your discard, remove Déagol to play Her Sneak.  Now he’s fierce and str +2.  Combo that with a copy or two of Slippery as Fishes (+2 for each at all of your sites)…  NICE!  You should also have no problem dealing with minions on your first two moves.  I almost always double-move from 1 to 3.  When you start, maybe you put out 1 or 2 twilight (play a Poor Wretch, Follow Sméagol, Fishing Boat...) then the move.  1 for companions, 0 for region, 0 or 1 for site; you can use the Still Far Ahead to control this.  So your opponent may only have 3 to 5 twilight (unless you go real wild).  Make your move from 2 to 3 - 1 for companions, 0 for region, 0 for site.  Maybe now they can play a minion, but you should be able to handle it.  So now you&#39;re ready for your shadow hand...<br />
<br />
The main focus of the shadow side is WOUND!!!  That&#39;s what the cards are designed to do.  Your shadow hand will unfold a few different ways.  Early on, Gollum, DAD will be used unless you&#39;ve already got your Gollum, Mad Thing.  Chances are you won&#39;t be able to play your Shelob, so Gollum will be your way of wounding/exerting and DAD is great at that.  And don&#39;t be afraid to use your Snufflers; you can always get them back with Incited.  <br />
<br />
By the time your opponent is to site 6, you should (hopefully) be well developed on both sides.  You will have definite cards that are discard-fodder by this point.  They would include: Shelob:Eater of Light, Captured by the Ring, Little Snuffler, Déagol (if you haven&#39;t already discarded him)... You should be able to ditch all these to use for They Stole it or Don’t Look at Them.  I’ve found myself primarily using them for They Stole It since the copies of Nasty, Where Shall We Go and Clever Hobbits help Sméagol to win skirmishes.  Plus, They Stole It is a skirmish event and it will let you exert a companion with your copy of Promise Keeping out there.  More effective.  And, if you happen to find yourself in need of a card or two you’ve chucked, just get it back with Incited.  You should have a big Shelob and a big Gollum, Her Sneak or Mad Thing winning skirmishes and allowing you to recur those cards.  <br />
<br />
So this is my rendition of an ALL Sméagol deck.  This deck is truly one for fun.  I love playing it and I love the reaction from opponents when they see one companion and two minions - pretty counter-intuitive, but highly effective.  This is by far the most fun deck that I have ever played.  I don’t know if I’d have the confidence to take it to a tourney since it may not win more than it loses, but it’s definitely nice in casual play.<br />
<br />
I have thought about putting in a copy or two of Led Astray and/or Treacherous Little Toad, but I haven’t quite figured out how to do that without losing the effectiveness of the Shadow side.  So if you have any suggestions on how to accomplish this, please let me know!  I have also thought about taking out Neekerbreeker’s and replacing it with either Caves of Aglarond (remove 2 burdens) or Caras Galadhon.  I hesitate on both because of the shadow # for Caves and the fact that Caras is a forest which doesn’t aid the Slippery as Fishes pump.  I’m open to thoughts/opinions about accomplishing this without increasing the size.  I’ve found that more than 32 a side is too much.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
