On your first turn, pull Aragorn, KIE from your deck with Prancing Pony text.  Move to site 3 and stop.  Get your companions down as quickly as possible, and try to cycle through your cards to get the ones you need as quickly as possible.  You should be able to kill most minions in the archery phase, and any that escape, you shouldnt have much trouble killing.  Be conservative while in Moria, then rush to 9 once you get to site 6.  Its pretty simple.  Use swan-ship to let your allies fight and participate in archery, and double shot is huge, as it adds 1 to your archery total by just spotting an elf acher, which you should have plenty of.  Get as many no stranger to the shadows on your rangers as you can, as it really helps.  Try not to play many cards unless you  have to once you get to site 7, as you need to give the shadow as little twilight to work with as possible.  <br />
<br />
for shadow<br />
<br />
use your trackers in the begginning to lower your orcs cost.  get the DDOTR on companions as soon as you can, and try to always have 1 sauron orc fighting, so you can get the full benefit from DDOTR and Thin And Stretched.  The minions are extremely strong alone, and you have several cards to make them stronger...Enduring Evil becomes huge, especially as the game goes on and Thin And Stretched and DDOTR begin to take their toll.  Once they do, overwhelming should be easy, and you should be able to either corrupt, or overwhelm the ring bearer. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
