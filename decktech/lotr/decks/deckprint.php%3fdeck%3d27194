<br />
Many decks try to choke the twilight pool. That can be fun but has been done far too much. This deck is the opposite. This deck tries to fill the pool so much that you can swim in it and when you do you find that Gandalf actually floats. A no-rare deck.<br />
<br />
This deck tries to generate so much twilight that Gandalf will always be STR 10 at least. Then he can use Trust Me as much as he likes to protect the other companions and win skirmishes.<br />
<br />
The Shadow uses the evil Trackers to put a slowly mounting wave of pressure of the fellowship that will hopefully give them so many wounds that they will often have to single move. <br />
<br />
Companions<br />
Frodo, Tired Traveller is a Gandalf signet and you get to remove burdens when you play Sam and Faramir.<br />
<br />
Legolas, Elven Comrade is one half of the sweetest starting pair ever. He and Gimli are so good at helping each other that you should have no problem while waiting for Gandalf to arrive – after all, a Wizard is never late!<br />
<br />
Gimli, Unbidden Guest is the second half of the deal. His damage bonus often means that he is the companion at the front doing the damage when you want to double move.<br />
<br />
Gandalf, The White Wizard is the key to the entire deck. You want to get him ASAP and MUST keep him alive no matter what. The extra copies of him will heal him from all his Trust Me exertions. There are so many ways to add to the pool to get him up to STR 10  that he will almost always be winning his skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Sam, Son of Hamfast is the best burden remover in the game. Is also very useful to have against a Moria deck making it harder to do that one turn swarm win.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, Heir of Elendil will also make it much easier to survive until Gandalf arrives as well as helping against Moria and in the Cavern Entrance.<br />
<br />
Faramir, SoD is unbeatable. They can’t play cards in the skirmish but you have many options. Also crucial against Easterlings.<br />
<br />
Boromir, SoD is the ultimate Frodo protection, being able to make Frodo +3 can often save you the game. If you are against a non-swarming opponent he is very expendable.<br />
<br />
Eowyn, LoR is probable the 5th most important companion as she does so many useful things. She saves you from Kings Room, lets you play 6+ companions and gives you an easy way to add some more twilight to the pool to pump Gandalf. Never put wounds on her lightly!<br />
<br />
<br />
Allies<br />
Bounder can save you the game – once. Well worth one card slot.<br />
<br />
Filbert Bolger is yet another way to avoid some skirmishes, especially against those really nasty minions that you used stealth or a discarding Hobbit against to cancel the first battle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Possessions<br />
Wizard Staff not only makes Gandalf +1 but lets you potentially save another companion from death at the cost of 2 exertions.<br />
<br />
Dwarven Axe lets Gimli really hurt people. Don’t forget to make them discard.<br />
<br />
Elven Sword not only protects Legolas but lets you cycle your hand which can be vital if Gandalf is not around (late or argh...dead).<br />
<br />
Sword of Gondor can go on any of the 3 Gondor men. I often start it on Aragorn but move it to Faramir once he shows up.<br />
<br />
Hobbit Sword is always important for Frodo but with so many companions an Sleep you hopefully will not be swarmed too often and he shouldn’t have to fight too much.<br />
<br />
Conditions<br />
Trust me as You Once Did is the key to the deck. Unless things have gone badly wrong you should always have 3+ Gandalf signets making keeping people alive not too hard.<br />
<br />
Events<br />
<br />
Speak “Friend” and Enter is to ensure your site such as Deep of Helm gets to punish your and to avoid fatal ones like Cavern Entrance.<br />
<br />
Sleep Caradhras kills every condition. This is such a powerful card and destroys certain decks. Evaluate the cost against the benefit before you use it.<br />
<br />
Intimidate amaze your opponent by never having people die in skirmishes. Add 2 twilight to make Gandalf big. Play 6 companions and laugh when they play Enquea. Really annoys people. I hear comments all the time like, “that’s a stupid card” when it has just saved someone from certain death.<br />
<br />
Strength of Spirit cancels exertions and even better also adds to the pool. But who is likely to exert anyway? Well in this deck Legolas, Gimli, Gandalf, Sam, Borimir and Eowyn ALL will be exerting every game. The choice is yours.<br />
<br />
Mysterious Wizard not only gives +4 but usually makes enough twilight to push Gandalf to STR 10 making it a +7 pump. Try to beat that!<br />
<br />
Cards to consider – Barliman Butterbur, Armor and Softly and Swiftly.<br />
<br />
If you could add just one rare – Glamdring or Shadowfax. Make Gandalf even harder to beat.<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
The aim of the shadow is to wear down your opponents, to literally make them weary.  Win or lose they should be taking wounds regularly enough to make double moves difficult. With Abandoning Reason for Madness you should almost never have a bad hand and you can get through your deck very quickly to find the crucial cards that you need.<br />
<br />
Uruk Hunters are big and if they are playing a discarding Hobbit deck they lose. Give them a broad bladed sword and you can be fairly certain that they will be there for the second move.<br />
Uruk Searcher are your best minions, really bully people with Search cards.<br />
Uruk Chaser solid and basic.<br />
Uruk Seeker the weakest but very good value and very good against those with Weary.<br />
Uruk Runner simple, cheap but effective.<br />
Saruman, Servant of the Eye is Legolas Greenleafs worst enemy. You may also come across some sites that pull him.<br />
Ulaire Enquea is always good. Punishes large fellowships and burdens. Great!<br />
Ulaire Nertea gives you great flexibility to replay whatever you can best afford, sensational.<br />
Broad Bladed Sword make a huge difference. They are more like armor as they let your little guys survive to the skirmish and the +2 is not bad either.<br />
Uruk Spear often gets “abandoned” but of you are playing Rohan or Gandalf with Shadowfax that can be a turning point.<br />
Worry will never corrupt the ring bearer but just a couple of burdens allow your site 9 text to work and wounds prevent Filbert.<br />
Weary is the card of the deck. Hurt them just by assigning. If I could put in 8 I would.<br />
Abandoning Reason for Madness is actually there almost as much for your fellowship side. You NEED Gandalf quickly. Also prevents hand choke or underspending when your opponent has a big turn. Prevents them being able to plan properly when they “Sting” you.<br />
Vengeance is such a great pump card. Against an all common deck people often go back to playing make Aragorn into a mule. This punishes them. My best was against rare Faramir with Weary, Sword, Brand, Bow, No Stranger and Boromir, My Brother – a +12 pump.<br />
<br />
Cards to consider – No Business of Ours, Many Riddles and Saruman’s Ambition.<br />
<br />
If you could add just one rare – Grima! Put weary on them and say goodbye possessions.<br />
<br />
Sites<br />
[1] The Riddermark gives you the ability to survive until Gandalf arrives. If Aragorn dies so what?<br />
[2] Wold of Rohan without Ugluk you are unlikely to spot 3 trackers but this should add enough twilight so that you will be able to spot another one at site 3 if they do move on.<br />
[3] Golden Hall is just such an evil trick that it is hard to resist. Can devastate an opponent who had a really good opening hand.<br />
[4] White Mountains = exertions. We like exertions.<br />
[5] Deep of Helm is the Uruk site, what else?<br />
[6] Hornburg Armory is not so great but we don’t want normal Uruks becoming fierce or allies fighting.<br />
[7] King’s Room can also equal exertions. A bit of a risk but this assumes you are coming second and your opponent probably wont expect it.<br />
[8] Wizard’s Vale is better than Dunland.<br />
[9] Palantir Chamber only needs 2 burdens to kick in. That is what Worry is for. Then you play Nertea who plays...<br />
<br />
Props must go to Matthias Szupryczynski in Germany for the basic idea for the deck. Well done and last time I heard your original version (using rares and Easterlings for the minions) of this was still undefeated in German tournament play.<br />
<br />
Your fellowship is designed to run while your minions get a couple of crucial stops on your opponents. These minions can really hurt certain fellowship types. I have played this deck quite a lot and it always gives you a lot of ways to go about resolving various skirmishes. More choices equals more skill and more fun. I really like this deck and hope that you do too. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
