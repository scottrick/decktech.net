Here I will raise my light upon this deck and I hope my light is bright enough for you all to see the things the way I see them :-)<br />
Another fun deck! Why i it fun? Not because the high amount of rare cards. I guess approximately half the deck is rare. I just counted and more then half the deck is rare, so that is not fun, that&#39;s a hole in my budget....The reason why it is a fun deck is the winning potential, and the cards from all series known to man! Anyway stop the crap and return to the deck.<br />
Ever since I saw Aragorn DOTFP, I wanted to make a deck with him. I never really came to it, because I thought it would make a real bad deck. What changed my mind? There are a few things I can mention. First there was Bloodlines with the possibility to reinforce tokens. Then there was this really nice guy who had 3 spare Saved from the Fire&#39;s. Last there was Arwen. I went to a release tournement of Hunters and I drafted her. She also does her thing with tokens and I decided the time had come! <br />
I went thru my cards and saw enough cards that would add tokens. That wasn&#39;t to b a problem. The problem was: how to set up my fellowship? Who was to start the quest? Then I remembered my 4 copies of Saved from the Fire. There is a way to speed up the process! So I decided to start with Gandalf and Glorfindel. Why Glorfindel, isn&#39;t it a shame to sacrifice him? Well, I thought of the worse case scenario, what if I don&#39;t get Saved from the Fire. I could start with a crappy pointy eared dude, but Glofindel is likely to survive a few things.....So thats why Glorfindel. <br />
Strat: get a SftF and burn Glorfindel. Depending on your starting hand get Galadriel, Arwen and Elrohir. Galadriel is there for her ability to make minions -3. Thats also why I put in her ring. Discard the ring and heal 2 companions by putting two shadow cards on top of your deck. The next skirmish fase you exert her, discard the topcard, which happens to be a shadow card and you wil win the skirmish! Next there are a few conditions and a few possesions that work their way with tokens. Strands of Elven Hair required a Dwarf so thats why Gimli makes his appearance. Then it is quite simple. Remove tokens to win skirmishes. Aragorn is supposed to enter the party quite quick so he is to win some of his skirmishes. Galadriel also helps and there are a few events from which Elrohir, Cirdan and in some way Elladan profit....Oh and the real pain would be Cavern Entrance....You can imagine why.<br />
<br />
Shadow is just about Trolls. I just love them. A troll with a scimitar kills almost everything it comes accross.....The best thing is a troll swarm so maybe it is an option to let your opponent start...You decide the sidepaths and maybe you benefit from all the underground sites...I will see what way I will go...<br />
Hope you enjoyed it! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
