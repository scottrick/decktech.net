<br />
Nope.  Not at all.<br />
<br />
This deck is 5-0 in sanctioned play, and around 20-0 in unsanctioned play.  The deck runs well, considering the deck size, partially thanks to the manipulation of Abandoning Reason for Madness and the Shards.<br />
<br />
Not many pumps for the fellowship in the deck, basically because I don’t believe in them.  Pumps are hand wasters in my opinion and just prevent you from achieving your goal – destroying your opponent.<br />
<br />
Combined with Bill the Pony and No Stranger to the Shadows, the low fellowship should give up no more then 7 twilight max a turn.  The only deck that can hope to deal with this is Moria, and thanks to Gondor Bowmen, even Moria Swarm isn’t very effective against it.<br />
<br />
The Shards are in the deck for two reasons:  1 – to get extra Gondor cards out of my hand to cycle the deck faster.  2 – to play Still Sharp.  Probably the best pump in the game because its cost is nothing and it gives a bonus to strength and damage.<br />
<br />
Shadow side is a no brainer.  In order to deal with the Uber Fellowship you have to slow them down.  Uruk-Hai, thanks to Savagery and Saruman have the best chance of doing this.  It also does well against the Horn of Boromir decks that are currently running rampant.  Uruks are big enough and damage enough to rip through most allies, allowing you a swipe at the fellowship, where most decks could not.<br />
<br />
Of course, as with any good Uruk deck, this deck incorporates the Tower Assassin/Uruk Raider combo that works well against any deck that uses allies.  It also incorporates the Uruk Scout/Tol Brandir combo to avoid no minions in hand problem at site 9.<br />
<br />
Oh – the Runners?  This is the one card that belongs in any deck.  Every deck should find room for at least three of these cards.  They are so key to being able to avoid choke decks.<br />
<br />
Always bid 0.  No need to go first – you will probably out pace them if they give you too much twilight in the early goings.  If given the choice, ADD two burdens to prevent Aragorn from being exhausted from Can You Protect Me – unless he is already exhausted.  Keep the Gondor Bowmen until you absolutely need them.  Site 9 is a great place to pop them to add to archery.  A total of 7 archery is possible with this deck, and this will eat through anything they can possibily put down for 9 twilight, which is the max you should give them at site 9.  Always stack one Flaming Brand and one Rangers Sword on Aragorn – never two Flaming Brand, no matter how many Naz you see.  Remember, many decks combine multiple shadow for the best performance they can get – and Flaming Brands suck against anyone but Nazgul.<br />
<br />
When playing your fellowship cards, remember do not play over 2 twilight worth of cards during fellowship.  “Choke”agorn is part of the reason this deck works – use it for all its worth.  If you have more then 2 twilight worth of cards to play during fellowship, place the remainder on the Shards – they never go away.<br />
<br />
If played correctly, even the best deck will be able to do nothing against you, and will slow down in the face of the Uruk rampage. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
