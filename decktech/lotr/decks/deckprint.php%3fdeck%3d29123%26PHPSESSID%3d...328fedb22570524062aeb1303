#1. Moria was definately the most popular <br />
#2. Uruk-hai were not so popular <br />
#3. Nazgul weren&#39;t that terribly popular <br />
And since we have a Standard tourney on Saturday, I cooked up this deck. The Fellowship side is based loosely on my Territorials Fellowship side, just with some modifications that were neccesarry. <br />
Dunland stinks against choke, plain and simple. THey have to have pool to function. Not that much of it, but if you choke them blind, and then hurl archery at them, nothing ever even gets to fight. Dunland ought to be much stronger in Standard, because they can handle straigh Elven archery, using War Clubs to get rid of the Bows, then just slashing up whatever&#39;s left. <br />
The armors are for protection against the Cave Troll, and the new Balrog that will coming out with Ents. He slaughetered me bad at the Territorials (Mike French!) and is also good against Uruks, Foul Hordes, and any other damage+ guy. Legolas is a Moria murderer once he gets his knives and bow. He alone can kill four minions at a shot, easily. Arwen with her horse and Gwemegil is for Nazgul protection. Faramir almost always wins his skirmishes, and Aragorn gets really big. <br />
The 2 Defend Its are for when you can&#39;t use archery special abilities. PATHS and Cliffs are great against Moria, as well as anything else. <br />
Bid medium high, you want to get the Riddermark. I always try to double to 3, and hopefully get my first site controlled by then. The SHadow side is really: Either totally crush your opponent so badly it&#39;s not even funny, so-so, or is terrible. If I&#39;m not well on my way to domination I go for a Fellowship win, which I&#39;m already set up to do. <br />
The key is site control. If you can manage to get a site controlled an No Retreat on it, the game&#39;s over, it&#39;s just a matter of timing. Stack what minions you can on sites, then No REfuge adds 5 pool. I made him double-move, played 2 guys for -2, played Hillman Horde from my discard pile with Constantly THreatening, taking advantage of my extra 5 pool, and then playing 4 more minions. He had 9 companions out, and everyone was fierce, damage +1, and archery was skipped. I kill 8 companions that turn, and only that because he had Defend It and Hope. <br />
The 2 Grima&#39;s are good, trust me. Even when you can&#39;t use their text, which is especially good aganst Dunland so the bows go away, for the 2 pool you&#39;d remove with Hides you can stack 3 archery wounds on them. <br />
Frying Pan is Frodo&#39;s plan of protection vs. Moria and Sauron. With 6 vitality he can take care of anything your opponent throws at him. <br />
Last but certainly not least, Dunlending Warrior takes out any pesky allies.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
