Not Another Archery Deck by Dustin Robinson    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is a deck i made being stupid the other night. Uruk-hai are popular in my area so i decided to make this deck plus it isnt typical moria either.I added the Lurtz for a third big fatty. I could put in the goblin swarms and armories and crap but i dont want this deck to be like that unleast not until im tired of losing with it.<br>

Basically u can use every free poeples card just about every turn so that gets them out of my hand. I usually bid 0 and only single move cuz im not trying to race to site 9.Im still really not happy with the Free peeps i just cant really decide which to play. I also thought about dwarf but I just went for hobbits right now just so i can play those dusty cards in boxes that i have.<br>
<br><br>

Shadow <br>
<br><br>
Heres where u win the game (if that ever really happens). On the first couple of site i dont play much. Usually i just drop Lurtz or somethin get a couple wounds or something maybe even overwhelm someone in a weak company. The fun begins at site 4 where ur first archer is -2 the so on if ur opponent moves from 4 to 5 in the same turn u can usually get the balrog out with some archers which is always fun. At sites 6-9 keep throwin archers and the cave troll to. The wounds will keep pilin up ur opponent usually doesnt exert to kill cuz he still has to face archery which really hurts. Now the icing on the cake is site 8 brown lands. Make sure u get to play ur site 8 or odds r u wont win. If ur able to get ur opponent to move from 6-8 which alotta people do u may have enuf twilight to drop archers like its ur job. A couple goblin archers and a couple moria archer troops alone gives u 10 archery here now isnt that fun. anyhow really if im able to knock off some peeps here or even kill some u may win and u may not but archery is fun none the less and i enjoy it and i hope u do too.<br>
