<br>
* Adventure path planning *<br>
Go second. If you have to go first at least you are sure of having Aragorn. Another advantage is that your opponent might get to two burdens if he uses your PP will help Úlairë Nelya (who becaomes fierce and damage +1).<br>
Single move to sites 2, 3 and 4.<br>
This is to make the opponent to walk over Weathertop (fierce nazgûls) and Ford of Bruinen. Even if you&#39;re unlucky enough not to have a Nazgûl, your opponent might be intimidated by the prospect of moving to Ford of Bruinen and stop at Weathertop.<br>
Moria Lake fits with the general shadow strategy by causing an exertion on Frodo.<br>
<br>
Double move from 4 to 6.<br>
After so many single moves you need to double move and with three site 6 allies in the deck it should be safe.<br>
Note that the site 6, Valley of the Silverlode, is necessary for Gift of Boats.<br>
<br>
Triple move from 6 to 9.<br>
The cards which help here are Gift of Boats (necessary), Pathfinder and A Ranger&#39;s Versatility.<br>
The use of Pathfinder depends on what you&#39;re playing against.<br>
Site 7 - The Great River gives the Moria Swarm a hard time.<br>
Site 8 - Anduin Banks is quite neutral and is choosen mainly because it only gives 6 twilight and the game text helps your shadow side if the opponent gets here first.<br>
Site 9 - Wastes of Emyn Muil helps your shadow side but is a bad choice for most shadow sides so if you still have a Pathfinder it should naturally be used to get out this site.<br>
<br>
* Fellowship *<br>
Aragorn is central. He must be prepared to fight the Balrog and with either Valiant Man of the West or Armor it should normally be smooth sailing.<br>
The focus is on archery. 2-3 regular archery points from Aragorn and Legolas together with the Double Shots and Orophin & Rúmil, in emergencies directed archery via Aragorn&#39;s Bow.<br>
Aragorn can heal any companion (except himself) each turn since they all have the Aragorn signet.<br>
<br>
Gwemegil (and Abandon Reason for Madness) is give the deck a bit of card rotation.<br>
<br>
* Shadow *<br>
The general idea is to exhaust the fellowship by causing wounds with Black Breaths to make healing difficult.<br>
The Servants, Retainers, Twilight Enquëa and Twilight Witch King all cause wounds through exerting. The Trees Are Strong is very useful to squeeze the last drop of blood from your orcs. Don&#39;t waste &quot;The Trees&quot;, use them wisely. :)<br>
Both Nazgûls and Isengard Orcs stop roaming very early and that helps in getting them out because they do cost a fair amount of twilight.<br>
<br>
Relentless Charge and Isengard Warrior help against archery.<br>
Trapped and Alone and Isengard Smith is to help against fellowship weapons.<br>
<br>
A minion with an axe is strength 9 or 10 so they stand a decent chance of winning skirmishes which makes their Regroup actions do some damage.<br>
Saruman lets you assign Isengard minions. This is good to protect your Isengard Smith. It&#39;s likely to force exertions, especially if you can get out a nazgûl too, which isn&#39;t unlikely if the opponent double moves. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
