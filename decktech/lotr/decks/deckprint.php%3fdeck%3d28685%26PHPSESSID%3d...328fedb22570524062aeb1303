#1: Simply kill your opponent. I swear, if you kill the other guy you&#39;ll win every game you ever play. <br />
#2: Corrupt your opponent&#39;s Ringbearer. THis will also ensure you a win. <br />
#3: Get to site 9 first and survive. This, I have discovered, through careful research, has proven to be the surest way of winning every game. <br />
#4: Discard all your opponent&#39;s cards from his draw deck by about site 6, then breeze on to an easy win. THis, sadly, is not such a foolproof way to victory as the previous three, but well worth  trying. However, you might not be able to pull it off if you&#39;re an idiot. A word of advice to any licensed idiots who might be reading this: DON&#39;T TRY THIS DECK!! <br />

He&#39;s corupted!<br />
<br /><br />
Discard you Orc Banner and useless conditions with Orc Warrior. Make sure you you make him (or her) to discard when they move for Tower of Barad-dur! I forget this all the time. <br />
<br /><br />
I wasn&#39;t really sure whether to put this in Fun or Advanced. Let&#39;s settle on a Advanced Fun deck, becasue it requires a lot of rares.<br />
<br /><br />
Pull no punches, continually exert your Elves to discard 2 cards, heal them up with Elrond. Vilya is your defense again any machines decks you might run into, because you can return fully loaded Devilries to their hand, and all those tokens go to waste. Pengedhel is still an archer even though he doesn&#39;t add. Your main focus with Fellowship is just staying alive till site 6, when hopefull your opponent is cardless. You&#39;re pretty safe with skirmishes because he doesn&#39;t have any cards left in his hand. <br />
<br /><br />
Courteous Halfling against this deck would be kinda bad, but the Fellowship discards way more than the Shadow. Besides, it&#39;s likely he won&#39;t even notice til about site 7. (insert evil chuckle) <br />
<br /><br />
So here is exactly how to play it: <br />
<br /><br />
Bid medium, if you don&#39;t win start Legolas instead of Pengedhel. AS soon as you get White Arrows stick it on the archer with the fewest wounds. the fun starts there. <br />
<br /><br />
If your opponent jumps ahead, which he might do in spite of having no cards in his hand because you don&#39;t have very powerful minions, do your best to stay even. Your ultimate goal is to get his deck down to zero and be able to breeze ahead to 9, although corrupting him with Irristable Shadow is a side-ploy, which you should concentrate on if he bounces ahead. I would advocate going first and moving twice to get to site 3, if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll pull a handful of cheap minions and can stop him at 2. <br />
<br /><br />
As i said, it discourages double moves becasue he doesn&#39;t have any cards left. Also, your Shadow side can win regardless of whether or not the Irrisistable Shadow works, you&#39;ve discarded most of his companions, weapons, great conditions, and skirmish events. (watch your opponent carefully. When he starts swearing out of the side of his mouth it&#39;s a sure sign you just discard Aragorn and Gandalf while he has about 5 of their weapons still in his hand. THis is your cue to put a cruel smile on your face) <br />
<br /><br />
Against choke decks, this works wonderfully because you discard all their No Strangers, and maybe even HTTWC. Against super-fellowship it works great because you discard all their companions. Against tanks it works great because you pitch all their tank cards. Against card-flow decks this works great because you pitch all their great skirmish events. Against hobbit decks this works great because you pitch all their Stealths.  Against Rohan this works great because you pitch all their horses. <br />
<br /><br />
In fact, this deck works great against ANY deck, because it will foil any strategy. BWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! (sigh) I wish you guys had webcams so you could see my evil glare, my cruel smile, the $ signs glowing from my pupils. I&#39;ll leave you all in the dust at Worlds! Victory is mine! <br />
<br /><br />
Actually, if that is my plan I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m giving all you my deck list. <br />
<br /><br />
THis is actually a preliminary deck, I&#39;m still tightening it up. If you have any suggestions please d-mail me. And if you want to tell me that I&#39;m a stuck-up idiot, you could to that too. If you do, though, I&#39;ll send you a virus that will destroy your entire hard drive! (just kidding, I&#39;d probably ruin my own computer trying) <br />
