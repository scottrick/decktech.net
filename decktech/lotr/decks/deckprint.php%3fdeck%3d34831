    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ringbearer: Boromir is ultimate ringbearer, burdens are no threat with The Ruling Ring (resistance +2), you can always add The Scroll Of Isildur [9R36] to boost him to resistance 10 or even more. When you need to assign him, prevent wounds using Sapling of White Tree also helps.<br />
<br />
Adventure deck:<br />
Both sides use weaponery, so Helm&#39;s Gate and Moria Stairway are good choices. I often replace those cards (pathfinder, ranger of the westernesse) and play them again. The Window on the West (gondor defender +1) comes in hand to prevent swarm.<br />
<br />
Aragorn: direct wounds with the bow (alas, no play possesion from your draw deck, you have to wait until it comes), wounds using: &quot;each time skirmish event is played, exert aragorn to wound minion he is skirmishing&quot; is also useful. The Saga of Elendil [1R114] helps Aragorn much, but it is 1st serie...<br />
Faramir: if you have better Faramir, play better. I use this one to heal ring-bounds<br />
Denethor: since I always have plenty of gondorians in play, denethor becomes strong. He is not RANGER, so I use Gondorian Sword on him (or Gondorian Blade with the combination of River site).<br />
Anborn: ringbound, i.e. healable with Faramir<br />
Ranger of Westernesse: site-layer, often used as a victim (in combination with Elendil&#39;s Valor as defender +1).<br />
<br />
The Free People have great direct wound ability, using Aragorns bow, Defent It and Hope and further with Aragorn. This should be supported with some sort of healing, you can either use healing versions of Aragorn, Saga of Elendil or some healing events.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
This shadow is almost universal. You have to decide, what tactics will you play, according to the cards you get during play.<br />
Mordor Scimitar and Orc Spear can be used on both trolls and orcs. If you give fierce troll Mordor Scimitar, it gives 6 wounds in one turn (or 4, if the victim is equipt with some sort of armour). This is awsome.<br />
The Orc Spear is also good, it usually helps me to play two weapons instead of one: twilight 1, Orc Spear on 4+ minion, twiligth +2, another weapon :-) how cruel...<br />
Mordor Aggressor is cool. Especially in combination with Orc Spear: you pay 5 for Aggressor and 1 for Spear, but get back 2, so the prize is 4 and you get 16/3 minion and all other minions are +2 :-)<br />
Oh, by the way, you can always use Emyn Muil to make Mordor Aggressor fierce.<br />
Notice, that there are many vitality 3 minions: this helps you survive archery or you can use this to toil for Undisciplined or for Champion Orc.<br />
The corruption can be caused by Troll (reveal event or give burden), Mocking Goblin and mostly by Retribution (win skirmish with weapon to give burden).<br />
Notice, that there are no skirmish events: I concider this rather a drawback, because the opponents (if (s)he knows your deck) does not need to expect some changes in strengths during combat. You can always improve this by for example conquered halls (+1 for each underground), abiding evil (companion -X, where X are burdens) or anything else.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s up to you, if you want to go first or not, you are still able to lay your path according to your wishes. The shadow side very often prevents your oponent from double.<br />

I would like to thank  David &quot;Wyvern&quot; Cauwenbergh for his ultimate guide to gondorian companions. Eventhough I know my companions by heart, I enjoyed his article very much and recommend it to everyone interested in &quot;Valiant Men of the West&quot; :) </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
