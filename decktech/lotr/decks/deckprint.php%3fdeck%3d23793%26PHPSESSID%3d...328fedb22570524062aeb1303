There have been cards that helped a lot to win some games by corruption such as his terrible servants (works well against ARV and archery abilities) Nelya (it gives more cahnces to be played at 2nd site) Threshold of shadow (after site 5 it can be really usefull) and in the ringwraith&#39;s wake. That was maybe the card that helped me most because it gets witch king even more powerful and mean.<br />
<br><br />
I got a very useful win at site 9 ( you know Witch king and his son go fierce) against a deck that i ve never thoght that i could win. I killed his defender+3 aragorn and put a couple of Burdens (14). After that i got some easiest corruptions at site 6 or 7...<br />
<br><br />
If you want explanations about the card selection d-mail me or check out the old version (1000+1 ways to corrupt frodo).<br />
<br><br />
Here are some tips about the changes:<br />
<br><br />
Free peoples<br />
<br><br />
- 4 Aragorns help against hobbit deck or "trap" decks(believe me its crucial...) In addition you got westfarthing if you wanna go first and let you opponent play without aragorn againts your first attacks. But i advise you to let your opponent go first. The first two sites are the most important because they dint let the other double at the early game.<br />
<br />
-The Mirror of Galandriel Great card which i have never use before...@$#$%^$%...unfortunately.it helps to get your fellowship phases even more easier.<br />
-Ok,ok,ok,ok,ok,ok... you were right about the Lorien elf its free and can save you at the bridge but i prefer to have Aragorn sword earlier.<br />
-Finally remember its an elf deck which i dont wanna pump with a lot of companions.<br />
Shadow <br />
-In the ring wraith&#39;s wake: use it its time your nasgul wins, there&#39;s no special strategy with it.THis card can really win games.<br />
-ok attea wasn&#39;t so much helpful so i get out one of them but he still can get out an exchausted Elrond ( sorry Lisa...)<br />
-Wraith world is better in this deck than the other one. Keep them for the late game where you can have more twilight and win the game.<br />
To finish these strategy tips i would like to add that there&#39;s no problem about the amount of cards. Discard one per turn use elrond&#39;s ability with attention to some assasins and dont worry if your deck doesn&#39;t get finished.<br />
Thank you all about the reviews and your comments.<br />
