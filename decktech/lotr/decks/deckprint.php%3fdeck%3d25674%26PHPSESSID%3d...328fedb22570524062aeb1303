Built to set-up and move quickly, the fellowship cycles cards and gets problem cards out of your hand before shadow phase rolls around, increasing the effectiveness of each swarm.  <br />
<br />
The fellowship is designed to use Shards to make sure you ALWAYS have the right cards at the right time (well, specifically, stacking Pathfinder and ARV is a great combo, as is stacking extra copies to heal, and your extra armor, etc.).  I run 5 companions, but against Uruk-hai, Gimli should die off as soon as Gandalf and Aragorn are out.  Otherwise Gimli sucks up wounds, plays good conditions and reduces twilight in 1 or 2 sites.  <br />
<br />
I use 2 of most of the weapons because you set up that much faster and you can stack the extras except Glamdring.  As for my conditions, Greatest Kingdom is absolutely brutal to Moria and Sauron, the two deck types I am weakest against, so hopefully decking them by site 6 or 7 should make up for this disadvantage.  Song of Durin is about the best Moria protection possible, only it is so limited in it&#39;s use.  Betrayal is the best of the three, it hurts the cycling of Moria while providing great Uruk-hai protection.  Saruman would obviously be the bane of this deck with all of the direct archery and lack of allies (this is a choice I made in order to use the confluence as site 7).<br />
<br />
A couple other cards choices:<br />
1 Flaming Brand: Nazgul is not that big here right now, and this deck ruins Nazgul anyways, I felt it more important to focus more on Moria, because Moria is a true problem to small fellowships.<br />
1 Sleep Caradhras: That said, you may wonder why only one sleep... I don&#39;t like that it clogs your hand when it is not worth using.  After all an exertion and 3 twilight IS pretty steep.  Plus you may not want to lose your own conditions which in some cases are doing more damage than theirs.<br />
Power According: Another great Moria killer, is another card that can really clog your hand, especially when you just get one against Uruk-hai.  If you don&#39;t agree, replace the stealths.<br />
<br />
The Shadow is built with the natural swarm mechanics but with the ability to stop a fellowship.  I don&#39;t have 3 or 4 Cave Trolls, but 2 works well enough for me right now.  Flankers on swarms have great stopping power, especially with Moria Axes flowing through the graveyard.  Keywards are a great cost effective minion, and with a Moria Axe are just great.  Scrabblers and Warriors are to avoid archery, thrarin and the rarely used Greatest Kingdom.  I only use 2 scouts because I see quite a few Men only fellowships, and scouts are just not worth 2 twilight.  Free is a different story.  2 is good enough for me though.  Nertea would be nice, but most fellowships don&#39;t get over 4 people lately.<br />
<br />
The Troll&#39;s Hammer is in here because I am stubborn about having it in there.  I love an 18 str Dmg + 2 Fierce Minion out there... the Chain is because a 20 str Dmg + 2 Fierce Minion is even better and more because archery could be a major problem (another reason to use big minions like Keyward and Flanker).<br />
<br />
Other choices:<br />
Unfamiliar Territory: + 4 str against archers... nice.  More because it&#39;s fun to play when Frodo gets assigned to a 10 str Scavenger and dies because he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d need help. Also sometimes Frodo or Legolas has no choice but to fight, and that&#39;s when your Scout or Scavenger suprises the hell out of them.<br />
Moria Axe: Required with Big Moria minions<br />
Guard Commander: I don&#39;t tend to leave as much twilight, because most of my guys are much bigger... also, he&#39;s the first guy to die in archery, or assigned to the most powerful guy, he usually uses up most of the twilight just to keep alive and that means easy double move against you.<br />
Possible Additions:  I know they kinda suck, but Goblin Patrol Troop would be pretty impressive w/ a Moria Axe.  Another Cave Troll for a Keyward would be ideal.  Another Moria Axe would be the last thing.  They are great w/ big Moria minions.<br />
