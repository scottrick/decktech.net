Some might argue that it is, in fact, unhealthy. I choose not to judge. Not to say &quot;Honey, might you better slather a tiny bit of the affection you show for Orcs on me?&quot;. <br />
Some might argue that helping her build a fellowship to compliment the shadow she prefers only helps the problem. But, who are they to judge, right?<br />
<br />
Right?<br />
<br />
Hello?<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
<br />
Alright, so lets get this out of the way right away. This deck MIGHT be good enough to play in a tournament with the intention of winning IF, and only IF you opponents do not play Frodo, COurteous Halfling. If they do, just stop thinking about it. If they don&#39;t, you can continue.<br />
<br />
The thing thats funny about the deck is that it has fun playing against just about everything. We&#39;ve been building Discard for Noelle for months, and this is possibly the best Shadow build for it we&#39;ve put together. The Morgul Hunters get stops a lot, especially early, and the Uruks and Inquisitors give it the ability to swarm late game, given the right draws. It also, as you might expect, discards like a MOFO. <br />
<br />
The problem has always been how to build a fellowship that can not only contribute to the discard but also be able to run enough to capitalize on your opponent having no deck. You see, the easy thing to do against discard is get ahead and then single move, knowing that your deck opponent will not deck you before you stop them a few times. As most discard fellowships are relatively weak, even though they chew through opponents decks, they rarely are able to double move BEFORE the decking. <br />
<br />
This fellowship solves the problem by providing a fellowship that denies pool AND wins fights. Gimli is a solid fighter, and between the 5 pumpers and Merry he should clean the clocks of several minions per game, allowing an easy play of the 3 Nobody Tosses a Dwarfs, but, more importantly, allowing the fellowship to keep pace with your opponent. It is usually not important to PASS the opponent until the site 6 sanctuary, but you have to know whether or not you can stop them. <br />
<br />
Anywho, enough history, here&#39;s how the deck runs.<br />
<br />
Bid 4.<br />
<br />
You want to go first, but obviously thats not always going to happen. If you win, pull Legolas and play whatever you&#39;ve got and go. You want to try and use White Arrows as much as possible but obviously don&#39;t exhaust Legolas if you need him to block. Win fights you can and move if you can, it&#39;s simple. If you LOSE the bid it&#39;s not all bad. In fact, against Nazgul it&#39;s often better to not have him, as he adds pool you don&#39;t need. Against Moria just single move and pray. Honestly though, how many Moria decks do you know that bid to go first?<br />
<br />
Some cards -<br />
<br />
Greatest Kingdom - this card early game spells doom for ANY orcs, much less Moria. As most Moria sides these days run nothing in the form of condition removal, Black Traitor having fallen by the wayside, the damage that can be done by this card alone is astounding. <br />
<br />
Axe Strike/Flurry - Gimli winning his fights is essential, and these cards make it, and consequently Nobody Tosses a Dwarf, happen. While you obviously aren&#39;t going to win EVERY fight, Nazgul should bow down.<br />
<br />
Elrond / Ring - typical Dauntless, and provides some healing to use with White Arrows. Condition Removal is good, I hear.<br />
<br />
Dwarven Axe over Gimli&#39;s Axe - well, the card off the top helps to discard, but primarily the 2 pool for Gimli&#39;s Axe is just too much in this deck for too little effect. <br />
<br />
The shadow side is wierd. Noelle would say that you have to have &quot;the gift&quot; for picking the right cards with the Random discard elements, that way you&#39;re taking their in-hand skirmish cards, which allows some of your bigger minions to win fights and consequently stay on the table. If they DO stay on the table, His Cruelty and Malice can quickly deplete a deck, besides looking wicked nice as a Foil, and even wickeder as a German Foil. The shadow isn&#39;t going to get many shadow kills against competent opponents, but it CAN be scary for direct damage decks to see all that vitality for so little pool late game.<br />
<br />
Some cards -<br />
<br />
Desperate Measures - yes, it&#39;s a gamble. If they don&#39;t have a burden, sorry. dead cards. thats why there&#39;s only 2. If they DO have the burdens this is a monster card and can actually cripple decks in one swoop. <br />
<br />
His Cruelty - mass discarding or no discarding. It&#39;s a cool card and it gets out of your hand.<br />
<br />
Tower of Barad-Dur - really nice in that it is unstoppable discard, and makes getting those skirmish cards all the easier with Inquisitors and Hand of Sauron.<br />
<br />
Uruk Soldier - hey, a discard is a discard right? and this one is also unpreventable (except by our evil hobbit enemy)<br />
<br />
Only one Grishnakh/Patrol - well, it&#39;s not really a deck that plans to swarm, or even hit hard, but Grishnakh can add burdens for Desperate Measures and the Patrol can kill Fortress Never Fallen and A Talent or any other problem causing condition.<br />
<br />
Well, thats about the best strategy I can give for this deck. It&#39;s a lot of fun to play with, as you get to kill minions before they even get to the table. If you DO bring this to a tournament, definitely expect opponents to run some discard hate next time, either in the form of Frodo, CH, or worse Old Noakes.<br />
<br />
Thats all for now, and in the words of Noelle:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh!!!!! Burning Cheese Juice!&quot;<br />
