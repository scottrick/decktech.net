Edit 1:<br />
Apparently some people don&#39;t have the ability to guess at some sites here so I shall appologize and give you the sites here:<br />
<br />
[1] The Inn (See Strategy: Bid 5 or 6 and pull sam if you win... hint...)<br />
[2] Bree Streets (You do play Nazgul after all...)<br />
[3] Ford of Bruinen (Guess...)<br />
[4] Eregion Hills (I don&#39;t want to say no-brainer, but I think it goes without saying)<br />
[5] The Bridge<br />
[6] Caras Galadhorn (Moria Protection)<br />
[7] Anduin Wilderland (I don&#39;t have archery, why should you)<br />
[8] Gates of Argonath (I don&#39;t like hate and can you protect me so this protects against that, I only use 2 maneuver events anyways)<br />
[9] Tol Brandir (I wonder why?)<br />
<br />
To sum up, thanks to 2 people for giving a three because they couldn&#39;t figure this out.  The only site that was a toss up was 8... I usually won&#39;t be able to get 5 orcs out at the shores... Anduin Banks is nice against a superfellowship but my deck is not about packing on wounds... The Gates just seems the best fit... not to mention it gives better twilight than the banks.<br />
<br />
Another note:  Alot of people don&#39;t believe this works, but I am guessing they aren&#39;t trying it out.  Why are you worried about a Band of the Eye losing skirmishes?  Does Aragorn pull Ranger Sword and Last Alliance out of the reserve deck when played?<br />
<br />
I recently went 4-1 in a tournament with this deck, with my only loss coming against an uruk-hai deck that pumped a Uruk Captain to 20 w/ 3 Savageries, a Bred and an Ambition at site 3 to beat Gandalf w/ Glamdring and no trust.  What can you do in that case?  Nothing...<br />
<br />
In casual play this deck is 7-0.  I am pretty sure at this point that the shadow is reliable...<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Bid 5 or 6, and pull sam if you win... if you didn&#39;t they are probably pulling Sam as well, and they will be in bad shape against your shadow side if you pull a couple of nazgul off the bat.  Fellowship is pretty resilient... Just make sure Boromir wins his skirmishes, Aragorn doesn&#39;t die early, and Gandalf does not get wounded too badly.  Heal Gandalf w/ his extra copies and with Elrond.  <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Uruks... once trust is out, you won&#39;t lose skirmishes, Savagery is worthless and you can Bring in Elrond to beat Troops, Lieutenants and Assassins, any questions?  note: Give the brand to Boromir when he gets his blade, that way you don&#39;t have to pump to beat str 9 uruks (the bulk of most of them)<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Nazgul... once trust is out, you should win most skirmishes.  Give the brand to aragorn obviously to beat str 12 nazgul, and one pump wins over the Witch King.  Try to keep minions off Gandalf if Black Breath is out!  Elrond should take on Canteas.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Condition Sauron...  Who cares about your trust?  If conditions are hurting you, sleep them, you will be fighting mostly trackers anyways...  You always have 3 more Trusts to play...  Going into site 9 you should have a fully healed Aragorn... if you do it&#39;s game over. Don&#39;t let Gandalf get hated off!<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Burden decks... you have plenty of burden removal with Narya and Sam... If you have reason to fear an enduring evil... horn in someone... make them hold that enduring evil for a while, at the very least it will clog them, or they will just chuck it.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Moria...  Once again, sleep away bad conditions.  Don&#39;t pump unneccessarily to beat a Troll, you can&#39;t kill it, so what&#39;s the point.  If you are in trouble, just blow the horn, and help is on it&#39;s way.  Good luck to them in overwhelming Frodo...<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs. Discard... remove burdens fast and avoid desperate defense assignments... yet another use for the horn.  If you suspect a discard variant of a sauron burden deck (i.e. Desperate Defenses with Towers) take Burdens rather than discard unless you plan on moving again...  Burdens are easy to remove so don&#39;t concern yourself too much.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The Shadow is designed not for corruption but for easy overwhelms.  Your task is to get 5 or more burdens on the ring bearer and then use those nasty Nazgul to kick some ace...  Enduring Evil will win you plenty of games via the best minion in this deck... Orc Assassin... this guy is probably my favourite minion in the game...  This shadow works well with the fellowship, because the fellowship will double move 3 times a game to win unless they a) start first (meaning they will have more burdens to exploit) or b) they skip a sanctuary or triple move at some point.  Either way, your minions win skirmishes and stick around, so they should slow them down enough for you to win with the Free Peoples side.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Thin and Stretched is the only condition I use due to the amount of condition removal there is out there these days... Expect it to be slept, or sentinalled... it&#39;s too hard to pass up though... practically a sure burden per turn.  With this on them, they might be tempted to assign Frodo to one of the Assassins... and then bye bye...<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Hold Enduring Evil for the Perfect time, and hold Enquea if you can likewise.  <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs. Trust Decks... Enduring Evil is not going to make a big difference while Gandalf is around, so make him exert to save someone&#39;s bacon, and then next turn take him out w/ an Enquea... not as easy as it sounds, but Trust decks will bid high and thus getting to 5 burdens will not be so hard.  Hit this deck fast because once it is set up you are going to have trouble, 2 Too Great and Terribles should do the trick especially if played together... worst shadow match-up.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Mirror/Shoulder/White Arrows... F*ck the mirror... Tower Assassins won&#39;t be enough, but I don&#39;t care.  Most people around here stopped playing it anyways, because it&#39;s a boring deck.  The minions you ARE able to play will take one or two companions down with them each time as they won&#39;t have room for weapons for all their 6 strength companions.  Adding burdens will be a lot tougher...  Fellowship will probably have to win the game... Know that they will try and triple from 6 to 9 and play accordingly... maybe save every minion until site 9 for an overwhelm.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Archery... lots and lots of vitality... your minions will get through, and when they do, they will tear those weaklings apart... save enduring evils for especially Aragorn and Arwen.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Dwarves... improvise, Orc Pillagers will absolutely murder dwarves... If you fear dwarf decks in your area switch the 2 band of the eyes for 2 more Pillagers, and when they are whining because gimli is now only 4 strength with his Battle Axe, Hand axe, Bracer, Helm, and 2 Endurance of Dwarves just put on your best &quot;I care, I really do&quot; face and laugh!<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Vs.  Choke... Thin and Stretched will eat away until Enquea can come in and cheese out a companion.  Orc Assassins are important because they are cheap and maybe win skirmishes if they play a 2 hobbit variant (i.e. Sam w/ Pony and Talent).  Once again, this is where your fellowship should win the game.  Choke won&#39;t hurt your fellowship because besides your companions and Trust, you don&#39;t actually NEED any cards... the rest is just icing sugar. Also, Orc Pillagers will once again tear them apart.  Most choke Aragorns will have 4 cards attached (No Stranger, Ranger Sword, Brand, Armor and possibly some Athelas) so a seamingly 11 strength Aragorn is actually only 9 strength, loses his skirmish and with 4 burdens on is overwhelmed with 1 enduring evil.<br />
