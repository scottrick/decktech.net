Those of you that are familiar with this deck, already know how to play this deck, but just for those that might be new, I will do the best I can.  But first, I do know that a lot of people are yelling errata the mirror, because of decks like this, and some decks like this, might have been posted here, I am not sure, I didn&#39;t check.  However, a few weeks back this deck was sent to me, and I did a lot of moving things around, and after playing it for awhile, I believe this is the best way to play it(IMO)....so here it is.<br />
<br />
First thing make sure you go first, doesn&#39;t matter what you bid, since Frodo will never battle anyone anyway.  Unless you are SURE that your opponent is playing Prancing Pony, then bid low, or still high, whatever, they can go first.  This deck sets up very early, you may not think so, by looking at the cards on paper, but it does everytime.  There is always ways to get cards down, and/or discard to cycle through this deck very fast, and get what you need when you need it.  <br />
<br />
Play the Mirror, and Galadriel together, the thing here to do is to have Far Seeing eyes out, so when you play an elf, they discard a card, then exert Galadriel twice for two more cards, then Exert Celeborn twice to heal Galadriel, and do it again for to more cards, and if you have more elves to play, they may not even have cards in there hand...who knows...either way, you will be discarded cards, that you know will hinder your game, whether it be free peoples cards or Shadow, so many times, I would move on to the next site, and they have nothing to play..its great.  Now some others things to know...<br />
<br />
Get Elrond out to use him to his fullest...Get a Dwarf ally out...use Shoulder to Shoulder in your maneuver phase to heal Galadriel, and Celeborn only one wound.  If for some reason you can only do one of them whatever.  Next turn use Start of turn action from Elrond to heal all allies from his site, and use Galadriel to heal all allies from her site.  Then start the whole discarding thing again.  Put the White arrows on Arwen, and every Archery phase use that to discard two cards as well.  Then use Aragorn&#39;s start of turn action to heal Arwen.  Any opponent who plays with 70 or less cards will run out of a deck by site 7 everytime...trust me.  If for some change reason you opponent does get a minion down, fear not, you have archers galore and anything that comes down will die a horrible death, or just sac a Lorien elf or even a ally(Thrarin) or something...nothing to worry with so many choices.<br />
Try to find Pathfinder before site 7, because you will want your site 7 out for sure....however if they deck is getting low, then you will probably kill their fellowship at site 8 anyway, but it is in there just in case. You might want to play with the Rare ring, which may come in handy, but really I never faced a major battle, because I always had control of my opponents hand.  Frodo doesn&#39;t need any special cards for him, because he never battles, there is always someone else to battle if for some off the wall reason it comes to that.<br />
<br />
As for the Shadow portion, I thought Sauron was good, and Moria, I went with Moria Swarm, because it gets cards out of my hand faster, so I find what I need early game, and all is well. I hope everyone knows how to play Swarm, so I won&#39;t go into to much detail.  You have the Troll, and weapons, and all that good stuff, so with that alone you could win a game, even without all your fancy stuff.  <br />
<br />
Well there it is...enjoy and have fun<br />
