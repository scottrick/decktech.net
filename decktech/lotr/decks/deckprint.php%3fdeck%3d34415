Bid 0, and go 2nd if you get the chance.  If you don&#39;t have atleast 2 fellowship setup cards (ie not events) mulligan usually.  Don&#39;t play any underground sites until you get a Goblin Hordes out.  Halls of my home is the most important card in this deck by far, so try to cycle fairly fast until you get 1.  As you need it at site 3 to make this deck work.  The more fellowship events you have to use at site 3 the better, but try and get a reasonable setup by just walking there.  Every game will be different, but you want to use Denethor 4x using House of Healing.  And mixing in with your fellowship events, in the best way possible to try and encourage them to draw lots of cards, and have the least amount of them being shadow cards.  You need to use Halls of my home as your last or 2nd last event, to make sure their top card is a nice expensive shadow card, so your Orcish Workers can do their magic next go.  You mainly use denethor to get companions out, especially if you have some Drawing his Eye in hand.  And maybe well travelled to make gondor defender plus 1 if vs a swarmer.<br />
<br />
The deck also corrupts fairly well, if the mega twilight doesn&#39;t crush them.  Exchanging the corrupt strat for the underground swarmers would also work fairly well, but I find if the setup fails, you pretty much have no chance, so I like the corruption option.  <br />
<br />
Thats it in a nutshell, takes practice to work out what to use when.  Even if you set them up, they could use a lot of cards to spoil their top card, by shuffling deck with a wizard is never late , simbelmynes, other drawing cards etc.  But when it works its great fun.<br />
<br />
Enjoy. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
