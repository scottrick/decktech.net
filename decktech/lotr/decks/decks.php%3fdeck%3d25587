<br>
What is the idea of this game? To get the ring to site 9. <br>
<br>
What do most decks do? Build a huge empire of companions and an army of elf allies. But too often they forget poor Frodo. This deck doesn&#39;t. While I make no promises for Legolas, Gimli or Gandalf if you play this deck Frodo should make it to site 9 more often than not.<br>
<br>
Last weekend at the local tournament this deck was undefeated beating the State Champion, State runner up, National Championships no 3 player and National Championships no 4 player. Not bad. Even better at the end of every game you get to say to your opponent &quot;You were just beaten by the 80 cent fellowship.&quot; (To which they usually reply, &quot;No, I was beaten by the $200 minions&quot;. More on that later.)<br>
<br>
Oh, what is the 80 cent fellowship? That is the cost of my starting fellowship at our local store. Frodo, The One Ring and Merry are 10 cents each and Boromir is 50. See this deck is so cheap anyone could afford it. Ok, I admit that is not true but if you are on a budget you could look at version 1 to see this deck when it only had 4 rares. http://www.decktech.net/lotr/decks/decks.php?deck=21518<br>
<br>
Basic Strategy<br>
Bid low. Props to Obi Wan (Wai Bien Wong - formerly no 13 Star Wars player in the world) for this. I normally bid 0. WHAT? ARE YOU INSANE? THAT&#39;S IT, THIS DECK GETS ONE STAR! Hang on, there are some reasons. What is the no 1 deck now? Uruk-hai. Probably 75% of the decks you will play are Uruk-Hai. Move second and you deny them Hollin and get a pretty much free move to site 4. What is the no 2 deck? Nazgul! What do they need to work? Burdens and sites 2, 3 and 4. By bidding 0 you probably deny them both. Even if they make you go first you can get Aragorn from the pony and not activate Nelya&#39;s gametext. Nothing sweeter than bidding 0 and going first anyway. Against a burden deck they are already thinking they have lost the game.<br>
<br>
I try to stay just behind my opponent until near the end unless they are also playing Orcs. I really want to avoid their sites and let my sites bring on the pain especially 7 and 8 which can be game winning. The aim is overwhelm them wherever you can with your minions or at least to get them to stop at 8 and then double to 9 for the win. Against Orcs you have to change this and pass them. This is easier than it looks.<br>
<br>
Sites<br>
Some are very obvious but others will need a little comment.<br>
[1] The Prancing Pony. Get Aragorn.<br>
[2] Trollshaw Forest. Are Moria really going to do anything serious before site 3 ever? So this is the most useless site I can think of except that if I am playing against Nazgul or some crazy minion drop that makes me stop, next turn I will draw bulk cards. There are 19 possessions in this deck!<br>
[3] Frodo&#39;s Bedroom. Who else will be playing Hobbits? Doesn&#39;t help me much but helps everyone else even less.<br>
[4] Mithril Mine. If you have at least one armory out then all your scimitars come back for free. Gets the Moria Engine going quickly. <br>
[5] The Bridge of Khazad-dum. I just like the picture.<br>
[6] Dimrill Dale. I am playing Moria you know. This makes it actually possible to create a swarm at site 6, the only possibility. Not a forest or river. Money!<br>
[7] Anduin Confluence. YOU MORON. YOU HAVE 4 ALLIES. ONE STAR! My allies are disposable. I know this is coming so I sacrifice Tharin to save a wound, use Bounder to keep a There and Back Again or protect someone from something dangerous. The only loss is Filbert but this WRECKS some decks. It also has some sneaky advantages. What it the no 1 condition removal now? Secret Sentinals. Hard to play your Sentinals with no allies. Probably the no 2 is Albert Dreary with all the Trust Me decks going around. Bilbo is also used. So this protects your crucial condtions. Better it makes it MUCH easier to overwhelm Frodo with no Bounder. Bye Tharin. Bye Barliman. Goodbye Rumil, I always hated you. Bori has a horn but no Elrond, so sad. Galadriel, Gaffer etc. Have I convinced you yet?<br>
[8] Shores of Nen Hithoel. Wins games. Makes them stop at site 8. You double to 9 and win. Game! 9 twylight is not bad.<br>
[9] Summit of Amon Hen. Cards = minions = win. Sad if they have no burdens but what else is there?<br>
<br>
Starting<br>
Frodo, Son of Drogo. Weapons free, There and Back Again free, Mithril Coat -1. Can mean one less minion or at least a smaller one.<br>
<br>
The One Ring, The Ruling Ring. Harder to burden. Those double burdens really add up and my hobbits do a lot of fighting.<br>
<br>
Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine. My no 2 fighter. Seriously. He does the second most fighting behind Aragorn. Very hard to kill. Has more lives than a cat. Fighting an Uruk-Hai. They play Savagery to overwhelm. I exert Borimir. They play two more. I exert Bounder. They play three more (yes I know this is impossible, I am just making a point). I play stealth. Fierce STR 29 Uruk. I exert twice, spot Filbert and cancel the skirmish.<br>
<br>
Boromir, Son of Denethor. He has got to be one of the most under rated companions in the game. Keep him unwounded until site 9 and you have an automatic win. He protects Frodo, Merry or Sam. Better than any ally or condition as they can&#39;t get rid of him with Tower Assasin, Saruman&#39;s Power or anything. You have to be clever with him. I always get him to fight the smallest minion so that he can use his exertion where it is really needed. I NEVER let him take a wound unless I have no choice. He makes this entire deck work. He is the PATHS, Stealth or whatever you need to keep Frodo alive. He is the man. Once he is tanked with blade, brand and armor he is very hard to budge. While he is healthy you can even let Frodo do some fighting, especially with his mithril coat. Just be careful against Uruks if you have 5 companions - which I almost never do!<br>
<br>
Free Peoples (38)<br>
Aragon, HttWC x2 He is the man. Against everyone except Moria that -2 each turn can be huge and with this many possessions you can produce a lot of twylight. Usually = one less Uruk-Hai and that is crucial. <br>
<br>
Gandalf, FotS x2 Will be at least STR 8 but he is no there to fight. He is there for Sleep, more on that later. He also has a lot of wounds useful against Moria archery or Uruks.<br>
<br>
Legolas, PoM He is my anti-Cantea tech. I have thought a lot about Greenleaf and Son of Thranduil but there is nothing crucial for them to do. Against Nazgul only Gandalf and Legolas can really afford to fight Cantea. Against Moria with Moria Scouts I just ditch him.<br>
<br>
Gimli, DotM-r. Pays for himself as long as you get him before site 6. Highly disposable but if something goes horribly wrong he is better than nothing.<br>
<br>
Sam, SoH. If the burden decks are not already throwing out their burden cards whey will when he hits the table. This deck has enough Hobbit cards that he can actually make it to site 9 and force your opponent to have to kill two ringbearers.<br>
<br>
Bounder x2. With Borimir and Bounder how can they overwhelm Frodo? Can&#39;t be done. Watch out of Tower Assassans, they eat Bounders for breakfast.<br>
<br>
Filbert Bolger. With three Hobbits you get to cancel a lot of skirmishes. Balrog with whip and sword. No probs. Stealth one skirmish and cancel the fierce one. If you have spare wounds it is an auto-win at site 9. They can put down as many fierce Nazgul and Uruks as they like, just survive the first turn sacrificing Borimir and everyone else and cancel the fierce.<br>
<br>
Thrarin. Like Pippen but doesn&#39;t cost 1 to move with you. Dies to the first really big minion you meet. Don&#39;t try to keep him too long or a Tower Assassan or Goblin Warrior will finish him.<br>
<br>
Blade of Gondor x2. A great weapon. Damage +1 is great. I really don&#39;t like exerting Borimir but it can protect him from a Moria overwhelm or kill a stupidly strong Uruk or Sauron Orc. Use with great care. 90% of the time it is just good to have so that with a Brand Borimir is STR 10 and the Uruk player will have to burn a pump to not die. Against Nazgul you could use 2 brands instead.<br>
<br>
Ranger&#39;s Sword x2. Aragorn is my main fighter and this makes him very tough. <br>
<br>
Sting. Know thy enemy. If you know they have no pumps the assignment phase is much easier. Huge twylight removal against Sauron, Isengard and Moria. Oh, it also keeps Frodo alive.<br>
<br>
Hobbit Sword x3. Merry is my no 2 fighter. This makes him as good as anyone except Aragorn for cost 2. Also goes on Frodo if no Sting and on Sam. In a pinch you can even give it to Filbert or Bounder if HttWC is going to remove the twylight anyway.<br>
<br>
Frying Pan. This is one of the best cards to come out of RotEL and I kid you not. Against any orc it is devastating. Moria can&#39;t overwhelm. Sauron can play their Swordsman with a Vile Blade - bonk, bonk, bonk. Move on. Isengard aren&#39;t exhausting anyone or pinching any weapons. Even better Merry uses it one turn then passes it to Sam to use the next.<br>
<br>
Flaming Brand x4. I really hate Nazgul. With this they really hate me. HOW COME YOU ALWAYS GET A BRAND OUT SO EARLY? Well the secret is out. Cost 0. Means Borimir is STR 10 and Uruks have to pump to beat him. Makes Aragorn impossible to overwhelm. Can put two on him against Nazgul for some STR 14 damage +2 fun. <br>
<br>
Armor x4. Have I said 75% of decks are Uruk-Hai at the moment? What is their no 1 advantage. Ok, besides all being fierce. Ok, besides all having lost of wounds. Ok, besides murdering you if you play five companions. Ok, besides being able to kill all of your conditions. Ok, besides the Troop ignoring your weapons and being one of the best minions in the game. What was my point? Oh yeah. Their no 1 advantage is damage +1. Take that away and they are only unbelievably strong. It also wrecks the Cave Troll, Balrog and many Nazgul. Makes double moving much easier if you know you can afford to lose a couple of fights. At worst they Beyond the Heights of Men you. Well your Armor cost 1 which HttWC possibly removed. BtHoM cost at least an exertion and probably 1 or 2 twylight and you have 3 more Armor. Can drop the extras on They are Coming if needed.<br>
<br>
Mithril Coat. The no damage bonus is reason enough to use it. But wait there is more, you ignore weapon strength bonuses making it much harder for Moria or Sauron to overwhelm. But wait, if you call now we will throw in -1 to the archery total. Forget Moria Archery, even if you meet Lurtz and the Anduin Banks it is worth it.<br>
<br>
Thror&#39;s Map. WHAT A PILE OF CRAP! Wrong. I have tons of Hobbits to exert and in every game there is one site you really want to avoid. Pathfinder is tempting but this goes down early so that you can avoid a problem site much later. Crucial sites to avoid are Ford of Bruinen, Hollin, Brown Lands, Slopes of Amon Hem and Tol Brandir. Save it for a rainy day. Don&#39;t forget Filbert can provide one of the exertions.<br>
<br>
O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! Makes Frodo +1 for cost 0. Good enough right there. Lets you take on the biggest Nazgul, protects you from Return to Its Master or provides and auto win at site 9 if they play a Nazgul.<br>
<br>
There and Back Again x2. Plays for free and can be kept until things are looking ugly. Then when your opponent drops a massive minion load you make all the Hobbits +2 and no-one needs to die.<br>
<br>
Sleep, Caradhras x2. The only condition removal. The only fellowship card you need to hang on to. If you are against Uruks you can probably drop the first one. Against Moria it is vital. With Sauron and Nazgul it depends what deck type they are playing.<br>
<br>
Hobbit Stealth x2. Great to keep you alive early before you set up and through the Bridge. Later +2 can still prevent an overwhelm.<br>
<br>
Hobbit Intuition. Worse than Stealth at site 5, as good or better everywhere else.<br>
<br>
Shadow (40)<br>
The Balrog, Flame of Udun. Big and tough. Very cost effective. If they don&#39;t have armor they will be sorry.<br>
<br>
Cave Troll of Moria x3. The best stopper Moria have. Very hard to beat and very dangerous. You generate a lot of twylight and need something to spend it on. At times I have played with 4 Trolls but I have found that they are hard to play early on until the machine is operating and 3 is better.<br>
<br>
Cave Troll&#39;s Chain x3. This is the special trick to limit archery decks. Any time Aragorn or Legolas are exhausted they will have to skip the archery phase. Gondor bowmen will be suicide. Also STR 17, damage +1 and fierce is a wicked combo. Can&#39;t be shot. Can&#39;t be killed. Can&#39;t move on. I hold my chains until I have a Troll. This is the one shadow card I hold onto.<br>
<br>
Ulaire Enquea. Not very original but the best way to keep the fellowship from getting too big. Also punishes high numbers of burdens. I always have at least one but sometimes I play with two if I suspect big fellowships.<br>
<br>
Goblin Flankers x3. Awesome minions. For cost 2 on a second move you have a STR 11 minion who is very hard to kill. You put them out and they stay out. Get a couple of these babies on swarms and see how keen your opponent is to double move. I would love to play 4 but I don&#39;t want a 100 card deck.<br>
<br>
Goblin Runner x4. Part one of the engine. Add one twylight and then get to double up on someone. Once they get onto the Swarms your opponent is in real trouble.<br>
<br>
Goblin Scavengers x4. Part two of the engine. Play him, scavenge a scimitar, (often on another minion like a Flanker or even a Runner.) draw a card and add up to 4 twylight.<br>
<br>
Troll&#39;s Keyward x2. Makes the Troll cheaper and the three health is great. They also can soak up archery, ignore PATHS, make Frying pans not worth using and live even when they lose a skirmish.<br>
<br>
Moria Scout. Spot an Elf and they are free. 2 wounds to soak up an arrow when the chain isn&#39;t around. I used to play 4, they are really good.<br>
<br>
Goblin Scrabbler. Very powerful against certain decks. Kill an Elf condition every shadow phase. This turn it is the Last Alliance, next the Splendor, the one after a Gift of Boats or even the Tale of Gil-Galad.<br>
<br>
Goblin Warrior. Kills Tharin. Hurts Dwarf decks a lot. Protects against Greatest Kingdom discarding your entire deck.<br>
<br>
Goblin Scimitar x4. Part three of the engine. Draw a card, make a minion +2 and add up to 4 twylight. Too good to believe.<br>
<br>
Goblin Armory x4. Part four of the engine. Makes the scimitars twylight factories. The other function is also game winning. They play PATHS to save Frodo from a Scavenger. Ditch one of these and he is still overwhelmed. Don&#39;t waste them but used at the right time they can be devastating.<br>
<br>
Goblin Swarms x2. Get the right minions on this and the game gets much easier. On a first move which minions to stack here and which to leave out is a crucial decision. Always stack runners, mostly stack scavengers, others vary.<br>
<br>
They are Coming x3. Claimed by some to be the best card in the game. Finish every shadow phase with nothing you don&#39;t want for your next Fellowship turn. Cycle your deck like crazy and never suffer from hand clog. Did I mention it also lets you play a minion from the discard pile? Not a bad extra benefit.<br>
<br>
Host of Thousands x2. I often play 4 of these. Whatever minion you want at the time you want. Can be annoying if you draw them too early before you have any useful minions in your discard pile.<br>
<br>
Unfamiliar Territory. I ALWAYS put at least one pump card into the deck. At times I have played up to 4 of them. Surprise is often the key to killing companions.<br>
<br>
Matchups<br>
Twylight choke: Moria laughs at all their wasted cards and kills them all.<br>
<br>
Undirected Archery: The Troll shakes his chain and they run and hide.<br>
<br>
Directed Archery: Ouch. Lose all allies at 7 helps. Get wounds on the archers so they can&#39;t exert. One or two thrown armories at the crucial time leaves Legolas fighting someone he can&#39;t beat.<br>
<br>
Trust Me: With the new ruling they can only exert once for each copy so you can still overwhelm. If they have more than one copy out then you have to stack onto Gandalf to give him wounds to try and exhaust him. <br>
<br>
Old Skool Gandalf: Hard matchup, but Servants in effect only add 1.5 to the companions STR vs an overwhelm. Just keep at them, eventually they will have a turn without it.<br>
<br>
Hobbits: This is their worst nightmare. Do they really want to fight 6-8 minions AND a Cave Troll.<br>
They will need a lot of pump cards.<br>
<br>
Dwarves: Actually hard. They like my sites and tend to get very big. They can even deal with the Troll. Their one weakness tends to be while they are untouchable Frodo is not. So your aim is to set up for a big overwhelm. <br>
<br>
Discard: I have 80 cards. Use They are Coming sensibly.<br>
<br>
Nazgul: With 4 Flaming Brands, stealths, Filbert, Sleep, Legolas the Cantea lover and a bid of 0 you should live. If they don&#39;t get you early they wont at all. Just remember to stop at site 2 if your opponent makes you go first.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai: 4 Armor, stealths, Filbert, high STR Borimir and Aragorn and keeping to 4 companions should see you through. NEVER give them enough twylight that they can get down Saruman and 5 Uruks!<br>
<br>
Sauron: Sleep deals with the conditions. Merry laughs at Vile Blades and the frying pan can smack around the Swordsmen. Gandalf fights Pillagers.<br>
<br>
Moria: The entire basic strategy ensures they cannot take out your main men with Moria. Lego, Gimli and Gandalf are fair game though.<br>
<br>
Isengard: Will hurt. Keep the twylight low. Keep your sleeps for Trapped and Alone and let your weapons do your talking. Save the Frying pan for Smiths.<br>
<br>
Burden: I bid 0 and have Sam. Good luck.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
The aim of this deck is to follow just behind your opponent unless he is playing orcs too. Take every opportunity to go for the kill with your minions. Throw out cards with crazy abandon to They are Coming. You can often overwhelm them when you least expect to. If not then you must run past him at site 8 and go for the win.<br>
<br>
This deck beat the current no 1 rated deck on decktech in a sanctioned tournament on Sunday. It has won several local tournaments. It did place at an open. Worlds? Who knows. Apparently they are going to be won by Uruk Shamen anyway.<br>
<br>
If you have any great suggestions please feel free to let me know. So many people have contributed to this deck already and I am always happy to hear ideas, just don&#39;t say something stupid like &quot;Get 4 Stealths, -17 stars&quot;.
