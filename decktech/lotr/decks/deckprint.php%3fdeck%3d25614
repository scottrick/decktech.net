<br>
You may have noticed that there aren&#39;t as many companions in this deck as in normal decks. The reasoning behind this is simple, but what happens is complex.<br>
<br>
First off, the Free Peoples give twilight to the Shadow to use. Without this twilight, the shadow side would be almost nonexistant. What precisly gives twilight away? A number of things. Most obviously, the site does. So, we lessen the site number. What next? Playing cards. So, we lessen the cost of cards with Gandalf&#39;s wisdom, or simply don&#39;t play many. Last but not least(especialy in super fellowship decks), the companions themselves add one for just being there. So, we reduce the number of companions in the fellowship. This lack of twilight will piss off your opponent.<br>
<br>
But what else does it do? Lets get into everybody&#39;s favorite subject: math. The idea is to bid to go second; whether that is high or low depends on who you play. Congradulations, we assume you are going second. Lets keep things average and assume that your opponent is getting as many Free cards as Shadow every time he draws. His first hand contained 4 Free and 4 Shadow. Lets assume his Free side has good throughput. He plays all 4 cards and moves on. You counter with some people, he stays, and resirculates. Card count: 2 Free 6 Shadow. You get No Strager in your hand and move up to site 2 for 2 twilight. Lets assume he has one low cost condition. You stay at every site, unless you&#39;re sick of the number of Free cards in your hand at later sites only. Opponents card count: 2 Free 6 Shadow. He moves to site 3 playing every card, you counter, he stays. Card Count: 1 Free 7 Shadow. Again you move for so cheap he playas nothing. He discards. Card count: 2 Free 6 Shadow. Total cards played before a possible Cavetroll: 6-9 at random. Before Balrog? 7-10 on average. Try this: separate your free and shadow, play starting companions including ones you pull(aragorn). Shuffle your Free half and draw 10 cards. Out of those 10, Discard all bows(Fill with Fear). Now, with those cards left, fight the Cavetroll and the Balrog back to back. How well did you do? Looks grim doesn&#39;t it. You problbly lost companions and are now facing a big swarm deck that converts card multiples and other no longer usefull cards into minions. And there is another Cavetroll coming. Have fun.<br>
<br>
Card Choices:<br>
Balrogs Sword- They won&#39;t have an armor, and if they do, its in place of a pump card and they will be overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
TAC- Garbage disposal after site 5<br>
<br>
Relentless- Hate Hobbit Stealths<br>
<br>
Enquea- Large fellowships, fun<br>
<br>
Thats about it, Feedback is appreaciated (I am prone to sudden and violent Attacks of the Stupids)<br>
