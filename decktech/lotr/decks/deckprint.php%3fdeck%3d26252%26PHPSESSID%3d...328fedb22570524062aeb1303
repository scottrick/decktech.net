<br />
The strategy behind this deck is simple... to gain twilight, card and site advantage throughout the game and wear down your opponent.  Legolas controls the twilight pool and assures that if they are leaving twilight in the pool to cancel your skirmish abilities, then you are at least clogging their hand.  I think this Legolas is much better than Greenleaf in this deck, as some might disagree on.  Making savageries cost too much to play is WAY too good.<br />
<br />
Bid 1, go second if you win, otherwise most likely go second anyways.<br />
If you go first, start all Hobbits, if you go second start Legolas and the Unbound hobbits.<br />
Treebeard is not a necessity, so losing Fanghorn won&#39;t kill you, if you have to go first at least you get Aragorn, AND first crack at site control.<br />
<br />
You have 10 companions, but that&#39;s no problem, because Pippin and Merry rarely die, just be sure not to go play one of them if you have played all your companions.  Elrond and Gandalf draw you cards to set up the Uruk swarm with the help of Galadriel and her ring.<br />
<br />
The Uruks stack for later use or play for cheaper with sites controlled, and you have the ability to control 4 or 5 sites in one turn, just remember to take advantage of your savageries at the right times.<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
I use the common Hobbits for versatility.  Legolas controls the twilight well enough, that cancelling my ability is usually not an issue.<br />
Aragorn, Ranger of the North:  4 minions, all useless... easy win if fully healed at site 9.  Especially w/ Filibert out<br />
Faramir, Son of Denethor:  You control when he dies.<br />
Gandalf, Grey Pilgrim: drawing cards more important to me than the recycling of the new Gandalf... that&#39;s what extra copies of the Hobbits are for.<br />
Sam, Proper Poet: Defender +1 Stealths, and Dying like a true champ<br />
Haldir: Just in case their site control is screwing up yours...<br />
Boromir, Son of Denethor: Allows me to use Frodo as my main fighter, when stealth events not around.  Make sure you have used Sting first.  Many times you can draw a savagery out of your opponent to try to kill Frodo, thus removing twilight and allowing you to discard Pippin and Merry.<br />
Sentinals:  To get rid of Pillage of Rohan... and other equally annoying conditions, like No Retreat/Refuge.<br />
Sting, O Elbereth, Mithril Coat: Frodo is my main fighter, these things keep him alive and ticking, all game long.  I use the new ring because of the ability to add an extra strength if I need it, making Frodo 8 str.<br />
<br />
Saruman, Keeper of Isengard:  Because I can see quite a few people using the site 5 that pulls him, and it&#39;s not like he shouldn&#39;t be here.  I chose only one because the focus is on swarming, that said, he&#39;s always a welcome draw.<br />
Enquea:  Because he&#39;s even better now w/ bigger fellowships getting built, i.e. Gondor Rangers...<br />
Uruk Assault Band:  Compliments the little guys well, especially when he&#39;s str 20, Fierce and doesn&#39;t take wounds...  The best part is that he&#39;s huge AND non-unique!<br />
Uruk Regular: Makes Assault Bands/Hordes very cheap.<br />
Besieger/Trooper/Veteran:  All stack on sites, which is the best strategy in this set... nothing like not having to worry about a hand full of crap is great.  The best though is your opponents superfellowship gives you practically unlimited twilight and you drop 8 or 9 minions without drawing a single card.<br />
Marauder:  Although he doesn&#39;t stack, he plays for free or almost free in most circumstances.  At 8 strength, he is very respectable.<br />
Pillage of Rohan:  This card is far too good to leave out although it can clog your hand if you draw into it early.<br />
Savagery:  I don&#39;t care if you are using Trackers, Small Uruks, Big Uruks or even Archers, but you can&#39;t build a good Uruk-hai deck without Savagery.<br />
<br />
Sites:<br />
1.  Most helpful site 1<br />
2.  Automatic, the only reason to go second.<br />
3.  I only use 1 and I know to save it...<br />
4.  Hurts Rohan decks, of which there may be many<br />
5.  Most helpful, ensures a swarm if I get the cards (I should)<br />
6.  doesn&#39;t really help, but doesn&#39;t hurt<br />
7.  +2 Archery, because even though I have mostly unbounds, I don&#39;t give a hoot about archery.  If I have over 3 unbounds, I most likely have Merry, Pippin or Both, so I&#39;ll load the archery on them, and then discard them, thus making those wounds useless.  Much better than exerting every companion.<br />
8.  Not playing Dunland<br />
9.  I don&#39;t really have twilight problems at this time, I should be able to get out at least a couple of guys stacked for minimal twilight, and play a couple of Marauders for close to free, so the best thing for me is to make them all fierce and get the job done.<br />
<br />
Note:  I realize that going second is a disadvantage against another site control deck, but especially Dunland won&#39;t be taking sites very early, due to skirmish cancellation, and the Uruk-hai site control backbone is two conditions, both of which will be quite pricey at first w/ Legolas sitting there w/ his Hobbit buddies.  The hope is, that by going second and denying them these things, you not only control sites, but control YOUR sites which are battlegrounds thus making Mr. Assault Band, pretty big.<br />
