The reference in the description is (in case you can&#39;t tell) to the fact that I only play 6 of the nine Nazgul, but "The Six have left Minas Morgul" just sounded -and I think you&#39;ll agree with me here- gay.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Bid low when you play this deck, as you have no way of removing burdons and it&#39;s not that important if you go first or second. If you go first, you get your site and the first move, and if you go second they have to deal with your sites. I usually bid 0 or 1, and choose to go first if I win. If I get Thror&#39;s Map or Nelya early, they still have to deal with my sites, and moving first is a definate advantage. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
With 5 ways of getting out Gandalf and a relatively small deck, you should get him first or second turn, and he&#39;ll be power 9 or 10 as soon as he hits the table. Give him Glamdring and a spell or 2 and he&#39;ll mow through anything. The Servants are a must, and the Gimli booster cards are incredibly useful. Armor is one of my favorite cards and is good against most every deck. I play no conditions, because I want to utilize Sleep to its fullest (without getting rid of my own). <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
The shadow is pretty simple. Big fierce Nazgul with a moderate amount of booster cards. Relentless charge is quickly becoming my favorite Nazgul card, and All Blades Perish is one of the most underrated cards in the game. You should have seen the look on my friend&#39;s face when he placed my exhausted Witch King against Frodo, played PATHS and I blocked it with All Blades. It&#39;s also key against Ranger&#39;s Versatility. Not only will it force your opponent to exert more times, but it just might save your Nazgul. If you have 2 Nazgul and your opponent has Legolas and Aragorn w/ bow, plays Versatility then tells you to take 2 archery, it&#39;s now too late for arcery actions. If you block both with All Blades Perish, he still has 2 nasty nazgul to deal with. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
I hope you like this deck as much as I do. It&#39;s done exceptionally well in playtesting, and is undefeated in tournament play (with 4 games under its belt).<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br><br />

PS I know this isn&#39;t really the right place to put it, but I have been trying my hardest to trade for or buy a Cave Troll foil or Gandalf, FotSF foil. If you have one for trade, please Dmail me your list of wants. <br />
