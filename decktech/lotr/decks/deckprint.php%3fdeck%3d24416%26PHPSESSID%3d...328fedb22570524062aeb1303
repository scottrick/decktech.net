This is the large version at 34/34; For &quot;serious&quot; play, I&#39;d probably drop a card or two on each side based on anticipated opposition. Anyway, it&#39;s my first go at a post-errata Rotel deck. Here&#39;s the basic premise:<br />
<br />
Free Peoples:<br />
With no Versatility, and no Map, choke decks&#39; stock is going way up. With Uruks still dominant and Nazgul moving up in the ranks, twilight denial has to be a consideration for almost any non-Mirror deck. The main consideration for a Mirror deck is, of course, the selection of a formidable sidearm to discourage any episodes of physical violence directed at the Mirror or the actual person of the Mirror-player. At any rate, I decided to try to revise the relatively Old School ranger choke decks, and this is the result. <br />
<br />
Early-Game (1-3):<br />
You&#39;re bidding zero. The Nazgul are now finally in a position to consistently stop the 1-3 double-move, so you can either make up the one-site difference by going to three on the first turn, or make them face the Ford in hopes of passing them later. Going second also gives you more time to locate Aragorn/Boromir before the first move. <br />
<br />
Mid-Game (4-6):<br />
Against Uruks, this is the time for Sam to go. If you&#39;ve seen Savagery with Sting, try to shoot them down to two Uruks, and put both on Sam. If your opponent plays the Savagery, Stealth the skirmish, and let Sam die in the fierce skirmish. If not, just let Sam die and Savagery will be reduced to a +2 for the rest of the game. <br />
<br />
Moria shouldn&#39;t be doing much with every Event in the deck hurting it quite a bit. Horn Elrond in to have fun with Scavengers or fight the Troll/Balrog if you don&#39;t have Armor out. Should be easy to go 4-6 as long as nothing has gone horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
Nazgul are a pain, but the choke hurts them. If you did well in the early game, you should be okay. You can always Horn twice to make Elrond a 14, and smack down the 12-strength guys. Hope for the Last Alliance/Brand combo on Aragorn :) <br />
<br />
Late Game (7-9):<br />
Hopefully a No Strangers or two will have shown by now. Fellowship should be down to four. Confluence kind of sucks, so hold the spare Elrond if that&#39;s a possiblity. Use the Horn. Shoot down minions. Heal with Elrond. Repeat.<br />
<br />
Other:<br />
Sauron usually shouldn&#39;t be much of a problem unless they manage to get rid of both Sentinels and kill off Elrond or Boromir. Isengard Orcs are rather twilight-hungry, and should lose skirmishes routinely. Might want to keep Sam around agiainst these two cultures just to soak up wounds or take the Ring in an emergency.<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
Pretty basic Nazgul stuff here. I&#39;m a fan of using a wide vareity of Events just to keep people on their toes. Playing one Charge or All Blades is enough to make your opponent think twice about exerting during Archery. Everything should be pretty self-explanitory. <br />
 <br />
Adventure Path:<br />
Really the only tough calls were six and seven. Valley of the Silverlode could be nice with Proper Poet, but I&#39;m still a little scared of Versatility; The Great River might come back to haunt me with the one Nertea in the deck, but I think it&#39;s worth the risk with the only other options being Silverlode, which does nothing, or the Wilderland which gives Moria an edge.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading. Hope you didn&#39;t read it all.<br />
