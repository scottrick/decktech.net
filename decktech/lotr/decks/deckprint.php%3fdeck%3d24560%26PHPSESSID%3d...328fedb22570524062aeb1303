Its generally a good idea to bid high these days so you should bid at least 6 to go first, you can go to 7 and still have 4 burdens on frodo after you have pulled sam with the green dragon. Usually I don&#8217;t play any big guys (aragorn/gandalf) till after the first sanctuary cause Lego/Arwen should be able to get you there in 1 piece. If you run afoul of Nazguls or something that hurts you with 4 burdens, stop at 2 and hopefully move on your site 3, house of elrond to remove a burden and provided you haven&#8217;t taken to much of a battering you can move through from 2-4 and replace killed characters with the tanks like Aragorn and Gandalf. Other than site 3, all my sites help the minions so you have a better chance of hurting and stopping the opponents fellowship.<br />
<br />
FELLOWSHIP:<br />
this is a big fellowship deck based around making Aragorn and Gandlf tanks so they can bust through anything and not lose a skirmish. I play very few events, because as a rule, events suck. Now that ARV is castrated, the list of worthwhile events grows thin. I think it is much better to have permanent possessions that provide benefit all through the game.  I play the new Aragorn to remove from the pool when I have played some weapons or more companions, but I think King in Exile would also work if you don&#8217;t have a lot of Heir to the White Citys. With Ranger sword, Brand, last Alliance and the new condition, Gift of the Evenstar, Aragorn never loses skirmishes. GOTE, for those that don&#8217;t know, acts much like Gwemigel, it allows Aragorn to exert or discard 2 cards to get -1 strength to a minion he skirmishes. Saga and Aragorns Bow help deal with big minions like Lurtz, or the Cave Troll. PathS is good in combo with aimed archery to direct damage big nasty minions.<br />
<br />
Gandalf is now so good with Wizard Staff and his ring Narya. Ppl say Gandlf&#8217;s Staff is better then Wiz staff, but exerting twice to kill a minion is better than exerting twice just to cancel a skirmish and then you have to fight the minion again if you want to move on. Combined with Glamdring and Merry, Gandalf can then help other companions win their fight like Aragorn, Arwen and Frodo. The extra vitality from Narya, lets him use the staff twice per Skirmish phase. I like to play 1 AWINL, because against moria and Uruks you need to find Albert Dreay quick to wreck their conditions.<br />
<br />
Orophin can kill an Uruk and then suicide at site 6. He also counts for Last Alliance. Oh and he can take Horsie through the mines and then give him back to Arwen if the need should arise. Gimli and Boromir are replacement companions depending on the situation. Boromir is nice going into 9,because he blocks a minion and gives +6 strength to Frodo b4 he dies. Gimli is cool going into site 4. You play him, Aragorn Removes those 2 and then Gimli takes another 2 from site 4 and 5. Also tech against Dwarrowdelf Chamber which a lot of Isengard Orc Decks use (and the reason I play Moria Lake).<br />
The Great thing about playing a lot of possessions and conditions is that it allows for great through put, so you can get to all the stuff you need. This combines well with Isengard Orcs, who are cheap, themselves and also allow you to get the support card that the orcs need to do the most damage<br />
<br />
<br />
SHADOW:<br />
Isengard orcs are so good. When you first look at then you think &#8216;how fÙcked up, they will never survive to the regroup phase&#8217;. But they do, and with the help of some support cards can do a lot of harm to a fellowship, big or small.<br />
Is. orcs come out early and are cheap so you can get a fair few down without great difficulty, which means more make it through to the regroup phase where they do so much hurt to the opponent. Retainers, Workers, Servants and Orc Commanders all exert to wound in the regroup and should survive there with at least 1 spare vitality. If they don&#8217;t then Coming For the Ring should heal at least a couple of orcs and that equates to 2 more wounds at least. <br />
<br />
The Isengard Warrior protects your guys from aimed archery and the warrior should often absorb the undirected unless you can spot 3 wounds on the ring bearer, in which case he can exert every companion.<br />
Saruman, SotE is key to ensuring that most of the orcs survive to the regroup phase unfettered. He can exert to assign a weaker orc to a skirmish that it can win. If the opponent wants to exert that companion to prevent the assignment that he has prolly done the work for you by adding more wounds and exhausting more companions.<br />
The Isengard Smith is so good for discarding all the possessions that would give damage bonuses to your orcs. In the regroup he exerts to discard a possession or all possessions if you spot 5 companions. (sic) So you can easily make the opponent lose his Ranger swords, Glamdrings, Stings etc. <br />
<br />
Enquea is just such a rapist in this deck. The opponet will frequently balloon out to 6 guys in order to have more companions to spread around the exertions. Then Enquea can easily kill 1 or more companions already exhausted. In combination with Can you protect me from yourself? You will often see 5 burdens anyway. <br />
CYPMFY? Is just wrong. Exhaust Aragorn or Add 2 burdens. They will only exhaust Aragorn as a last resort for obvious reasons so the burdens will quickly pile up and the exert to wound aspect will also see Frodo slipping on the ring to absorb the odd wound. No business of ours is important to stop the mirror for at least a while, and more importantly stop Sting and Glamdring milking the pool dry cause of  all the orcs that you will have in your hand. The Trees are strong is the money shot. After all your Orcs have exerted themselves to death you can play TTAS to discard them all and do another wound for each. That&#8217;s an easy 3-5 wounds that is gonna hurt an already exhausted fellowship. TTAS is when you start killing companions.<br />
<br />
In this crippled state the opponent will be forced to move slowly and stop at the sanctuary site 6 to heal. Then you can burn ahead and win the race. If they are ahead of you by site 7 try and amass 5 orcs in your hand to stop them at the shores of Nen Hithoel. If they do make it to 9 your Orcs can still win it for you. The Wastes of Emyn Muil has a built in Hate, in the manuver phase you can exert to wound a companions. Seeing as there is no Regroup phase after site 9, you have to kill as many companions as possible so that you can overwhelme frodo. A nice idea is if Saruman is still hanging around exert him to assign the weak orcs like the workers to the opponents strongest guys so the retainers and Commanders will be left over to be assigned to Frodo. But be wary of  PathS.<br />
<br />
MAIN STRATEGY:<br />
This Deck can win with both minions and fellowship, but I strongly advise to try to win with the fellowship. Once your guys are well armed you will win most of your skirmishes and as such will take few wounds. Then you can move on a win the race. The minions can be very hurtful to the fellowship, but you cannot expect miracles. They will most likely just force the opponent to rethink a double move here and there, so your fellowship can profit. <br />
<br />
At the moment Uruk-hai are the biggest threat to your fellowship. Always keep to 4 companions so they start tossing their savageries. Gandalf and Aragorn will be able to beat most Uruks with the exception of Lurtz and Troops. Direct Damages from Legolas, Aragorns Bow and PathS should be used to keep Lurtz from wrecking to much. Wizard Staff, Last Alliance, Gift of the EvenStar are all immune to Troops so you can still beat them even without your weapons Gandalf is easily 10 Strength with Wiz Staff so the opponent will need to toss a savagery to beat him. Albert Dreary is important to keep Sarumans Ambiton off the table. Thrarin can sacrifice himself if lurtz survives to fight and Armor+Saga on Aragorn will keep the damage very low. But you must keep to 4 companions.<br />
<br />
Vs Moria swarms Sting+Sleep+Dreary+Aimed Archery+lotsa companions pretty much keeps you safe from what they have. Thrarin+Armor should keep the Cave Troll under control. The only real threat is being stopped at the Shores by 5 orcs. Since Swarms are very impotent against this deck you should be able to move througth site6 to keep a head. failing that, at least your own orcs have a chance at stopping him at the shores too.<br />
Nazguls are still popular and a deck to watch out for. Naz are the main reason I still use Arwen DoE and not Elvin Rider who is pretty good herself. Arwen with Gwemigel+Horsie can beat most Naz, as can Aragorn with the Flaming Brand+ Last Alliance. Now that Nazguls greatest foe, ARV is errata, they may see even more play. It might be good to add another brand if they are big in your area.<br />
<br />
But Naz are still weak once your have establish your fellowship particularly at the last sites, so as long as you weather the storm from 2-5 you should have no problems. Just keep Gandalf from getting Blade Tipped so he can sleep, Carhadras any annoying Breaths and stuff. Sauron is still weaker than the other races nowadays, so Sting+Heir to the white city should keep em good and choked, so you only have to deal with a couple minions at a time. Sleep wrecks their direct damage conditions in a single turn.<br />
I&#8217;ve yet to play against an Isengard orc deck so its hard to give advice about how to play against them. Help in this area would be nice.<br />
<br />
Oh and I&#8217;ve yet to play this deck in multiplayer<br />
<br />
Any thoughts or questions plz d-mail me b4 you review. There is nothing worse than a review in the form of a question. No stupid questions like &#8220;why do you use Wizard Staff instead of Gandalf&#8217;s staff&#8221; &#8211;2 stars or some shìt.<br />
