I&#39;ve been long searching with Carny to improve the strenght Of his What Are They deck.<br />
<br />
Tho It was Realy strong , it had no way to cope with regular swarm or with Sauron.This deck , using elves and alot of spare companions to enable dual moving has.Furthermore I&#39;ve looked for it to have alot of cycling in this deck so I could reach my combo&#39;s asap<br />
<br />
Cycle cards :<br />
Gondorian Sword<br />
Gondorian Merchant<br />
Gwemigil<br />
Ships Of Great Draught<br />
Easterling Footmen<br />
<br />
Ive tried it at the TOC and realy didn&#39;t have any problems with this deck except for stoopid swarm ,<br />
but I just refuse to anti-tech a deck that is sooo<br />
ANTI-LOTR = strategy and FUN.<br />
<br />
To my great anoyance after goin a sweet 3-0 i was paired 2 tims in a row against it , and no less against the 2nd and 4th of Belgium ( argh).<br />
First game i had bad draws , second game i got so frustrated i was loosing grip of my game and lost aswell.<br />
Finaly meeting an easy matchup ( the 3rd of Belgium) Nazgul.There i was soo tierd , i killed my own companions and hit a stroke of non stop faults in a row.Even my opponent addmitted ( He&#39;s a very nice guy Vincent)that normaly i shouldv beaten him.<br />
<br />
The Shadow Only works if you have good cycling , cse for the same monney u don&#39;t draw your small hopes and get without burdens.Therefore the footmens are great to cycle and add the necc. burdens against DH decks and such.<br />
Drop him together with a skirmisher first turn and ur burdens are all set up :]<br />
<br />
Why DOE?<br />
Sure I tested FEM and It went pretty well , but Niek And Luke , 2 friends of mine brought under my attention that DOE is more safer cse you can use ur What Are they&#39;s way better and faster since she&#39;s a Ranger to start.<br />
<br />
Ships Of Great Draught is a bomb cards cse you can re-use the cards you realy need to accomplish a stop.<br />
<br />
8 companions realy help you to fool your opponent in thinking he won the game and start moving more carefull.U can like lose all your elves and then at site 7 drop a new fellowship with gondor bowments and just walk in to 9. (Thnx Mike French for inspiring me).<br />
<br />
Well I hope you like it and I&#39;d like to see some good reviews on how to improve this deck.<br />
