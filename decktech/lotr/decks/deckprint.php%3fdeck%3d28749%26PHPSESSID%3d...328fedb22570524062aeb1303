    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The Shadow side it pretty simple. If he has Aragorn use Can You Protect Me, and either exhaust Aragorn or add 2 burdens, if you can get him up to 5 burdens, use the Orthanc Berserker. If Aragorn has a Saga on him you can kill him with Grima, Wormtongue. Either way, exhausted companions means more pool with Tower of Orthanc. <br />
You can even have a kind of &#39;Uruk bomb&#39; at site 5 with all you cost-3 strength-9 minions. And if you get Saruman with his staff out, you can do some serious damage. <br />
Saruman is pretty cool. Use his abilities to assign minions to his weak guys like Legolas, then use Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry to finish him off. Then you can start to concentrate on his bigger companions. <br />
Also, with all your cheap guys you can often get the guy with Palantir chamber, if he has a decent number of burdens. <br />
With the Fellowship, it&#39;s slated for Standard, becasue i&#39;m thinking about taking this deck to Territorials on saturday. YOur suggestions, please! <br />
Arwen is there to be a strength 13 against Nazgul, 15 if at a plains. Defiance is another good card. Aragorn is strength 13 as well once you get the Last Alliance on Him. Faramir and his bow help agaisnst archery, and can steadily take on minions without fear because of his text. Elrond heals guys, takes care of machines and Orc Bowmen with Vilya. Rumil and Orophin protect against swarms. Secret Sentinals discards all those awful conditions, and Legolas can pick of Moria guys, as well as Aragorn. Bill the Pony gives you 1 less pool a turn. Boromir, My Brother gives Faramir an extra exertion to take out Dunlendings, and the +4 bonus from Swordarm can let Aragorn pick off the biggest minions easily. And Legolas is basically a strength 12 with his Long-knives, and can wound access minions. <br />
Please remember, I&#39;m still tightening this up, so I really appreciate any suggestions for anything to add, to cut, or whatever. <br />
