I must give credit, however, to a young man I played at an I-10 Cup (AZ thing) last summer for the idea on the Shadow side.  The beating I received from his Shadow deck inspired me to make a similar one of my own.<br />
<br />
This deck is definitely for fun.  What really makes it fun for me is the Shadow hand.  Watching your opponent squirm as his big companion is nullified and burdens just keep piling on, I just love the Gollum minion deck!  I have been able to win with it, but it will probably lose more than it wins.  I suppose it could be classified as an Advanced deck due to the high number of rares (and multiple copies of them), but you may see later why it&#39;s just for fun.  The Shadow deck is highly effective if it develops fast enough, otherwise you&#39;ll struggle just to do damage to companions with your Nazgul/Shelob/Gollum minions.<br />
<br />
Free Peoples -<br />
<br />
The basic strategy: RUN!  The Duality&#39;s should hopefully help minimize the amount of minions you&#39;ll face, however they&#39;ll probably be bigger ones (who in their right - or left - mind would want to ditch a 14 str minion for a 6?)  Plus the narrow escapes can assist with the double-moves (if you dare).  Pippin and A Light will help with burden removal along with the Hope is Kindled if you can get your hobbit to win.  The Don&#39;t Look at Them helps to get rid of some big nasties (e.g. Shelob, Trolls).  I only had one copy of Don&#39;t which is why it&#39;s in there.  Ideally, you&#39;d probably ditch your G&#39;s for three more copies of that or perhaps Unharmed (to help heal hobbits).  Admitedly, this fellowship is somewhat weak, but it can be effective.<br />
<br />
Shadow -<br />
<br />
This is where things either make or break.  There are some pretty involved combos, but one in particular is quite handy (as you&#39;ll see).  There are two places you can focus your efforts: burdens or ring-bearer wounds.  You probably won&#39;t win too many skirmishes with your minions, so killing companions is out!  The first basic combo is to fetch Gollum, DAD to exert the R-B.  Once he is wounded, you then play a Treacherous Little Toad on him.  This keeps him from healing while you spot a Gollum card (not difficult while you have a Web in play).  It&#39;s also effective with any pesky large companion (e.g. Durin III, Eomer 3rd Marshall).  If you can get these two cards early enough, you can inflict major damage quickly.  I have won this way before.  One thing that will help beef up Gollum are the Slippery as Fishes, which need rivers, mountains and underground.  That&#39;s why it may seem as if there are sites that don&#39;t make sense.<br />
<br />
The next big combo is more involved.  Get out a Sense of Obligation, usually on a big companion (you could play additional copies on smaller companions; they may skirmish and die just to avoid the burden).  Next, you play Gollum (DAD is ideal for the exertion).  Lastly, play Her Ladyship and prevent the companion with Sense from skirmishing.  Plus, Shelob is fierce, so you add 2 burdens per skirmish!  I was toasted by site 5 with Gimli ring-bearer.  The effectiveness of this increases most when your opponent is using the Shadows Ring (Ring of Rings).  Once you exhaust the ring-bearer, he HAS to take burdens, so you exert Gollum twice during the regroup to wound him.  Plus the two that Shelob or any Nazgul add each skirmish...  well, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
I have struggled with ways to make this more competitive, and haven&#39;t been too succesful.  Perhaps is my lack of good Smeagol cards or just bad deck-building, but I am most open to suggestions on how to "beef" up my fellowship and even my Shadow.  Any ideas, d-mail me!     </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
