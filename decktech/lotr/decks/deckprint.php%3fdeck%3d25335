<br>
Well, the basic premise of this deck is to get your Aragorn out ASAP and get all your companions loaded up with their conditions. Bid low, around 2-3. If you know you&#39;re facing either Uruks or Moria, bid 4. Aragorn is probably the most important to reinforce, with Boromir coming in second. Boromir should probably get the Saga, since he can pump both Frodo and Merry. With multiple copies of the most important possessions, it shouldn&#39;t be hard to pull off getting at least 2 in your opening hand to fend off that annoying Such A Little Thing, which really screws you over. Should a companion (or two, or three) die, Legolas and Arwen should take their place. Never deploy more than 4 companions against Uruks!!! Savagery will destroy you. Against most decks, this is a monster.<br>
<br>
Vs. Uruk-Hai<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai are nasty, but manageable. Try to beat them when you can, but get your armors out quickly to soak up the damage. Mithril Coat + Sting usually means a fightin&#39; Frodo. Don&#39;t be too ambitious, as moving twice at the wrong time can spell disaster.<br>
<br>
Vs. Moria<br>
<br>
Get Raragorn out. Don&#39;t settle for Heir, wait for ROTN. He&#39;s absolutely vital to surviving. Get Legolas and Arwen out ASAP after site 5, as well. After site 5, it really doesn&#39;t matter if their scouts play for free as they have lots of twilight to begin with. Filibert Bolger is tech here against the Balrog and Cave Troll. Don&#39;t worry too much about double moving against nothing, because Moria can usually empty their hand whether you give them 5 or 20 twilight.(Stupid Armories...) Fear Such A Little Thing.<br>
<br>
Vs. Isenorcs<br>
<br>
Shouldn&#39;t be too hard. Most of them should die to your Aragorn and Boromir. Biggest threat here is Overseers; hence the Dagger Strikes. The only Isenorc deck I played barely phased my fellowship. Beware, however, of 5 companions due to Smiths discarding all your possessions (ouch).<br>
<br>
Vs. Nazgul<br>
<br>
Probably the toughest match-up. You need to get your Flaming Brands out. Fast. Your super-Aragorn should be able to fend off almost any Nazgul except the Witch King with his Sword/Brand. Also, don&#39;t be afraid to give Boromir double brands, if you can&#39;t quite find Aragorn. You can always transfer later. With Filibert out and your brands, the Nazgul shouldn&#39;t be able to win many skirmishes, but be on guard nonetheless. Blade Tip should be removed from most with Athelas, but from Aragorn it should be Black Breath, due to the multiple copies to heal with in the deck.<br>
<br>
Vs. Sauron<br>
<br>
(Snicker) Well, don&#39;t bid too high. If you&#39;re positive you&#39;re playing a fighting Sauron deck, bid 0 and try to stay there. Enduring Evil is a nasty card, but without burdens is ineffective. Get Frodo&#39;s possessions on him fast so that Thin and Stretched doesn&#39;t affect you. Desperate Defense may start to wear thin, but there are plenty of non-essential cards out there. Athelas will come in handy to get rid of it, too. Overall, by the time Sauron minions aren&#39;t roaming, you&#39;re already set up and ready to roll. Just don&#39;t get too arrogant.<br>
<br>
Shadow:<br>
<br>
Well, you should all know how to play Uruk-Hai. But, for a refresher course... Early game, try to get a Troop out at site two. If not a Troop, a higher vitality minion, such as a Raiding Party. Your adventure path is preferential towards Uruks and mean to Moria, your FP biggest weakness. The higher the vitality, the better for overwhelming. If you&#39;re not going to be able to overwhelm anyone at site 2, save your adders for site 3. If you&#39;re able to overwhelm someone important at the early sites (i.e. Aragorn, Gandalf), then your opponent is screwed and all you have to do is wear them down. Single move with your fellowship; your opponent isn&#39;t going anywhere.<br>
<br>
Be careful to wisely use your Saruman. I know he can clog your hand at times, but just be aware that he&#39;s most useful at site 5, 6 and 9. Five and six is a one-two punch to kill companions. Site 7 and 8, you should probably not play him, if possible. Site 9 it&#39;s almost essential to get him out, so that you can make one last ditch effort to finish off their fellowship.<br>
<br>
Card Choices:<br>
<br>
Caras Galadhon/Great River- I hate hate hate Moria swarm. These stop it.<br>
<br>
Filibert Bolger- Cancel fierce skirmishes. Self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
Strength of Kings- Stops that pesky Savagery and Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry.<br>
<br>
3 Lurtzes? Yeah, why not? He&#39;s not good enough to play 4 of, but a 13 strength, sometimes fierce minion is always good to have. Play him by himself, too. With a bred for battle or two and a savagery, Lurtz becomes a killin&#39; machine.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai Raiding Party- High vitality. You can use two Bred For Battles on these guys. Not too shabby.<br>
<br>
Why not 4 Savageries? I only have 3.<br>
<br>
Only 1 spies? You have 3 of the rare saruman, meaning unless they&#39;re playing SUPER archery, you shouldn&#39;t even be phased by archery.<br>
<br>
Ambition? For now, it just is in there to drop the cost of Power, LBC, etc. When I get a 4th Savagery, I&#39;ll probably take this out for it.<br>
<br>
Well, that about covers it. Have a fun time against this deck, and good luck! </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
