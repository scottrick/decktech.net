So this deck really tears up Rohan, as they give out a lot of pool. And it slaughters Dauntless Hunter, via the polarms. There are the top 2 decks in today&#39;s environment. <br />
<br />
The Shadow side is a mix between beatdown and corruption. Either side can win, and has many times. The captain gets more powerful as the other player acquires more burdens, and you can add more with Vision From Afar. Then once you get up to 5 burdens you can drop Enquea and kill off a companion. <br />
<br />
With the Free Peoples, it&#39;s basic Ring-bound power. They prevent most of the burden-adding with Easterlings, and can kill most anything that is put out. Legolas is out to help pick off minions and Aragorn counters the stupid swarm and can be dropped at site 8 (my personal favorite) which always really ticks of my opponent. The majority of wins comes from the Shadow side of this deck but the fellowship side can indeed win, and quite handily. Mablung can kill any minion in the game with 2 exertions - whack on Shelob. But keep an eye out of Nazgul decks with All Blades Perish - my personal most dispised card. You rely a lot on exertions, which is what Athelas and the Citadel of Minas Tirith are for. I bid about 3-4, you remove the burdens as you play your companions, which also helps against Easterlings. <br />
<br />
I noticed in a previous Ranger deck some people gave me lower ratings because they said it was stupid to run both Ancient Roads and Gondorian Ranger. The answer is simple: If they run cards like Saruman&#39;s Power, I can keep them roaming all the way until site 8 with just 2 Rangers. If they&#39;re killing my Fellowship like crazy, what few companions I still have will stay strong. It works very well and much better that just one or the other.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
