First off , I want to thank everyone for reviewing this deck with the necc. good comment and critism that improves decks.<br />
<br />
I have been working at alot of decks latly and feel less and less joy in posting , cse i only get GOOd , NICE reviews , which get me to top 5 places , then later on some random Lotr newb gives me one star and no-one looks at it again to see what can improve.<br />
<br />
So i decide to spend my tech points to review those reviews , but each day there comes like the same one again and again.So now i don&#39;t even have enough to rate a deck lol!<br />
-----<br />
<br />
So now that you have wresteld your way trough this boring text , i would like to present you this wonderfull piece of tech.<br />
<br />
I see you wondering : WHAAT IS THIS PILE?<br />
<br />
Slaked Preps set up real fast to kill minions together with focused legolas and aragorn , or a path once in a while.<br />
<br />
Why combine it with Corsair?<br />
Well with corsair you can toss away your entire minion side and still realise a stop using your possesion trick : black sails + ships of great draught.So Legolas realy gives an edge.<br />
<br />
Why does this deck work?<br />
<br />
Well lets see the counters :<br />
<br />
1.Threat Nazgul / Casual :<br />
HAHAHAHAHAHA , so you want to discard my imaginary possesions cantea : Go right ahead.<br />
After your setup , u hardy give off pool and have the ability to take down minions real nice using ur super tech DARK WAYS + slaked , meaning two dual exerts each turn , the rest of those pritty nazgul plainly die to the archery.<br />
<br />
2.Corsairs : Taking care of castamir and preventing its return by discarding possesions is usualy auto win vs it :]<br />
<br />
3.Dunland : Here&#39;s a good joke.What are dunland without hides? Worth Nothing , thats what they are.Hence 3 Possesion Remove cards + Barliman who can take them back.<br />
<br />
4.Swarm : 4 Paths , Aragorn ROTN , Huge amout of Archery vs legolas (splendor + 2 focused = auch) , slaked to take the bigger ones.<br />
<br />
5.Sauron Grinder : Yeah this is prolly one of the harder ones , but using your slaked at keen times to kill them off and your sam to keep stacking wounds and healing simply results in a win.<br />
<br />
6.Burdenising Sauron : Ok here is where my deck fails often : If i can&#39;t get rid of those pesky burden adders soon i have probs.However I nor my friend haven&#39;t seen a game without the deck being depleted at site 9 , wether the fellowship or the minion side does it.<br />
<br />
7.Isenguard Bomb = Each deck can lose from it , soz so can mine , but using slaked at right times , gimli&#39;s dge bonus , gandalf&#39;s overwelm ability , aragorn Rotn , i stand a fair chance of 50 */* vs it.However when they come vs a 4 curse their foul feet deck , they stand way less chance and so this deck can promote to the finals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fellowship you should set up your slaked fast and use your dark ways to ensure double moves :]<br />
Legolas is realy a pîmp being able to set up 5 archery in one turn , turing potenial slaughter in a win for your behalf.<br />
<br />
For the minion side : Set up your conditions and let Castamir man do his job : overwhelming after corsair mar. have taken care of their possesions.<br />
Then use boosts as a suprise +6 to do 2-3 overwhelmes a turn.You don&#39;t have to be affraid to ditch minions or stuff , they come back.<br />
<br />
ok I hope you enjoyed , my friend did even more :]<br />
(naturaly he gave me some of his &#39;decipher dolars&#39;<br />
so im a happy man aswell)<br />
