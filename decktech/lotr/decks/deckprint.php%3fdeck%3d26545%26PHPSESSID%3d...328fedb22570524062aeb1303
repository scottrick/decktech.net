Also it help because you have no burden removal, which works out ok with this deck just don&#39;t pushimmer.<br />
<br />
I think the first thing I have to say about this deck is about the two questions that arise of the very start.  Why not the common Faramir and Why no Blade of Gondor?  The common Faramir is not a good starter for the deck, one because of cost and the other because he isn&#39;t strenght +2 against roaming.  I start with what I do because it is a saftey net for the start of the game.  As for the second question, Boromir doesn&#39;t need his sword because in this deck all he is there for is to take on the big minions with out being overwelmed.  This deck is just made to servive the oppoints onslaught with out losing anyone until site 7.  What I usually do is keep one Still Sharp in my hand and stack the rest on the Shards.  I have played with a deck like this several times and I have only been stopped once from going from site 7 to site 9, and the time it happend was when I only got 2 power ups the whole game.  The rest of the deck on the fellowship side is pretty self-explainitory.<br />
<br />
The minion side is fairly easy to grasp. Control as many sites as you can, espically battlegrounds so that your Uruk Assalt Bands are really nasty, that is the reason why Uruk Camp for site 2.  Otherwise just do what Uruk-Hai do best, KILL. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
