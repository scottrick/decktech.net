And for the sake of long-windedness, I&#39;ll go through most of it. :-)<br />
<br />
Obviously, this deck is mainly about various sorts of direct damage: archery, exerting to wound people, making people exert for no good reason, etc.  That automatically gives the deck some good and bad matchups.  On the fellowship side, the smaller the fellowship you&#39;re facing, the better, as there&#39;s less people to assign all that damage too.  However, how big they are tends not to matter too much, as most of your damage tends not to come from winning skirmishes.  I haven&#39;t had too much trouble with big companions though, with stuff like Hate you can usually kill companions as fast as the opponent can play them.  On the shadow side, Nazgul is probably the toughest matchup, because it isn&#39;t that easy to make them go away without fighting them.  A lot of my deck is dedicated to anti-Nazgul, including the choice to start Arwen instead of Gimli, and the 4 Athelas.<br />
<br />
Obviously, Sleep, Caradhras does a number on the Shadow portion of the deck.  However, right now it&#39;s not that popular of a card, and it has a big weakness: you need Gandalf.  Make sure you exploit that weakness, and give Gandalf the You Bring Great Evil.  Then when you get enough Hates in your hand, Hate him to death.  It&#39;s worth it.<br />
<br />
One other note, the deck does very well in multiplayer with no modifications at all.  Remember, all those Orc Bowmen and Under the Watching Eyes affect EVERYONE, whereas most shadow stuff affects only one player.  I really wouldn&#39;t change anything for multiplayer, as long as you&#39;re conservative on card drawing you shouldn&#39;t run out in a 4-player game.<br />
<br />
As for bidding, I pretty much always bid 2.  The reason is this.  If I go first (or if my opponent starts Prancing Pony, which is pretty common), I&#39;ll add a burden to get Aragorn.  That gives me 3, one less than is needed to activate Ulaire Toldea.  I fear Toldea.  If I can possibly help it, Toldea will never be active.  Of course, if you know they&#39;re not playing Nazgul, you could possibly bid 3, but you&#39;ve also got stuff like Enduring Evil and Worry and Traitor&#39;s Voice to worry about.  I wouldn&#39;t really bid more than 3 in any case with this deck, because there&#39;s really no way to remove them.  If you don&#39;t get to go first and there&#39;s no Prancing Pony, it&#39;s not a huge tragedy, as there are 2 Aragorns.<br />
<br />
Some card choices:<br />
<br />
Son of Drogo - There&#39;s no Hobbit allies, so this is a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
Isildur&#39;s Bane - Really, you should never be putting on the Ring.  I&#39;ve only actually been corrupted once, and I never actually put on the ring that game (but I probably bid too high).  Extra vitality is what makes this ring the winner.<br />
<br />
Rivendell Waterfall (Site 3) - It&#39;s a forest for ARV, and it lets you move from site 3 to site 6.  What more could you ask for?<br />
<br />
Lothlorien Woods (Site 6) - I really don&#39;t care how big the stupid allies are, but I do care if they look at my hand and see if I have Hates or Enduring Evils.  And cheap Moria orcs are no good.  Hence, Woods it is.<br />
<br />
Anduin Confluence (Site 7) - Well, I try to get Rumil killed at site 6 anyway, so it doesn&#39;t hurt me.  And it almost always hurts others.  One note, the only time I&#39;ve lost against a Moria deck was at Anduin Wilderland (another site 7), go overwhelmed because I couldn&#39;t use my archery.  Otherwise you should be fine against Moria.<br />
<br />
Rumil - Works against 2 popular races, while Orophin only works against one (and I don&#39;t see too much Isengard anyway).<br />
<br />
Athelas - Heals people, and gets rid of those silly Nazgul conditions.  I play 4 in every deck.<br />
<br />
Sleep, Caradhras - This card is the main reason I have Gandalf in the deck (and x3 besides).  Against Sauron (and to a lesser extent, Nazgul), you really need to get rid of those conditions.  Minion conditions are MUCH MUCH better than fellowship conditions, so I opted for this instead of Tale/Sage/Last Alliance.  And I&#39;ve yet to regret the choice.<br />
<br />
A Ranger&#39;s Versatility - This can get you out of some big trouble at the later sites, especially site 8 when you don&#39;t need extra minions sticking around for site 9.  Most of the sites 7-9 are forest or river, so playing it shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem.  And there&#39;s 3 rangers, Arwen, Aragorn, and Boromir.  Just reduce their 2 biggest guys down to 1 vitality each, then ping them with Arrows.  Works especially well against Nazgul (which is the main reason I included it).<br />
<br />
Swordsman of the Northern Kingdom - Remember, this works on Arwen and Boromir too.<br />
<br />
Morgul Hunter, Band of the Eye, Enduring Evil - These are to knock out companions later on in the game, if I can&#39;t get them with Hate.<br />
<br />
You Bring Great Evil - No point in doing all that damage if they just heal it all, right?  Biggest targets for this are Gandalf (if he heals less, you&#39;ll be able to Hate him more easily, and then he can&#39;t play Sleep, Caradhras) and Aragorn (he can heal other people, that&#39;s no good).  Remember, You Bring Great Evil doesn&#39;t just affect Sanctuary healing, it means they can&#39;t heal at all while at site 3 or 6.  So Athelas, Aragorn, extra copies, etc., don&#39;t work as long as they&#39;re at a Sanctuary.<br />
<br />
Various Tracker Orcs - You need them for Under the Watching Eye, and being able to pull them with Tol Brandir is a game-winner too.  I&#39;m using Ambushers over Assassins because they&#39;re texts are both pretty insignificant, and one less pool is much better than one more strength.<br />
