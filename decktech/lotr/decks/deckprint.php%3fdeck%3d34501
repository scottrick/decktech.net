It&#39;s so good. The main strategy is to get your Jesus-Clerk combo working so you can prevent the Milli Vanilli incident from occuring by using Randall to tape Girl You Know It&#39;s True without error. How do you do this? Simple. Get Jesus down ASAP to heal Randall and to make sure you get off Girl You Know It&#39;s True on by turn 2.<br />
Apu is in the deck to give Randall some strength bonus with his ability.<br />
<br />
What happens if your opponent leaves you alone and starts doing their own thing? Drop VOLTRON on them and watch them cry as he destroys everything in site. Good luck getting enough Voltrons because he is SUPER ULTRA MEGA RARE.<br />
<br />
Neo and Night Rider are in the deck to handle anything Voltron doesn&#39;t feel like handling. Neo&#39;s Matrix Move is pretty good. Use it<br />
<br />
Winston Churchill is in the deck to add power and give it credibility. I was thinking about fropping him and adding 3x Bill Clinton or     3x EPP Osama, Saddam, and Aylatola with Koran.<br />
<br />
Good matchups-<br />
You will own Terrorists because Voltron and Neo will pick them apart. Too good, plus you have Jesus.<br />
<br />
You can beat any Democrat deck that starts John Kerry. It&#39;s jst plain and simple. They usually don&#39;t have enough personality in the deck and if you grab Swift Boat Captain, they&#39;re sank.<br />
<br />
You will dominate any Republican deck that doesn&#39;t play Religious Right on the next to last turn. Apparantly they have a better Jesus than you do, so watch out. You might have to place Neo with Apu to prevent Hate Crime.<br />
<br />
Bad Matchups-<br />
Any dedicated Jew deck with 9x Cross might be bad news for your Jesus. Try deploying him to a safe place. If they run a Barry Goldstein, just try use Voltron to get him off the table ASAP.<br />
<br />
Any Democrat deck that starts off with either Howard Dean, Bill Clinton, or John Edwards. It may be a rough go. You might be able to play Jesus at their sites, and if they reject him, it&#39;s an autowin.<br />
<br />
N&#39;SYNC-Satan will probably beat you 9/10 times unless you can neutralize N&#39;SYNC. Jesus takes care of Satan easily, but Milli Vanilli is no match for for EPP Justin Timberlake. Good luck.<br />
<br />
The Paris Hilton and friends deck. You will just get pwned. Just have fun looking at your opponents&#39; HAWT cards as he plays them.<br />
