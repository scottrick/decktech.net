I wasn&#39;t really that concerned about the fellowship, because I knew the minion side would wreck big fellowships.<br />
<br />
The recursion with nertea and uruk captains are what won the game for me. Scrabblers were huge and to be able to keep bringing them back with nertea helped. White Arrows, Tale of Gil-Galad, Shoulder to Shoulder, it popped them all.<br />
<br />
Spies of Saruman was to try and prevent White Arrows, but proved to be 2 wasted slots. No business of ours helped me keep the cards I needed. Tower Assassins were for all sorts of allies.<br />
<br />
The fellowship to this deck is nothing special at all. Its just something I knew how to use, and i like elf allies and sentinels better than sleep. PATH is huge, but I don&#39;t need to tell you that.<br />
<br />
I am sure this deck would never win a local tourney as everything is way too expensive, but with the big fellowship decks and shoulder to shoulder giving away pool, this is exactly what I needed. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
