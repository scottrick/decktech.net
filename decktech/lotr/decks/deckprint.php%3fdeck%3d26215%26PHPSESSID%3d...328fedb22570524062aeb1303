Though it has the potential to run if need be, it wins 80+% of the games by killing or corrupting Frodo at site 5, 7, 8 or 9. Basically the massive amount of card drawing on the Fellowship side, combined with a healthy mix of cheap Uruks ensures that you will use every ounce of pool given to you to it&#39;s fullest. Not to mention the Tower Assassin/Raider combo to not only keep Filbert in check, but also great for setting up really cheap beatdowns. <br />
<br />
Bascially this deck plays the same against most anything and everything. Bid 0-2 and go second if you have the choice (I hear Hollin is pretty good). Give up a thousand pool early, then choke later when minions stop roaming. Keep the pressure on, but don&#39;t pass if you don&#39;t think you have to. Remember, with a set up hand and 13-15 pool you can play Saruman and 8 Uruks (assuming you have the Captain) once they hit the deadly Slopes. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I happened to hit some HORRIBLE luck (afterall, it&#39;s LotR) day 2, or I could have very easily seen this deck taking both brackets, but Efridge did what I could not, and pretty much owned anything and everything he faced going 8-0 at day 2 Worlds for (I was told) the first time in Decipher history. This deck has posted a cumulative tournament record of 33-3, and has proven itself time and time again. I only wish I had thought of it for DragonCon :-)<br />
<br />
The strategy should be pretty straight forward, though this deck takes a lot of skill to play (considering it&#39;s LotR and all). Try to set up Worry as soon as you can, and time your strikes appropriately. You don&#39;t wanna blow your load with 10 pool at site 4, save it for later when it will be a little more devastating. With an ally in the dead pile, 12 pool can get you Saruman, Ravager x3 and a Raider, throwing four 9 power, damage +1 minions in their face. With a pump or two, you could easily win 8 skirmishes in that situation, perhaps giving Frodo a heart attack from all that worrying. Not to mention the barrage of Uruks that is site 9 every time (assuming they last that long). <br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that should be it. All I can say is that I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t make a site like Slopes in Two Towers, and I&#39;m sure this deck will dominate Fellowship block for months to come. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot, I hope you like it-<br />
