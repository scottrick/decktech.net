It is really important to go first. The starting fellowship was chosen because of the obvious need to get rid of burdens and the ability to shoot most every thing for the first 2 runs. It let&#39;s you remove 3 burden with sam. If out bid start aragorn. Bid as high as you want just fall back on Sam ( His ability to become the ring bearer has saved me in the worst of times). It is so tech to kill off frodo only to replace him with the burden eatin machine. Just hope that luck is on your side after all this game is all about luck Right? Starting the game gets rid of the luck factor. Decks that rely on killing the right ring bearer might be very unhappy with your decision to replace frodo with Sam.<br>

Now this deck use 9 companion, 6 stealth, and 4 allies. So it doesn&#39;t really matter if they manage to live through the archery phase you have so many character&#39;s to eat the damage. Never put more than 5 characters out at a time, that&#39;s all. Unless your at site 5, and you can play Ranger Versatility all the way. The combination between stealth and Ranger Versatility is great with all the companions, as it easily take care of some of the minions. The stealths are for the begining of the game where as the ARV&#39;s are excellent late game equalizer&#39;s even with all the anti-ARV stuff out there.  <br>

So the hardest location to live through is site 9. That&#39;s why you have multiple companions and Stealths to cancel skirmish&#39;s. Tharin is the best stealth, from location 2 to 9 he save someone. By late game you should have out the map, this ard is so powerful as we all know. Now for those of you who don&#39;t know what the map is it is called Thorr&#39;s Map it lets you play your sites denying your opponent the ability to play his and because it is a fellowship or regroup action this makes moving easier because of the fact that after moving for the second time you map out the next site for your next turn. From 6 to 8 you have only forest / river and this is important because your gift of boats kicks in about site 6 and plus the ARV&#39;s equals alot of moves if you have to. Lego and Aragorn are huge as you all know they turn most anything in to a pin cushin.<br>

Nazgul are really tough to get rid of with All Blades Perish x2 and the Not easily destroyed x2 they are a force to mess with. Now Nazgul are what I call pearl harbor bombers they are made for hitting the fellowship at the beginning of the game when they are most effective.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
If you decide to use this deck please remember that there are alot of people that believe that Nazgul are there to kill companions well there not they are there to slow down your opponents fellowship while you run ahead of him and take the win right out from under his her nose.  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
