Uruk Lieutenant  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The deck uses a high fellowship/low deck count to get out the cards you need quickly.  Your hand should almost always come up with a large amount of minions.  Uruk Hai are in there for Worry – the burden adding strategy is huge.  Uruk Hai, while not my first choice for this deck, are very potent and have lots of fun with decks – especially the card discarding strategy.<br />
<br />
Bid low always – you want to go second.  Bid one burden at most – when you deploy Pippin – Hobbit of Some Intelligence he will remove the burden.  There are far too many cards that hurt high burden counts, and most of them are Nazgul.<br />
<br />
If by some chance you do go first, grab the Gaffer.  He is somewhat important in that he heals Frodo.  To heck with Sam – you should barely have to use his text for burden removal.  And if you do, that is what Rosie is there for (that and to add 1 to Sam’s power).  The Gaffer/Sting combo is very important to any deck.  Why?  You get to look at your opponent’s hand.  Anyone who has ever played a gam of CCG in their life is well aware of the benefits of knowing what your opponent has in their hand.  It is the difference between moving one site or two sites.<br />
<br />
The sites are all carefully selected to cause the fellowship some difficulty in their travels.  Low deploy Nazgul/Moria (makes your opponent think you are playing a different deck), archery bonuses, card drawing bonuses, and exerting penalties.<br />
<br />
There are few rares, most should be easily attainable.  But as I am sure we are all aware, the uncommons are sometimes harder to come by then the rares.  :)<br />
<br />
Why Merry – From O’er the Brandywine?  Because with a weapon, he becomes Super Hobbit, able to kill minions very easily, and hard to overwhelm!<br />
<br />
The basic strategy of the deck is to move 1 site a turn and get your sites out to penalize your opponent. </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
