Too Great and Terrible    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Most decks are built bent on not encountering much resistance, and that&#39;s fine... but it&#39;s not half as fun as seeing what they can throw at you and beating the royal $hit out of it!<br />
<br />
With &quot;Trust me as you once did&quot; any companion can be a total masher, especially when gandalf has his 6 vitality goin on.  This deck is built to fight, on both sides... <br />
<br />
The Nazgul side doesn&#39;t have multiple copies of Gates or the Witch King, but I think it&#39;s competetive, and as a bonus, I think it could do quite well against a Mirror/Shoulder to Shoulder discard deck that right now seems almost unbeatable... How?  Because the weaknesses of that deck (easily overwhelmable characters, giving up tons of twilight, and dependence on one or two characters) all play into the nazgul&#39;s hands...<br />
<br />
Did I design the deck to counter that deck?  No, it just sort of does...  I designed the deck for fun, because I like taking the fight on to those nasty minions, and more importantly, I like playing Nazgul!<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />
<br />
Early Game:<br />
Bid 1, start second if you win, don&#39;t bid zero!  Until site 4, just keep up with them, don&#39;t move past... <br />
<br />
Mid Game:<br />
depends on your situation... if your shadow isn&#39;t even putting a dent in them, then you are obviously going to have to start running, if not, don&#39;t worry until site 6, just keep up... that&#39;s very important, always be at the same site by the end of your turn, if you can&#39;t then it&#39;s time to start hoping...<br />
<br />
Late Game:<br />
If you are still behind after the second sanctuary you should at least double move to 8 (if you can) to force them to a decision, unless you are fully confident your shadow can take frodo down...<br />
<br />
Card Choices:<br />
<br />
Pippin:  Great scrub for this deck... makes Aragorn / Gandalf cheap:  odds are you will average just over 1 of either in your opening hand, let him die right after you play the second for sure though, if not before, as you want to stay under 5 companions.  <br />
<br />
The Slight Choke (Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom, No Stranger):  You don&#39;t want to give your opponent enough twilight to get 5 Uruk-Hai out or 4 and a Saruman, because that is only trouble... with these cards, you should never get swarmed by anything except Moria and maybe some really half @$$ed Sauron swarm.  This makes the fighters that much more effective...<br />
<br />
Friend of the Shirefolk: One extra power, plus believe it or not, he&#39;s the only one I have 4 of!<br />
<br />
Betrayal of Isenguard: hurts swarms a bit, plus it makes Saruman a non-issue... man I hate the common one... it&#39;s not that good, but it can be a game breaker...<br />
<br />
Wielder of the Flame: get out of jail card... could make Aragon defender + 4...<br />
<br />
Gandalf: Egon himself... what would you do without Egon?  He&#39;s the glue of the Ghostbusters!<br />
<br />
Boromir: Peter Venkman... is there anyone who plays bull-headed better than Bill Murray?<br />
<br />
Aragorn:  Ray... is there anything remotely similar between these two characters?  <br />
<br />
Pippen: Slimer! Scrub central...<br />
<br />
Shadow:<br />
<br />
Black Breath/Lemenaya : The Reason to play Nazgul...<br />
<br />
Skulkers:  More BB/Lemenaya of course<br />
<br />
Nertea: More Lemenaya...<br />
<br />
2 Witch Kings:  Only have these two... he&#39;s really only here for Pale Blade condition removal.  He also wins more skirmishes than the rest.<br />
<br />
Too Great and Terrible:  Direct damage is just too hard to pass up.  Gandalf is in easily over 50% of decks these days... plus sleep could really suck some life out of nazgul.<br />
<br />
Relentless Charge / Power is in their Terror:  More direct damage against the banes of Nazgul everywhere.<br />
<br />
Last but certainly not least:<br />
<br />
Lemenaya:  Badest Nazgul there is... not to mention the scariest looking card of all the nazgul... really the only one that looks like a ghost!<br />
<br />
Well, Thanks for Reading, I appreciate your reviews... this deck may not win tournaments, but it&#39;s not meant to... this is my fun friend deck... please review accordingly... and please, please, please don&#39;t blast my very corny ghostbuster jokes.... </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
