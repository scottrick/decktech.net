Except for Anarion who is of course, the key to the deck. He is so DOMINATE it isnt even funny. Denethor must stay alive till 3 at least to pull him. He can pull lots of stuff usually to because of all the healing in here.  I threw in Gandalf at the last minute cause Grind decks and stuff seem to not be going away. Interestingly enough I drew gandy everytime, usually with the grown. <br />
<br />
The shadow, of course, would destroy my fellow, mostly, but no one was running it but me.  Its an old shadow (0riginally this was meant to be paired with the new EVIL MEN archery deck, but lego is too much of a jerk against that deck, cant wait for march!). I also chose this shadow cause it owns that brainless eowyn lego deck that is sadly still around, and does well against elf galadriel nonsense since there is nothing she can really hurt.  Its solid stuff! <br />
