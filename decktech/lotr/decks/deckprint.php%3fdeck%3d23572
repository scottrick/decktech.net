<br>
Companions:<br>
<br>
Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir - Frodo is in this deck to provide the extra healing into the hobbit healing circle, but more importantly, it allows Bounders to be used again and again, thus freeing up space for more cards. Should be the first to receive a hobbit sword.<br>
<br>
Sam, Son of Hamfast - Corruption protection. Sam is used a lot for protecting Frodo from corruption. Also makes bidding high a viable option, as they will be removed quickly.  Great for carrying the ring forth as well. If Frodo has a blade tip and the black breath, and several burdens on him, it is often not a bad idea to get Frodo killed and Sam will start fresh with no burdens. Should be the third to receive a hobbit sword.<br>
<br>
Pippin, Friend to Frodo - Fodder. Swarm protection. One of the weaknesses of this deck is swarming. Pippin is there to help stop that. He should only be given a hobbit sword if one of the other hobbits has been slain.<br>
<br>
Merry, Friend to Sam - Great asset. Wielding a hobbit sword, and with There and Back Again being used, you can exert Merry to add seven strength to another hobbit. He should be given a hobbit sword second.<br>
<br>
Adventure Deck:<br>
<br>
[1] Bag End - If you get to go first (not a bad idea, unless fighting Nazgul) you get to start off the hobbit healing circle early. Good thing.<br>
<br>
[4] Balin&#39;s Tomb - Best site four for this deck I believe. Can be used to clear out your hand if you have an extra O Elbereth Githoniel, and it probably  won&#39;t help your opponent a lot.<br>
<br>
[9] Summit of Amon Hen - With the amount of burdens being added, the extra card draws can really help. One of the problems with this site is that often by site nine, the draw deck will be almost gone, and will not often make full use of the card drawing. I&#39;ve had several instances where I only get to draw one or two cards at that site. Emyn Muil might not be a bad site here, as fierce fights mean more activations of Desperate Defense of the Ring.<br>
<br>
Free Peoples:<br>
<br>
Bilbo Baggins, Well-spoken Gentlehobbit - The last line of defense against the ever-so-nasty Goblin Swarms. Would not recommend removing from this deck, at all.<br>
<br>
Bounder - One of the few defenses against swarming and overwhelming this deck has. Removing even one of them would be a fatal blow to the deck&#39;s structure. If Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir is not going to be used, more bounders are essential to the hobbits&#39; survival.<br>
<br>
There and Back Again - Protection from Saruman&#39;s Snows and Saruman&#39;s Frost. Also very handy for pumping up Merry to make another hobbit very powerful.<br>
<br>
Thror&#39;s Map - An added bonus to this deck. Recommend to not move onto site seven without it, or allies could go missing. Another one in this deck would help, but it&#39;s tough to find room.<br>
<br>
Shadow:<br>
<br>
Desperate Defense of the Ring - The deck&#39;s staple card. Not a bad idea to put all four one on companion, or two each on two companions. Don&#39;t put any on Frodo (unless Frodo is the deck&#39;s tank, like the Free People&#39;s site of this deck)<br>
<br>
Thin and Stretched - Along with Desperate Defense of the Ring, it helps entice the Free Peoples player to get Frodo to fight. <br>
<br>
Enduring Evil - The other staple of this deck. More burdens, more evil. Get Frodo to fight. Get Frodo to die.<br>
<br>
Must Do Without Hope - Hold in hand until the Bridge of Khazad-Dum. It is usually a guaranteed two burdens, and consistency is always a sign of a good deck. If you draw several before the bridge, move faster. If you draw one or none before, move slower and recycle your hand quickly.<br>
<br>
Orc Inquisitors - They assist Desperate Defense of the Ring. In the tournament I just played with this deck, I corrupted the Ring-bearer because I played two Orc Inquisitors, and he couldn&#39;t discard enough cards for Desperate Defense of the Ring.<br>
<br>
Bill Ferny - Swarthy Sneering Fellow - Simply used to stick on to the companion with the most Desperate Defense of the Rings. Stick onto a companion with four on them, watch the Free Peoples player add four burdens. If drawn early in the game, might be a good idea to discard him.<br>
<br>
All Other Minions - There to smash the free peoples. These are up for adjustment, but I found the current configuration worked very well, as most of them can exert lots for Desperate Defense of the Ring and Thin and Stretched, and most are high strength, making Enduring Evil even more brutal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall Strategy:<br>
<br>
Bid a reasonable amount: 3-5. Go first if you can, unless you&#39;re fighting Nazgul, then make the other player go first, so you don&#39;t have to feel the wrath of their sites (Thror&#39;s Map is nice here as well). <br>
<br>
The weakness of the hobbit side is swarms and overwhelming. Moving first can be pretty devastating if you draw bad support cards, but I have found that the hobbits almost always recover. The bounders and Bilbo play an essential part of protection from this weakness. Frodo should be the prime fighter, with Merry backing him up closely.<br>
<br>
Against Under The Watching Eye/Orc Bowmen decks, this deck has no problem against. Once there are enough UTWE and Bowmen out to be a threat, the hobbit healing circle is usually going at full force, and they have no effect.<br>
<br>
For the Shadow side, Desperate Defense of the Ring is key. It&#39;s not a bad idea to play them all on one companion. The idea is to try to entice Frodo to fight against your minions, and then to Enduring Evil him (usually down to zero strength). Bill Fery and the Balrog are there simply to add more burdens. This deck can corrupt.<br>
<br>
This strategy works best against people who like to bid high to go first, and people who are not familiar with these tactics. It has taught many people in this area to not take burdens for granted, and to often not fight with Frodo when you don&#39;t have to.<br>
<br>
The shadow site has a couple weaknesses: A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, and Sam, Son of Hamfast. One opponent I played had Sam, and I could only keep around two or three burdens on him at a time. He was also playing shadow choke, and that hurt a lot. He was unable to stop my hobbits though. Orc Scouts wouldn&#39;t be a bad addition to this deck, but the big minions also work very well. <br>
<br>
This deck just won me 3 to 1 in a tournament. The loss was not a fault of the deck, it was a fault of my playing skill; I made a silly error and it cost me the game.<br>
<br>
I would like to know if anyone else is going to try this deck and how successful they are. If you wish to contact me, my email is kefka@kmfms.com.<br>
