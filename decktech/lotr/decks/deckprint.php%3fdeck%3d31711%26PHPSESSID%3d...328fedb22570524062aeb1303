<br />
It all started in a preperation for a Belgian <br />
PSQ like event ( loadz of top 20 players there).<br />
<br />
Me and Luc Compernolle were discussing the good and the bads in the new sets and what cards could really boost a decktype.<br />
<br />
My eye fell imidiatly on the knights , cse get real , they got Such a big boost , they all are like little champs :]<br />
<br />
But then i said , its a shame u can&#39;t start out with 2 strong knights :/<br />
Soz we went on :]<br />
<br />
Later on he said , wouldn&#39;t it be great to build a Noble leaders deck with that new gandalf card u can set it totaly up!<br />
<br />
And there it was ! The card i needed to make this deck run like a smooth machine.<br />
<br />
Tatatata : Introducing Saved From The Fire!<br />
<br />
Sack a stoopid gondor dude and what happens?<br />
Get Faramir , Aragorn and Imril in ur starting<br />
fellowship!<br />
Then play ur gear and go to site 2.<br />
<br />
Mostly stop there unless u can kill some off , cse u&#39;ll be giving quite the pool away.<br />
After that u can start doubling as a madman , since ur dudes all are base 10 strenght , and can take out minions with forts aswell + get them back in the regroup.<br />
<br />
Hard choise seemed like fun to add once , just for a nice heal on aragorn or gandalf :]<br />
<br />
Fall Back is good to toss away a polearm or sth , but u realy don&#39;t need it to win vs easterling , u got ur 4th levels to win that , combined with citadels , they can&#39;t ever touch u!<br />
<br />
same goes for dunland , they realy cant hurt this deck much , cse u just deal too much wounds , and after site 2 the pool stays so low that they will have to work miracles to win skirmishes :]<br />
<br />
As for the minion side , jada jada , an easterling deck , some find them good some don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
What i like about them is that if they are combined with a good running fellowship they got good stopping power and are defenced vs smeagol likes :]<br />
<br />
The Axmen and Skirmishers can do a little swarm as my friend luc pointed out , aswell as add teh pool needed to give ur captain some more boosts :]<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope u enjoy this deck and <br />
hope on some + critisism to make it even smoother.<br />
<br />
Ty for reading and cya!<br />
