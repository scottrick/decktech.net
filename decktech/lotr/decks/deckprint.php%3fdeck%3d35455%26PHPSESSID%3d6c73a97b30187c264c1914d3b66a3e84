Mulligan it all away if you have to.  You&#39;ll get it back, who cares.  Gandalf is so important to this deck that it is a little fragile, but it rocks when it&#39;s on.  I was always intrigued by the elf telepathy decks, but never played one because it just seemed too hard to double move.  Losing initiative was easy enough, but being able to do it on the second move was risky at best.  Along comes wells of deep memory.  Hmmmm.....drawing three cards just for moving again?  Let&#39;s see what I need to make this happen : Galadriel - check, she&#39;s got the ring already.  Arwen - check, that fair elf maiden was already along for the ride.  Celeborn - uhhh...wait a minute, that new Celeborn is pretty wise.  Yeah, let&#39;s throw him in there.  Hey, he actually gets a forearmed or final shot back in my hand if I move again too.  We&#39;re so wise and we didn&#39;t know it.  Rounding out the party is Gandalf, who taught the elves how to see into the future; Gil-galad, who can help with a double move and take on a few scraps himself; Elrond, who gets even more cards back outta your discard; Cirdan, who&#39;s got the built in forearms (this guy&#39;s buff); and, Jarnsmid, our likes-to-be-overwhelmed-but-at-least-I-got-rid-of-a-couple-burdens-barding-guy.  He doesn&#39;t get as overwhelmed near often as you might think, plus, he&#39;s the only answer against some turbo-nazgul-burden shadows.  The rest of the fellowship is pretty easy.  Forearmed to make the bad guys little bad guys.  Final shot for a little pump.  Company of archers comes in a little handy against those goblin hordes.  Glimpse of fate and brooding on tomorrow.  Simple stuff.<br />
<br />
As for the red cards in the deck, Sauron (the guy and the culture) seemed to be an obvious choice.  What&#39;s better than using Sauron to give a minion -18 strength?  Heck, even Jarnsmid feels like fighting today.  Beseigers are good to round out your baddies because of the obvious high costs until you feed them through the engines.  Plus, I just love using Grond.  The card rocks.  Great seige towers are beastly too in multiples.  Please give me a little feedback on this deck, because it is my first telepathy deck, and it just seems like something is a little off.  I&#39;m not amazed with the final shots, and I like the idea of having no possesions to have the shadow discard.  That just seems like wasted twilight.
