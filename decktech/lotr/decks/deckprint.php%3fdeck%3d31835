<br />
First, the Fellowship. Second Level and the Gondorian Merchant makes minions roaming, What Are They? Discards them, and the massive amounts of archer slaughters anything left. 39 cards a side is a bit big, but the deck cycles wonderfully with the Moria side, They Are Coming, and Shadow Between. Elrond + Shadow Between can heal Legolas twice every turn, which basically means he can single-handedly kill at least one minion every turn. I put Rumil in because of some of the Sauron Besieger decks that have been popping up, he’s a big help against them. Aragorn, with his sword and Last Alliance becomes a tank. Trackers or Old School Uruks are no problem, they’re roaming until site 5 without any help and by that time you’re completely set up. The deck eats Captain Crunch and the Polearms for breakfast. With them having 4 Polearms and me having 4 What Are Theys, the archery kills every other minion. Legolas has his bow and knives which can save your butt against the Stupid Swarm deck, which this deck does pretty well against. Second Level and WAT? takes care of Isengard Warrior, Secret Sentinels kills Swarms, and the Bow can kill a runner on Frodo. <br />
<br />
Your hardest matchup will be against Rohan with Merry -- although this Shadow side does quite well against it. I’ve play-tested it against Rohan and it wins about 75% of the games. They’ll bounce Merry back to their hands to get rid of 3 wounds at a time, but that also means they when they re-play him they might have lost Merry’s Sword, which means you can drop Ulaire Enquea the next turn and pick off Eomer, thus triggering threat wounds. Which brings me to the Morgul Ambusher, who’s text reads: While you can spot 3 threats, the minion archery total is +2. And he’s not unique, so you can drop two of this guy at site 5 for 4 easy archery, not counting all the other archers. The Moria Archer Troops and Bowmen do their usual thing, as well as actually providing a bit of swarm for this deck, if the straight wounding doesn’t work. <br />
Another way to counter Merry is by playing a cheap Orc, Throw Yourself In Next Time on Merry, and Enquea. If Merry is within reach then you definitely want to kill him, otherwise hit Eomer. Even if it doesn’t kill Rohan, it will still make them stop to heal at the sanctuaries and you can beat the deck by doubling past them and reaching site 9 first.<br />
Dunland can be a hard matchup, if they manage to discard your bows early. The thing to remember is to give off as little pool as possible, and then overwhelm them with archery, and/or discard them. <br />
<br />
Finally, don’t give me a lousy rating because it won’t work vs. Rohan - this works! <br />
