<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
as previously mentioned, what really makes these guys shine is their ability to quickly cycle through your deck. this is where we meet up with your fellowship. bid high and go first, use sam to get those nasty burdens off (but don&#39;t sacrifice him too soon, you need someone to take a hit when the &#39;rog rears his ugly head). you need to be able to make it to site 9 first. so whenever it&#39;s possible, you need to play all the shadow cards in your hand. this ensures that you&#39;ll have a good deal of free peoples cards for your fellowship to use as you run. as a matter of standard procedure, you should run from sites 1 to 3, and from 7 to 9. you should really only need to double jump a third time if your opponent tries to out run you. but because that means you can play even more minions and possibly overwhelm more than one character, the chances of that are really slim (especially after site 4). <br>
<br><br>
<br>
<br><br>
 now you understand the basics of the deck, and what you&#39;re supposed to do when you use this deck. <br>
