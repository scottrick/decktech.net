Terrible as the Dawn    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Free Peoples is a pretty standard Firewall build.  Bid 0 to play your sites until you get set up.  Then you can run.  I typically move 1-3, 3-4, 4-6 and 6-9.  <br />
<br />
You have to play it by ear depending on what you draw, but typically with the first Saved, I burn Galadriel to go get Elrond, Legolas and Aiglos.  Then the next turn you can burn Dervorin to get Elessar, Elendil and either Anduril or Narsil.  Clearly this all depends on your draw.  Remember, you can use two in a turn, but you will only be able to get 4 cards from your draw deck total, so this is typically not a great idea.  <br />
<br />
Most shadows can’t use the pool you will generate, but be careful against Beasterlings as they CAN!!.  <br />
<br />
I typically wait to play Radagast until site 6 if I can and then you can triple to win.   If you have Terrible and Evil in hand for Enquea protection, go ahead and do it earlier.  <br />
<br />
Make sure to use Anduril’s game text to get your sanctuaries as sites are so important now, especially against Nazgul.  If you like Derufin better than Dervorin, start him instead, but it seems like I use Dervorin’s text more.  It really doesn’t matter as you will typically burn either of them by site 3, 4 at the latest.<br />
<br />
Shadows is again a pretty standard Beseiger build.  Remember to place your tokens on Great Siege Towers and spread them out so you can pump more than +2 at a time.  Great Hill Troll isn’t as great in Shadows but he’s still good and Troll of Gorgoroth is really good too.  Mordor Pillager makes it easy to control sites, especially since we’re seeing more “rainbow” fellowships in Shadows.  Grond is awesome as usual.  Like I said, this is a pretty standard Beseiger build.  <br />
<br />
I love how Saved filters the deck out, leaving me mostly minions in my draw deck by Region 3. Trolls get really cheap with more engines out and the more sites I control the stronger everyone gets.  This is a fun deck to play because it makes you think about the order of your actions.  Check it out!<br />
