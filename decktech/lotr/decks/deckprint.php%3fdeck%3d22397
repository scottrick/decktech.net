Before you look at this deck and say “A Gimli Deck! Gimli decks suck!” open your mind.  Give this deck a chance.  I guarantee you that you’ll be surprised.  I’ve searched high and low for a way to make a Gimli deck that works, because when he’s decked out, he’s an axe-wielding whirling dervish. Well, my efforts have paid off.  The Moria Family Album is undefeated in tournament and league play.  If you think that Gimli decks can’t be good, let me assure you that you couldn’t be more wrong.  This deck is proof.  It has a bit of everything.  It wins skirmishes.  It has easy (and continuous) condition removal. It deals with swarms. And it has the number one thing that any elite deck has, throughput. In fact, this deck creates so much throughput that I had to add 4 cards because 72 was too small. The result is this little powerhouse. The only side that my fellowship has shown weakness against is Nazgul. But honestly, what deck doesn’t? And furthermore, if this deck can survive through site 3 against a Nazgul deck, from there on out, I’m home free. The only combo that has been able to give my shadow trouble is Boromir with Armor. But even that doesn&#39;t last for long. So, without further ado, let’s take a quick look at what the deck does and some card choices . . .  <br>
<br>
Stairs of Khazad-dum: A free, non-unique, Gloin pumper.  It has the added benefit of destroying Moria. With 2 Stairs, a Dwarven Axe, Hand Axe, Bracers, and a Flurry of Blows (easily accomplished with this deck’s throughput) Gloin is power 17 and Damage +1 vs. Moria Minions. With 2 Stairs, Gimli’s Axe, a Hand Axe, Bracers, A Flurry of Blows and one exertion, Gimli is power 18 and damage +3. That kills the Cave Troll. Moria isn’t an issue when you factor in the Stairs. <br>
<br>
Flurry of Blows: Get any 2 Axes on a dwarf and this card will make him unstoppable in combat. <br>
<br>
Fror: Wins skirmishes against Uruk-hai <br>
<br>
Farin: Wins skirmishes against Orcs <br>
<br>
Sam, Son of Hamfast: Take advantage of those that start the Green Dragon Inn. Soaks up a minion whenever I need him to, and adds some much needed Burden relief. <br>
<br>
Aragorn, Ranger of the North: Takes advantage of those that start the Prancing Pony. And, he soaks up multiple minions when you need him to. <br>
<br>
Make Light of Burdens: Discards Tips, Breaths, and Desperate Defenses on my Dwarven characters. It also discards Weather Conditions. This card is the bomb. Saruon Burden decks, Nazgul shadow conditions, and Isengard Snows ain&#39;t got nothing on me. <br>
<br>
Cave Troll’s Chain: I&#39;ll put it this way, if you can get the Cave Troll, Cave Troll’s Hammer, and Cave Troll’s Chain out all at once, you’ve won the game. Maybe not at that site, but soon. <br>
<br>
The Balrog, Flame of Udun: He’s a guaranteed baddy at site 5. With the Balrog in the deck, it’s pretty easy to ensure a Cave Troll-Balrog combo from 4 to 5 or 5 to 6. In either case, companions die. It’s all about killing 1 or 2 companions before the second sanctuary. Together, these baddies get it done. Then at site 9 (or earlier) the goblins break through. <br>
<br>
Goblin Swarms: This one card wins games whenever you get it out. When the overflow starts to happen, assign your minions intelligently and you’ll make sure that every Moria Scout and Runner goes on the swarm so that you can build the beatdown at site 9 (or earlier).  10 orcs at one site is easily accomplished with Goblin Swarms.<br>
<br>
Guard Commander: With Armories and Runners, there are often times that I’ll have pool left over. The Commander gives me something to do with it all…and therefore put orcs on the swarm.<br>
<br>
Prancing Pony: I want to go second, but if I do end up going first, I get an extra companion. <br>
<br>
Trollshaw Forest: Lots of cheap weapons mean lots of extra cards. <br>
<br>
Moria Stairway: With Goblin Scavengers, I shouldn’t have any problem getting weapons from my discard pile, so I don’t feel the need to play the Mithril Mine. And I know that against most decks, Dwarrowdelf would do an automatic two wounds, but I don’t want to exert Gimli. Instead, I chose the Stairway to make my opponent think twice about skirmishing a Scavenger with a Sword. Furthermore, the Cave Troll with Hammer is Damage+3 and Fierce. Nasty! I&#39;ve gotten many a pi$$ed off look because of that. <br>
<br>
Anduin Wilderland: I want to extend the usefulness of my Cave Trolls. If I can get a Troll out here, he’s guaranteed to skirmish (barring an ARV+Bow of the Galadhrim/Power According to His Stature miracle), and that further softens my opponent for the deathblow. <br>
<br>
Now for some common questions/reviews, I’ve received:<br>
<br>
“You NEED Aragorn!”:  I will admit that you might think this, because I start the Prancing Pony, but I assure you that I do NOT need Aragorn.  Aragorn is a chump blocker and nothing more (Granted, he might take offense to me referring to him as such . . . after all, chump blocker is the role of hobbit companions, not Kings…Hey!  Sorry, Aragorn!  You’re better at it than they are.)  I want to go second.  However, there are occasions when somebody might win the bid and make me go first.  What do you know if your opponent utilizes this strategy?  You know that they have a stronger shadow half and want to define the site path.  That can mean Moria, Sauron, or Nazgul.  Against Sauron, it’s not really an issue.  But against Nazgul, I get two things out of the Prancing Pony start.  First, I get a companion that can take multiple skirmishes, whom I don’t care about.  If he dies, he dies.  The only truly important companions are Gimli and Gloin . . . and of course, Frodo.  And that will get my dwarves into Moria where they rule.  I stop at site 2 and now my opponent is going to play Aragorn.  That gives me at least 7 twilight to clear shadow cards from my hand.  This opens the way to more possessions that will keep my dwarves alive.  And against Moria, I get a Aragorn who can block multiple Orcs to make sure that Frodo never gets overwhelmed.  However, if I don’t see him, I’ll get him close at some point before site 9, which can easily win me the game.  Aragorn is utility . . . not necessity.  The Prancing Pony site 1 is a deep meta choice.<br>
<br>
“How does this deck OWN Moria?”:  A better question is, “How does a Moria deck own you?”  Solid Moria decks win by using a Cave Troll and Balrog to soften the fellowship so that the Moria minions wounds start killing companions, and from there on out, you start stacking on the swarms, so the swarm grows.  Then from sites 7-9, because of They Are Coming, Goblin Armory, and Goblin Swarms, you’re going to see 6+ minions per site.  Frodo fights.  Companions die.  Frodo fights more.  Frodo dies.  That’s how the typical swarm works.  Now, what if your Balrog and Troll never win a skirmish?  What if your Orcs never win skirmishes?  What if you have no cards to discard for They Are Coming?  What if I can block so many Orcs that you never break through to Frodo?  That’s what this deck does.  And then as a back-up plan I have PATHS.  My Dwarven Axes coupled with Stairs of Khazad-dum will quite possibly cause my Moria opponent to discard 8-15 card.  8-15 cards out of the highest throughput shadow side is a nightmare.  You have nothing to discard at sites 8 and 9.  No way you get enough Orcs to overwhelm.  Also, orcs rarely win skirmishes, so nothing gets stacked on the Swarms, so there’s no help there.  I win skirmishes against the Balrog and Troll (and even when I do lose, I only take 1 wound because of my Helms/Bracers), so my fellowship makes it in tact to site 9.  There, I discard all of my hand axes, make Aragorn Defender+X, assign with Gimli, wound an orc on Frodo, and then PATHS.  How does Moria stand a chance?  (In fact, my deck is filled with so much Moria Hate, I often am left holding my PATHS for no reason.  I use PATHS so rarely...actually never...that I considered removing it completely, but that was something I could not do in good conscience.  Again, this deck owns Moria.)<br>
<br>
“Your deck is weak versus Isengard!”:  I fail to see this one.  With Flurry of Blows, I kill Lurtz because I have one by the time I need it.  I limit my fellowship to Frodo, Gimli, Gloin, and Fror.  I prevent any extra wounds with Dwarven Bracers, but even that is assuming that I lose my skirmishes.  Which most of the time, Gimli is power 9-10 and pumpable; Gloin is power 11; and Fror is power 11, too.  That beats basically every Isengard minion.  Then with Till Durin Wakes, I heal any wounds I might have taken as I move to keep up with the fast paced fellowship trying to slow me down.  I’m going to force those rangers to double move on me, and that’s where the Swarms really hurts them.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s take a look at what the different halves of my deck do . . . <br>
<br>
Fellowship: <br>
<br>
If my fellowship can survive through the first 3 sites, I should be home free the rest of the way out. This deck can run, but I don’t advise it.  Instead, I suggest that you just try to keep the pressure on your opponent’s fellowship.  Keep the threat of the double move in his mind, and he’ll try to keep ahead, which is where your Orcs shine.  The Moria side wants to win, so let it. Bid 0. Go second if you can help it. Move one site at a time. Drop your Dwarven conditions and weapons as you get them.  They’re almost all free, so you get incredibly throughput.   In any given game, you will see 90-95% of the cards in your deck.  So look at the deck list and think about the fact that every card is being played.  Now, realize that all you have to do is keep Frodo alive.  As long as your fellowship survives, you’ll have another chance to win with your shadow.<br>
<br>
Shadow: <br>
<br>
At the beginning, be content to drop your Moria conditions. Don’t worry too much about the minions. Barring the extremely rare Cave Troll with Hammer at site 2 (which I wouldn&#39;t advise anyway, when you have the Moria Stairway), you’re not going to be able to do enough damage to carry over from the first sanctuary anyway, so why try. Go ahead and play some minions, but with the express purpose of putting those minions in your discard pile for the manipulation ahead while getting new cards in your hand. That is the purpose of the first few sites. In fact, you should PLAN to have your minions double jumped on from 1 to 3. With Moria, there’s not much of a way for you to prevent it. Just be prepared to drop the hammer (no pun intended) from 4 to 6 . . . <br>
<br>
Sites 4 to 6 . . . Ah Moria! This is where the nastiness happens. Moria Stairway is an evil choice for this deck. It forces your opponent to strongly consider exerting for Archery or taking wounds to a damage +1 Scavenger with Scimitar. Yet, more importantly, there will be many situations where you manage to play a Cave Troll with Hammer or Chain at site 4. In the first case, you have a Fierce, Damage +3 minion. (I love watching people assign Aragorn or Gandalf only to find that he dies anyway.) If your opponent can survive that AND the Balrog at site 5, just reach across the table and shake his hand because he deserves to win. Meanwhile, the Chain is almost more disgusting. With this, your opponent won’t even have the option of shooting the Troll down AND the Troll will still be damage +2 and fierce. Nasty! Then at site 5, even if you have the Keyward, Troll, Hammer, and Chain in hand, play a goblin and the Balrog and use the Cave Troll value pack at site 6 or 7. This little gauntlet of nasties almost guarantees a dead companion by site 8 and 9...and it certainly guarantees a wary opposing fellowship. <br>
<br>
Now, by this time, you’ve gotten your Goblin Swarms on the table. Assigning your overflow minions is one of the keys to winning with this deck. If Arwen with Gwemegil (or without) assigns to a Goblin Runner, Aragorn assigns to the Ancient Chieftain, Boromir assigns to the Guard Commander, Frodo assigns to a Moria Scout, and you still have a Goblin Runner left over. Put that Runner on Arwen. Then you end up with 2 Runners on the swarm. Doing this, I have often ended up with 3 recurring Runners. That becomes evil. Play any goblins on the swarms at site 9. Use They Are Coming to play more Goblins. Finally, play Goblins from your hand. That’s an easy 6 to 10 minions against a fellowship of 3 or 4 at site 9. You win! <br>
<br>
So, I think you can see how this deck is nasty.  True, the Moria side isn’t that revolutionary, but it’s true strength is in the Fellowship side.  The dwarves constantly threaten your opponent, because from site 4 on, they shrug off any opposing attack making it easy to double move, and you plant that in the back of your opponent’s mind.  That makes my orcs the ants at the Moria Family picnic. I guarantee that your opponent will wish he had the Raid of the Galadhrim! <br>
<br>
Give it a try!  You’ll like it!  It’s competitive, but more than that, it’s a lot of fun!<br>
