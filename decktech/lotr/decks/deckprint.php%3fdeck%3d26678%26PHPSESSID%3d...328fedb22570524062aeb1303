HE is best since I can use my extra copies of Gandalf and Bormir to heal Frodo. Think about it, it works. I promise.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Lets start off with the basic principles of this deck. You need to do your best to kill every minion they play, with a few exceptions. To this end, you have 2 companions who will win most of their skirmishes.<br />
<br />
Eomer. most of you should know by now how good Eomer, TM is, but for those of you who don&#39;t, I&#39;ll spell it out. He is 7 strength and gets an additional strength +2 for each wound on a minion he is skirmishing. Add his spear and a mount and you have a companion who requires a pump from your opponent EVERY time they wish to win a skirmish. Very efficient. Also, he makes your skirmish events all that much more effective since his spear makes him Damage +2 while mounted, and the horse does another damage. <br />
<br />
Gandalf. nothing too new here, Gandalf is generally going to be an 8 without his sword, 10 with it. When Legolas or Gimli show up, he&#39;s even bigger. Yet another companion who requires a pump for your opponent to beat him. Since he will generally be the bearer of Brego, he hits for 3 every time he wins his fights. Highly efficient.<br />
<br />
To back up the beatsticks, we have several companions able to kick weak minion butt, but mainly they are there as Frodo protection.<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Aragorn, RotN - almost an auto-win at site 9, and insurance against the site 7 Moria kill that has started to rear it&#39;s ugly head.<br />
<br />
Legolas, G - need I say anything? makes a Gandalf a better fighter, more Moria stoppage and at worst, a pansy speedbump.<br />
<br />
Gimli, SoG - a skirmish winner, even if it IS only one time, and he&#39;s efficient enough to use Servants and Merry with, since he&#39;s naturally Damage +1.<br />
<br />
Boromir, SoD - this guy is SOOOOO good. He is KEY to winning every game. My opponents around here have learned to take him out with Enquea, which means that Eomer and Gandalf tend to be safe, which is cool. Anyway, I play 3 of him to get him out early, as he is KEY against Dunland. Keep him alive until 9 and you have a Ringbearer who will NOT die. <br />
<br />
Merry, FtS - a portable pumper that can get REAL mean when paired up with Boromir. <br />
<br />
Eowyn, LoR - ahhhhh, the lovely lady of the bunch. Eowyn is such a good card, she just makes it so much easier to run tons of companions. With her in play, feel free to play as many companions, just make sure you have some way to deal with Their Number Must Be Few! She allows me to start with Eomer, play Simplbyne and allows me to NOT play with Armor. <br />
<br />
ALLIES. I don&#39;t use many allies, but the ones I use are key.<br />
<br />
Filbert - cancel skirmishes with Nazgul, which can admittedly be a tough matchup, save Frodo at the end and all around get me out of tough sitiations.<br />
<br />
Albert - takes care of Weapons of Isengard and No Business of Ours, which is good enough, and makes up for the fact that I am only playing one Pseudo Sleep<br />
<br />
Treebeard - Sheesh! How many awesome cards can Decipher pack into one set? This guy is amazing. If he shows up early enough, it makes dumping pool on turn one easy, and he makes the double jump from 6 to 8, which I love doing, simple. Also, he tunrs my extra copies of Gandalf and Boromir into "V" Athelas for my one off companions. SOOOO good.<br />
<br />
all the other gear should be pretty self explanatory, but I mean c&#39;mon, I gotta be safe, right? Everything else in the deck is designed to get my fighters out a fighting as fast as possible, or to help my fighters win against minions they wouldn&#39;t normally be able to defeat. Betrayal of Isengard serves triple duty, helping against Isengard, Dunland and Moria all at the same time. HUGE.<br />
<br />
Against most decks, you should put out all your companions and set them up to win their fights. Your movement against most decks will be as follows:<br />
<br />
1-3<br />
<br />
3-4<br />
<br />
4-6<br />
<br />
6-8<br />
<br />
8-9<br />
<br />
BUT, this will change depending on what your opponent is doing. Don&#39;t be afraid to double time past a sanctuary, especially 3, where you can heal up to 2 of your companions. The place where things will REALLY change is against Dunland, where they will clober you of your possessions, and where Eomer is impotent. Against Dunalnd, you will most likely move 1-2 and then, as you start to get more companions out, double a good bit. With all the Frodo protection this deck runs, you&#39;ll have little to worry about, even if the control every site you both pass. <br />
<br />
SHADOW.<br />
<br />
Well, I&#39;m afraid the Shadow strategy is going to be little more than the explanation of my specific card choices, but the deck is solid, without many gimicks, it just beats the crap out of everyone.<br />
<br />
MINIONS<br />
<br />
Ugluk - he commands! ahem. Try to make sure that Ugluk has support, because otherwise he is just asking to be pimpslapped. Send him out with someone armed with a Broad Bladed Sword, and watch your opponent cry.<br />
<br />
Mauher - an efficiently costed Tracker. The fact that he can prevent Cliffs and PATHS and Ranger&#39;s Bows and such is just candy.<br />
<br />
other minons - I tried to pick guys that can win fights against everyone, but that don&#39;t cost too much. The Searchers will play havok with small fellowships, the Chasers and Runners will do well against large fellowships and the FOllowers are beefy and screw unbound Hobbits.<br />
<br />
Nertea - see my article :)<br />
<br />
Enquea - SOOO Important to winning these days. Anyone he is able to kill is worth it. Mow down Faramir, or better yet, a GOndorian Ranger, and watch a Ringbound deck fall apart.<br />
<br />
Weary - the bread and butter of any good Tracker deck, makes all you Trackers essentially Damage +1, which is <br />
Worry - the extra pain to put your deck over the edge, also loads up your opponent for the Palantir Chamber, should they outrun your Freeples.<br />
<br />
No Business - if the can&#39;t see your hand, they can&#39;t move confidently. they also can&#39;t see the Vengeance you&#39;ve been saving for Frodo.<br />
<br />
Vengeance - a wicked cool card in the right situation, but not widely useful enought to play 4, which is why I use....<br />
<br />
Broad Bladed Sword - everyone has been packing Defending the Popes, so this is the answer. Make sure that Ugluks back up makes it to the skirmish phase. Also, it&#39;s a pumper!<br />
<br />
Saruman&#39;s Power - well, this card might seem a little out of place in a deck that plays 6 conditions, but it&#39;s important. Just imagine if your opponent gets out even one copy of Fearing the Worst? Ugh, I mean c&#39;mon! Just in case, it&#39;s important.<br />
<br />
Grima - someone is going to get onto me for only playing one, but he&#39;s just not worth the card slot. If I get to bomb someone, then fine, thats awesome, and I can keep on doing it with Nertea. The opportunity just doesn&#39;t present itself enough to warrant more than one card slot.<br />
<br />
Well, I think that pretty well covers it. This deck is undefeated in three 5 game tournament and is responsible for winning me 2 Fierce Shirts and the respect of....well, somebody. If you have any questions, feel free to D-Mail me, or if you just wanna talk. I&#39;m all for it. Thanks for looking.<br />
