This is just an updated verision of my deck call WTF are you guys shooting at. <br>
<br>
Additions: <br>
<br>
First someone asked me why i call my deck &quot;WTF are you guys shooting at&quot; the reason for this is, in the movie while in moria the fellowship was shot at 100&#39;s of times without being hit once. <br>
<br>
My free people side, it used to be pool denial sam, arwen, frodo starting fellowship. Some people pointed out that my fellowship sucked :(. <br>
Allthough my fellowship didnt suck, it wasnt the best it could be, it couldnt provide me the crucial double move when needed. Allthough V1.0 of this deck never lost a game and when 8-0 in tournies, there were a few close calls against some pretty bad decks. <br>
<br>
Aragorn Heir To the White City: This card is GOOD! He is to this deck, what fingers are to a bolemic, he allows me to play all i can and not get a fat pool afterwards. Combined with Sting, and consorting with wizard you cant go wrong. <br>
<br>
Arwen, Elven Rider: Okay so i kept her, her ability sure is nifty i feel she is currently the best arwen out there, the discarding of 3 cards is very useful, she is also a ranger so she can be no strangered.<br>
<br>
Elrond, Lord of Rivendel: I was searching for hours for an inovative card drawing tech, when i gave and said &quot;ah this is good enough&quot; for only one card you cant go wrong, he is a combo unto himself.<br>
<br>
Fireworks: I can do a few neat things with this card, like get all 4 of my servants back (with the help of butterbur, or get back my oh elbereth agains a nazgul deck, its good card with many uses.<br>
<br>
Pathfinder: really no site the opponent plays is going to scare me to much, it there so i can move into my own site 8, brown lands. this site is key for my shadow deck. I can also use path finder to avoid ford of bruin, or there site 9 what ever it may be.<br>
<br>
The Weapons: Are realy self explainatory <br>
<br>
<br>
Shadow: Ive kept this pretty much the same, but did change a few things. <br>
<br>
Goblin Sneaks: I took these out for armories, i am going to see how this works, i played again to many anti pool decks<br>
<br>
Goblin Armories: I put these in the sneaks place, i found myself getting chocked and not being able to play out all my archers, not anymore. Also i i saw my 11/1 goblin marksman being shot down a whole lot, once again not anymore. <br>
<br>
Goblin Swarms: i won alot more skirmishes than i thought i would, why not add this? <br>
<br>
Moria Archer Troop: i added one, i used to have 2 but now i have more pool to work with, aslo these guys rule under my swarms. <br>
<br>
Ulaire Enquea: This was tough, it was either him or another orc overseer, i went with him. This deck adds burden better than decks ment to add burdens, people just love taking burden on frodo instead of archery wounds on someone else, haha take that! <br>
<br>
well, i hope you find this deck better than the last one, i think it is, we will see what happens. <br>
<br>
And please remember that each card in the FP side of this deck has at least 2 uses so look well befor reviewing, thank you. <br>
<br>
i would also like to thank all those who reviewed my last deck, and the dude that gave it 2 stars, he helped me the most <br>
