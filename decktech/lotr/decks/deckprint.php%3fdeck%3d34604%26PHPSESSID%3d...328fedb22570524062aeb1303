<br />
- Basic knights. Use &quot;Fortis&quot; to win skirmishes but don&#39;t waste those resources for no reason, you&#39;ll be needing them late game.<br />
<br />
- Knights can handle lots of decks going from Beasterlings to swarm decks. They should be able to deal with almost everything when they are fully build up. My shadow deck will make sure that they get their gear in time.<br />
<br />
Shadow;<br />
<br />
- Early game, you have to make sure that you get a Moving This way, nothing else matters - sweet song, Metallica rules ;-) Then cycle through your deck. Play 1 Nazgul and use Moving This Way to put the others at the bottom of your draw deck. When you get a shadow condition, play it. Maybe hold on to that 2nd Shapes Slowly Advancing but you need to play or cycle every Shadow card that you get. We basically want to get as many fellowship cards as possible.<br />
<br />
- Mid game, play some Nazgul. Use the site &quot;the Angle&quot; to draw some extra cards and use Nelya to get the site back. Play Nazgul with a healing game text so that you can stack some tokens on Winged and Ominous in regroup. You don&#39;t really have to worry about Shapes Slowly Advancing at this point. Stopping the opponent is more important. Don&#39;t let him move from 3-5 and from 5-7. <br />
<br />
- Late game, you do it all. Hopefully all free peeps cards will be played by then. Use &quot;the Angle&quot; to draw more cards as you play Nazgul - you will only get other Nazgul minions that you put at the bottom yourself. Moving This Way will now allow you to get any Nazgul in your draw deck. Winged and Ominous and Black Rider will provide more twilight. Try to get as many Nazgul out as possible. In regroup, use both Spied from Above and Shapes Slowly Advancing. Left over exertions go to Winged and Ominous. <br />
<br />
- Important sites would be the 3 Nazgul sites: get a Nazgul for 1 burden, play a Nazgul to discard a condition - Noble Leaders anyone? - and the Angel to draw cards. Ofcourse, the Trollshaw Forrest will be here as well and a few others.<br />
