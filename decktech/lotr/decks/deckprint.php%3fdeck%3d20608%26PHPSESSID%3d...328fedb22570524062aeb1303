<br />
First I want to mention that because there is such a small fellowship, it&#39;s important to get Aragorn out. That means either going first, or making sure your opponent plays Prancing Pony. I wouldn&#39;t bid more than 4 at the most (Nazgul do bad things after one or two more burdens, it makes corrupting Frodo easier for Sauron players, etc). In my area, I can get away with bidding 0, simply because about 90% of the players start Prancing Pony. That said, the main object of the deck is to kill Frodo. To accomplish this, you use Saruman&#39;s Reach to get your opponent to put on the One Ring. Most would choose to put on the ring instead of exert 2 companions, especially after taking a few wounds in skirmishes. With the ring in place and making sure you have a Nazgul in play, you use Return To Its Master to assign the ring-bearer to skirmish that Nazgul. Naturally, it&#39;s more easily accomplished after site 5, when those pesky Hobbit stealth events no longer cancel skirmishes. One of the biggest deterrents to this strategy is heavy directed archery a la Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Legolas, Greenleaf, which is why I included the Spies Of Saruman. The other thing to worry about is Power According to His Stature after the opponent has played A Ranger&#39;s Versatility. Fortunately, the Free Peoples half of the deck is designed as a sort of backup plan, with support cards making it fairly easy to run all the way to site 9 if you need to.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, I&#39;m going to go over some card choices:<br />
	<br />
	Trollshaw Forest - it doesn&#39;t hurt me, but it could help me (play Glamdring or Ranger&#39;s Sword 	here, get a card back).<br />
<br />
	Balin&#39;s Tomb - also doesn&#39;t hurt me. Seemed like the best site 4 to use.<br />
<br />
	Aragorn, ROTN - I can make him Defender +1. Works good with Swordarm of the White 	Tower.<br />
<br />
	Power According to His Stature - swarm decks suck. Sure, Arargorn can take on two minions, 	but that still leaves Frodo open to one or two. This helps lessen the pain.<br />
<br />
	Intimidate - don&#39;t laugh. Preventing wounds is a good thing. Gandalf got hit with 4 Hates in a 	row once. I decided that Intimidate was a must.<br />
<br />
	Sleep, Caradhras - Sauron Orc decks are seeing more play around here. That means seeing 	Desperate Defense of the Ring, Thin and Stretched, and Orc Bowmen. <br />
<br />
	Glamdring - Orc decks are seeing more play around here. Not that Glamdring isn&#39;t good anyway, 	but if I need to run to site 9 this helps quite a bit.<br />
<br />
	Lurtz - he&#39;s big, he&#39;s exertable, and he&#39;s an archer. <br />
<br />
	Orthanc Assassin - see Lurtz.<br />
<br />
	Spies of Saruman - I don&#39;t think this really needs explaination. People love big elven archery, and 	with good reason. It hurts this deck.<br />
<br />
	Saruman&#39;s Reach - in case you didn&#39;t read the main part of the strategy, it&#39;s in here to coax the 	opponent to put on the Ring.<br />
<br />
	Return To Its Master - use this to make a Nazgul jump Frodo after using Saruman&#39;s Reach.<br />
<br />
The biggest change I&#39;d like to make to this deck is find room for Valiant Man of the West x3. Sure, I could exert Aragorn to get essentially the same result, but this saves me an exertion and ensures I&#39;ll only take one wound (which can be prevented by Intimidate). If you have any suggestions on how I can fit in those cards, I&#39;m all ears. So that&#39;s about it. I&#39;d appreciate constructive criticism.<br />
