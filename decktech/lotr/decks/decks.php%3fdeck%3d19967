It is 10-0 in sanctioned tournament play and 9-0 in pick up or playtesting games. I will first talk about some of the card choices, then go on to the strategy of the free peoples and shadow parts of the deck, and finally on to the key match ups.<br>
<br>
CARD CHOICES<br>
<br>
East Road-Punish my opponent early if he gives me too much twilight because all his companions are twilight cost +2, I have won one game at site 2.<br>
<br>
Midgewater Moors-Moria minions are cheap, so if my opponent gives me all that twilight early, I&#8217;ll make him discard a card from hand for each minion I play here.<br>
<br>
Council Courtyard-Allows me to play any companion with a twilight of 2 virtually for free, I play Arwen for 2, then move, and remove the 2. Helps me a lot, doesn&#8217;t help my opponent a lot as I don&#8217;t need a lot of twilight from site 4 on as all my little orcs are cheap and even the Troll can get pretty cheap at the mine as it is underground.<br>
<br>
Mithril Mine-Underground so if I have a Troll in my hand, I can hit my opponent early and devastate his fellowship. Also allows me to play any scimitars or even the Troll&#8217;s Hammer if I have discarded it from my discard pile for 1. If I have Goblin Armory out, all the scimitars become virtually free to play from my discard pile.<br>
<br>
The Bridge Of Khazad-Dum-Do I have a choice?<br>
<br>
Dimrill Dale-My first orc played there is &#8211;2. Great with Moria Scout if they still have an elf, play for free and add 2 to the pool. Kill a companion with many wounds here before he can get the chance to heal.<br>
<br>
Anduin Wilderland-Cancels the archery phase so my little orcs don&#8217;t get ravaged by a large amount of archery. Though they seem to get through archery fine.<br>
<br>
Shores Of Nen Hithoel-A shadow number of 9! Also, if I get 5 orcs out, I can keep them from moving to site 9 so I get a turn to prepare for the final crush if they are still in the game.<br>
<br>
Summit Of Amon Hen-After Frodo fights those backstabbers and accumulates some burdens, I draw a bunch of cards and make sure I get to do what I want at the final site if my opponent is still alive.<br>
<br>
Frodo, Old Bilbo&#8217;s Heir-I have yet to see someone use the common Frodo&#8217;s ability, Frodo can take the most wounds of anyone in the game, why would you exert a companion that can&#8217;t take as many wounds to heal him? Also works very well with Bounder, Bounder will be fresh and ready to save Frodo every single turn.<br>
<br>
The One Ring, The Ruling Ring-If you do the math, the common ring allows Frodo to take 12 wounds, the rare ring allows him to take 8 wounds. That is a bad ratio, true, the rare ring can take it any time and adds an extra vitality, but I haven&#8217;t been in any situation where Frodo has taken a wound outside of skirmishing where it would have killed him, and taking 2 burdens for a wound is not nearly worth it.<br>
<br>
Aragorn, King In Exile-This Aragorn works much better in this deck as the rare Boromir and Arwen have the Aragorn signet, so he can heal either one. Also, all three of these are rangers, so they can all have No Stranger To The Shadows on them to subtract 3 from each site&#8217;s shadow number.<br>
<br>
Legolas, Greenleaf-Yes, he adds one more to the pool, is not a ranger nor has the Aragorn signet, but his game text is too much to pass up. If you can get Legolas out and Aragorn&#8217;s bow, you can ping up to 5 times, that kills any huge minion.<br>
<br>
Bounder-Should be in any deck. He always comes in handy and will save Frodo from being overwhelmed numerous times. Rare Frodo can also heal him every turn, for use every turn.<br>
<br>
Power According To His Stature-In my opinion, this is the most useful card in the entire game. It literally will save Frodo numerous amounts of time, especially against a Moria swarm as majority of the orcs have a vitality of one, sure, if 5 of these gang up on Frodo, I&#8217;ll add a burden to kill them all.<br>
<br>
Athelas-Great card, especially against those pesky Ringwraith and Sauron conditions. Also, if you still have all 5 of your companions and you are at site 7, you can heal all the wounds taken getting to site 7, as the last site was a sanctuary, and then run to site 9 knowing Frodo will probably get through it alive.<br>
<br>
The Seen And The Unseen-Great card, to exert 2 elves is definitely worth getting rid of conditions like Goblin Swarms, Goblin Armory, or those Ringwraith and Sauron conditions that plague your fellowship.<br>
<br>
Cave Troll Of Moria-Yes, I play 4 of the Cave Troll, why you ask? Because with the amount of twilight you add with this deck, he will be able to be played at sites 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and even site 6 if you have the right hand for it. The Cave Troll can do massive damage to a fellowship once, imagine what he can do if he hits the table 4 times! Also, with his hammer, he almost will kill 2 companions all the time. He becomes a strength 18, damage +2, and fierce!<br>
<br>
Goblin Armory-Really aids the shadow part of the deck in doing what it is supposed to do. If you get 3 of these out, every time you play a scimitar, you add 3 to the twilight pool, draw a card, and give an orc 2 extra strength. That is just too good. Also, you can discard it from play anytime to prevent a wound to an orc. Great against archery when you are going to kill 2 companions and you want to keep enough minions on table to do that. Also great against Power According To His Stature, helps keep the vitality orcs on Frodo to overwhelm him.<br>
<br>
STRATEGY<br>
<br>
The Free Peoples side is fully defensive. It is meant primarily to keep Frodo alive long enough for your shadow side to do its thing and wipe out your opponent. Most times you want to go second so your opponent runs into the heavy sites before you do and gets ripped apart by your shadow before he gets the chance to. You just move one site at a time so Aragorn can heal a wound a turn and then the sanctuaries take care of the rest. The only times I ever move second are maybe from site 1 to site 3, but only if you drew at least 2 of the other companions, and from site 7 to site 9. You do that only if you still have all 5 companions, have Athelas to heal any wounds you took from the skirmishing at site 7. The you have a fresh fellowship, move to site 8, archer by exertion, then move to site 9, use Valiant Man Of The West if your opponent has enough to gang on Frodo, and let your entire fellowship die so Frodo lives and you win. But I&#8217;ve only done this twice because all the other times I had already killed my opponent&#8217;s Frodo. I always start Aragorn even if my opponent starts the Prancing Pony. I don&#8217;t know why, but it always works out fine as I am playing 3 copies of each of the other companions and you don&#8217;t need any extra companions at the first 3 sites. That is basically all you do with the Free Peoples part of the deck, survive.<br>
<br>
The Shadow part of the deck is fully offensive. It continuously applies pressure to his fellowship because of all the damage it deals out. This deck can easily overwhelm any companion because you play so many orcs and the Troll just dishes the damage to them. With all of your ganging up abilities, the Backstabbers turn into these nice little damage +2 guys that kill any vitality 3 companion without having to overwhelm them. Also, all your little orcs that gang up go to Goblin Swarms after they&#8217;ve done their damage just to be used again next turn, and the turn after, and the turn after. The Troll when he gets his hammer can easily overwhelm companions. Or if not, he is just a strength 18, damage +2, and fierce. He will be giving out 6 wounds unless they&#8217;ve got something that prevents wounds or limits the wounds to only 1. Either way, he is ripping your opponent&#8217;s fellowship apart. Between sites 4 and 5, you should kill 1 or more companions. Then when he moves to site 6, you should kill one that is heavily damaged. From then on, it is basically just the Troll and his buddies against their little Frodo. That is what the shadow side does and that is how it works, it is pretty easy to do, just hard to get the cards to do.<br>
<br>
MATCH UPS<br>
<br>
Vs. Gandalf<br>
A lot of people think Gandalf is the way to go against Moria. I personally think he doesn&#8217;t stop them in any way. Against a Gandalf deck, you just gang up on Gandalf, kill him, and their deck is dead as majority of all the cards in it are useless after he is dead. Also, Gandalf decks give way too much twilight anyway, he is just asking for a Troll to hit him every turn. Sure Servant Of The Secret Fire can make the Troll small, but if he uses enough to do that, he wastes them all on one minion, what about the other 5 that are ganging up on people? It is easy enough to do, kill Gandalf, then you will win the game. Sleep, Caradhras also can get rid of your conditions like Goblin Armory and Goblin Swarms. If your opponent is playing Gandalf, play one swarms, wait until he cancels it, then play another and so on. He is also getting rid of his own Free Peoples conditions by playing it. That is how you combat the Gandalf decks out there.<br>
<br>
Vs. Archer Madness<br>
I&#8217;ve gone up against a deck that plays all the archer allies, a ton of Elven Bows, 4 Double Shots, and Splendor Of Their Banners 4 times, and my record against it is 4-0. You go for a one turn beat on the archer companions and prevent as much of the archery as you can with the Goblin Armories. You gang up on the archer companions and take them out. Believe me, if played right, you kill everything but Frodo in one turn. From then on, their archer stuff won&#8217;t help that much as you need an archer out to use majority of it. That is the key against these decks.<br>
<br>
Vs. Aragorn<br>
The Aragorn decks that depend all upon Aragorn to take on a bunch of stuff and keep the twilight low won&#8217;t help against the Moria Swarm. These types of decks don&#8217;t play too many other companions. So once you get rid of Aragorn, it will just be Frodo and the game will be yours. It is easy enough to do this. With Goblin Swarms you should be able to do it by site 5 easily. That is how you beat the Aragorn decks.<br>
<br>
Vs. Another Moria Swarm<br>
Try as hard as you can to go second. You can bid as high as 5 because Moria most likely will not corrupt Frodo. Pound their fellowship hard with the Cave Trolls. Archer their high strength low vitality orcs so they don&#8217;t get anything on Swarms. If they do get some orcs on to Goblin Swarms, cancel it with The Seen And The Unseen. The card that will keep Frodo alive against Moria will be Power According To His Stature. Pair all the high vitality minions up with your other companions, then let Frodo get ganged up on by the vitality 1 minions, then go ahead, play it, add a burden, and kill all of the minions off. That is how you take on another Moria swarm.<br>
<br>
Vs. Ringwraith<br>
This match up is quite easy. The 3 No Stranger To The Shadows to keep the twilight pool low, so low that they can usually play no more than 2 Nazgul a turn. The Nazgul don&#8217;t do a lot of damage because they are not damage +1. Sure they are fierce, but they aren&#8217;t strong enough to overwhelm either. Arwen goes and takes 2 wounds, fighting twice. Aragorn heals one wound. The next turn, you throw Boromir up, take a wound, then Arwen, take a wound. The next turn, Aragorn heals Arwen, you put her up, take a wound, then you put Boromir up, take a wound, That is 3 turns and they don&#8217;t kill anyone. Against a deck you know is Nazgul, you don&#8217;t bid anything. They will never get enough burdens on you to make the swords damage +1 or use Dark Whispers. Until the Nazgul do more damage, they aren&#8217;t going to be overwhelming or killing anyone. I am 3-0 against Ringwraith decks.<br>
<br>
Vs. Uruk-Hai<br>
This is probably the toughest match up. I haven&#8217;t lost to it yet. Once again, go second. Keep the pressure on their fellowship so they have to discard Shadow cards to try get Free Peoples cards to keep their Fellowship alive. The heavy damage can hurt, but Valiant Man Of The West keeps Aragorn to taking only 1 wound. Athelas helps keep the wounds off for that extra turn you need to take out your opponent. The archery will also help as Uruk-Hai have low vitality, which if not kill them, will keep them from exerting to use all those cards that require them to exert. Power According To His Stature can also help if you&#8217;ve got 2 in your hand, they can kill the vitality 2 Uruk-Hai, which majority of them are. That is the best way, kill their fellowship before they kill yours, but it can be done, I&#8217;ve done it in 4 games so far.<br>
<br>
Well, that is it, this is the longest thing I&#8217;ve ever typed and if you read the entire thing, congrats, if I had an extra of this deck I&#8217;d give it to you, but I don&#8217;t. Again, this deck is 19-0 and I have a feeling that that number will increase greatly. <br>
<br>
Thank you for reading, and if you build this deck, have fun, though your opponent probably won&#8217;t. ;)<br>
