<br />
my fellowship is about as powerful as i can make it.  i recently took out Gandalf because centering a deck on him was too difficult when i didn&#39;t start him; i couldn&#39;t reliably draw him early enough.  with this deck, i usually get the Prancing Pony to help get Aragorn out early.  or if i don&#39;t, most of the man stuff works on Arwen since she&#39;s a ranger.  and yes, despite Beyond Height of Men and Whip of Many Thongs, i still use Armor.  Armor is a fellowship saver, and it should always go in man decks.  ARV is the same way, its just too powerful to pass up.  i use archery because it makes sense to take out minions before they get close enough to do any damage, plus Dismay our Enemies is just awesome.  i came within a hairsbreath of making my opponent choose between discarding the Balrog or the Cave Troll with that card, before either one of them had fought in a skirmish...but it was not to be.  anyway, if i had a Aragorn&#39;s Bow or Blade of Gondor, you&#39;d see them in this deck.  or Last Alliance, rare merry, etc.  this is just what i have.  Elrond is in because i have to draw cards and secret sentinels is the best way to discard conditions without using gandalf.  Sam is in because its just plain stupid to play a deck without him.<br />
<br />
my shadow side is the product of long and exhaustive practice with Nazgul.  as soon as i get more MoM cards, its gonna change in a big way.  right now, the point of the Shadow side is to surprise kill some companions.  that&#39;s why i&#39;ve got 5xstrength bonus events.  they clean out your hand pretty fast, and they are quite useful for springing on an opponent who finally figured out how he can barely scclober past the witchking without taking a wound.  Nine Servants is in to combat burden-removal Sam and superMerry.  i wish i had more morgul gates to stock this deck with, because twilight is and always will be the worst part of playing nazgul.  if your opponent doesn&#39;t give you enough, you can&#39;t do anything...i used to play with as many nazgul as i could, until i realized that every turn i was staring at 5 nazgul, trying to pick 2 to play.<br />
<br />
anyway, that&#39;s about all i&#39;ve got to say for this deck.  its always a work in progress, never quite complete and certainly not the best around.  thanks for looking, thanks for suggesting ways to make it better.<br />
