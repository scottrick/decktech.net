It depend of your opponent, you can choose to bid between 3-5 (you can remove 2 with ringbound). It&#39;s not the best fellow to set a big moria hand but it can run to 9 most of the time. (because usually I&#39;am unable to stop trust deck with my moria, but with the new grima ....)<br />
I am not afffect by grima + my objectif is to rely on 3 bigs fighters, I usualy play Boromir with horn + sword-- Aragorn with sword + last alliance -- faramir with sword +  alliance + flaming brand<br />
<br />
Faramir + Last alliance = death to anything with 9 of power or less <br />
<br />
Ithilien trap is good vs saruman, grima, tower assassin, enquea ....<br />
<br />
vs Uruk Try to have a fool creation + little pool when you move to 5. <br />
--orophin + celeborn + galadriel is awesome <br />
suicide merry early to have a 4 guy (savegery)<br />
<br />
Vs Nazgul euh Faramir + 2x flaming brand + last alliance = 16 of power and cantea can destroy his weapon <br />
Keep filibert for the end, use fool creation because they will play grima<br />
Try to keep merry alive because he will be useful to win vs Witch king + pale blade <br />
<br />
Vs Moria use   secret sentinel (too good ) sting his and horn sould win you the game but vs Such a Little Thing.... I really don&#39;t know yes, destroy your possession but ... Maybe I will play 2x thor&#39;s map to protect my boro if it become too popular<br />
O elgebeth is the card because he can use nertea or enquea at the end !!!! (better is you get fili)<br />
Vs Easterling don&#39;t know never play vs good one .  my past experience was = just move <br />
<br />
Vs dunland = that could be tough because he destroy early your possession.  Use legolas wisely <br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
Moria is Moria = site 7 kill <br />
I think the fear of the new grima will change the deck, I don&#39;t know if I need to play him.<br />
Dark Place is there because I need the site 7 even if my fellow is ahead.  But you can remove it and add thor&#39;s Map to the fellow (with maybe pippin or a bounder )<br />
I hesitate a lot between SaLT and the isengard orc ... it depend of your meta But I espect boromir to be more played with grima + Isengard orc trigger fool creation ....<br />
<br />
Yes I know 3x cave troll is very much but presently I play a lot vs my friend and an early cave troll is the best think i could draw.  he is good early in the game, but when opponent get aragorn + armor ....<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I try this version of the deck but I played a lot with variation, the shadow kill most of the deck that don&#39;t have condition removal, but he have difficulty vs Trust me (bow if galandhrim , gimli&#39;s Axe, albert, GST....) The Fellowship is slow at the start but he can double at the hand when you are set. If you expect a lot of Uruk and saruman play 1x Betrayal of isengard vs Bill or another Foul creation. <br />
<br />
Seriously the deck is good<br />
<br />
Give your opinion please <br />
