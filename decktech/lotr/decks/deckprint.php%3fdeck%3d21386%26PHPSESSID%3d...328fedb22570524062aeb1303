Top Cards: 125-150 words: <br />
<br><br />
Fellowship:<br />
<br><br />
Sleep, Caradhras is a must for nasty Conditions, and Dreary is very useful against snows and spies, and can be pulled with your Wizard Is Never Late, once Gandalf is out. The Spells help you to mow through minions, and win as many fights as you lose. The Fellowship is set up to be Aragorn (or Boromir if need be), Gimli, Legolas, Frodo and power 10 Gandalf. Arm you companions, and you have serious fighting power.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Shadow:<br />
<br><br />
The minions are somewhat standard for Nazgul, only using the 6 fierce Nazgul. The events are what make the deck, however. With Versatility and Archery running rampant in todays environment, All Blades Perish is essential for keeping your Nazgul alive (and also a great surprise against PATHS), and Relentless Charge is powerful direct damage. The weapons are standard, and the conditions are there to put some added pressure on key mains. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
How It Beats You- 300 words:<br />
<br><br />
This deck always bids 0, yet thanks to the threat of Nazgul, nearly always wins by getting to site 9. You opponent will almost always stop at site 2, giving you an easy chance to pass them, and quite often you still get the benefit of the Fords via Nelya or Thror&#39;s Map. From site 3 on, it should be easy to get to site 6 on turn 3, and site 9 on turn 5, while stopping your opponent at least once to ensure you&#39;re leading the race. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
It&#39;s easy to move again on dead minions, and it&#39;s easy to kill them with Archery, Gandalf and Aragorn backed by a couple spells. Against Moria Swarm, if they make it through the Archery phase, Aragorn can be defender +3 and take it as a last resort, then you can Sleep away all the nasty conditions. Against Nazgul it&#39;s ok to lose a couple fights early game, as most of it can be healed. Once you get past site 6, Versatility can buy you a free move or 2, and it doesn&#39;t matter if everyone dies at site 9 as long as the Halfling survives. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
This deck has worked quite well for me in playtesting, and is undefeated in the past 3 tournaments. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do. <br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br><br />
Number 1 Card: 25-50 words<br />
<br><br />
Everyone knows the power of big mains like Gandalf and the Witch King, but I think possibly the MOST important card in the deck is All Blades Perish. IMHO, LotR has no better surprise card than this one. Very useful against archery once your Nazgul have been exhausted via Versatility, and even better when your Witch King overwhelms the Ring-bearer who was counting on the PATHS.<br />
<br><br />
<br />
<br>Response to reviews: A couple of you mentioned more Barliman Butterburs, and I have in fact considered adding more several times. However, in my area a lot of people play the Nazgul event called Power In Their Terror (or something like that) that wounds every ally. This renders Butterbur useless, because he&#39;s always exhausted, and that one wound drops him into the dead pile. Also, the Intimidate is quite useful in blocking a well timed Hate, or an unexpected Lurtz&#39; Battle Cry or something like that.<br />
<BR>Enjoy!<br />
