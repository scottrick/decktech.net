Any suggestions how to better this would be most appreciated.  I&#39;ve playtested against most shadow cultures, except for Moria(but I think swapping a Horse of Rohan for Firefoot would work...)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I recently played this in a local tournamnet and went 4-0  The culture that gave me a run for my money was Raiders with Mumaks, but I needn&#39;t worry...my shadow went for the kill at site 6 :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I find that as long as I win skirmishes, this deck does quite well holding its own.  Eomer managed to kick the Witch King&#39;s butt quite nicely tho :)<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Ok, enough rambling, onto the strategy....<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Why Courteous Halfling?  Well, I&#39;ve been burned by shadow discard one too many times, and this is a surefire way to stop that!<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I want to go first, so I bid 3-4,  and pull Aragorn.  If I&#39;m denied the winning bid, then I will adjust my start to Aragorn and Frodo, and hopefully pull a Rohan companion quickly!  The one game I played where I lost the bid and had to start Aragorn I managed to get my Rohans out by site 3, what luck!  Burden removal is definately a weakness of this deck, so if I bid high to start first, I&#39;d better run!  And this deck can. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Might of Numenor is a great card, as it allows me to heal those exertions I just used, esp if I want to double move.  Boromir is a gift! Nuf said. I do have to be careful tho not to flood the pool too much.  I decided to put in the Great Shields as opposed to armor, as there is too much shadow archery in my area (although they can easily be swapped out for armor as well if needed).  If I&#39;m not facing an archery shadow, then I pitch the shields for the Fell Beasts.  That&#39;s why I feel this deck works harmoniously between the fellowship and shadow.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
The nice thing about this fellowship is that everything can be played on anyone most anytime (within reason of course.) With 3 swords Aragorn gets set up pretty quickly after the Golden Hall. Eomer and Aragorn are the main fighters, and with those extra Gondor men, they serve well for Help In Doubt and Need for Eomer in those fierce battles until he&#39;s tanked up. I like to put Eomer into the fierce battles when the minions already have wounds on them...(Gondor men win, or at least wound but don&#39;t usually kill against the biggies, so maybe switching to the original Ranger&#39;s Sword is a consideration.) <br />
<br />
I realize that without a surefire way to get Eomer tanked up, I can&#39;t rely on him to win skirmishes...but between 2 aHiDaN and 2 horses I find that getting those cards out is pretty consistent, thus helping Eomer to win skirmishes.  Symbelmyne would be a good thing, but I&#39;m not sure how to incorporate it into the deck...it&#39;s pretty good as it is without changing too much of the dynamic of it. This deck used to be 80 cards, but it just wasn&#39;t flowing like it does now, so I think the size is really important. There are times I don&#39;t have Eomer all suited up, so in those cases I rely on my Gondor men, and use the Rohan for AHiDaN  That&#39;s why I only use a splash of Rohan, not solely dependent on them. They are there to make up for what might be lacking.  Besides, Eomer TMOR is just way too good not to have in a deck! :) As for hand clog (well, maybe &#39;cept shadow, but I&#39;ll talk about that later) it&#39;s not usually a problem. Like I mentioned, most everything is immediately useable.<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
I have to admit, I&#39;m getting quite fond of those fortifications, although its too bad they have to be discarded after I kill a minion. I don&#39;t use Knights, so that scraps that idea.  I just deal with it and keep track of how many I&#39;ve used.  I decided to add the Dagger Strikes in lieu of more Men of Numenor or Swordsman cards. Thanks to all who commented on how huge Dagger Strikes were (not that they never were GOOD, just forgotten.)  They have been KEY to many of my skirmishes!<br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Now for the shadow.  Hmmm, let&#39;s see....Nazgul.  Any questions?  They do quite nicely without much help.  Those Threshold of Shadows have come in handy, but not sure if it warrants swapping a contdition or two for more of them.  I HATE HATE HATE hobbits that discard themselves, so maybe another Nine Servants should go in?  I find that the 2 Fell Beasts work well, as they or any card I discarded can be shuffled back in with the Skulkers.  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Overall unless I am seriously choked (ahem, No Strangers or Aragorn HTTWC..oh wait, this is a STANDARD deck)I can cycle thru pretty well.  Again, Fell Beasts come in handy for that.  I feel that having 2 versions of Toldea work well.  Again, if I find that one works better than the other in a particular situation, I can choose which I want to shuffle back in.  Same with the Witch King.  Enquea is for crowd control, and Nelya is there for those who like to bid high (hehe punish them for outbidding me.)  With 4 Blade Tips in the deck, Otsea works well. <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
Otherwise I think everything else is self-explanatory. I don&#39;t seem to have a problem with archery, or direct damage (yet).  The real problems start if I&#39;m getting choked, in that case I depend on my fellowship to run.  With many thanks and help of a friend I feel that we pretty much balanced this deck out.  <br />
<br /><br />
<br />
<br /><br />
So, I guess that about wraps it up.  Again, comments, suggestions, etc are helpful. Thanks for reading!   </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000"> </Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech <BR> For the Players, By the Players  <BR>www.decktech.net </FONT></TD></TR></table>
