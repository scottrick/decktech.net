<br />
This is a fun deck to play while still being amazingly effective at winning.  The combination of Gandalf, aimed archery and Strength of Spirit make this deck a real powerhouse.  The moria minions make it easy to cycle through to get the cards you need while helping you in slowing down your opponent.<br />
<br />
Top Cards: <br />
<br />
 A great card that the fellowship has going for it right now it A Ranger&#39;s Versatility.  This is the only card that the Fellowship has that can do wounds during the Maneuver phase.  Need to kill 2 Nazgul at the Fjord?  Want to not worry about being Hated this turn by Sauron?  This card can do it for you.  All you need is a Ranger (which you get at the beginning via Prancing Pony) and a forrest or river (of which there are 5 on the adventure path).  This card is really good and makes the decks run capability much more effective.<br />
<br />
Another good card that is used in this deck but not in many others is Threat of the Unknown.  This Moria card allows you to draw an extra 2 cards by exerting one of your Moria Orcs.  This may not look that great, but when you play it and also play 3 Goblin Scimitars (which let you draw a card) that gives you an extra 5 cards to use to beat down your opponent with.  And even if you&#39;ve drawn Fellowship cards you can pitch them to the They Are Coming to play even more guys from your discard pile.  <br />
<br />
How It Beats You: <br />
<br />
The play of this deck is virtually the same against any deck.  Bid high.  I&#39;ve bid up to as many as 9 before.  The reason you can bid so many is because you start with Sam, Son of Hamfest.  He will let you get rid of burdens to go and get Aragorn safely.  Generally you won&#39;t need to bid that high, but having the option you can.  Usually the bid will be about 5 - 7 depending on what you think your opponents deck will be.  You can have removed up to 9 burdens by site 3 if you use Aragorns text to heal Sam plus an Atleas or two, or you can let Frodo die and have Sam bear the ring.  Sam can exert to remove burdens from himself too so he can be quite good at being the ringbearer himself.  <br />
<br />
Fellowship is centered around Gandalf.  With Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Legolas, Greenleaf you are able to direct archery at almost every site.  This comes in especially handy when used with A Ranger&#39;s Versatility.  3 Barlamir Buttermirs work well in this type of deck as they allow you to retrieve any Gandalf card you may need/want for your next site.  Its like haveing 3 extra of whatever Gandalf event you want in the deck.  Aragorn can heal Boromir every turn and so you let Boromir have the armor and all of the big minions too.<br />
<br />
The Moria minions in this deck are standard.  They help you to cycle through your deck with cards like They Are Coming, Goblin Scimitar and Threat of the Unknown, while still being able to effectively handle your opponent.  There are 3 Cave Trolls, 2 Troll Kewards and a Goblin Patrol Troop.  These minions are big by themselves and usually they prevent your opponent from moving more than once a turn.  <br />
<br />
The Nazgul were added in to deal with one of the decks biggest weaknesses: Large Fellowships.  There are 2 Ulaire Enquea and a Ulaire Nertea.  These are both excellent at dealing with larger fellowships.  Enquea has the text that lets him exert to wound while you can spot 6 companions or 5 burdens.  This is great for taking down exhausted companions in a large fellowship.  Nertea is good because he lets you play minions from your discard pile.  Since he isn&#39;t specific about a minion type, you can play anything from any of the minion races (eg Cave Troll, Goblin Runner, Ulaire Enquea).  This guy is great against large fellowships.<br />
<br />
Number 1 Card: <br />
<br />
The biggest assest to this deck is Strength of Spirit.  When it is used in conjunction with Legolas Greenleaf, Aragorn&#39;s bow and A Ranger&#39;s Versatility makes it easy to eliminate large minions safely.  For some reason when I have looked at a lot of decks that use Gandalf, they don&#39;t include this card for some reason.  In my opinion it is possibly one of the most versatile cards there is for the Gandalf race. Use it to heal Frodo by preventing and exertion to Gandalf.  Use Sting/Glamdring and place no wound.  The uses are numerous with this card and that makes it number 1 to me.<br />
