I don&#39;t think that Gandalf and Sleep would be a good idea since I have qutie a few conditions that I rely on playing. So that let me with Secret Sentinels. I thought about putting in the usual 1-Galadriel, 1-Rumil, and 1-Orophin, but I think that playing Elrond would be better since he has a 4 vitality and he will let me draw cards if I need to. I took out the Athelases for the Secret Sentinels since they were in ther primarily for removing Shadow conditions from my Companions. I went down to only four copies of the stealth cards, because I hate having a handful of them and canceling a skirmish is nice, but if I want to double move the minion is still out there. I don&#39;t know which one of the two will work out better, so I put in two of each until I decide. I also added the Shield of Boromir to help out against archer decks. I did try out the rare Merry and I liked the common better for two reasons. One he is a str. 7 with a sword on him and is less likely to be overwhelmed and he heals at the start of the turn from Aragorn. Also with only four companions Merry was often skirmishing which meant I couldn&#39;t use his ability. I added two A Talent for Not Being Seen to help with more twilight reduction. <br>
With the Shadow I dropped two Lurtz&#39;s Battle Cry and one Saruman&#39;s Ambition to add in two Saruman&#39;s Power and two Beyond the Height of Men. These will help me get rid of two cards that screw up my shadow. Armor and Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Most people said I should add in one more Troop of Uruk-hai which I did and I dropped one Uruk Warrior. <br>
The last thing I am concerned about is the sites I have chosen. I picked Eymn Muil for those times that the opponent get ahead of me and having fierce Uruks and site 9 is nice. The others I am pretty sure of keeping though. <br>
Well let me know what I can do to improve it or if I made any bad choices. Thanks! <br>
