All Nazgul are Fellowship versions.    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is basically the deck I played at the Seattle DPC, designed to beat small compact fellowships and uruk-hai.  probably should have concentrated more on moria, because i ended up going 3-2 in the master series tournament.<br />
<br />
bid 0 or 1, depending on your area.  if you get to choose, go second so you get your own sites.  if your opponent goes second, remember he&#39;ll be playing nazgul so you need to get aragorn out (gimli and legolas obviously can&#39;t handle any nazgul at all).  take a mulligan if you don&#39;t get a good nazgul hand, because you will need it to slow your opponent.  in fact, with the new mulligan rule i&#39;m thinking about switching weatherhills to ettenmoors so i can hold off and trick my opponent into doublemoving if he/she didn&#39;t sting.  anyway, pathfinder is best used for site 3, 4 against uruks, 6 against moria, 7 against filibert, and 9 against sauron trackers/isengard orcs (watch them cry).  there&#39;s only one, but it is extremely useful against just about any deck.<br />
<br />
i&#39;ll start with the Shadow side.  i&#39;ve played nazgul forever, and I was starting to get disillusioned the night before the master series, until some guy (can&#39;t remember his name) suggested black breath/blade tip as the only way to kill aragorn w/2 brands and last alliance, using morgul blade to get them on him.  so i reworked my existing nazgul side a bit to take advantage of that, running 4 tookkings and 2 pale blades to work over the Trust Me decks that were seeing popularity.  the Wreathed in Shadow x2 is to protect against archery-happy decks, and it usually works rather well.  don&#39;t try to rate me down for using 4 witchkings saying they&#39;ll clog my hand b/c they rarely do.  i actually have more problems with getting both pale blades in my hand, but that&#39;s just because i have horrible luck.<br />
<br />
For the fellowship, i noticed that the worst place to be attacked was usually the bridge, so i threw in gimli DOTMR to help me get past that part of the game.  this way, i regularly give moria players 3-5 twilight at site 4, and everybody gets just 8 at the brigde.  combine that with Song of Durin action to discard armories, tac, and swarms, and moria players have a tough time getting the balrog out.  from there on, its a race, with my nazgul usually slowing the opponent down because they can do serious damage.<br />
<br />
like i said, this deck is strong against uruks and not so strong against moria.  so basically its a meta choice based on your area.  the last tournament i went to in wenatchee, the top 4 decks were moria and this deck came in 5th.  so that says something about it...i knocked all the uruk players on their ass, but couldn&#39;t beat the top two players (i did actually beat #4 but it was early on so his weak schedule let him win more games while i was playing the other undefeateds).<br />
<br />
best way to win: face saruman and an uruk at site 8, then doublemove into site 9 with 2xbanner of the white tree in hand.  opponent plays 4 uruks, 2 of them go to aragorn who is not overwhelmed thanks to banner + armor, boromir and legolas take their share, and the fierce ones get helped out by filibert.  a beautiful thing, and actually happened in a game to me.  opponent kept saying &quot;one more uruk!&quot; until i pointed out that i could have put another one on aragorn, and then his second one could have gone on frodo and i would have put on the ring to avoid screwing myself out of using filibert...after that he shut up.<br />
