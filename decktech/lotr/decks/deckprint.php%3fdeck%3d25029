    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This deck is made so that the opposing fellowship won’t be able to double move without having some nasty minions following them.  With this deck, I bid 1 or 2.  If you win the bid, you might as well choose to go first so you can get Aragorn.  From this point on, you probably won’t ever need to double move, but feel free to do so if you have the cards to do it.  If you end up going second, that’s good too.  There are 2 Aragorns, and the deck doesn’t exactly revolve around him, so you may end up drawing him before long, as the deck is only 68 cards.  If you don’t find him, it’s ok, because the only cards only he can have are his sword, bow, and an extra armor and flaming brand.  Boromir can carry the rest.  Going second means that you should be able to stop them from double moving every time with 2 to 3 uruk-hai on their tail, especially if Saruman is present.  Just one step your way to site 6 or 7, and if you don’t see any chance of killing them, you should be able to start double moving easily.  <br>
<br>
SHADOW	<br>
Scrabblers are there to discard pesky Elven conditions, such as the Gift of Boats, or The Last Alliance of Elves and Men.  Goblin Warriors can get rid of a Dwarven Ally or condition.  Saruman’s Power is in there just as a precaution—if the other fellowship is swimming in their conditions, then wash them all away.  Can You Protect Me From Yourself? will add burdens (if they use Aragorn…nearly everyone does), which will trigger the Orthanc Berserkers and Traitor’s Voice’s abilities.  Worry will possibly add some burdens, or at least weaken their ring-bearer.  Saruman keeps the uruk-hai from being pinged off the board with archery, or other skirmish actions that might try to make a cheap kill on your uruk-hai.  He also makes them all fierce…which is very, very nasty if they can’t find a way to beat the uruk-hai off.  Uruk Captains can bring uruk-hai back from the discard pile, which is an ability that will come in handy especially at site 9.  Uruk Ravagers essentially only cost 2 if you have Saruman out.  A cost 2, strength 9, damage +1, fierce minion…who’s complaining?  The Saruman’s Ambitions are there solely for pumping uruk-hai, and Savagery’s can be devastating if the fellowship is large enough.  The other minions speak for themselves, and need no explanation.<br>
<br>
FELLOWSHIP<br>
There’s really no explanation to give here…all the cards are there to strengthen your fellowship.  The possessions and other companions come easily, as there are only 68 cards in the draw deck.  If you feel that your fellowship can’t be stopped by the opposition, then just double move your way to victory.  They will have a tough time double moving past the uruk-hai.  It’s a very well-rounded fellowship, and works well against any shadow culture.<br>
