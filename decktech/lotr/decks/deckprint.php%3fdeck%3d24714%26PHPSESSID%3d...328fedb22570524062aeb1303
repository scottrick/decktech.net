PLEASE READ BEFORE REVIEWING!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
Ahem. Thanks for looking. <br />
I had been running a Shoulder 2 Shoulder deck without the Mirror for a while, since I HATE the mirror, and had had some success, but I noticed that it&#39;s hard to double move, no matter how many companions you have, when they keep adding more and more minions because you can&#39;t kill ANY of them. So, keeping with Shoulder to Shoulder&#39;s ability to pull wounds off of the fighters and on to the allies, or the other way around, I stumbled into this deck. What does this deck do?<br />
This deck sets up the two baddest dudes from the books and lets them kick hiney. It also adapts to your oponents shadow strategy. Are they playing Moria? Kill all their conditions, drop 9 companions and run all the way, laughing at their Trolls and feeding Hobbits to the Balrog. Uruk Hai? Beef up Legolas and Gimli, shoot the bigguns and win the fights you can, but NEVER go above 4 companions. Sauron? Kill the conditions, shoot them all and win fights with ALL your companions.<br />
Nazgul? Win the fights you can, but generally take 2 wounds from each minion, since you won&#39;t be getting overwhelmed all that often.<br />
<br />
How does this deck operate?<br />
<br />
Gimli becomes a tank. He is 10 strength, able to be 16, damage +2, 4 vitality, takes no more than 1 wound per skirmish, can prevent one and when he wins, he wounds an Orc. Gimli MUST not die. <br />
<br />
Legolas. He is strength 8, 4 vitality and he shrinks everything but Nazgul/Troll/Rog. He shoots the menaces you can&#39;t beat, and beats the little guys to kill the big guys. He can die, it&#39;s just not preferable.<br />
<br />
Elrond. He bounces conditions, draws card and is the linchpin of the Shoulder to Shoulder engine in this deck. He MUST not die.<br />
<br />
Other companions/Allies- food for the hungry minions of Sauron. Aragorn/Sam should be saved until you need them, but can be dumped at you leasure. Gandalf will win most of his fights. Boromir is you Hobbit helper, but can help anyone is Merry is around. Fror is your Uruk-Hai beatstick. Filbert rules. Thrarin is Shoulder 2 Shoulder fuel AND minion food. Grimir is Shoulder 2 Shoulder fuel, nothing more.<br />
<br />
card choices<br />
<br />
I think I explained all the companions/allies, but here goes the other stuff<br />
<br />
Vilya- extra vitality for Elrond, takes to place of Sentinels, but does a better job since it sticks around.<br />
<br />
Sting- stop Frodo from being overwhelmed, drop pool when possible<br />
<br />
O Elbereth- I hate Nazgul, extra Strength<br />
<br />
Gimli&#39;s Toys- helm helps against Uruks, Axe against everyone, Bracers are permenent Strength, Axes can be given to the allies and thrown late game, or boost Gimli.<br />
<br />
A Royal Welcome- heal Gimli without adding twilight and BEFORE maneuver. awesome card, but not essential. <br />
<br />
Tale/Endurance- extra shots for Legolas, extra boost for Gimli, extra vitality is always good.<br />
<br />
SHADOW<br />
<br />
Sauron burden capitalization. The point is to get your opponent as high on burdens as possible and use Nazgul and Enduring Evil to finish them off. Your goal is 4-5, because thats where the Nazgul kick in, but with your Band of the Eyes, as little 1 burden can mean an overwhelm against Boromir, Gandalf and elves. Most players bid at least 1, most bid 2. If they use the Pony that gets us to 3, our site 4 gives us 4 and ONE activation of Thin and Stretched or DDotR gives us 5. Nasty, and even more effective against decks that bid high, get Sam and then dump him early. <br />
<br />
CHoices<br />
<br />
Enquea- the machine gun, this guy picks off any and all comers. Prime targets should be Legolas, Aragorn and Gandalf, since they are often the linchpin of decks they show up in. If you get the oportunity, shoot down Sam when they play Son of Hamfast, but ignore Proper Poet unless no better target presents itself. Enquea is also pivotal in games against large fellowships.<br />
<br />
Toldea- kill Legolas, kill Hobbits, draw fire away from your Orcs. Toldea is the man who is always in the right place at the right time. A word of warning: do not play Nazgul in the late sites if they have out O Elbereth.<br />
<br />
Slayers- these are a personal choice. they can be replaced by almost anything that costs 2 or less, but I like them, since most of the time you will have an Enduring Evil in hand to help them win. They can finish off what Enquea and Toldea starts and can win fights against large fellowship decks, since they aren&#39;t playing weapons. love em.<br />
<br />
Tower Assassin- kill allies and is a darn good minion in his own right. these guys make all of my non-nazgul decks.<br />
<br />
Our List of Allies- turns allies into companions that can&#39;t fight. wicked, and always gets missed when Secret Sentinels gets played. he he.<br />
<br />
No Hates? - no room, and damage isn&#39;t really the point of the deck, although the Slayers can be pseudo-hates when they win their fights. Ditto for Bowmen and UTWE.<br />
<br />
Pillagers? - I dunno why they don&#39;t fit, but I like the Bands better, just do better all around, although Pillagers could probably work about the same in the deck. I would love to hear some game experience with the Pillagers. <br />
<br />
well, I think that pretty well explains the shadow, and I hope you get a good idea for how the deck plays. I think this deck is very strong against the current good decks, but I am open to all criticism. Thanks for your time.<br />
