<br />
What are you to do?<br />
<br />
Well, having purchased the Faramir starter as an easy means to the commons for RBRangers, I had all these silly IsenOrcs that appeared to be rather cheap to play, stopped roaming at 4, and I HAD THEM!<br />
<br />
So, I throw together the cheapest, most biggest most Dauntless Hunter killing Orcses I had, combined with Insurgents for hand extension and the 4 GOOD shadow cards I&#39;ve managed to get up to now (Grima x 2 and Enquea x 2) and you&#39;ve got a shadow capable of EASY kills early. It will not kill often in the late game, but it&#39;s VERY easy to get site 4 and yes, even site TWO kills. How?<br />
<br />
Bid 4 to start, which will usually get it online, and start the site that gives 2 extra pool. Move along, get where you can, and set up the Shadow hand. Opponent starts Gimli and Legolas (common start online) and then adds Gorn and perhaps Elrond. thats 8 plus 2 for site plus 3 for site 2 (as most play the Wold) plus 4 for the companions which appears to add up 17, divide that by 3 per minion and you get 5 minions and some leftover, and if you have an Insurgent in that situation, that means 5 Orcs + the Insurgent! Granted, often they&#39;ll have a solution but if they don&#39;t that&#39;s game. If they do, you get a stop AND cycle your hand for your next turn. <br />
<br />
I realize that this isn&#39;t the most consistent Shadow side, but the fellowship is a beast, especially in the Enquea-lite Online environment which is where it has shone. So far, in it&#39;s current form, the deck is something like 10-0 with all but 2 wins coming from the shadow before site 5. CRAZY!<br />
<br />
So, for those of you looking for a shadow to play online before you attain all those digital rares look no further. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s a bonus that it loves Dauntless as an opponent, though I hear Frying Pan is no fun. <br />
<br />
If you want strategy for the Free Peoples, look to the Something Clever by the Carny strategy section. It&#39;s all there. And just for you doubters, yes, I DO have all these cards online :)<br />
