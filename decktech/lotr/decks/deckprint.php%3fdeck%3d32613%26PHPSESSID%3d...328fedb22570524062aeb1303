This is a non-tournament legal deck (which is okay since it works a little better in 3-4 player games anyway).  I don&#39;t think Nertea should be banned, but he is.  Sorry if it bothers some of you that I used a banned card in this deck.  If your friends don&#39;t mind, try it out.  I guarantee it&#39;s loads of fun!  (To make it tournament legal/ready, drop all four Nerteas and a Flung Into the Fray on the Nazgul side, and an Elite Rider, Rohirrim Army, Brego, a Rohirrim Bow, and King&#39;s Mail.)<br />
<br />
I only bid 1 or 2 burdens.  Possibly, even none if you&#39;re afraid of people using them against you.  I don&#39;t care about going first, other than playing my Rohan possessions for free (usually)!  When you do go, get a horse on Eomer as quickly as possible.  The Fellowship deck is self-explanatory.  Keep Eomer and Eowyn alive.  Use Merry to play bows on people during skirmishes.  Double move whenever you have force bumps or you think you can get away with it without enormous mountains of shadow.  In all honesty, this is just the strongest fellowship I felt I could make to give my Ringwraith Archers the time needed to work their magic.<br />
<br />
On the shadow side, it&#39;s all about initiative and killing people in the archery phase.  If I don&#39;t get a &quot;Flung into the Fray&quot; or &quot;Streaming onto the Field&quot; in my opening hand, I often mulligan.  (Unless, of course, I have a KILLER fellowship hand).  Get &quot;Streaming&quot; on the table ASAP.  DO NOT burn it for a force bump.  Ignore winning skirmishes with the orcs.  It&#39;s unimportant.  Put Toldea or Gothmog on &quot;Flung&quot; as soon as you can.  Use Nertea to play orcs out of your discard pile to get initiative.  (Without Nertea, the shadow side obviously works a little bit slower!)  Add burdens with Attea whenever possible…three is all you need.  Keep the threats coming with sites and Destroyers.  Discard Nelya and Otsea in regroup to keep Frodo from preventing your Destroyers from adding threats.  Again, you only need three.  At site 8, if you haven&#39;t killed your opponent already, use the site&#39;s text to play Nertea and then a couple orcs (Ambushers, Creepers, or Lurkers depending on which conditions you meet) and then play Gothmog from &quot;Flung&quot;.  So much the better if you have Toldea in hand or in the discard pile, and you can play him free.  I have given 13 points of archery with this deck.  I consistently deal out 4-6 every phase.  Sure, I don&#39;t win skirmishes (except with a couple Nazgul), but who needs to win skirmishes when Ulaire Toldea is a FREE STRENGTH 12 FIERCE ARCHER?!?!<br />
