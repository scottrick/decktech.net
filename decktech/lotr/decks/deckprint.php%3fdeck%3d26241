    </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" COLOR="#000000">Strategy</Font></TD><TD><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">General Strategy:  Here&#8217;s the old guy deck tweaked for Two Towers.  The significant change is in the Fellowship where Eomer is just too good to not use.  So, the starting fellowship gives the appearance of a Rider deck (but it isn&#8217;t).  Eowyn starts simply because she can, and her only function is to keep the other companions alive (ergo, no support cards for her!).  If Arwen no longer starts, then Arwen no longer plays.  She is gone, along with Gwemegil and the Evenstar.  But without those cards to help cycle, I had to cut the deck down, so Last Alliance, Gimli, Rumil and the Blade of Gondor go away as well (with 2 Faramirs replacing the 2 Boromirs).  LOG isn&#8217;t as necessary anymore with no expected Balrogs.  Gimli is no longer needed since no Bridge.  The new ranger sword replaces the old as Brego will compensate for the extra damage against Uruks. <br />
 <br />
This deck is still built to run.  Bid 1 to go first.  If you win, go first.  If not, you double move to 3.  If shadow gets the job done at 2 (a troop stops them almost all the time) you should now pull ahead.  Once you have the lead, keep it to the point of idiocy, double moving every time you can, and sometimes when you can&#8217;t.  The shadow side is designed to make it suicidal for your opponent to double move through the Deep of Helm so hopefully, if you are still behind, you can beat your opponent to site 6.  You run with five fellowship members at a time, Aragorn and Eomer pumped up with all their toys.  Once you have the lead, the idea is to dump every shadow card you have with Abandoning (if possible) until everything you need is where you need it to be.<br />
<br />
Specfics: <br />
Vs. Nazgul:  Shouldn&#8217;t be a problem, provided the brands show up.  Keep to 5 companions, try to keep the pool under 11 so you never have to look at 3 Nazgul.  Once you get through the fords, a fully loaded Eomer and Faramir (with the 2 brands) will be able to swat most of the Black Riders out of the way.  The only time you might get into trouble is if you double move unnecessarily and allow 4 to show up.  Then you&#8217;re dead.  Note that Eowyn can neutralize Enquea by stopping the fatal wound unless shes the target, but that&#8217;s ok.<br />
<br />
Vs. Moria:  Moria should not present a problem for the new site path.  The only underground sites are 6 and 7, and you can heal at 6.  If you have all of your directed archery going you should cream Moria.  Note:  Eomer with spear and Firefoot is a power 15 vs a Cave troll with 2 wounds at the start of a skimish.  Firefoot adds the third wound.    <br />
<br />
Vs. Sauron:  Who the hell plays Sauron anyway?  (Even more so, now!)<br />
<br />
Vs. Uruk:  Now you&#8217;re playing Candyland.  Whoever gets the right cards wins.  Be prepared for a bloody as hell, single site moving game.  Hope Gandalf shows up in time to neutralize Saruman, and hope that you can dodge the Power.  Never place both betrayals on the table at the same time, and hope you see his Tower assassins go by before you need to play Filbert.  This is absolutely the most difficult matchup for this deck.  No changes here&#8230;.<br />
<br />
Vs. Dunland:  If your opponent bids high and makes you move first, expect Dunland.  If you have to move first your opponent will not be able to gain control of any sites.  Go 1 to 3 no matter what the cost.  If you can arrive at 3 safely the game could be yours.  Five directed archery should be able to cut through the bad guys to the point where hides must be discarded.  There is no site control protection in this deck, so you must either be able to hammer the power 9 with Eomer and Aragorn, or gun them down with archery.  If minions start stacking on sites, you&#8217;re dead.<br />
<br />
Vs. Raiders:  Haven&#8217;t played against them enough to elucidate, but they need to exert for stuff, so hopefully you make sure they don&#8217;t do that and you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem anywhere along the path.  I&#8217;ve only played against one raider deck and this deck stomped it.<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for:  Grima.  He could show up anywhere at any time.  Try to keep to 2 cards per companion and fend off shadow conditions with sentinels.  Elven allies are still cool.  I&#8217;m toying with idea of putting in 2 copies of Roll of Thunder into deck if deemed necessary.<br />
<br />
On the shadow side, I experimented with the new mechanics, but it all boiled down to &#8220;there just ain&#8217;t nuthin like a three twilight power nine bad guy&#8221;.  The only change beside shrinking the deck (2 ambitions and 2 Tower assassins disappear) is replacing the Berserker with the Champion.  Nothing like picking off an exhausted companion.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you all think. Thanks.<br />
