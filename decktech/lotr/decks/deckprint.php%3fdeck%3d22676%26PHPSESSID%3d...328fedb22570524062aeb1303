Either way, feel free to help me out with your reviews.  This is card-for-card what I played at my first tournament this week, and it went 3-2.  I might have done as well as 4-1 if I weren&#39;t such a moron (read my tourney report).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I always bid 1.  I would like to go first and start the Pony, but I can&#39;t really go higher than 1 because I have no burden removal.  You basically set up your Fellowship with Aragorn and Boromir (Ace and Gary) with Armor and Weapons early (hopefully while your opponent is roaming), then simply march along with a small party to limit twilight.  Minimize wounds from large minions with armor, take out average minions with your Events.  Nobody in this Fellowship (not even Gandalf) is so essential you can&#39;t survive without them.  If you lose a Companion, just ditch any now un-usable cards via They Are Coming and Pillars of the Kings.  Just make sure that if somebody is going to die, they go out in a blaze of glory.  Make Sam Defender +1 then sacrifice him to the Balrog AND the Cave Troll.  Play Valiant Man and Wielder of the Flame on Aragorn to let him take everybody down with him at a later site.  Make Boromir Defender+1 and let him just take one wound in his armor.  Etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Shadow side is your usual Moria Swarm, I just mixed in a few Nazgul that I felt had utility purposes.  Toldea to punish high burdens, Enquea to punish high companions, Nelya to change a vital site, and Nertea to get me a Cave Troll from the discard.  There are only 3 Cave Trolls in the deck because I only own three, but I have yet to have any problem dropping a Cave Troll at any site I feel like.  Foul Things may be a good addition to the deck though.<br />
<br />
Card explanations:<br />
<br />
Aragorn, KIE - I personally think RotN is better, but in this deck, KIE&#39;s healing is monster.  Exert Gandalf to cancel a battle, heal him to do it again later.  Thanks to Chris Gogolen for pointing out that I had my Sams mixed up when I typed this.  KIE can&#39;t heal Sam, but he does take a wound off of Boromir, allowing him to step in front of a big-nasty over and over again...<br />
<br />
Sam, Proper Poet - See above reference to "dying in a blaze of glory".<br />
<br />
Galadriel x2 - I know I don&#39;t have a second mirror, but even without the mirror, she&#39;s good.  Exert to drop Celeborn/Rumil for free, heal Rumil for repeated wounding, etc.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chieftan - With three minions and a Moria Axe, can be Strength 16/Damage +1.<br />
<br />
Moria Scout - With so many people putting Elves in their decks, this guy is basically free after site 3, and has an extra vitality to suck up archery, survive PATHS, etc.<br />
<br />
Nazgul - explained above, but may come out.<br />
<br />
Cards I&#39;d like to add: Bounder, Foul Things, Bill Ferny, Goblin Swarms<br />
<br />
Match-ups:<br />
<br />
This deck basically plays the same against all deck types.  I like to think I have something in the Fellowship to deal with each minion type (I beat Uruk-Hai, Sauron, and Moria this weekend), you just have to be able to adapt as you go along.  Gandalf and TAC allow you to get through the deck quickly enough, in most games I finish with <10 cards in my draw deck.<br />
