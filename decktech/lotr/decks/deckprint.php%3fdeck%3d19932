Start Aragorn. He is your only dude, so make sure he doesn&#39;t die. If he lives to site 8, then dies there, you should still be able to win with Power According to His Stature (PATHS) and/or Bounder. Play No Stranger to the Shadows on Aragorn as soon as possible. The point of the deck is to be able to move under the radar, usually moving 2-3 sites on the first turn (try to go to site 3 on the first turn every game, unless they are playing Nazgul, then you might not want to move to the ford). Bid low because you want your opponent to play first (or you can bid high and choose for them to play first), so that way it will be your site 2, allowing you to go to site 4 on the first turn if you got a good hand. Put Athelas and Ranger&#39;s Sword on Aragorn whenever you get a free moment, because the sword is essential to living through the early sites, and Athelas is essential to making it through 8 and 9, with enough room to make Aragorn defender +1-2. Athelas also has the nice side ability of discarding Blade Tip and Black Breath.<br />

<br />
Shadow half. This deck is made to put as many burdens as possible on Frodo, and then use Enduring Evil to wreck house. I picked the minions based on site to cost ratio, as well as vitality to cost. Notice the Inquisitor (who combos well with Desperate Defense of the Ring), the Warden, and the Band of the Eye all have 3 vitality. Not quite as huge as the 4 on the Morgul Hunter, but that guy is better suited for a different deck type. The other guys I&#39;m playing all have the wound me to wound you ability, so basically they win a fight even when they loose. <br />
<br />
<br />
Summary - Play this deck based on the way the cards come up. Drew multiple An Able Guide, run like crazy. Drew 3 Band of the Eye and Thin and Stretched, play the Fellowship slow (1 site at a time after 3) so they can&#39;t do anything to you, and wreck them with shadow. Both decks are solid, and they work good together, so give them a try if you have the cards.<br />
