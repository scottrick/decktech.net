<br />
I&#39;ve been a hardcore SWCCG player since it came out, and my all time favorite Light Side deck is and always will be Mains and Toys. Here is my best attempt to recreate Mains and Toys in LotR. The Fellowship is exactly that: big mains and their matching toys. In theory, you should get Aragorn out first turn, and Gandalf first or second. Gandalf&#39;s a 10 as soon as he hits the table, and throw Aragorn and Gandalf their swords, and minions fade quickly. The rest of the deck is more mains and more weapons. Gimli&#39;s Helm and Axe, turning the little guy into a killing machine, and Arwen and Boromir with their respective swords. So far in 6 games playtesting my fellowship has been untouched, and ran to site 9 in four turns every game, thanks to move limit +1 or skipping site 6. <br />
<br />
The shadow compliments my fellowship quite well for a number of reasons. With the direct damage potential, it literally forces opponents to slow down and heal, giving my fellowship the edge. In addition, the Tol Brandir is a killer site 9 for Lidless Eye Orcs, but also a river, which, when combined with Thror&#39;s Map and Ranger&#39;s versatility, gives me an almost free pass on the last move. <br />
<br />
The key to shadow is, of course, direct damage, but unlike many Sauron decks, I&#39;ve included elements of combat, such as the Hunter (who is a BEAST), Orc War Band, Enheartened Foe and Enduring Evil. Imagine the look on your opponent&#39;s face when your 6 power Tracker overwhelms Aragorn thanks to Enduring Evil (which has happened twice in playtesting).<br />
<br />
As for site choices, most are pretty straight forward. 2-3 are to help me out if I lose the bid, because I can often move 3 times once I get set up. Site 4 is cool because it adds direct damage, and I have a Gimli to exert if needed, site 5 is a no brainer (literally), site 6 is neutral, 7 is to get rid of Elrond, Galadriel and friends, 8 is for high twilight and the possiblilty of stopping them, and 9 is key for Sauron Orcs AND Thror&#39;s Map + Ranger&#39;s Versatility. <br />
<br />
As for weaknesses, as any other LotR deck, it has its share. Sleep, Caradhras hurts, of course, but exerting Gandalf is somewhat risky thanks to Enquea, You Bring Great Evil, Hate and Exert to wound orcs. Archery can be painful, but your Hunter and Enquea have 4 life, and your weak trackers have usually done their job prior to the Archery phase, so they can die. Moria Swarm can be dangerous to the Fellowship, but Aragorn&#39;s Bow, Legolas, Sleep and Sevant Of The Secret Fire should help, and Aragorn can become defender +3 as a last resort. <br />
<br />
I think most of the rest are pretty straight forward. I can&#39;t change my strat, so please DMail me if you have any pressing questions. <br />
<br />
Hope you like-<br />
