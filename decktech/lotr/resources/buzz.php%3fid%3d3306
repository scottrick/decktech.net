If so, it could be near impossible to beat your score. The hardest star I&#39;ve gotten so far is the 8 coins on the desert level without the red hat. That took me a long time. I had to use a combo of the turtle shell and the whirlwind that blows you around to get them all. Another challenging thing has been getting 100 coins on certain levels without red hats. On the very first board I must have shot myself from that cannon on the floating island a hundred times getting all the coins from those rings.

<br>
This used to be very popular for many of my years, a guy would get a creative idea and do it all himself.  Now every game is a huge conglomerate of almost 100 people.<br>
<br>
That&#39;s how film was incidentally and that&#39;s just one of many parallels between film and vid games.  early on, guys like Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, DW Griffith, they were like the one man creative force.  Guys like Jackie Chan somewhat continue the tradition, but now films are huge productions with almost a thousand crew.<br>

Which brings me to my point....<br>
Name some games that are ridiculously hard that you doubt have ever been beaten.<br>

a few games come to mind  Super Ghouls and Ghosts<br>

Personally, I can&#39;t stand to play lotr that much.  Once a week would be tops.  It&#39;s like Vega said, making decks is 10X more fun than game play.

There may be others, but they are probably not worth mentioning (like the Cdi, that has to be the worst system ever). Out of all the systems we have, we probably play the Gamecube(smash bros.), X-Box(halo, the only game for this system as far as I can tell), and 8-bit the most. My overall favorite systems are probably SNES, PS1 and 2, and Dreamcast.

The Mario challenge is very fun actually, most of the stars are standard, but some of them are really wild, and require some creativity.  You&#39;d be surprised just how many stars you can get in weird ways in that game.<br>
<br>
Try jumping on them from great distances for instance.  It&#39;s worth the reward.  Like i&#39;ve dropped onto the star coin on the Stone Castle from a huge height.  Also, on the Scale the mountain level, i&#39;ve jumped onto the mushroom from the very top of the mountain, that you are only supposed to get to by cannon.<br>
