I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone out there (or at least very few) who think that anyone on the USA team didn&#39;t earn its spot.  What we&#39;re saying is that it&#39;s not fair that the only qualifications for the WC team be how many games you play in a certain time period.  I myself have other commitments besides LotR and lack the time and money to change my 150ish ranking to one in the top 25 or so.  I attended Origins this year and made day two, so I think I can play a little.  Unfortunately, that&#39;s the only convention I went to.  I can&#39;t attend all the big tournaments.  I can&#39;t attend two local tournaments a week.  And not only that, but even if I could, I wouldn&#39;t want to because, in general competition at local tournaments is pretty sad.  The problem is that in order to make the team, you have to turn a GAME that we play for fun into something more than a game, more like a part-time job or (for some) an obsession.  So therefore, it&#39;s not those who are necessarily the best (however small that margin may be), but those who have the most resources to commit to the game.   </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont"><B>Crash Beedo</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont">Yeah, well you&#39;re still a genius Hayes.  You and Craft are solid picks, you&#39;ll do fine.  I don&#39;t know anything about that other guy except his rating is hella high, eh?<br>
<br>
And those Sanct teams are going to be pretty gosh darnit good too. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Hayes</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">My post was deleted. Here is what I said, to the best of my memory: <br>
<br>
Here&#39;s a question from an interview I did with a Decipher employee: <br>
<br>
<i>8. Team USA is going into the World Cup as the favorites, what other countries do you think will have a good shot at the title and why? <br>
<br>
>>>I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say we&#39;re the favorites. We are the highest seeded team, yes, but all that means is that we have the most inflated ratings. I have the utmost respect for the card playing abilities of so many European players I&#39;ve met through the Star Wars CCG (for example World Champion Bastian Winkelhaus and Alex Tennet, to name-drop a bit). Don&#39;t forget, the US players are playing without the home field advantage; we&#39;re going to be the ones combating jet lag for once! I really can&#39;t predict which countries have the best shot simply because there has never been an event like this before and, as evidenced in the results from other "major" LOTR events, the "most skilled" player doesn&#39;t always end up on top. </i> <br>
<br>
Now, to touch on some of the recent posts, I believe I deserve my spot on the US Team <i>as much as anyone else</i> does. I say it like that because it&#39;s LOTR; meaning the "very best" player is not all that much better than a "great" player, who, in turn, is not dramatically superior to a "good" player, and so on. I build decent decks and play as mistake-free as consistently as anyone out there. Period. So do I deserve to go any <i>more</i> than any one of the players in the top 10, 50, or 100 of the world? Of course not. I simply played the ratings game better than most people for a short while. <br>
<br>
That is why you guys have to stop giving shimmer to Kyle, Will, Craig, and even Andrew Howard. We may not be the "best" players, but because it&#39;s so d!mned close (especially this early on in the games life) it is impossible to determine who ultimately deserves to go. <br>
<br>
There is some hope, though. Decipher has admitted they are looking into a new means of deciding who makes the teams for next year. Again, because the game is so new there was little they could go on besides ratings this time around.  </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont"><B>rellekmr</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont">Th problem with selecting national teams based on ratings is the current artificial ratings floor at 1600.  This allows a mediocre player to keep gaining points from his awful local group at a rate much higher than would be possible otherwise, as they never drop.  It punishes players for playing in highly competitive circles.  Was it any surprise that someone broke LotR 2000 rating faster than any other Decipher game?  Yes, those who have hit 2000+ are good, but they were launched there by a corrupted ratings system.  Not only were they getting points from scrubs, but they were getting points from other good players who got points fromn scrubs, and so on.  ELO doesn&#39;t work when you have a floor for everyone in the game.  When chess was using ELO, you didn&#39;t get ratings floors until you were very high up, and those were only to prevent people from intentionally tanking their ratings to get class prizes, which don&#39;t exist in LotR.  Get rid of the floors, and next year&#39;s World Cup teams will look much more impressive.<br>
<br>
Side note: actual qualifiers for national team spots would be even better, except that some players might not be able to afford to travel to both the national qualifier AND the World Cup. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>neal</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Kindly do not post kyle heuer&#39;s name here, thanks </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont"><B>dope5tar</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont">oh and hayes is a genius. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>dope5tar</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">congrats red 69, at last someone has discovered what ive been alluding to for weeks now.<br>

sure the system is imperfect, its the first year of it.  give it some time, eventually they will root out the problems and make the cup teams representative of the best players in a particular country.<br>

<br>
Whats the point? If you hold tournaments or use the major cons to pick players than you are going to have some schmuck who got hella lucky on the team so that way sucks.<br>
<br>
The only way to pick a good team is to look at everything from players within the top 200 american players. there are some guys who play this game who are not in the top 100 but could whip anyone that is, they just dont play as much as some of you.<br>
<br>
You look at who they play, of they go to the major cons and how they did, how many games they play etc etc, then you pick.<br>
<br>
Otherwise we will just have more andrew howards (good thing that phag got caught) and Kyle Craft who legally cheated his way on to the team by entering tournaments late so he wouldnt have to play anyone good and can gain points. and craig berry who whips the local losers 2 or 3 times a week.<br>
<br>
This years world cup is a bloody joke.<br>

now the sanctuary teams which looked decent keep changing because of no sponsorship money thanks to decipher being cheap skates so it looks like a diniega will be on the team thanks to others not going who he probably paid off since he is a spoiled rich punk.<br>

Just my thinking. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>zwitter</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"> Team Australia, all the way people!

does anyone think any of the bottom 16 teams will even show up. team thailand? average rating 1537. wow<br>

i think the world cup is only a show down of teams that can afford to go and has not been done right from the beginning.<br>

better luck next time. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Planar Creature</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Boy the lists look really random...all but 1 American and the alternates look better than the first picks.<br>

I wonder if they&#39;ll actually develop a sanctuary team "list" so as players are unavailable, they have a waiting list of alternates.  Gabe would be hanging out on the alternate list, saying &#39;pick me, pick me&#39;.  Looks like players in the top 100 have about a 1 out of 10 of makiing a sanctuary team right off.<br>
<br>
As for sponsorship, once the team is assembled, I&#39;m thinking they could try and line up sponsorship.  Anything would help. </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont"><B>Hayes</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#FFFFFF><font class="bfont">Tricky thing about the Sanctuary Teams is that they are not (as far as I&#39;m aware) sponsored.  So, while there may be plenty of good players in the top 100 willing to go to Germany, who can predict the calibur of the player that is actually able to afford it? </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont"><B>Yoda Killa</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont">I definitely think the Sanctuary Teams will be the most interesting, I&#39;ve talked to quite a few very good players who are in the top 100 who all say they will go if they are picked for one of the teams(American Players mind you), so it could be quite interesting to see US player vs US player, heh.<br>

Also the only European Premiere series event for this year is being held the same weekend, so it could end up being the most competitive one yet, with quite a few of the best US players, squaring ofeasterlingainst Europe&#39;s finest.

It looks like about 60 people will be left in the top 100 after the National Teams are picked.  Something like 80% of those 60 are top American tournament players - guys that go to Cons, play in big events, etc, but don&#39;t necessarily stay in locals soaking up ratings - a 3-man team of some of the top events participants would be my pick.  Go Team Rivendell.  </TD></TR><TR><TD ALIGN='LEFT' valign='top' width='70' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont"><B>el-diablo</B></font></td><Td valign='top' bgcolor=#A2B1C1><font class="bfont">difficult question.
