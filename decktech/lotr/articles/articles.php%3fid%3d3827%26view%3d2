<br>
Hello my faithful readers. This article, Keys to the Kingdom: Section Three is the final installment of my three part series on deck design and game strategy. Anyway, todays lesson is about the last truly important facet of Lord of the Rings gaming.  This is of course the development and implementation of a successful Card Engine. More experienced readers, keep in mind this like the other two sections of Keys to the Kingdom is geared toward the blossoming beginners. <br>
<br>
WHAT IS A CARD ENGINE?<br>
<br>
So, what exactly is a card engine? A card engine is a technique usually involving multiple cards and a preplanned strategy that consistently provides a desired result in game play. Card engines tend to vary greatly in size, intent, and efficiency. Some are very small and offer just a little bit of an edge to the user, while almost guaranteeing that it will always work. Others are extremely large and complex, offering a huge advantage to the user, while not actually coming into play most the time. The best engines however are those precious few that tread the line. They dont require too many cards, they offer substantial rewards, and can usually be depended on if needed. These true card engines are the marks of an experienced player and can be found in any tournament level players deck. Effective card engine usage spans over both deck design and game play.<br>
<br>
IN THE BEGINNING <br>
<br>
The birthplace of every great card engine can usually be traced back to one place a shoebox. The vast majority of winning engines are designed by some guys sifting through stacks of their old cards, often just before the big tournament, looking for that one little trick that is going to bring home a victory. Theyre not always expert strategists, in fact most of the time they just notice a few cards laying near them and something clicks. A flicker of insight, an I wonder, and an If I play it like this later, we have a bouncing baby card engine. So, now that we have established that anyone can do it, lets go through the steps of designing a card engine.<br>
<br>
IN THE GARAGE<br>
<br>
First well examine a decent card engine developed by friend of mine, Bilbo, the Super Archer, it suffers the problem of efficiency but can yield awesome results. There are effectively five cards essential to this combo: Bilbo Baggins, Retired Adventurer; Elrond, Herald to Gil-Galad; Hobbit Sword, Consorting With Wizards, and Hobbit Sword-play (preferably four of them). At first, I thought my friend was of his gourd but after close review I saw the potential. The idea begins with the card Hobbit Sword-play a decent 0 twilight event that gives armed hobbits a sort of archery in the maneuver phase (You gotta love that).  However, it allows the opponent to cancel it by spending 3 twilight, but since it is in the maneuver phase that isnt too much of a worry. So lets see, that means that Frodo with Sting or any hobbit carrying a Hobbit Sword or Frying Pan can be exerted to use this event. Hmm a taking a wound to deal a wound that can be canceled seems a bit steep. It would be nice to prevent a fight with a low vitality, high power orc though. Still, wounding your own companion in mid-battle can be bothersome. Wait a minute; it doesnt need to be a companion! We can use a hobbit ally, but wait, hobbit allies usually only have 2 vitality. So that means after one swing well need to heal them, and on top of that we lose the Hobbit Sword-play. Nuts! Wait what about good old Bilbo Baggins, Retired Adventurer? He has 3 vitality and with his game text he can shuffle that event right back into our deck. There are still problems though. Bilbo will still need to be healed often to get the engine running, and he needs some protection from ally hate cards. Hmm trusty old Elrond could heal Bilbo regularly, but only once a turn and we will have to play Gandalf before we can play him. However, the new Elrond, Herald to Gil-Galad can heal Bilbo twice and doesnt need to spot Gandalf to play! Great, now all we need is some cover for Bilbo why not Consorting With Wizards, it can shield Bilbo from most things. So lets see now; Bilbo gets a sword, uses swordplay to stab a minion, pulls back the swordplay, and gets healed by Elrond next turn so he can do it again. Consorting protects him from wounds the whole time. Not bad! Personally, I think it is still a little sketchy but an excellent start nonetheless. Reviewing the material, we can see that the whole process can be either streamlined or expanded. Starting Hobbiton Party Field would make getting Bilbo out fast much easier. Playing multiply Hobbit Swords and Hobbit Sword-plays could easily be covered by a hobbit based deck and a couple Frying Pans might be substituted in place of a couple swords for variety. In the case of a hobbit deck, a few Hobbit Appetites may also be in order allowing Biblo to strike more than once in a fight or just to heal another hobbit. Elrond seems a bit out of place but is more or less necessary to the engine. If he cant be pulled early however, it isnt much of a problem as Bilbo can do his trick at least once while you wait for Elrond to show up. Consorting is much a matter of preference, if you fear ally hate, or if it is common in your area than you should probably consider it, if not than dont. In any case, Biblo is now effectively a Super Archer. He has much the same power as the Lorien archers, but greater range. The Balrog cancels the archery phase not the maneuver phase. Saruman and his spies also dont have refuge from the angry little halfling. Cave Trolls Chain doesnt work outside the archery phase either. Is the Witch-King at a river? A Rangers Versatility and Bilbos versatility kill him in one shot. Minion archery before fellowship archery? Bilbo can peck those 1 vitality chumps off before they aim their bows. The is some definite potential, but also some definite efficiency issues.<br>
<br>
AT THE QUICK LUBE     <br>
<br>
Now that weve seen a card intensive engine lets take a look at some of the more compound and efficient models. Many of these are pretty much universally known, as they require next to nothing to set up.<br>
<br>
1.	Starting your fellowship first. Here is a prime example of a compact card engine with a simple but reliable purpose. For some reason your deck runs better if you go first as the fellowship, so how do you pull it off. Simple, start Sam, Son of Hamfast or if your starting fellowship is already full start the Green Dragon Inn. You can bid very high to go first and than have Sam exert all the burdens away by at most site 3. Then you can serve Sam up as fodder or keep him around so Frodo has a backup. This only gets tricky when the other player is using the Sam strategy too.<br>
2.	Getting more out of stealth. Hobbit Stealth and Hobbit Intuition are two of the most powerful cards in the game allowing you to cancel battles with hobbits all the way to site 5 (that means the Balrog too). However, it only blocks the one fight and doesnt prevent fierce battles. Using Sam, Proper Poet and Filibert Bolger easily solves this dilemma. The Balrog and Cave Troll appear, Sam exerts twice, and then cancels the first fight, and Filibert uses his text to cancel the fierce battle. Clean, simple, and easily doable. This trick can also be performed with Gandalf, his staff, and Wielder of the Flame. <br>
3.	Early twilight choke. The twilight choke has always been a rather complicated thing to pull off and often doesnt work out as strong as you would hope. Here is an effective and simple engine that might help. Start Frodo and his three hobbit pals (Sam, Faithful Companion; Pippen, Mr. Took, and any Merry). Sam will pull Bill the Pony lowering your twilight by one each site. The Prancing Pony can pull Aragorn, Heir to the White City or even better it he is in hand Pippen can play him. Aragorn then removes the 2 twilight it took to play him. Now if you play them No Stranger to Shadows and A Talent for Not Being Seen will actually have you in negative twilight. Talent, No Stranger, and Bill will cover your fellowship number and Aragorn removes two each turn too. Deft in Their Movements and An Able Guide would also be nice. Rangers and hobbits go figure.<br>
4.	Here is an old school, Shadow card engine. Its the tried and true Under the Watching Eye/You Bring Great Evil/Hate engine. The purpose is simply to slow the opponents fellowship down as the Sauron culture has the highest home site and has trouble deploying quickly. A couple of weak orc tracker can drop and pile on the two bothersome conditions and when the opportunity arises, Hate can be dropped to kill of a poor exhausted companion. The efficiency of this strategy is doubly tricky as it can also be hampered in decks larger than 60 odd cards. <br>
<br>
As seen these somewhat smaller engines are easier to pull off, but have less spectacular results. It is also good to note that even the smallest engine isnt completely full proof. Bad draws can occasionally kill even the most locked strategy, and sooner or later an opponent will find a hole to pour sugar in our well-tuned engine.<br>
<br>
IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE<br>
<br>
As stated, the best engines are the ones that walk the tightrope between efficiency and potential. It is in this border area that we find true gaming power. The example Ive chosen to use is probably the most popular and most used card engine in the game today, in fact many a deck strives to set itself apart while using the engine as a crutch. The engine is of course the aimed archery engine. The beauty of this engine is that it can be fit into just about any chasse. With only its bare bones it requires at least Legolas Greenleaf and some healing potential. However, the variants on this engine are great. The most used is the Ranger/Archery variant. It always starts Arwen and Legolas, and almost always pulls Aragorn. Soon Aragorn gets his bow and some Athelas and the engine gets roaring sometimes using Arwen and Aragorn to heal each other via The Choice of Lothien and Athelas to heal Legolas. The engine uses A Rangers Versatility to weaken strong enemies and then pops them and most others off with aimed archery. Another variant, the Shoulder Fire depends more on dwarven and elven allies. It still frames around Legolas direct archery and uses the direct archery of elven allies as well. The healing factor is found with the dwarves who are milked for vitality via Shoulder to Shoulder and in Galadriel and Elrond who heal both the dwarven and elven allies. This simple but incredibly effective engine is so great that it is widely used by players of all calibers and has prompted Decipher to produce new cards targeting it specifically. To date Decipher has failed to produce any card that truly kills the Aimed Archery Engine, however it has been checked quite well.<br>
<br>
For an example of an effective shadow engine well look at the ever-popular Moria Machine. The Moria engine is by far the simplest and most efficient engine the shadow has yet to produce. The purpose is clear more minions and more twilight to swarm the opponent. It achieves this by turning its discard pile into nothing less than a second hand. The nexus of the whole equation is the Goblin Scimitar, Host of Thousands and Goblin Scavengers. The scimitar plays for free, ups your orcs power, and lets you draw a card (Wow, and its a common). Host (also a common) plays for free and lets you play an orc from the discard pile. The scavengers allow you to retrieve a weapon (i.e. the swords) from the discard when you play them. So, host pulls a scavenger that pulls a sword that draws a card. Simple, sweet, and efficient. Expanding on this is the use of  Moria Scouts, Goblin Runners, Goblin Armories, and Foul Things. Moria Scouts are cheap and if you can spot an elf are free (with Legolas being the most popular starter thats not a hard bet). Goblin Runners actually add 1 twilight when you play them, making it easier to play more minions. Goblin Armories sweeten the deal by adding twilight cumulatively every time you play a sword. Foul Things works like host but costs 2 twilight and allows you to pull the cave troll, Barlog, watcher, or tentacles. It is a nice thing to pull runners and scouts with if you havent discarded a big minion yet. Goblin Swarms is also common in this deck but using it isnt necessary. It may all sound confusing, but in actuality it is very easy to pull off and requires little time to set up. It is rather common to hear your opponent complain about you have 5 or 6 minions out each turn when he can only muster out a few. <br>
<br>
ON THE TRACK<br>
<br>
As I hope the examples and my dialogue have shown, the key to a great card engine usage in decks lies in three things. <br>
<br>
1.	A clear reachable goal. For an engine to run it has to have one thing in mind beyond everything else. It may end up doing a number of other cool things, but focus on its purpose is always a must. Distraction is a precursor to disaster. If the engine is supposed to make Elrond a constant participant in skirmishes, focus on that. Great if it leads to other good things, but focus on the goal.<br>
2.	Keep the options versatile. When designing your engine dont forget the cool things either. While focusing on turning Song of the Blessed Realm and Three Monstrous Trolls into a healing factory is key. Make sure it does a little something extra too.  That engine would require a lot of tales, why not chose tales that fit into some of your decks other purposes. Efficiency just doesnt happen, you have to make it happen.<br>
3.	Finally, dont overshoot your bounds. Never have more than a few engines running on either side of your deck and absolutely never have more than one major engine running on either. For efficiencys sake it is also a superb idea to overlap the cards in your engines. Have cards in your deck that can work in more than one of you decks engines. Remember, smaller is usually better. Some of the best decks have only one engine for each side. <br>
<br>
DONT BUY A CLUNKER<br>
<br>
As a final note on the subject, dont buy into broken engines. If you play long enough you will likely stumble onto one. A broken engine is a technique that is so effective that it is either impossible or near impossible to beat when in the hands oeasterlingood player. To commonly known broken engines in Lord of the Rings have been Mirror Fire (prevents the opponent from playing by eliminating their hand) and The Godhand (does very little as it slowly builds up an unstoppable one turn killer hand). A new errata and a new rule has now eliminated both of these engines. A broken engine is readily identifiable by two things. <br>
<br>
1.	If in tournaments and play testing it is never or almost never hinder and radically gives you the advantage in the game every time. If you cant figure out a way to stop it yourself it is very likely broken. <br>
2.	If the other player and yourself are no longer playing the game. Most broken engines are overlooked card wordings or game rules that allow an almost cheating level of abuse. They often change the very nature of the game and pull away from the fun and competition of the match. In the case of Mirror Fire the game becomes dull as only one player does anything. <br>
<br>
Playing broken engines is a dubious undertaking. Some may cheer your cleverness in finding a game loophole but most will find it offensive if you actually play it. Playing broken engines hurts both the user and the opponent. The opponent usually gets very frustrated by being left out of the game. The user often falls upon the engine as a crutch and their actual game suffers when the broken engine is inevitably eliminated. In the long run it is best to stay clear of these engines. If you stumble upon an engine you think may be broken, set it aside. It may be kosher to use it at some up coming big tournament if others havent uncovered it yet, but only once. After the initial use showing the rest of the gaming community the loophole, just toss it aside. If it is truly broken, it will be torched soon. It is complete folly to use a broken engine someone has already posted. It being posted is a clear sign it is about to be eliminated and sometimes that literally happens overnight. <br>
<br>
In any case these are my thoughts on this complicated aspect of game play. I hope you have enjoyed the series. Im really not sure what to write next any suggests or queries?      <br>
