<br>
<br>
I&#39;ve spent a long time playing CCGs, and I love to learn new things about strategy, metagame, and card combos. But most of all I love deck building.  In this article I share information on deck building that I have gathered from my own experience and the experience of high-end players.  This guide should be read as a companion to the many other great articles out there on theme, strategy, and culture types. <br>
<br>
THEME<br>
A deck doesn&#39;t have to have a theme per se, but must have a goal and all cards must work towards that goal.  So a dwarf deck doesn&#39;t have to be built entirely with dwarves; what is important is that you know why dwarves will help you win and what dwarf culture cards work best together to that end. When considering a theme you should realize that focus is a big part of an effective deck. <br>
<br>
The biggest problems with not sticking to a theme in LOTR occur when you toss in too many cards of different cultures, and break your deck&#39;s consistency and flow. Multiple cultures can interact well, but you lose some flexibility.  On the other hand, using multiple cultures may help protect you from your opponent, particularly on the Free Peoples side.  The Shadow side, on the other hand, is most likely to suffer from an unfocused theme.<br>
<br>
METAGAME<br>
Before I go on to strategy and then the core of deckbuilding let me say something about &quot;metagame.&quot; Metagame is a term used loosely by most people to refer to the local playing environment.  Metagame literally means the game _within_ or _about_ the game; for our purposes it is best to understand that deckbuilding is a game as much as playing is. Preparing for your opponent&#39;s deck, adding cards to counter the dominant decks in your area is considering being attentive to your metagame.  Here are some examples that you can use as you consider your metagame: an environment dominated by Cave Trolls with Hammers/Witch Kings with Pale Blades can be countered by playing Armor or Chain Mail on your Men; an environment dominated by Rangers and archers can be countered by using Ranger-unfriendly sites (plains, marshes, and underground), and by putting into effect anti archery conditions and minions (e.g. Goblin Wallcrawler); an environment dominated by Moria Swarm (unheard of!) can be countered by utilizing a large Fellowship and condition-discarding events.  <br>
<br>
Metagame can be easy: competition against your best friend who you&#39;ve played four times this week. Metagame can be hard: competition against your region--people you&#39;ve never played or even met before.  Regardless, when building a deck be sure to allow some flexibility for alterations according to your environment.  And pack a few extra cards in your card box for last minute metagame changes.<br>
<br>
STRATEGIZE<br>
Now that you&#39;ve got your theme and have considered your local environment its time to figure out how to reach your deck&#39;s goal, and to pick cards and combos that will be both effective and consistent.  Effectiveness will be based primarily on the soundness of your strategy and your card selections.  One strategy that I keep in mind when building my deck is based on sanctuaries: on sites 3 and 6 the Fellowship can heal five wounds. How can I wound the Fellowship beyond what it can heal before it can reach the sanctuary? Or better yet, how can I kill healthy Companions between the sanctuaries?  For the Free Peoples I usually plan how I can get Frodo safely to each sanctuary before making the dangerous trek to site 9.  I plan on having additional companions available to join after site 3 or 4, some beefy boys backing up my starting Fellowship and offering their lives in protection of my preci--er, the One Ring.<br>

CARD SELECTION<br>
I&#39;m ready to pick out my cards. Remember your focus; remember your goal. Pick cards that seem to work well together.  Read the text of your cards carefully so that you don&#39;t make incorrect assumptions.  <br>
<br>
Once you have an idea of what cards you&#39;d like to include, think about how consistent you need to have those cards available, and how you can use card advantage to get you what you need and when you need it.  I won&#39;t get into card advantage too much (for more info, check out Marc Thery&#39;s The Right Cards at the Right Time and Mark Balderston&#39;s articles on Card Advantage), but I will spend some time on how you can make your deck consistent.<br>
<br>
CONSISTENCY<br>
Other than the cards you start with, multiple copies of each card will increase the consistency of your deck. You can even calculate the chances of drawing a single card according to your deck size (minus your starting Fellowship), the number of copies in your deck, and the number of cards you are drawing.  You&#39;ll always draw eight cards to begin with and you always have the opportunity to draw at least one card per turn.  Be sure you have enough multiples of the important cards to get them at the right time; this is card advantage, and plenty of good articles have already been written on it. I will give one rather obvious example based on Frodo.  You start with Frodo. The game as we know it always starts with Frodo. And unless you have some unorthodox strategy based on dumping Frodo site two and making Samwise the sole ringbearer, you will use Frodo for most of the game.  Frodo is a naturally consistent element of your deck.  Compliment this consistency by including multiples of cards that he can use immediately.  Sting is a good selections; 2-3 Stings in a deck will help you boost Frodo&#39;s STR early in the game, and most likely he will keep it throughout. If you&#39;re playing multiple hobbits, Hobbit Swords will indubitably see use so pack in a good ratio (see below). Having multiples will be only more useful in Mines of Moria as the Fellowship will have to face additional possession-discarding minions such as the rare Balrog. Ouch.<br>
<br>
Ratio<br>
Ratio is important to consistency, particularly with possessions and events. Possessions and events must be playable--don&#39;t let them get stuck in your hand! One Boromir and two Blade of Gondors does not make for good consistency unless you start Boromir.  In general, a 3-4/2-3/1-2 ratio should be followed for drawn possessions to characters on which they are playable.  Unique cards should receive special attention as only one can be in play at the same time.  Non-unique cards, such as Armor, can be included at a more liberal ratio according to their necessity.<br>
<br>
Staying Power<br>
Some cards last longer and can be used more times than others while providing the same or similar effect.  A Thror&#39;s Map essentially fills the same function as a Pathfinder, but while Thror&#39;s Map is a (semi-)permanent possession, the Pathfinder is a single-use event. Sure the Pathfinder doesn&#39;t ask you to exert, but is that too much to pay for staying power?  Another example for Shadow: Host of Thousands and They Are Coming both help you dish out the Moria swarm that appears to be dominating the current scene.  They Are Coming will last as long as the opponent allows it to, while Host of Thousands is an event that, though fast, extremely easy to play and inexpensive, may not be as consistently effective or efficient as the related condition.  You have to weigh these issues and decide what will give your deck the maximum efficiency.<br>
<br>
Specialty and Tech Cards<br>
Some cards are specialty (or tech) cards that you will most likely only need to use once or twice in a game.  Two cards come to mind: for the Free Peoples Sleep, Caradras is awesome to wipe out the opponent&#39;s effects, especially mid-game and later when it can cripple the opponent for several turns, and he/she may not be able to fully recover fully. For the Shadow I see cards like Denizens Enraged or Saruman&#39;s Snows as being ultimately effective in highly select situations such as the final battle, and thus even just one card (with the a sufficient ratio of requisite matching cards) in the deck may suffice--just be aware of this and wait until you need it.  Because tech cards are often useful only in very specific situations you do not want to have too many, as you will find yourself holding onto them all, waiting slyly for just the right moment while your hand becomes clogged and your deck sinks deeper into your own treachery.  But the reason a card is considered tech is usually based on how much of an advantage it can give you in the right situation; how badly will it mess up your opponents own strategy?<br>
<br>
PLAY TESTING<br>
When you are satisfied with the first draft of your deck--and that&#39;s all it is at this point--its time to shuffle up and deal it out. Playtesting for gamers like re-reading is for authors; it&#39;s the time to think, observe, and revise. It&#39;s the time to lay yourself bare to the ravages of others and see how well you can take it. Here&#39;s a tip: playtest the first few games against yourself.  This is a habit that the best chess and ccg players practice regularly.  It gives you an inside look at what the opponent sees you playing, and helps you spot the weakness that your new deck may possess.  This is where the first revision should take place. Now go out and find yourself an opponent who&#39;s actually better from you with an opposing deck you don&#39;t know inside and out. <br>
<br>
QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF AFTER PLAYTESTING<br>
<br>
How deep into my deck did I get?<br>
This will tell you if your deck is too fast/slim or too slow/fat.<br>
<br>
Did I draw every card that I wanted to draw at least once?<br>
If not, look at your consistency and equalize by adding more cards or reducing your overall deck size.  Adding a card draw engine like Elrond can also help, as can search cards, e.g. A Wizard Is Never Late.<br>
<br>
How many times did I use X card? How many times could I have used it effectively?<br>
If you use a card each time you draw it, you probably benefit from it as much as you had hoped you would.  Maybe you found yourself at the pointy end of a scimitar because you didn&#39;t have the one event you needed when you needed it.  This problem points to consistency, and can help you decide how many copies of each card you need.<br>
<br>
What cards were useless in my hand? What cards did I drop most often when I reconciled?<br>
 Pay attention; this will tell you what cards you have too many of or which cards you do not need altogether.  <br>
<br>
When I (or my opponent) reached site 9 and the game ended, how many cards were left in my draw deck?  What cards were they?<br>
If, after playtesting, you consistently find yourself with upwards of 20 cards in your draw deck your deck is too big or too slow.  Cut it down.  If your deck consistently has around 8-15 cards when you finishimmerhink you are where you want to be.  If you&#39;re near the 0-5 end remember not to cut your deck too short as there are discard decks out there that can cut your deck down cold.<br>
<br>
If I won did I win by achieving my goal (e.g. overwhelming Frodo, rushing to site 9, etc)? What helped me towards my goal? What didn&#39;t help?<br>
 Just because a card worked in a given game or situation doesn&#39;t mean that it ultimately helped you towards your goal. For example, I may bring out a Nazgul and play events to increase your burdens, but if my goal isn&#39;t to overburden you what&#39;s the point? <br>
<br>
Did my sites help my opponent or me more? If they helped my opponent more than they helped me can I pick more useful or at least more neutral sites?<br>
  For example: If you&#39;re playing Allies don&#39;t be playing Anduin Conference unless you don&#39;t mind discarding them at site 7.  After rebuilding his deck, my friend had forgotten to swap his site 6 before a tournament; we both saw how dramatically and adversely it affected his ability to win across two games.<br>
<br>
Was my opponent a challenge? Was my deck fully tested in an authentic environment?<br>
Don&#39;t be afraid to push your deck to the limits.  If you just test against the newbies at the shop its probably not going to get you too far in a tournament.  Ask the dominant players for a game, try it against the most competitive of the bunch.  Even if you fail to win, the experience will show you what in your deck is effective, what is ineffective, and ultimately improve your skill and performance.<br>
<br>
Was my deck fun to play? <br>
This is for me one of the most important questions to consider, especially since Lord of the Rings CCG is really quite balanced at this stage. If you built a Uruk Hai deck but decide that being damage +1 and occasionally becoming firece is just dull, then maybe switch to something new.  Maybe Sauron Orcs, with their burdening and discardation effects, are more your style. Or try a Moria Swarm where you can construct a complex but elegant cycle of conditions, minions, possessions, and events to overwhelm the opponent.  Or maybe you like the idea of coming out fast and furious, inflicting lots of wounds; if so, Nazgul is the culture of choice for you. Theres plenty of options; go to town!<br>
<br>
<br>
REVISING YOUR DECK<br>
At this point you should be able to make the rest of your revisions on your own.  Let me end with four revision guidelines to help you on your way:<br>
1. Push yourself to the right consistency by adding or dropping multiple copies.<br>
2. Stick to your theme. Stay focused.<br>
3. Trim your deck by taking out the cards that you never or rarely play.<br>
4. Rinse and repeat as desired.<br>
