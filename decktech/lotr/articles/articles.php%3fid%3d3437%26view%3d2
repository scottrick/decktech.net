Section two will focus on the basic of game strategy and introduce the basic tactics of the game. By this point you should have had ample time to use section one to design a deck. Well dont put away your other cards yet because while on paper that deck may shine like a diamond, in an actual game it may sink like a stone. Rare is the deck that keeps the same form from tournament to tournament. For even the best deck design is worthless if it is not accompanied by a strategic mind set that suits it. I wont lie, true strategic power can only be gained through experience and that means if you want to win a lot you have to play a lot. However being prepared with ideas and tactics before a match at least gives you something build from and material to start the search for the type of strategy that fits you. So without wasting anytime lets layout the blue prints.<br>
<br>
Part One: Lead, Follow, or Get Out of the Game<br>
<br>
The first strategic choice open to both players of a Lord of the Rings game is the option of going first or second as the Free Peoples in the game. Some would naively assume that this is as simple as bidding when you want to go first as fellowship and not doing so when you want to go first as shadow. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near that simple. It is entirely possible for both players to want to go first as fellowship and thus a bidding war ensues. Sometimes this is meaningless, as many strong decks do not use burden adding as a strategy and bidding four or even outlandishly bidding five or six never leads to defeat. However, too many decks do in fact have ways of corrupting the ring bearer to make bidding in this manner anything close to safe. Another misconception is the idea that bidding zero will guarantee you will go first as shadow. Just as it is possible for both players to want to start as fellowship, it is equally possible for them to both want to be shadow. When it comes down to it bidding and not bidding at all both have about the same probability of success, but bidding comes at a potentially very high price, while not bidding is free. Therefore, my advice is to bid zero no matter what. There are advantages to starting, as either the fellowship or shadow and your deck should never live or die on just this element, if it does go back to the drawing board. <br>
<br>
Game tips involving bidding:<br>
<br>
1.	Never have your starting companions out before the bid, they might give away a piece of your strategy and alter your opponents bid.<br>
2.	Certain bids and start choices sometimes imply strategies look for them and take note. For example if an opponent bids high and chooses to go first as shadow, he is probably playing Nazgul. This isnt always true but in my experience being prepared for Nazgul at site 2 and finding a Moria orc instead is better than being caught by Nelya unawares. <br>
3.	Oddly enough, many people fear their own shadow deck the most. For example, someone bidding exactly two is usually playing Nazgul with swords. Make note of these tendencies too.<br>
<br>
Part Two: Getting Started<br>
If You Start Fellowship:<br>
<br>
Well, you are bold! Choosing to start as the fellowship is taken for granted as the best of all things when in fact it starts you in the most dangerous position. Your fellowship will be forced to survive this turn on nothing but the luck of your first draw and your skill of play. Odds are unless your party falls along the track or you ever so wisely packed some site playing/changing cards in your deck, you will never see any of your sites. You will play most of the game on the opponents battlefields. Always remember this. However, you will also usually know your opponents primary game strategy before he knows yours.<br>
<br>
Game tips for fellowship starters:<br>

1.	This could be your safest turn of the game as far as minion fighting goes. Do not be too afraid to play the companions, allies, and items you draw. Odds are that this is your best chance at getting these cards on the table without paying too horrible a price. <br>
2.	Try not to play too many powerful event cards this early unless they specifically target roaming minions. As stated this turn is relatively safe, ever turn here after will not be so. <br>
3.	Getting to site three safely first turn is pretty much a staple of any good deck (hobbit hop decks excluded of course). Always tire your best to make it to site three as soon as possible.<br>

If You Start Shadow:<br>
<br>
Going first as shadow is a very intriguing tactic. Your sites will usually be seen for the rest of the game and that gives you a good advantage. Your first attack on the opponent is more then likely going to be futile but do not pass it up as it does serve a purpose (card cycling). Your going to be getting one and most likely two chances to setup your first fellowship turn as a big success. <br>
<br>
Game tips for shadow starters:<br>
<br>
1.	Strike, do not try to swarm. Your best bet at sites two and three is a precision strike rather than a horde tactic. Your odds of doing any lasting damage this turn are better if you send out a single pumped-up guy rather than a few weaker guys at the same cost. The damage from three guys attacking three companions will likely be healed at site three next turn, but overwhelming a single companion with a strong minion is permanent.<br>
2.	Remember where you roam. Roaming sucks and during this turn unless you are playing Nazgul and drew Nelya, you are going to be roaming. This means extra twilight costs and the fellowship playing cards that really suck for you. With this in mind it is sometimes better to play your conditions to the table with your twilight now and your minions later if possible.<br>
3.	If possible, hold them at site two. Making it to site three is usually very easy, if you can prevent this from happening you have seriously hurt the opponent and opened the door to a second or third turn victory or at the very least an early death to a companion.<br>

Part Three: To Infinity And Beyond<br>
<br>
Well now your off and running, so what about the rest of the game. Well it all comes down to three basic things from here on out. First, card knowledge, go to decipher or decktechs website and read the entire card list again and again (even the ones you dont have) until you know them by heart. The best protection from a card combo or trap is to already know about it before it is played. If your opponent plays a card, you do not remember, read it immediately and then look it up again to memorize it after the tournament. To be forewarned is to be forearmed people. Second, do the math, be a human calculator if you have to. The battle scenarios of Lord of the Rings come down to simple probability and basic addition and subtraction. To master these fields of mathematics, is to master the battle system. It is important not only to estimate your companion/minions strength before a fight but also the maximum potential strength of you opponents fighter. Finally, play as if it was poker. The third key element to card game strategy is the poker mechanic. A strong player will always know when to hold a minion or companion in hand, when to play them, and when to simple discard them. There is no real guide how to do this for any deck as this element applies differently for each deck. A general rule however is to always be playing out your weakest cards throughout the game. Discard your strong cards if drawn early (unless you only play one or two, then you end up holding them a long time), hold them if drawn midway, and play them late game. Moderately powerful cards are held early, played midway, and generally discarded late game.<br>

Fellowship Game Tips:<br>
<br>
1.	This is not a movie or book it is a game. Do not try to make it through every game without losing a companion or two. It would be nice to do so, but it is not necessary. One of the most common mistakes Ive seen is people wasting cards to save companions who will only die a turn later. Cheap deploy hobbits, dwarves, and elves make excellent late game bullet biters (remember the nine companion play limit though). <br>
2.	Frodo is not a god. It is not necessary for Frodo to live to win the game and sometimes your better off with him dead. If Frodo is up to three wounds or maybe eight burdens, dump the chump. Let him die in battle and give the ring to Sam. Neither wounds nor burdens carry over to the new ring-bearer. Remember that this however is not always wise against Nazgul with their new Sam game-text canceling card ouch.<br>
3.	Aimed archery is your advantage and your folly. Use Legolas and Aragorns Bow wisely. Remember that for the most part exerting and taking a wound are the same. Why exert twice to eliminate a threat that could only deal you two wounds?<br>
4.	Do not limit your options by holding bullet cards. It is always better to play a moderately powerful card that will be effective no matter what the opponent plays then one that will kill hard if they play a certain race of minion or does a certain thing. <br>
5.	Save your best stuff for sites 5, 7, 8, and 9. These are the worst sites for the fellowship and should be viewed and tread with caution. <br>
<br>
Shadow Game Tips:<br>
<br>
1.	Minions are chumps. No minion is worth holding in hand all game. Even the Balrog, Witch-King, and Cave Troll do more harm than good if you hold them to long waiting for the perfect time to play them. Minions are meant to be played on demand and discarded otherwise, holding certain minions is fine sometimes but generally try not to hold a minion for more than a turn or two.<br>
2.	Weapons? If you play weapons in your deck, you must have a special strategic reason. Playing minion weapon is usually only useful if you are trying to overwhelm a specific companion or companions. Remember this when decided to play or toss them (Goblin Scimitars of course are always best played).<br>
3.	Deal out the pain. Even if your deck relies more on your fellowship making site nine them you getting the ring, it will fail if your shadow doesnt find some way to do significant damage to or hamper the opponent. When possible find ways to be fierce, damage +1, swarm, fire archery, overwhelm anything that hurts.<br>
4.	Archery bad? In general, archery usually ends up hurting the shadow more than helping it. However, remember that if the opponent does not play aimed archery, yours will hit them first. Four Goblin Bowmen at the right site eight can equal eight points of direct damage.<br>
5.	Men, Elves, and Dwarves are your competition but Hobbits are your targets. It is better to focus on kill hobbits then fighting off their guardian. There are large assortments of cards that harm Hobbits (including the ring-bearer) even outside of battle. Remember that if you cant see a Hobbit in front of your opponent you have won.<br>
6.	Burdening the ring-bearer is an often-overlooked method of winning the game. Keep in mind that it is usually much harder for the opponent to rid himself of burdens than it is to rid himself of wounds. <br>
<br>
Well, that is it for now. Be sure to look for the third and final installment of this series in the future. It will cover the application of game theory, militaristic principles, and psychology in game play. Hope you enjoyed the read.<br>
