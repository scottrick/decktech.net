There were no awkward lines. There were no awkward pauses. Besides being a superb Oscar-caliber performance, it was authentic original Boromir, straight from the book, maybe even better than the book. <br>
<br>
Boromir is the the best dynamic character in the movie; he changes considerably from beginning to end, especially in his relationship to Aragorn. The way his attitude towards Aragorn&#39;s right to be his King goes through a complete reversal in the movie, and the way he acts it out is perfect. We have just enough of a view of his internal mind to connect with him in his struggle to do what&#39;s right for his people and his city. <br>
<br>
The friction between Aragorn and Boromir in the movie was great. Boromir first saying &quot;We don&#39;t need your kind,&quot; and snubbing him every chance, but then by the time they arrive in Lorien Boromir is all &quot;Yeah, we gonna go back to my city and we&#39;ll be the Lords of Gondor, you and me.&quot; But Aragorn shrugs him off with &quot;yeah, i&#39;ve seen your town...,&quot; clearly indicating that he is not eager to approach Gondor as its King. By the time Boromir dies, he has understood Aragorn more, has gotten to know him better, and sincerely wants him to be King of Gondor. This change in opinion is brought about mainly because his dying thought is still for his city, Minas Tirith, and his dying hope is that Aragorn will save it from Mordor. This is a really great move on Jackson&#39;s part, he really smashes that subtle character interaction home and makes it work.<br>
<br>
Even though Boromir is overcome by the power of the Ring, we still support him because we know he only wants it so he can save his people. he sees the Council&#39;s plan as utter foolishness, to let this child carry the Ring straight into Mordor where Sauron will undoubtedly recover it. And when Galadriel basically reveals that he&#39;s the one who can cause the quest to fail and the Enemy to win...that&#39;s too much for him, because he thinks that what he&#39;s planning to do is right. Not until he attacks Frodo and Frodo puts on the Ring to run from him does he finally see what he&#39;s doing...that he *is* going to destroy the quest. And so he struggles for some way to save it: defending Merry and Pippin from capture. <br>
<br>
Merry and Pippin are much maligned for their role in Boromir&#39;s death, but Jackson brought it out excellently in the movie. What they were doing was not passively allowing Boromir to die saving them, they were actually saving Frodo from the Uruks. Don&#39;t forget that they didn&#39;t know Saruman had told the Uruks not to kill them. They thought these guys were out for Hobbit blood, and they were willing to sacrifice themselves to give Frodo a chance at escaping, knowing that they won&#39;t be able to rejoin him. Pretty tough choice for two of his best friends. They actively consigned themselves to death for the good of the quest, and in the end were captured instead.<br>
<br>
Some people say that in the book, Aragorn finds Boromir surrounded by a &quot;mountain&quot; of foes that he has slain, and the movie does not adequately represent that. Did they miss the scene, right after Boromir&#39;s death speech, when we get the wide camera angle as Legolas and Gimli run up and Aragorn is still holding Boromir&#39;s body? There were Uruk bodies *EVERYWHERE* and you know that it wasn&#39;t because Merry and Pippin were fighting...every time we saw them they were just standing there. Boromir knocked out an incredible number of Uruks, and he would have won too if Lurtz hadn&#39;t been such a coward and shot him full of arrows. Even then it took quite a few to put him down for good.<br>
<br>
I find it very interesting how the death scene of Boromir was played out in the movie. In the book, we hear his horn and then later Aragorn comes upon him dying. In the book no narrative is given of his final fight, and i think that&#39;s one of the things that translated so well to the screen that they couldn&#39;t just leave it alone like the book did. In addition, the use of sound was simply amazing. By dulling all the sounds so low, and with the total absence of music (as i recall...), watching Boromir fight with those arrows in him forces the audience to help create the film. What I mean: when you watch it, the sound is dulled so much that your mind automatically adds its own sound effects to the performance. It is a very subtle bit of movie magic, but it draws the audience in so far that they actually take part in the movie in a very real way. <br>
<br>
And yes, i cried too...<br>

I&#39;m taking Shakespeare in college this quarter, and we recently went over the necessary ingredients in Shakespeare&#39;s Tragedies. Specifically, we looked at Richard II, but applied the principles to Othello and Hamlet as well. The interesting thing is that each and every principle of Shakespearean Tragedy may be found in Boromir&#39;s character. <br>
<br>
Every Shakespeare Tragedy hero is high-born, a king or noble or general or something. Boromir is the son and heir to the Steward of Gondor (basically a king without a crown). <br>
<br>
Every Shakespeare Tragedy hero has a Hamartia, a character flaw or judgement flaw that both makes him (or her, as Cleopatra) attractive as well as causes him/her to make serious mistakes that bring about his/her downfall. Boromir&#39;s Hamartia, his character flaw, is his strength, his will to defend his people and his willingness to do anything to save his city. It makes him attractive as a character because we feel that strength and we know that he&#39;s capable of saving them (heck, this guy can massacre Uruks like nobody&#39;s business), but that willingness to save his people also causes him to lust after the Ring. <br>
<br>
Every Shakespeare Tragedy hero makes that one wrong decision, rooted in their Hamartia, that sends them down the path that ultimately leads to death. Boromir decided to take the Ring, because he thought that by doing so he could save his city. He wasn&#39;t trying to steal the ring for himself; his cry was, &quot;I only ask for the power to save my people!&quot;<br>
<br>
Every Shakespeare Tragedy hero, before the end, comes to understand his/her Hamartia, understand the effect it has had on all decisions, understand that it is leading to a downfall. This is called the Tragic Epiphany. Boromir&#39;s comes when Frodo puts on the Ring and runs, and he&#39;s left standing there with leaves in his hair saying &quot;Frodo...Frodo? What have I done?&quot; <br>
<br>
Every Shakespeare Tragedy hero takes steps to atone for their mistakes before they finally die. Boromir dies saving the Hobbits, freely admitting that he tried to take the Ring and that he failed the Fellowship. <br>
<br>
I found it quite amazing that Jackson managed to bring all of that out so clearly in Fellowship of the Ring, and that Sean Bean evidently understood it well enough to perform flawlessly an essentially Shakespearean role. just another reason why i hope Fellowship takes Best Picture Oscar and Bean gets Best Supporting Actor.<br>

Thanks for reading my informal analysis of Boromir&#39;s character in the movie Fellowship of the Ring. I realize it&#39;s not gameplay related, but some of the best Star Wars articles I&#39;ve read had not a thing to do with the game. I look forward to seeing your comments and observations about Boromir in the reviews section.<br>
