This is from the perspective that you want to reach Site 9 first. Shadow influences and factors are not discussed or taken into consideration.<br>
<br>
There are realistically only two practical and easy ways to win the game in this TCG: Getting to Site 9 first or overwhelming your opponent with your shadow. The latter option is feasible mostly for Moria, a strong culture that can afford to let the Fellowship slug along slowly while the shadow concentrates on swarming the opponent, or Sauron, who can really weigh down the Fellowship in the latter stages, but for other minion cultures, most notably Nazgul and Isengard, they aim to slow down the opponent&#39;s fellowship more than destroying it in order to reach Site 9 first.<br>
<br>
And so, how do you get to Site 9 first? Simple, you must go to Site 6 first, no questions asked. Reach Site 6 second, and you&#39;ve more or less lost. I dare to say that if you reach Site 6 first, there&#39;s only at most a 10% chance your opponent can overtake you to beat you to the punch. You will reach Site 9 first. (note that surviving Site 9 is a totally different matter)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
WHY?<br>
<br>
<br>
Simply because the person who reaches Site 6 first will dictate the pace for the rest of the game. From Site 6, barring very rare exceptions, Site 9 is three sites away. If the person who reaches Site 6 first chooses to double-move on one of his remaining 2 Fellowship 2 turns, there is no way that the other player can catch up, and he must instead utilise his shadow half.<br>
<br>
And most of the time, both players are going to stop at Site 6. It is directly after the Bridge, and huge beatings go on down there in the underground. The Bridge is where the huge twilight number combined with the number of companions floods the twilight pool to benefit all shadow cultures. Nazgul can put down at least 2 minions, Isengard stops roaming and drops their hand, often twilight-choked in the earlier sites. Sauron uses the huge twilight number and trackers to get down some respectable resistance, and Moria...expect at least 6 minions. Site 5 is where Moria decks often win or soften up the fellowship enough for another big swarm later on.<br>
<br>
Many fellowships get out of the bridge heavily wounded and half-dead. They have to stop at the sanctuary and regroup and satisfy their voyeuristic tendencies by peeping at Galadriel. Thus is it rare to see a fellowship speeding right past Lothlorien. It is unfeasible, and after Site 5, it&#39;s the calm of the storm. Yet, you want to jump from one precipice to another, into Site 7?<br>
<br>
From Site 6, it is straightforward. The fellowship which sets off first will make a single-move or double-move judging by the situation. The second player will move, often insignificantly. On the next turn, the first player can dictate the pace. Should he double or single-move into Site 9 to finish the race first, or if he is at Site 7, should he just move once and concentrate on swarming the opponent next turn? The second player will have no luxury of this choice and can only try to destroy the opponent&#39;s fellowship.<br>
<br>
No, Gift of Boats will not help for the second player because it requires you to &quot;Spot the felloship at a river during the FELLOWSHIP PHASE to make the move limit +1 for the rest of this turn&quot;. Shores of Nen Hithoel can assist slightly with its huge twilight number or if the fellowship stops at Site 7, by preventing the Fellowship from moving when it reaches Site 8. If he double-moves to Site 8, however, there is nothing you can do with the Shores.<br>
<br>
Simply put, the Fellowship will almost always win if it reaches Site 6 first. Put your objective to reach Site 6 first, and relatively and ultimately, your chances of reaching Site 9 first are very, very high.<br>

So, how do I get to Site 6 first?<br>
<br>
If you start first, the race will be easier, with you controlling the pace. If you start second however, recognise that sooner or later before Lothlorien, you MUST make at least one double-move to overtake your opponent before Site 6.<br>
<br>
For double-moving, grab your chances. Site 1 to 3 is a popular choice barring against Nazgul decks (Nazgul however, barring if they have Ulaire Nelya in their hand, will usually stop at Site 2 too if you stop there to try to get their Ford into play). Skipping the Site 3 sanctuary, unlike Site 6, is also a viable option if you&#39;re only running perhaps 1 or 2 wounds (and not on your vital characters like Greenleaf or Aragorn), have a strong Fellowship, have few minions after your blood or have no wounds. Your opponent will usually not expect that waltzing past Rivendell. Triple-moving or, um, Quadruple-moving thanks to Bree Gates and Rivendell Waterfall can also give you a HUGE leg up and let you laugh at your opponent.<br>
<br>
Double-Triple-Quadruple-moving into Site 5, however, is a risk that a lot of LotR players disapprove of, and examples of this foray gone wrong are very plain to see in tournament reports and personal experiences and such, but it can still be risked. If you have disposed of all his minions (note: ALL!), are doing well on wounds, and there is very little twilight floating in the pool (very little means 1 or none), MOVE IT!<br>
<br>
Double-moving into Site 6 can be VERY viable if you play with Site 6 allies. Galadriel, Celeborn, Rumil, Orophin and Uruviel can help block those minions for you. Don&#39;t be worried if there are 1 or 2 minions left over from Site 5, your allies can help. Heck, even if there&#39;s just a single Cave Troll left, you can still consider it if you have a lot of allies waiting to welcome you on Site 6. A few of them dead will not matter. (e.g. if your opponent doesn&#39;t play Uruks, let Orophin die protecting you). Screw those allies for being good-intentioned and helping you. Stab &#39;em in the back. Bite the hand that feeds you. Feed them as snacks to the Cave Troll. Let Lurtz sodomize Celeborn. Hear Galadriel scream as she is ravaged by the Witch-King. SCREW THEM! THE RING IS MINE!<br>
<br>
Treat Site 6 as Site 9. Do not let your opponent get there first. If, however, you are burdened with a huge group of minions and are like 2 or 3 sites behind, forget it. A fellowship last in the race is better than a fellowship dead. End your turn, cry, and make sure you destroy him with your shadow culture.<br>
<br>
<br>
YIKES! I forgot that the next site was Galadriel&#39;s wh0rehouse and didn&#39;t double-move! My opponent got Galadriel&#39;s services first and had them FREE! HELP!<br>
<br>
<br>
All is not lost. I will offer 2 solutions, excluding destroying him with shadow. First and foremost, the triple-move.<br>
<br>
I think it sucks.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s see the ways you can move three times at the end of the race. As I said above, Gift of Boats CANNOT help.<br>
<br>
-Silinde bearing the text of Rivendell Waterfall<br>
<br>
That&#39;s the only example I can think of, which is a possible back-up if you plan to stay behind your opponent. Silinde can be used for Support of the Last Homely House and the need to spot YOUR OWN Site 3 (opponent&#39;s Rivendell Waterfall does not count, read Silinde&#39;s text) can be solved with Ulaire Nelya, Paths Seldom Trodden, Thror&#39;s Map or Pathfinder, or um, moving slower than your opponent.<br>
<br>
Next is the stupid way. The foolish way. The unadvised way. The...but then the whole Quest was foolish. Elrond himself stated that the west was ever the safe way and therefore Sauron would watch it and therefore they had to move south, right into the lion&#39;s mouth, where Sauron would never expect them to go. YES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! Skip Site 6 totally!<br>
<br>
Yep, after all that talking about stopping at Site 6, I tell you to skip it. No, don&#39;t heal, don&#39;t check out Galadriel&#39;s wh0res. This, however, is a desperation maneuver that will be discussed below. To define a desperation maneuver is that you haven&#39;t won a bloody skirmish and your opponent&#39;s fellowship is blowing you away like dust. You know you can&#39;t kill Frodo and wipe that ugly smirk off his mug. The only hope you have is to reach Site 9 first. In this case, stopping at Site 6 can perhaps, say, prevent the death of Aragorn after you heal him, but it will lose you the game. Skip the sanctuary, Aragorn may die, but you may still touch the wall first with a breathless Frodo.<br>
<br>
The most tempting factor to skip Site 6 is to, again, have few wounds, and more importantly, few minions chasing you (Gondor&#39;s Vengeance and Pursuit Just Behind anybody? Puke, never mind). Again, Site 6 allies to welcome you at Lorien can help in lowering the minion survival count. Again, screw them as you forego the hospitality of Caras Galadhon. Tell Celeborn you need the toilet and jump out of the window into Site 7.<br>
<br>
Double-moving from Site 5 to Site 7 is dangerous, for the simple fact that you are jumping from danger to danger. Site 7 onwards is where shadow really gets dangerous.<br>
<br>
Another factor to consider skipping Site 6 is if you have unfair cards in your hand like A Ranger&#39;s Versatility or Power According to His Stature. With those in hand and a few big fighters, you have nothing to lose, literally meaning you will more or less lose nothing.<br>
<br>
Skipping Site 6 is very unexpected, simply because it is STUPID to do so. That&#39;s why you counter fire with fire. Do it as your last resort, when you really cannot overwhelm him with Shadow, when you really believe you can do without removing 5 wounds, yet soak up more by speeding, and most importantly, when you are 100% sure your fellowship will not die.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. Many a time have I found myself in games with the odds pinned against me but at the end, my opponent laments letting me &quot;running away&quot; and commenting how I seemed to have got a lucky win. I simply follow the rule of reaching Site 6 first and if failing, reach Site 7 first.<br>

If your fellowship gets destroyed in scrambling to Site 6 first or scrambling to catch up, don&#39;t come crying to me. Tear up the Fellowship half of your deck, making doubly sure that there is an Arwen foil in there and blame yourself. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3289&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
