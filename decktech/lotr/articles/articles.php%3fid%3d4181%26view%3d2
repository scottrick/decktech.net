<br>
Besides the fact this Ring has by far a better picture than the Fellowship set, you may find this ring to be more popular than you may of first thought.<br>
<br>
Nothing will ever beat the wide use of Isildurs Bane, in many ways this first rare ring will still be the most used and most sort after Ring. However the choice of this new Ring will complicate the issue for a number of decks.<br>
<br>
Any Hobbit deck will have to give this ring some serious thought, or a deck where Frodo is going to be a skirmisher! Increasing the vitality of Frodo to 6 and then even 7 if you play a copy of Escape and Frodo becomes incredible. So then is Isildurs Bane that much better?<br>
<br>
You score basically 5 wounds (10 burdens) with the Bane and one extra vitality, if you play Escape in open play then that is 6. So in total Frodo can handle 11 wounds (presuming the bid is nothing). With the Answer to all Riddles you can score anywhere from 12 wounds to 20 depending on how you use the skirmish abilities of the ring. So at the base level you can still take one more wound than the Bane.<br>
<br>
The draw back is obviously burdens are out of the question if not in a skirmish, so the Bane makes up that one wound easily. However the new Ring still gives a +2 strength when used. You also have some very simple and widely useable burden removal now, especially with the new Frodo, Tired Traveller. One can imagine pumping Frodo up with the Ring and a sword so as to not be overwhelmed, then taking anywhere up to four wounds from a Damage+1 and Fierce Uruk as burdens and then having them removed very easily. Burden removal also becomes more of an issue as the majority of hobbit cards now read add a burden to do something really useful. <br>
<br>
Some interesting questions to be answered when it comes to deck construction now, I think many decks will choose the new Ring, but with the new Archery mechanics the meta may change again and who knows what might happen next!<br>
<br>
Dunland.<br>
<br>
Nothing like a strong story based rabble of ugly men! The culture is a reflection of the unorganised and violent Dunlendings that live off the pleasure of pain. Based on the idea of winning Skirmishes to set off a chain of events, the Dunland culture can be difficult to get going, but once it does it really packs a punch.<br>
<br>
Most of the culture has an average strength of around 8-9, but they come with a vitality of one (some have 2, but not many). This makes pumpers, possession removal and anti-archery the key to the strategy. Burn Every Village, Dark Fire and Death to the Strawheads are quite lethal pumpers while Secret Folk and War Club are some of the best possession removal you will see next to the Grima bomb.<br>
<br>
However ignoring all that, to get the best out of these men you need site control. With site control your pumpers become more powerful, events become easier, you can generate enormous amounts of twilight, and winning skirmishes is more achievable. The problem is to take sites you need to first win skirmishes. <br>
<br>
This will be the problem that plagues a Dunland player  how to best win skirmishes early to get sites. The adventure path helps out with some anti-archery for Dunland Men and one would be mad to ignore that so the rest is left to the luck if the draw and getting the right minions and pumpers early to win. In that respect cards like Arsonist and Wild Man of Dunland in combo with Wulf or Ransacker will be the most desirable. <br>
<br>
Saruman also makes a cameo, and whilst potent with a card like No Retreat at site 5 that can allow you to play Saruman from your draw deck, he seems a little odd. Something tells me the Current Rare Saruman that prevents wounds to Uruks would have been a far better choice for the Dunland Men, someone was not thinking in my opinion. Still Rabble-rouser will see play as he can provide more pumping action and can slow a Fellowship down!<br>
<br>
In short this culture is difficult, Hides, Over the Isen and most of the pumpers are very good but difficult to get their combinations right with enough twilight. It is only once you get the sites under control and the right cards like No Refuge that all of these cards become extremely potent and one of the better skirmishing Swarms available. Not a culture for those who are weak in the deck construction department!<br>
<br>
Dwarven.<br>
<br>
Card stacking is the new strategy with Gimli, and pumpers are what it is all about. Deck manipulation is generally in terms of the Free-Peoples left solely to the Dwarves or more accurately Gimli, yes Gimli is the only dwarf in the Tow Towers set.<br>
<br>
Gimlis new Axe allows you to dump a card stack on a Dwarven condition to make him Strength+1. Essentially your deck can become Gimli pumpers! So use this to pump Gimli to skirmish winning proportions and then use cards like My Axe is Notched to make these temporary strength bonuses more permanent. This means discarding the cards is not so bad, but it also means you need to play with Legolas and Final Count. <br>
<br>
Yes, Gimli is very bound to playing with Legolas in this set. Cards like My Axe is Notched, Quick As May Be, Khazad Ai-menu and the common Gimli all revolve around the Legolas connection. The rest of this set revolves around stacking cards on conditions and pumping Gimli up. So the conclusion is that at least it Towers block play Gimli is a Legolas support companion and vice versa! This is not such a bad thing as My Axe is Notched and Final Count make them both lethal skirmishes, but it is very theme based and limiting.<br>
<br>
You can always try the Dwarf/Hobbit regime with Gimli, Lockbearer! It seems logical however that this works best with another of the three hunters especially as he has the Aragorn signet! <br>
<br>
If your also worried about all those cards that used underground sites form the Fellowship then this would be a good time to suggest Moria. Play Dark Fire to get those Underground sites out and then you may fin Dwarf of the Mountain Race and a lot of those Fellowship support cards become very useful in this site path. Site 6 and 7 are the underground sites, so imagine being able to heal every Dwarf when moving then? You would make site 8 wound free (almost) giving you greater options.<br>
<br>
Much is to be explored here and the mechanic of card stacking is yet to be proven, yet another area for experts in deck construction to play with.<br>
<br>
Elven.<br>
The first thing you will notice is the sheer number of companions in this set for the Elves, 12 choices including the two different versions of Legolas. By far the greatest push to have a entirely all Elven Fellowship. As we all know however, the Elves were not exactly the best fighters in Fellowship and with extras like Lorien Elf they could not make up a Fellowship at all. Well have no fear, there are no more Lorien Elves to pretend to be something useful, everything hear has something worth looking into.<br>
<br>
Firstly you will notice more Skirmish events to aid in winning, Arrow and Blade, Feathered or Supporting Fire are all stock standard skirmish support cards. Nothing outstanding, but then again nothing is. There is a new Elven Bow that does the same as the Fellowship version and this time we have a generic Elven Sword giving +1 to strength and allowing (Like Gwemegil) for you to dump cards to make a minion strength-1. Then you can use Lembas to return a full hand after dumping it, giving you the chance to move on!<br>
<br>
The first important thing to note however is the bow makes your Elves far more potent in combat. In the majority of cases when the Elves are bearing a ranged weapon they dont add to the archery total but they gain strength and Damage bonuses. Again nothing brilliant, just standard, but it is all adding up. <br>
<br>
Next to note is the versatility of the events like Sword-wall or Night without end. They are set up for a purpose but allow you to use them to wound a minion as a secondary effect. A nice bonus and good against hand clog! If youre also looking at a way to combat the possession removal, you may want to take a look at Elven Brooch. It remains to be seen if it is really useful, but you may want to check it out.<br>
<br>
You will also notice the Gimli tie in cards with Final Count and Legolas, Elven Comrade but that is really about all. Overall however this set is about making Elves function by themselves as a culture rather than in support of another deck strategy. However, with the lack of anything totally outstanding and the fact that both copies of Legolas work with other cultures only, you may find yourself ignoring most of this to start with. This may be an idea someone picks up on a little later on. Oh and as a point of note, there are potentially sites at plains, so bring on Arwen & Asfaloth baby!<br>
<br>
Gandaleasterlingain Gandalf is probably the most potent and powerful skirmisher on the side of the Free-Peoples, and again he is probably taking up too many cards in your deck.<br>
<br>
The common Gandalf with his walking staff will see a tonne of play unless everyone starts using the Raiders heavily. Strength + 3 and Damage + 2 if you can spot 3 twilight tokens is wicked, give him shadowfax and all of a sudden he deals around 4 wounds in a victorious skirmish. Then you can play Under the living Earth and get +1 strength for each token (limit 5). So if you already spot 3 then potentially Gandalf is strength 13 companion at Damage +2 and dealing a wound with Shadowfax! <br>
<br>
He also comes with some awesome healing; Have Patience at a cost of three heals twice any unbound companion including him (hey trust me just got more useful, and so did Aragorn, ROTN and Legolas, Greenleaf). Keep your forked Tounge and Long I fell may also come in handy as it can not only save a companion, but it helps to spot those 3 tokens at the right time. <br>
<br>
Grown Suddenly tall is still not as good as Sleep, Caradhras and Roll of Thunder now gives Gandalf some possession and artifact removal! It also costs 3 and plays in the Maneuvre phase (*smile). Gandalf is also given some cards to deal with Swarm in Mithrandir, Mithrandir!, Task was not Done and Wizardry Indeed, but perhaps this is best for open play where Moria will still be present.<br>
<br>
Stump and Bramble is also the only way to get an Ent up to skirmish outside of home sites. The only pain here is that there is one Ent, Treebeard and he generally only helps with Unbound Hobbits. This brings me to the Rare Gandalf who seems quite strong in an Unbound Hobbit discard deck, but something tells me there will be issues regarding skirmishes involving Frodo in this kind of deck at the moment. We will all need to sit back and watch the meta and how this kind of deck evolves, at this point it is too hard to tell.<br>
<br>
Gondor.<br>
<br>
Two things to look at here, Unbound (Aragorn) and Ring-Bound Rangers! <br>
<br>
You will note another major factor here in this set, no Rare Aragorn (just like the common Gandalf is the better of his copies). Aragorn, Heir of Elendil is a watered down version of Ranger of the North and accessible to those with little money, you may find this guy getting a lot of play in the standard Trust Me decks as now those without all the cards have an option to include him. Then the Premiun Aragorn is another unbound Hobbit spotter that can wound a minion each move for each one you can spot. At this point in time one has to wonder at the idea of the unbound hobbit strategy, because if you used each companion that works with unbound Hobbits you would end up with seven of them. Something tells me (as I mentioned in the Gandalf section) that the unbound Hobbit theme is just not that refined and needs more work before anyone really gets going with it. There is too much danger from cards like Savagery and Death to the Strawheads to even think about it for now.<br>
<br>
Working with Aragorn is Boromirs Gauntlets, which can be useful if the twilight is low, Defend it and Hope and Ithilien Trap allow a function similar to Aragorns Bow except two wounds if it is an Uruk. Then Hard Choice, like Gandalfs Have Patience gives an Aragorn signet deck some really potent healing and combined with King in Exile can be very potent in open play.<br>
<br>
Aragorns new sword too is rather potent now you must choose between damage+1 from the Fellowship sword or +2 against all Uruks. This can be tough and will depend on the meta in your area, but something tells me with the amount of Uruks out there and the fact that they are currently the best shadow culture that this sword will see a lot of play.<br>
<br>
Faramir and his Ring-Bound Rangers then bring a whole new strategy to the game, separating themselves from the rest of the game and consequently preventing any chance of using these guys with other Free-Peoples cultures they provide the best chance of a single culture Fellowship. Aimed mainly against Men and roaming minions, these guys are quite potent and can provide an easy path right up until site 8 in some cases.<br>
<br>
There main strength is in making minions roaming during skirmishes with cards like Gondorian Ranger and New Errand then using that to gain benefits as the case is for the rare Faramir or their bows. Their bows also help kill off Raiders and they totally destroy the Dunland Men. You can use a number of Hobbit tie in cards that I will look at in the Hobbit section that also help the Ring-Bound strategy. <br>
<br>
There are some site specific conditions that provide support at sites 5-7 that also have a secondary effect to make them more appealing. These conditions can solve a number of problems you may encounter on the site path, and especially considering that Gondorian Ranger and Ranger of Ithilien are not uniqe you can solve the site 7 problem (if they play Cavern Entrance) with Ruins of Osgiliath. Soak up everything on these companions then simply play them again in the next turn.<br>
<br>
Overall Ring-Bound rangers, which are not rare heavy and hence out of reach of the casual player will see a lot of play and may become one of the staple deck types around the scene. This is well worth a look for anyone and currently appears to be one of the most talked about strategies for the set.<br>
<br>
Isengard.<br>
<br>
Three areas to look at here: Archers, fighters and Trackers, each with their own mechanic and problems to overcome.<br>
<br>
The first thing to note about the Archers is most of them are also Damage+1. So like Lurtz and Orthanc Assasin, they are doubling up on wounds on companions that have already taken a pile from archery. Plus if you are playing Towers block only and there is no Isildurs Bane, you have an extra potency forcing wounds on your opponent.<br>
<br>
There are a number of events too, such as Cloud of Arrows, Driven Back or Volley Fire that make Archery total higher of force wounds onto Unbound companions. You will also notice that a number of Isengard Archers have an exert to wound for unbound companions only. Certainly this means Ring-bound get out of it, but it becomes like Hate for every other deck, and this is by far the most potent aspect about them! Imagine playing these guys with Saruman, Keeper of Isengard?? You can make them deal wounds with archery or direct archery and then deal damage+1 in two skirmishes (Fierce) compounding the problem and causing decks that rely on exertions (Trust me comes to mind) against the wall.<br>
<br>
Come Down is a simple solution to allies as well, turning the archery fire onto allies only. This provides Isengard with something is has not gained yet but restricts it to archery decks. Finally you get a machine this time, but you can only use one card to make the machine work. Uruk Crossbow Troop puts tokens on the machine and the machine can boost the archery total even more. <br>
<br>
Something tells me Lurtz will be big again and something tells me you will see a lot of this around early on!<br>
<br>
The fighting Uruks this time get to play with Site control for benefits and they also look for the keyword Battleground. Advanced Uruk Patrol for instance is quite strong at strength 10 for a cost of 5, but if you control a Battleground he becomes strength 14 and very powerful. <br>
<br>
You get a number of chances to grab some sites, with tokens on conditions like Down to the Last Child which is easy to get going and may make a Dunland/Isengard deck a thing to look into! Then if you get some sites you can run riot with cards like Pillage of Rohan that stops the Free-Peoples player form using skirmish special abilites or events. This is almost unfair as Grima wipes out possessions, then Pillage wipes out everything else, leaving the companions at their base strength! Beware Fellowship players; these fighting Uruks are going to thump you fast if you cant handle site control.<br>
<br>
Saruman is also a fighter now with his staff, but I cant imagine anyone really bothering with him as a fighter right now so there is no point looking into this yet.<br>
<br>
Finaly Isengard Trackers, who will make the common Saruman from fellowship, look really good! The first thing I saw was Get Back, that prevents an Isengard tracker from being assigned full stop and wondered  what? Then I saw still they come and noticed that you could use a tracker like Mauhur to pump another tacker up by three and then because he is not in a skirmish, you are assured of being able to use his ability as he wont die in a skirmish.<br>
<br>
The next thing to note is the trackers are fierce and if they make it to the fierce phase some score a strength +3 and damage +1. They have only a vitality of one, but with the common Saruman, you can assign them to the smaller companions first off and hope to get away with it. Pump them up with Vengence as well if they are up against a larger companion and you start to get on top of your opponent. The fierce ability may be the way to get around the armour decks out there! Next too is that some of them prevent unbound hobbits from being discarded, but like I have already said that may not be such a worry early on anyway, until someone works out how to use them.<br>
<br>
Another use for the Common Saruman is with Search cards and a Tracker like Uruk Searcher. Play Weary on a companion, and then assign Uruk Searcher to him so he is strength +2 and damage +1. Weary forces and exertion and all of a sudden that companion is not looking too healthy.<br>
<br>
At the end of it there are three awesome strategies at first sight for Isengard, and I suggest you explore them all and more, as you may not see many more Isengard cards for the rest of the 5 expansions left in the 9 already planned.<br>
<br>
Raider.<br>
<br>
They come as too sub-cultures, Easterlings and Southrons and both have unique abilities by themselves, but they also work well in combination.<br>
<br>
You may note first and foremost the Southron Archers can exert to exert and unlike the Isengard archers they can attack Ring-Bound companions. You can the use Arrows From the South to heal your Archers to deal even more exertions. The other aspect of Southrons is removing twilight to wound, you can get that twilight from ambush  or events like Flanking Attack. This could also be the answer to the new Gandalf, so you remove those 3 tokens and cause Gandalf to be a wimp again and then deal another blow with a wound.<br>
<br>
The culture can benefit from site control, but right now it is difficult with only two high vitality minions (Desert Lancers and Regiment of Haradhrim) who have to exert twice in the regroup phase and then the weak Southron Explorer who has to exert and remove 5 to get a site (way too hard). Yes they are likely to last until then with their strength, but it is getting hard to have enough vitality left for even the biggest minions in the game today.<br>
<br>
The rest is all about burdens for the Southrons and the Easterlings can benefit from it too. You can add burdens very very easily with cards like Easterling Guard, Easterling Lieutenant and Vision From Affar. This could be the Nazgul tie in people have been after. You can also boost the Archery with Burdens using Rapid Fire, making it easy to pump out a tonne of archery in one turn and wreaking havoc.<br>
<br>
You will also notice that Ithilien Wilderness and Eastern Emyn Muil do not need to spot any raiders to play. Meaning Wilderness is an all culture answer to twilight denial whilst Easter Emyn Muil can be the answer to Ring-Bound decks (if played in the first turn the whole Ring-bound idea falls to pieces).<br>
<br>
The draw back is their cost and one asks if you can get combos moving with this problem. That remains to be seen, but there sites are more generous this time around in terms of twilight and there are answers to twilight denial to be found as well.<br>
<br>
Rohan.<br>
<br>
Ally, possession and mount strong, Rohan seems a bit up in the air right now. The two things most shadow cultures get are an answer to Allies and possessions in this set, so why use a culture that is heavy on them?<br>
<br>
Firstly Emoer is a God at fighting and will be popular with a Mount, strength +2 for every wound on every minion is very powerful. He also provides a better choice for a starting Fellowship if you play another Rohan man. They also have the only Armour of the set with Kings Mail, but only Rohan can use it and it is Unique. <br>
<br>
The Mounts will be nice to use in a few Multi-culture decks as a number of cards spot wounds on minions to complete actions, but a Riders of Rohan deck at this point seems a little too weak!<br>
<br>
Theoden has a number of tie in cards with Gandalf and he is a great answer to site control. Weapons Store and Well Stored appear to be the only support cards here and the only answer to the ally and possession problem. Overall however it is yet to be seen if this culture is strong by itself.<br>
<br>
Shire.<br>
<br>
Add burdens to use abilites, then removing burdens, this is what most of shire culture appears to be about. Get on and Get Away is awesome, but it costs two burdens and Mind Your own affairs is an interesting cards that could help out Emoer in his pumping.<br>
<br>
You can remove burdens with Tired Traveller in a Ring-Bound deck or Brace of Coneys or Frodos Cloak or simply prevent them with Sam, Samwise the Brave. <br>
You also have the best healing for Ring-Bound companions in Light Shining Faintly and Sams Pack. These cards will make excellent additions to a Ring-Bound Ranger deck.<br>
<br>
Then you have the discarding of Unbound Hobbits, which as I said before looks dubious. Some cards like Knocked on the Head, Warmed up a bit, Store-room and the common versions of Merry and Pippin make the idea more appealing. Then the new stealth cards Severed His Bonds and Swiftly and Softly make for an interesting conversation. But overall the Hobbit support cards are not here in this set, you need the Fellowship set to make it work and not many sites support Hobbits this time around. One imagines that the Ents of Fangorn will provide this unbound Hobbit idea with some much-needed umph! Right now I cant tell you it looks like tournament material!<br>
<br>
In the End.<br>
<br>
Much more to play with this time, and you dont need all the rares to make a potent deck. Which can be a good thing. You get new cards for old strategies and new cards for new ideas and you also get a chance to experiment more with the Fellowship, single cultures and a wider variety of skirmish strategies. I think you will find however that in both Towers block and open play the chances of making it to site 9 and surviving are thin. The Shadow cultures win this time around, hands down so we will have to hold out for Helms Deep to see what happens next!<br>
