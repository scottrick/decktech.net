Others find it a gruelling experience and get frustrated because they just can&#39;t find a starting point.  I hope to help those of you who find the deck building experience trying and to perhaps enlighten those who excel at deck building although those that excel are most likely better builders than myself.<br>
<br>
	First, why build a deck?  Of course you personally don&#8217;t have to build your deck, you can copy one from decktech, hire a private deck builder or just play go fish with your cards make a pile of 30 fellowship, 30 shadow and go to it.  But, building a deck brings a sense of accomplishment and I think every player should try it or at least know the basics so that they can get a good start then branch out to other sources for the tummy tuck and face lift.<br>
<br>
	Secondly, where should you build your deck?  Always find a area where you can be comfortable sitting for a while.  Make sure you have lots of space for putting out your cards for the visual effect.  And do it in an area where you won&#8217;t be disturbed easily.  On a crowded bus with 50 people is not the best place to do this.<br>
<br>
	Thirdly, when should you build your deck?  Build you deck just after the lightbulb goes off in your head.  Most players daydream and ponder particular cards and combos that they&#8217;ve seen or would like to try.  This is usually the best time to begin deck construction, you&#8217;re at your most creative when you first get an idea so you should capitalise on it and start a building.  If the timing of your inspiration is poor, &#8220;you&#8217;re at work&#8221;, then jot down your idea(s) and pocket them for later, when you have the time.  If you have no ideas or inspirations then choose a card from your pile, your favourite picture, favourite character or just grab one randomly and use that as your starting idea.<br>
<br>
	Finally, how should you build your deck?  This section is most critical and will make up most of the article.  Once you&#8217;ve decided to make a deck, picked your location for construction and had your brainstorm, it is now time to begin construction.  There are two ways to construct your deck, first is with paper/pen and cardlists in front of you, or second is pull out your binder or card collection and have them out.  I personally favour the cardlists because they allow for quicker access to card text and are better organized than your cards.  Once you&#8217;ve chosen your library of cards you can then move on to a series of steps.  At each step just choose the cards you&#8217;d like to include, don&#8217;t worry about numbers of each or feasibility of playing them.  Remember to think of possible shadow cards/combos which will disrupt your theme so play remember to include counters.<br>
*Note: These steps are in the order of my personal preference and variation of the order is due to personal taste.  This next section will be used to construct a fellowship part of a deck*<br>
<br>
1.	Choose your theme: This is based on your idea or brainstorm or that card you chose.  It is now your temporary theme for your deck.  All of your following decisions will be based on using and abusing your idea. *Our theme is card drawing*<br>
<br>
2.	Character selection:  First off, you need to choose the character(s) that go with the card/combo.  This is quite an easy step because the card will most often dictate what companion is needed.  Once you&#8217;ve found your staple character you need to choose supporting characters and allies.  Here you need to make a decision.  Do you plan to kill minions with archery or skirmishes or both or do you plan to just soak up damage and survive?  Just choose your characters here, don&#8217;t worry about support cards just yet. *We&#8217;re going for skirmish wins so extra characters are Aragorn, Ranger Of The North, Boromir, Lord Of Gondor, Gandalf, The Grey Pilgrim and Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer, Elrond, Lord Of Rivendell, Dwarven Allies*<br>
<br>
3.	Possession selection: Alright you have your characters chosen now the decision comes whether to arm them, or give them gidgets and gadgets to use.  Since we decided on winning skirmishes as our secondary theme we need to toughen the characters.  So looking at what&#8217;s available there are armours, weapons, artifacts and just plain possessions.  Since we&#8217;re using Gandalf, Aragorn, Frodo and Boromir we&#8217;ll arm them up. *Ranger&#8217;s Sword, Blade Of Gondor, Glamdring, Gandalf&#8217;s Staff, Sting, Armour, Mithril Coat, Flaming Brand*<br>
<br>
4.	Condition selection: Now we move on to conditions.  These are powerful cards but are most often very specific.  Our themes are card drawing and skirmish winning.  So we want cards which enhance our card drawing or boost fellowship strength or reduce minion strength.*no cards for card drawing, The Saga Of Elendil +str, A Blended Race, Natural Cover, O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! for reducing minion power*<br>
<br>
5.	Event selection: Now for the non-permanent cards.  These are the cards you play out as a &#8220;surprise&#8221;.  These cards are a double edged knife they provide bonuses but can easily clog your hand.  Sticking with card drawing themes and skirmishing themes we&#8217;ll choose a few events which promote these themes. *Tidings Of Erebor (use with Dwarf ally), Secret Sentinels (remove conditions), Sleep Caradhras (ditto), Mysterious Wizard, Servant Of The Secret Fire, Dagger Strike, Swordarm Of The White Tower, Swordsman Of The Northern Kingdom, Valiant Man Of West, Hobbit Stealth, Power According To His Stature, just to list a few*<br>
<br>
6.	Now you have this list of cards and it&#8217;s time to weigh the worth of each card.  At this point you should set your goal as a 30 card deck so cards get weighed against each other in their overall efficiency.  This is also the time where you start thinking about the number of duplicates you require of each card in order to guarantee having it when you need it. Efficiency of a card: a card which has fewer restrictions is slightly better in value than a card which has a specific requirement.  (For example, choosing Swordarm Of The White Tower, sure it provides a strength boost to your men but that leaves the poor hobbit and Gandalf out.  Whereas a card like Servant Of The Secret Fire has the same overall effect but is useful for every companion.) You slowly go through your card lists, noting that to best guarantee drawing a card out early you will need 4 copies in the deck.  You should also notice card efficiency, don&#8217;t use a four card combo which can be pulled off by using only 1 card.  Ex. Dwarf ally + Tidings of Erebor, require at least 3 allies in order to get them out and 3 tidings to get those in hand or you could play with 3 Elrond, it may give you few cards in a single instant but is more reliable and is 3 cards less.<br>
<br>
7.	Step 6 takes the longest and as you play test a deck you will be adjusting the card content.  After that long deliberation you&#8217;ve come up with a deck list, don&#8217;t worry if you&#8217;re not exactly 30 cards because you did include a card drawing character which draws you an extra 8-9 cards in a game so you can max. out to 34-35 fellowship.<br>

The final decision on this deck content was based on overall card effectiveness and increasing the dependability of combos occurring.  Conditions were not included because of deck space and having no conditions will usually cause dead cards in your opponents shadow as they usually pack condition removal.  The same is true for lack of allies.  The inclusion of condition killer is based on the popularity of shadow conditions.  Knowing what minion maximum power is we find that if you have a man armed with brand and sword you will beat almost any minion straight up.  The events then enhance this so almost every minion loses.  This keeps to are secondary theme, and as you can see are secondary theme became the more primary theme since card drawing became too card intensive.<br>
<br>
8.	Once you have your fellowship side prepared you must now build a shadow deck.  You follow the same steps as above except you either choose a similar theme to enhance the fellowship theme, (card drawing) or create a new shadow theme to suit your purpose.  You expect this fellowship to have no trouble dealing with minions and possibly double moving so your shadow should contain tough minions which will prevent double moving thereby enhancing your fellowship.  Decks in which shadow and fellowship share themes are usually more successful.<br>
<br>
9.	The final deck choice are the sites.  I leave the sites to the end because you can fit the sites to your theme.  For this deck we&#8217;ll take the assumption that this deck will double move or at least get ahead of the opponent so any sites that get played will be opponents.  If it&#8217;s your sites getting played then you&#8217;re playing catch up.  I feel if you&#8217;re playing catch-up then your sites should promote your shadow rather than fellowship.  Now sites which promote your shadow are based on whether you plan on starting the game or going second.  If you choose to start then all of your sites except site 1 should promote your shadow so that if you get passed you can slow your opponent with your sites.  If you plan on going second then sites 1-5 would be best to enhance your fellowship, leaving sites 6-9 as shadow promoters so if you&#8217;re behind at that time you can stomp down on your opponents fellowship.<br>
<br>
Now, if you were in a comfortable area, had plenty of time to create your deck, based it on your amazing idea you should have a sense of &#8220;great&#8221; accomplishment!<br>
<br>
By creating your own deck you should really understand the in&#39;s and out&#39;s of your deck.  Knowing your deck strategy from the get go is a major advantage over someone who just copies a deck or hires out a professional. I hope this helped ease any problems creating decks or perhaps gave you a new idea in how to build your deck, or helped pass some of your free-time.<br>
