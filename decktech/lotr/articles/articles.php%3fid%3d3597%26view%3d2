Its hard to convey the concept in less space. <br>
<br>
With the introduction of Mines of Moria, and about 4 months of tournament play under everyones belt, I set out to undertake an understanding of the tournament meta-game. <br>
<br>
There are 4 strategies that MUST be accounted for in any fellowship deck, in order to be successful at a tournament. Those 4 strategies are Condition Removal, Multiple Wound Prevention, Site Control, and Healing. Id like to address each strategy of the tournament meta-game, and the Free Peoples cards one should play with to succeed in tournaments. <br>
<br>
You may ask yourselfwhat does this have to do with Mines of Moria? Well, I include analysis of Mines cards in this article, and there are manyprobably a 50/50 split of Fellowship/Mines cards discussed. <br>
<br>
Before I go on, howeveryou cannot get away with just 2, or even 3 of these strategies. You should account for all 4 strategies in your deck, or your deck will not have consistency. <br>
<br>
Note--I don&#39;t spend as much time on healing as on the rest--mainly b/c I got tired of writing by that time, but also b/c healing is MOSTLY (not completely) a more straightforward process than the others.<br>
<br>
-----------------CONDITION REMOVAL-----------------------<br>
<br>
The first strategy I would like to discuss is Condition Removal. Some of the ugliest shadow cards are conditions: Goblin Swarms, Goblin Armory, Relics of Moria, They are Coming, Dark Places; Desperate Defense of the Ring, Thin and Stretched, Orc Bowmen, Under the Watching Eye; Black Breath, Blade Tip, Wreathed in Shadow, Drawn to its Power; Worry, Sarumans Ambition, Uruk-Hai Armory, Their Arrows Enrage. Each of these cards brings something significant to the table, whether its minion staying power, archery prevention, wound prevention, archery generation, exertion generation, wound generation, burden generation, or twilight generation. Each of these cards works aggressively at making your Free Peoples deck LOSE. In order to combat these cards, you need to play with condition removal. <br>
<br>
Gandalf: <br>
Gandalf has arguably the best condition removal in the game: Sleep Caradhras. For the expensive cost of 3 twilight (2 with Gandalfs Staff) and an exertion, you can eliminate ALL shadow conditions in play. <br>
The upsides to this card? Its probably the cheapest generic condition removal card out there, and easily the most versatile. <br>
The downsides? You have to play with Gandalf. Its expensive. And it gets rid of your conditions also, so you cant play it in a deck that relies on Free Peoples conditions. <br>
Requirements: Gandalf and Sleep, Caradhras. Min 3 cards playable (if starting with Gandalf) or 5 cards playable (if Gandalf is in draw deck). <br>
<br>
Albert Dreary: exert Albert Dreary to discard a Moria or Uruk-Hai condition.  <br>
The upsides? Moria has the most threatening condition game, and this takes care of it. You don&#39;t have to pay twilight (beyond buying Albert) or exert Gandalf, so it&#39;s less risky than Sleep.  It doesn&#39;t discard all conditions (including your own), so it&#39;s again safer than Sleep. <br>
The downsides? You have to play with Gandalf. You have to pay for Albert. Site 7 gets rid of Albert in some circumstances, and there are other &quot;ally wound&quot; cards out there too, making it more risky than Sleep from that perspective.  It doesn&#39;t take away ALL conditions, and it doesn&#39;t work against Nazgul or Sauron, who also have great conditions.  <br>
Requirements: Gandalf and Albert Dreary. Min 3 cards playable (if starting with Gandalf) or 5 cards playable (if Gandalf is in draw deck). <br>
<br>
Gondor: <br>
Gondor has OK condition removal, but its limited. Athelas allows you to remove a shadow condition from a companion or heal a companion. <br>
The upsides to Athelas? If youre not playing against a Shadow that plays conditions on your companions, you can use it to heal (not wasted). If you ARE, you can use it to remove conditions. <br>
The downsides? They cost 1, and can only remove 4 conditions. They only remove conditions on your companions, which is the biggest drawback. <br>
Requirements: A Gondor companion, and Athelas. Minimum 3 cards playable, or 5-6 if you play the Gondor companion from your deck. <br>
<br>
Shire: The best condition removal in the new set is Bilbo Baggins, Well Spoken Gentlehobbit. For the cost of an exertion and a tale (Consorting with Wizards!), one can remove a single shadow condition from your opponents support area. <br>
Upsides: Gets rid of the support area conditions, which can be very dangerous. Is relatively cheap in that Bilbo is easy to heal (Hobbit Party Guest, Frodo, Heir, etc), and the cost of discarding a tale is better than paying 3 or multiple exertions. The opportunity cost of the card is that you are NOT playing with Bilbo, Retired Adventurer, so you cant recycle cards without Dear Friends. <br>
Downsides: Cant remove conditions on companions. Have to play with Bilbo AND tales. Requires Site Control meta, so you dont lose Bilbo at site 7. <br>
Requirements: Bilbo, healing for Bilbo, and some tales. Assume you need 2 bilbo cards, 3-4 tales, and 2-3 cards for healing of some fashion (hobbit party guest or extra copies of Bilbo). 7 to 9 cards. <br>
<br>
Elf: The elves have several condition removal cards. <br>
<br>
Secret Sentinels: Pay 2 and Exert an Elf ally to discard a condition (or 2 conditions if you spot an Orc). (Maneuver phase). <br>
Upsides? Most support conditions are in the orc decksNazgul and Uruk-Hai can survive without conditions. This means 2 conditions down pretty easily. <br>
Downsides? Requires an Elf Ally. Potentially makes an elf deck slower b/c of putting pool in the deck after the shadow phase, to be used in a subsequent shadow phase. <br>
Requirements: 2-3 copies of an elf ally, 2-4 copies of Secret Sentinels. Minimum 4 cards playable, max 4 SS plus as many allies as you want. <br>
<br>
The Seen and the Unseen: 0 cost, exert 2 elves to discard a condition during fellowship phase. <br>
Upsides? It can remove any condition. <br>
Downsides? Exert 2 elves! Thats a high cost just to get rid of 1 condition. Secret Sentinel is clearly a better card, IMHO. <br>
Requirements: 2 elves and this card. 4 cards minimum playable (assume starting Arwen/Legolas), probably closer to 7 or 8 for real use. <br>
<br>
Stand Against Darkness: 1 cost during Maneuver, Exert an elf to discard a Sauron minion, Sauron condition, or Sauron possession. <br>
Upsides? None. <br>
Downsides? Specific to Sauron. Costs 1, an exertion, and is used during the Maneuver phase. Yuck. <br>
Requirements: an elf, this card. 3 cards playable, assuming a starting elf. 5 or 6 would be ideal, for extra copies of elves. <br>
<br>
Dwarf: the dwarves have limited condition removal. <br>
Make Light of Burdens: Maneuver, exert a dwarf companion and discard the top 3 cards of your draw deck to discard either a shadow condition from a Dwarf, or a weather condition. Did I mention this cost 1 also? <br>
Upsides? Its a condition usable by all-dwarf decks. <br>
Downsides? It is specific to conditions played on dwarf companions only, very limited. You have to exert. You have to pay 1. The worst? You have to discard 3 cards, and you dont know what those cards are. Oopsthere went your 3 gimlis battle axes. Sorry. This is just about as bad as Stand Against Darkness, but not quite. <br>
Requirements: a dwarf companion, cards to discard, this card. At least 6 cards playable (3 to discard, plus starting dwarf, plus 2 of this). <br>
<br>
So there you have it. The wise man plays with Gandalf, unless you dont fear Moria Swarm and Orc Woundingthen you play with Athelas. Bilbo is a worthy replacement for Gandalf in those hobbit decks. <br>
<br>
----------------MULTIPLE WOUND PREVENTION------------------<br>
This is a simple concept, and most of the cultures can deal with it (except Elves, I believe). There are quite a few minions that do, or can do with a booster, +1 damage (or more). Mainly were talking Uruk-Hai here, but Nazgul get quite a bit of damage +1, and Moria can bring the pain also with Moria Axe, Cave Troll, Balrog, or Watcher in the Water/Tentacles. Dont forget Sauronall of those exert minion to wound character he is skirmishing minions are not damage +1 in the traditional sense, but can still be devastating. <br>
<br>
The strong fellowship needs to be able to prevent multiple wounds to the same companion in a combat, its that simpleyou will lose if you cant absorb wounds from those damage +1 folk out there, and you will lose quickly. <br>
<br>
Gondor: The best MWP in the game is Armor. It cost 1 (0 with Jarnsmid or Gandalfs Wisdom), and allows only 1 wound from a skirmish. <br>
Upsides? Why is Armor the best in the game? Because there are 2 companions that can use it, and once its played it stays in play (possession-discarding aside). The 2 companions that can use it happen to be the best skirmishers in the game, BTW. <br>
Downsides? It can be discarded by things like Beyond the Height of Menso carry extra copies. <br>
Requirements: This card and Gondor companionsminimum 2 cards (1 armor, 1 starting Gondor companion). Id play with at least 3 armors, myselfand 2 Gondor companions. <br>
<br>
Valiant Man of the West: Pay 1, and during the Maneuver, to make Aragorn Defender + 1 and take no more than 1 wound during each skirmish until regroup. <br>
Upsides? Secondary benefit of Defender +1 ability. <br>
Downsides? One time event, costs 1, requires Aragorn to play. <br>
Requirements: Aragorn, and this card. Unless youre guaranteed to get Aragorn out, Id say minimum to play is 7 cards3 aragorn, 4 of this card. Otherwise, use Pony and its 5 cards. If you rely on this card for MWP, you need 4 of it. <br>
<br>
Gandalf: <br>
Intimidate: Pay 2 as a response to prevent a wound (not an exertion). <br>
Upsides? Prevents any wound during any phase at any timearchery, maneuver, shadow, regroup. Very versatile. <br>
Downsides? Requires Gandalf, cost 2 (1 with Staff). <br>
Requirements: Gandalf, this card, and ideally Gandalfs Staff. Id say minimum 7 to play (3 gandalf, 3 intimidate, 1 staff). <br>
<br>
Shire: <br>
Nice Imitation: Stealth Response, 1 cost condition. Plays to support area. If a hobbit is about to take a wound, discard condition to prevent wound. This is a very good card in a hobbit deck. <br>
Upsides? Plays to support area means you dont have to hold it in your hand. Prevents any wound, any time (like intimidate). <br>
Downsides? Requires hobbits. Cost 1. Its a condition, which means shadow condition discarding can get rid of it (bad!). Also means you cant play it with Sleep Caradhras. <br>
Requirements: A hobbit taking a wound, and this card. Id play with 3 or 4 of themyou dont need anyone besides Frodo, but its best used in a hobbit deck. <br>
<br>
Dwarf: <br>
Gimlis Helm: plays on Gimli, cost 0, unique. Only takes 1 wound during skirmish. Discard to prevent all wounds to Gimli as a skirmish action. <br>
Upsides? Its free. It has an additional use of keeping Gimli alive one extra turn. <br>
Downsides? Its unique, and only plays on Gimli. <br>
Requirements: Gimli, and this card. Ideally, youd play Gandalfs Cart and put your extra copies there. 2 card minimum if youre crazy, ideally Gimli plus 4 copies of this, and a Cart or 2. <br>
<br>
Yes, I know--4 copies of GH is a lot. However--if Gimli is your only MWP character in the deck, you NEED 4 copies--1, to get it early, and 2, to use its other ability and still have it available to you! If you&#39;re playing with Gondor also, then you only need 1 or 2 of this card. <br>
<br>
Elf: <br>
A Blended Race: Pay 1, spot an elf, play to support area condition. Uruk-hai lose 2 strength and all damage bonuses until regroup, then discard condition. <br>
Upsides? Cheap, affects all minions (not just specific skirmish). <br>
Downsides? Only uruk-hai, goes away at end of turn. Weak to shadow condition discarding. Have to hold copies of it, since it is discarded when done. <br>
Requirements: An elf, and this card. For it to be effective, you need 3 or 4 copies of it, and a deck that doesnt require fast throughput (you may get stuck holding this sometimes). Oh yeah, and an uruk-hai opponent. <br>
<br>
Hosts of the Last Alliance: Pay 2 for a Tale/Condition that plays to your support area. While you can spot an elf companion, the archery total is -1. If an elf is about to take a wound, discard this condition to prevent that wound. Non-unique. This is one of the better MWP cards in the deck, but is probably only GREAT in a 80% elf deck. <br>
Upsides? It&#39;s a tale, and works with some of the elf tale-tech. It reduces the archery total, and is non-unique. <br>
Downsides? It&#39;s a condition, so cannot be used well with Sleep, Caradhras. It&#39;s 2 cost. You have to discard it to prevent a wound. <br>
Requirements: Spotting an elf, and this card (you don&#39;t need to spot an elf to play it, just to use it). I&#39;d say minimum usable is 3 cards--1 elf starter and 2 of this card. <br>
<br>
Overall, I believe Armor to be the most versatile MWP card. Intimidate is a close second, but has a higher cost and the luck of having it in your hand. Gimlis helm is good, except for its limited use. I personally recommend Boromir, Aragorn, and 3 armors. Hosts of the Last Alliance is GREAT for an elf deck, b/c it&#39;s recycleable with some elf-tech, and also prevents archery. <br>
<br>
---------------------SITE CONTROL------------------------<br>
Each section should get smaller and smallerSite Control, with each new set, is more and more important. Mines of Moria came out with 3 great new sites (Hollin, Great Chasm, and Valley of the Silverlode). Many of the shadow decks require certain sites to get a better advantage for their decks. Specifically: Nazgul want Weatherhills, Weathertop, or Bree Streets (Gate? I always mix em up). Uruk-Hai want Hollin or Pass of Caradhras, Slopes of Amon Hen (or Tol Brandir). Moria want underground site 4 (Great Chasm for archery decks), Dimrill Dale, and Brown Lands if theyre playing archery. Sauron really want Tol Brandir, though the rest are less important. <br>
<br>
So, the smart fellowship prevents their opponent from gaining a site advantage, by playing their own sites. This is SO critical I cant even emphasize it enough. If you make your opponent play YOUR game, you are always at an advantage. <br>
<br>
Shire: <br>
Thrors Map: A strong site control card, Thrors Map is a possession that cost 0 and plays to your support area. Exert a hobbit during the fellowship OR regroup phase to play your next site (Replacing opponents site if necessary). What a great card! <br>
Upsides? Free, usable by any culture, usable during fellowship or regroupwhat else can I say? Its great. <br>
Downsides? You have to have an exertable hobbitsometimes risky if you only play with Frodo. Still probably the best site control card. <br>
Requirements: An exertable hobbit. <br>
<br>
Hobbit Farmer: allows you to play your site 1, which is good for hobbit healing circles, and not much else. It does have other applications, but nothing quite as useful as getting Green Hill Country. <br>
Upsides? You can continue to use your site 1 game text past site 1. <br>
Downsides? Only lets you switch your site 1, so its not really effective for total game site control. <br>
Requirements: multiple copies of hobbit farmer to ensure you get him. <br>
<br>
Hobbiton Woods: this site allows you to play your site 2 by exerting a hobbit. <br>
Upsides? Youre guaranteed to get your site 2 into play, at least until the shadow phase (where Nelya replaces it:)). <br>
Downsides? Only controls site 2. <br>
Requirements: this as your site 1. <br>
<br>
Gandalf: <br>
Speak Friend and Enter: for 1 cost, during fellowship or regroup, you can spot Gandalf to play the fellowships next site. IF that site is underground, draw a card. <br>
Upsides? Total game site control, free with Gandalfs staff (OOPS--correction--not a spell, so it&#39;s not free with the Staff. Thanks, Reader!). Can be used during 2 phases. <br>
You get to draw an extra card, but only if you use SFaE to play an underground site 4 or 5--and let&#39;s be realistic...isn&#39;t using it to play site 5 a bit of a waste? <br>
Downsides? Requires you have Gandalf in play and this card in hand, which can be tricky timing-wise. You may not have this card when you need it. <br>
<br>
Gondor: <br>
Pathfinder: 0 cost, fellowship or regroup, spot a Ranger to play the fellowships next site. <br>
Upsides? This card is 1 less cost than Speak Friend, and can be used during 2 phases, the whole game. <br>
Downsides? Spot a ranger. Requires ranger in play, and this card in hand. You dont always get it when you need it. <br>
<br>
Elves and Dwarves do not have site control. <br>
<br>
In sum, my recommendation is to find room for Thrors Map. If you dont want to exert Frodo, make room for Speak Friend or Pathfinder, site control is important. If youre playing with Hobbits, Im not sure Id use Hobbiton Woodsthere are better site 1 cards. I would play hobbit farmer in a healing circle, though! <br>
<br>
------------------------HEALING---------------------------<br>
Sadly, to shorten the length of this article, Im going to not spend much time on the most obvious of strategies, Healing. Just a few commentsI dont personally believe you can survive the game relying only on the healing at site 3 and 6. A judicious heal past site 6 is always useful, and sometimes you need something to keep you alive before site 6 even! <br>
<br>
Some cards to think about: Aragorn, King in Exilegreat, especially with Mines of Moria releasing Aragorn Signet copies of Frodo and Gandalf! Athelasgood multi-meta-game card! Multiple copies of companionsincreases your chances of drawing them, and provides a use for them later in the game. Stout and SturdyOK, but there are better ways to heal hobbits (unless you dont play healing circle). Shoulder to Shoulder, Choice of Luthien, etc, etc, etc. There are tons of ways to generate healing, and they exist for every deck strategy out there. The new site 6, Valley of the Silverlode is a GREAT site out of the new set, especially if you&#39;re playing with a shadow side where you aren&#39;t concerned about your opponent healing an extra wound or 2 (or 4 against Hobbit decks...:)). Make sure youre using something to heal! <br>
<br>
Thats all for now. Thanks for reading this LONG article, and I hope you consider it well done. If you can incorporate these strategies into your tournament decks, I can guarantee that your fellowship will live a long and prosperous life! <br>
<br>
-------------------WHAT ABOUT ARCHERY?---------------------<br>
---------------WHAT ABOUT TWILIGHT DENIAL?-----------------<br>
Archery is not a strategy that need be accounted for. Sauron archery is easily removed with &quot;Condition Removal&quot;, as described above. Uruk Hai armory is laughable--Orthanc Assassin and Lurtz, 2 unique minions, hardly qualify as an archery strategy. Moria archery is potentially dangerous--but mostly, Site Control makes this deck weak--they really need their site 8 to be dangerous. Condition Removal does the rest, taking out Goblin Armories and Relics, and Swarms, preventing the opponent from recycling minions. <br>
<br>
So--Minion archery prevention just isn&#39;t worthwhile, once you&#39;ve got Healing, Site Control, and Condition Removal. <br>
<br>
As for Twilight Denial--I believe, like Archery, that it is not a necessary strategy to have in your deck--I believe this 1) from experience, and 2) from my strong belief that the 4 above are all you need. It&#39;s hard to do more than 2 or 3 twilight points per turn in &quot;denial&quot; on a site move, and this really only hurts Uruk-Hai, personally. Nazgul usually leave points in the pool, Moria only needs 2 points to do something in the first place, and Sauron can get by with a weak pool. Furthermore, even if you remove 2 or 3 by moving, you&#39;re still putting in a bunch at sites 7, 8, and 9--there&#39;s not really any avoiding that. <br>
<br>
As for &quot;fellowship&quot; twilight removal--Sting/Glamdring, Pipes, etc. Yes--I play with Sting and Glamdring. No, I don&#39;t play with them b/c of their abilities--I play for their strength bonus, the ability is a nice-to-have. The card only works against 2 of the 4 shadows, and then its the 2 shadows that are least hurt by twilight denial--heck, I&#39;d argue that Moria laughs at twilight denial, but that&#39;s just me. <br>
<br>
Anyway--My other point about twilight denial is on the flip side--it&#39;s unreasonable to expect that, even with the best draw, your opponent can use more than, say, 16 twilight--and I&#39;d say 11 is a more consistent average. As long as I&#39;m putting down twilight wisely (i.e. not putting down Elrond before moving to site 5), I don&#39;t think I need to be concerned with Twiligh Denial. <br>
<br>
To sum--Archery can be controlled easily. Twilight Denial is more in the way you play your cards, than it is in the cards you play to reduce twilight. Therefore, I do not believe that either strategy is something you need to build into your deck for it to meet the tournament meta-game. <br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents...I strongly encourage disagreement, b/c that&#39;s how I learn! <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3597&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
