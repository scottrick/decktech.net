Introduction<br>
<br>
As a player there is a never-ending quest to find new strategies, to discover a way of winning the game that has never been done before. Chances are it has however, and chances are some of you have seen this before, but until I publish this article I will never know.<br>
<br>
Sauron Power is basically creating Minions that are so powerful they overwhelm a character instantly, or at least always win the skirmish. This article explores the options for such a strategy and looks at how feasible it may be.<br>
<br>
Minion Madness: The Power of the Eye.<br>
<br>
There are several Minions spread across the three releases that can be used in this strategy, each with their own uses and abilities which can be adapted to how you feel the cards will work. The basic premise here is high strength with an ability to increase that strength or decrease the strength of your opponent. Here is a list and a short description of why they are so useful.<br>
<br>
1.	Morgul Hunter. He is strength +1 for each compaion, which means he will be strength +4 in almost all cases. Does more need to be said?<br>
2.	Morgul Skirmisher. He is indeed a powerful Orc with 9 strength for a cost of 3, but his ability to remove 1 to exert a Hobbit will a bane to many Hobbit decks given his vitality of 3. Not really considered a power card but it can be useful if you live in a place where Hobbit decks are common.<br>
3.	Morgul Skulker. This Minion is generally only to be used in a Sauron Power deck when the Burden connection is utilized. This will be explained later.<br>
4.	Morgul Warden.  His strength is 9 for a cost of 3, but he is strength +1 for every other Sauron Orc. This is again useful for the power deck.<br>
5.	Tower Assasin. 11 strength, 3 vitality and all for the cost of 4. He can also knock of an annoying ally like Galadriel perhaps? <br>
6.	Orc Butcher. He is only a strength 6 minion with a vitality of 2, but the usefulness of his ability to be +1 for every condition in play will become clearer later on.<br>
7.	Orc Pillager. Another Minion with a high strength of 10, and vitality of 3 with a cost of 4. This time however the character he is skirmishing is strength &#8211;1 for every card borne by that character. <br>
8.	Orc Swordsman. High strength again for only 3 and when a weapon is used he is strength +2, meaning in that situation he becomes strength +4 in total.<br>
9.	Orc Trooper. A bit low on the strength side to start with, but with strength + 1 for every card in your hand he can become very powerful.<br>
<br>
As you can see the common trait here is of course the high strength and/or an ability to increase that strength for combat. The cost is obviously generally high, with most minions being around 3 or 4, this makes a Sauron Power deck a late deck and your Fellowship will need to compensate accordingly. <br>
<br>
There are other minions with high strength that you may consider using, however you will find the nine listed here are the most useful. <br>
<br>
Power Overwhelming: How to get there.<br>
<br>
The strategy here is obviously to get those Minions into a position where they can wipe a companion out in one skirmish. This chapter will briefly explain what cards you can use to do this and what combinations are proven to be the most useful.<br>
<br>
Chances are that even without any extra cards these Minions will win their skirmish, this conclusion comes from experience. It makes sense then to include the condition Orc Banner, which makes all Sauron Orcs strength +1 until the regroup phase when a Sauron Orc wins. This places pressure on the Fellowship to ensure they can handle a strong Orc in a skirmish involving say three assignments. It can provide in most cases an extra 1 or 2 by the time the final skirmish comes around. Imagine then that you have four of these conditions about and two Minions. When you win the first skirmish, all of a sudden your next Minion is strength +4, can any smell the fear your opponent will be in? Not to mention of course if the Orc Butcher is the second Minion who was originally strength 6 when he was played, but is now strength 14 due to the four conditions, and the first skirmish.<br>
<br>
The only other condition that gives your Orcs another strength bonus Is Strength Born of Fear which costs 3 shadow token to makes an Orc strength +1. It may seem useless, but one extra strength can be very useful. Generally when this condition is used a player will add Forces of Mordor for extra Shadow, which costs space. This condition is best used as a one off card that you add one copy of to your deck so you have the option and can use it to help Orc Butcher as well.<br>
<br>
The two and most obvious additions will be the two Orc weapons, Orc Scimitar and Vile Blade. Both add 2 strength, but can add more. Orc Scimitar is more useful than Strength Born of Fear that was mentioned before as it uses less shadow to gain the increase in strength. Potentially this weapon can have a total of strength +5 for its bearer. Vile Blade too has a bonus, when skirmishing a Gondor companion it is strength +2, given a total of +4. As Aragorn is common and the use of Boromir is on the rise this weapon becomes valuable. Imagine playing either of these on Orc Swordsman, and you can see how quickly the strength of such a Minion gets our of hand for your opponent.<br>
This next card is not so much about increases in strength, but more so in causing a double blow. Enheartened Foe can become the most useful card in this deck because as mentioned above, chances are your Orcs will win each Skirmish. Imagine having a Morgul Hunter at strengh 18 because of 4 companions and an Orc Scimitar, then of course Enheartened For brings it up for a second round. Start to get the idea?<br>
<br>
Finally you can play Hate or Orc Bowmen if you feel the need to, but in my opinion they waster valuable space in this deck. What I will do however is put one copy of each in the deck to confuse my opponent into believing there are more, this can have no effect on the game or can force your opponent to make a decision that would otherwise not take place. <br>
<br>
Beat them down: The Burden Connection.<br>
<br>
It is often considered one-dimensional to play a one-culture shadow deck, especially when it centres around one plain strategy. I do not feel this is the case with this deck, but if you wish to explore possibilities this is one of them.<br>
<br>
Burdens can be key to a deck of this type to make certain cards useful. Enduring Evil can reduce a companions strength by the same number as burdens on the Ring-Bearer. This can be painful for an opponent, but it is a gamble as getting the burdens out I the first place is difficult.<br>
<br>
You can use The Ring&#8217;s Oppression and hope to hell your Minions will overwhelm their opponent when the card is in your hand to allow you to add one burden. A more useful approach may be to us Thin and Stretched, as generally Frodo will not take on your large Minions regularly and you will score a burden every time, Verily I come can also be a useful addition. This is possibly the best means for adding Burdens to make Enduring Evil useful. You could also use Gleaming in the snow if you know your opponent uses Gondor as a culture however there is little point.<br>
<br>
The next logical step is to add Ulaire Otsea, Ringwraith in Twilight and a few Blade Tips, or even a few Twilight Witch Kings to force your opponent into some direr decision-making as he may add burdens for the wounds the King inflicts. Either way they are both proven ways of inflicting burdens onto your opponent. In this case you can use Morgul Skulker and recycle the cards to great effect. <br>
<br>
All in all however it seems like a long way to got to get Enduring Evil to work, and whilst admittedly it has worked for me in the past, it can be a combination that is too hard to get working against certain types of decks.<br>
<br>
The Adventure Path<br>
<br>
What sites to use? There is no real path that is best suited to this strategy and it depends greatly on your fellowship but you must remember you need a lot of twilight and so sites that cost more can be more beneficial. Here are a few ideas:<br>
<br>
1.	Bree Gate, 1 extra shadow token than most site 2&#8217;s.<br>
2.	Breeland Forrest, say goodbye to stealth.<br>
3.	Ettenmoors, again 1 extra shadow at site 2 and you can exert to make the character +2, but so can your opponent.<br>
4.	Trollshaw Forrest, If you play 8 shadow weapons (4 Vile Blaeds and 4 Orc Scimitars) this can useful to get more out early.<br>
5.	Mithril Mine, again for weapons, you can retrieve them from the discard pile if needs be.<br>
6.	Moria Stairway, Makes your weapon bearing Minions damage +1. As discussed earlier your Minions have a high chance of winning.<br>
7.	Andiun Confluence, no more allies making Horn useless and killing the popular Elf or Hobbit deck <br>
8.	Andiu Wilderland, no more archery!<br>
9.	Andiun Banks, help&#8217;s get down to four companions to make killing one of them more useful.<br>
10.	Shores of Nen Hithoel, shadow cost is 9, need I say more.<br>
11.	Emyn Muil, you have enough vitality to this will make your Large Minions Fierce.<br>
<br>
Weakness: What to look for.<br>
<br>
As with many decks, Archery can be a real pain, but there is not much that can be done. You can often rely, especially later on, on the vitality of your Minions but that is about it. You can add Mordor Enraged, which can make an Archery deck suffer beyond belief allowing you to pump out a great deal more, but you would need to be sure your up against archery a fair bit. Given that Realms archery is fairly popular you could have a field day with this.<br>
<br>
Other weaknesses come from Twilight denial, which Forces of Mordor can assist with, but may never completely fix. Conditional removal may be a problem, and of course Stealth can annoy this deck for the first 6 sites. However in general these are problems to expect in most decks and only through play testing and experience can one strike a balance for their deck. One must remember however that all you need to do is overwhelm someone once and they are dead, that is one Skirmish out of a possible minimum of nine. As soon as that happens considering most decks have four companions, you will have the upper hand. <br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
