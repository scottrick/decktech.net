I&#8217;m talking about a strong guy, fights it out, but isn&#8217;t the leader.  The fantastic four had The Thing.  X-men had colossus (among others), the sinister six had the Rhino.  The list goes on and on.  The fellowship is no different.<br>
<br>
Now your first reaction might be, Aragorn is the Brick!<br>
Well, that&#8217;s true.  Nobody kicks more shadow hiney than Aragorn master of sword and Bow.  However, Aragorn also fills many other responsibilities, including Healer (King in exile) shadow denial (no stranger to shadow) Arwen watcher outer of  (Choice of Luthien and Arwens fate) the list goes on and on.  Most players usually have a hard time winning if Aragorn dies early.  And understandably so, he whoops major butt and is usually the focus of most fellowships.<br>
<br>
Example.<br>
Archery.  Aragorn and Legolass using ARV and directed fire to roast all bad guys.<br>
<br>
Gondor Smack down &#8211; Aragorn and Boromir using armor, weapons and swordsman of the Norther Kingdom to but the hurt and the bad guys.  This gets even worse against nazgul when they have their trusty torches out.  <br>
<br>
Ranger denial &#8211; Aragorn, his best gal Arwen, and Boromir using no stranger to shadows, among other things to deny your opponent twilight.<br>
<br>
All of the above scenarios feature Aragorn at the center keeping the fellowship moving rapidly.  Most of these decks (And I do stress most not all) usually take advantage of the Pracing pony, to get the star of the fellow ship out as early as possible, and still feature three or more copies of Aragorn (ROTN or KIE) just in case they don&#8217;t have a pony.<br>
<br>
What this means, is most average players get dependant on Aragorn.  Of course the elite players view Aragorn as a potent tool, but have a robust enough style that they can adjust for an unforeseen Aragorn death.  Understanding Boromir will give you one of those weapons to add to your arsenal.<br>
<br>
<br>
By himself, he&#8217;s just a hard to overwhelm strong guy who won&#8217;t win many fights with out enhancers.  Add his sword, and your getting somewhere.  Sure he&#8217;s one behind Aragorn with his ranger blade, and probably two behind Gandalf Friend of the Shire with Glamdring, but 9 power is nothing to laugh at.<br>
<br>
Then he happens across a suit or armor.  He can only take one damage.  That makes him an Uruk bashing mad man.<br>
<br>
Add boromir&#8217;s shield and he keeps Lurtz from tearing up your fellow ship.  Now, before this gets convoluted, I&#8217;m going to list all of the gondor cards that work well with Boromir, and how best to apply them.<br>
<br>
Blade of Gondor, Uhm&#8230;yeah.  Required.  Even the mighty Lord of Gondor is reduced to an extra helping of weak-sauce without it.<br>
<br>
Armor* &#8211; No more than one wound for The lord of Gondor, if they can beat him.<br>
<br>
Athelas* &#8211; Yep, he can carry it too.  Who died and left Aragorn in charge of all the plants?<br>
<br>
Boromir&#8217;s cloak &#8211; This seldom used possession can really take the sting out of Isengard conditions.  However Boromir has to exert so it must be used with discretion.  Personally, I prefer Gandalf and Sleep Caradhras as my condition removal method.<br>
<br>
Coat of Mail &#8211; Why?  He already is a coat of mail just for being the lord of Gondor.<br>
<br>
Great Shield* &#8211; Archery minus 1.  Sure, but then Boromir has a custom one that does that plus some more goodies (see below)<br>
<br>
Flaming Brand* - Gets Boromir up to 10(with his sword) 12 vs nazgul and damage +3.  Worth it alone for getting Boromir up to 10.  If nazgul are popular in your area, your opponents will groan every time they see that bad boy on Boromir.<br>
<br>
Shield of Boromir &#8211; Archery minus one, and minions don&#8217;t get str bonuses from weapons.  Not that Boromir needed much more defense, but now he can tangle with the Balrog, or  Lurtz and his new sword.  He may not win, but he won&#8217;t go down.  (Boromir the wheeble?)<br>
<br>
Conditions.  Unfortunately, there aren&#8217;t allot of conditions for the men of Gondor, and even less for the Lord of Gondor.  (Aragorn gets everything.)<br>
<br>
Foes of Mordor* &#8211; Exert a Gondor man to wound a sauron orc.  Hmm a Boromir&#8217;s sword that does not give me a str bonus, and only works against Sauron,  So Boromir and Aragorn can use it.  Aragorn has a Bow that works on everybody.  Boromir has a sword that works on everybody.  Why does this card even exist?  Well if you don&#8217;t have an Aragorn&#8217;s bow, AND only play against Sauron, you will find this card rather useful.<br>
<br>
No stranger to shadows* - Denial card.  Fits in a denial deck.  Wont be much help if you like a Ranger Smack down type of deck.<br>
<br>
The Saga of Elendil* - Cool card.  Unfortunately, unique.  99.99999% of the time this card is going on Aragorn.  He&#8217;s got the bow, he exerts all the time.  He is nasty when he can exert 4 times in a single encounter without the aid of Gandalf and his strength of spirit.  What happens if Boromir is the bearer of this saga?  Well, he became 33% harder to kill and he becomes much less vulnerable to a well timed hate.  And he can exert more in combat to put down some big meanies in his up close and personal way.   Of course the better choice will always be Aragorn, but for a kick, pop it on Boromir once and give it a try.  (Don&#8217;t do this in a tournament though.)<br>
<br>
Blood of Nuemenor* - Okay I don&#8217;t like this card at all, for several reasons.  1.  It is a condition that discards at the end of the regroup phase.  2.  It works against one culture only.  Yes, that culture happens to be the &#8216;we exert to kill you culture&#8217;, but you have to exert a Gondor man to get it out.  So didn&#8217;t the bad guys get what they wanted anyway?  3.  You skip the archery phase when you do this, so you can&#8217;t even take advantage of all the exhausted orcs.  4.  The picture is of Boromir dying from fighting the Uruk-Hai, yet this card applies to Sauron orcs?  What the hell?  (I know, nit picking.)<br>
<br>
In it&#8217;s defense, when combined with pursuit just behind, you can get some double move in.<br>
<br>
Natural Cover*  -   Minion archery &#8211;2 while in a forest.  No bad.  Not enough forests to make it useful.  Better off with a Boromir shield, and one elvin cloak. Those work everywhere.<br>
<br>
Events.  Gondor loves events.  They have some fun ones.  And some really nasty ones.  A rangers&#8230;blah blah blah.  We all know about that one.<br>
<br>
An able guide*  Denial anyone?  Spot a ranger to remove 4 twilight.  Ouch.  When applied with no stranger to shadows you are taking anywhere from 4 &#8211; 7 twilight out of the pool depending on how many rangers you have NSTS on.<br>
<br>
A change of plans* Force your opponent to shuffle his hand and draw 8 new cards.  I suppose if used with glamdring, sting or the mirror this might be useful, but a rare card?  Ugh.  No thanks.<br>
<br>
Dagger strike* Str +2 Damage +1 for Gondor and hobbits.  This card rocks!!!!<br>
<br>
Elendil&#8217;s valor*  Make a gondor man defender +1 until the regroup phase.  This card can be very nasty if used with Boromir&#8217;s sword.  It&#8217;s a large card combo, but ohh the pain.  ARV.  Wound two minions, Elendi&#8217;s valor, Boromir defender +1, he exerts twice and kills them both.  Meanwhile, Aragorn and legolass are free to commit god knows what to the rest of the poor bad guys.  Card intensive but fun as hell.<br>
<br>
Eregion&#8217;s trails &#8211; It says exert a ranger to make a roaming minion str &#8211;3, but it really should have just been against a sauron orc.  Unless you are going to pack 4 of them, Sauron is the only culture you will get a chance to use it on.  Avoid this card.<br>
<br>
Gondor&#8217;s vengeance &#8211; Exert a ranger to discard a minion.  WOW COOL!  In the regroup phase.  CRAP!.  It can help with double moves, especially when the cave troll is at site 4 and you don&#8217;t want to face him and the balrog (flame of udin) at site 5.  A specialty card that can be really useful to allow double moves in stealth decks.  (hobbits sneak out of fights, and boromir kills them when they move on.  One can&#8217;t have stragglers now can we?)  Overall, this card is a tough one to judge.  I don&#8217;t normally play with it, but I always think about adding it.  <br>
<br>
Pathfinder &#8211; A one shot Thror&#8217;s map.  If you need those sites, use the map, it&#8217;s more permanent.  Add Ulare Nelya and you can change sites during your fellowship or shadow phase.  A good card if you don&#8217;t have the map and/or don&#8217;t have room for Nelya, and are always going first and leading the way.  But if your doing all that, you probably don&#8217;t have room in your deck for pathfinder because all those&#8217; Bow&#8217;s and Gandalf spells are glutting up your deck already.<br>
<br>
Pursuit just behind* &#8211; Allot like Gondor&#8217;s vengeance.  Instead of killing one thing, you wound everything behind you.  <br>
<br>
A Rangers versatility* - Perhaps the best event card for the fellowship.<br>
<br>
Strength of Kings*  - Cancel a skirmish event against a Gondor man.  While this could save you from a deadly minion event card it is more than likely not worth the space in your deck, and it&#8217;s rare to boot.  Ugh.<br>
<br>
Sword Arm of the white tower* - +2 for being a good guy, +4 if you are defender +1.  Would be nice if it was more practical, and if you really want to make a point of being defender +1 you can play this card to get Boromir up to str 13.  Just high enough to still loose against two minions.  I prefer Swordsman.<br>
<br>
Swordsman of the Northern Kingdon* -  Make a ranger +2 or +4 against a roaming minion.  Good pump card, and even better against Sauron.  Many decks win battles without pumpage cards, but when stacked with a dagger strike, you will kill most monsters outright.<br>
<br>
What are they* - Spot a ranger to remove a roaming minion.  Useful power, but it&#8217;s all early game.  Meaning in the late game, when you need the most punch for your fellowship, this card will just be taking up space.  Is useful to disrupt most Sauron decks and annoy Isengard.  All in all, a specialty card, best left for special circumstances.<br>
<br>
Flee in terror* - Response, Ieasterlingondor man wins a skirmish discard an exhausted orc.  That minion&#8217;s owner may remove 3 twilight to prevent this.  (TIRADE WARNING)<br>
<br>
What the hell is this?  Ieasterlingondor man wins a skirmish.  Easy enough, Aragorn and Boromir are going to put the hurt on many a minion.  Discard an exhausted orc.  What?  Okay, I guess it&#8217;s possible to skirmish an orc and not kill it IF it was Sauron (moria orcs typically take only one hit, and even a 2 health orc will go down from the damage + 1 of a weapon.  But if that great useless effect wasn&#8217;t good enough, your opponent can always spend three twilight to cancel it.  Boy do I love effects that can be cancelled.  Why the hell would anybody want this card in their deck.  I suppose, if you used ARV, and then skirmished the now exhausted minion, you could clear out 2 for the price of one.  I suppose.  I may need help here, but doesn&#8217;t that make this card useless against Moria who&#8217;s minions usually have only 1 health, and therefore can not be exhausted?  Ugh.  Stupid card.  Though it does match up well with another card I hate, Blood of Numenor, as all the Sauron orcs will be exhausted.  Still, not worth it.<br>
<br>
Gondor will see it done* - If a companion is about to take a wound, exert a Gondor companion to take that wound.  Hmm.  So I take the hit for someone else.  I suppose that could be useful.  I&#8217;d rather use intimidate which doesn&#8217;t cause me to exert anyone.  However, it could save your from blade tips, Hate, or any other take damage for X reason.  In this instance, it is useful, but again, Gandalf has much better methods of handling such situations.<br>
<br>
Sentinels of Numenor* - Make a Gondor companion Str +2 or +4 if fighting a fierce minion.  Good card.  Nothing wrong with +2.  If your opponent is using Nazgul, then Boromir with his flaming brand and his sword is going to pound them in to oblivion.  (16 str).  Damage +2.  Pair it with a dagger strike and he can take the Witch King down in one hit.  That&#8217;s pumped.  But that&#8217;s 4 cards to take out one.  Not all together economical.  At least the sword and brand are permanent.<br>
<br>
Okay, so at this point you are probably saying, &#8220;Yes Marc, aka Shivv We have all read the cards, when are you going to tell me about Boromir the so called tank.&#8221;  Well, now that the stage is set, I&#8217;m going to show you how to keep Boromir a killing and enduring machine, while not forcing your deck to be a Boromir based theme.<br>
<br>
You will notice, that in all those card descriptions, many have an *.  These are cards that are useable by both Boromir and Aragorn, and potentially others (Dagger strike for hobbits.)<br>
<br>
Here is my example oeasterlingondor Beat down deck.<br>
<br>
Aragorn x3<br>
Boromir lord of gondor x2<br>
Arwen<br>
Legolass death machine<br>
Gandalf x3 FOTS (or grey for card cycling)<br>
Sam burden remover (For prancing pony start)<br>
<br>
Ranger sword x2<br>
Blade of Gondor x2<br>
Flaming brand x1<br>
Gwemegil x2<br>
Glamdring x1<br>
Armor x1<br>
ARV x2<br>
Swordarm x3<br>
Dagger strike x3<br>
Athelas x3<br>
2 sleep caradhras<br>
3 secret fire.<br>
<br>
This gives you a 35 card deck that has a good amount of healing in the form of athelas, aragorn (if KIE) and duplicates of Boromir, Aragorn and Gandalf.<br>
Additionally you have some condition coping power in the form of Athelas and Sleep Caradhras.  You only have 2 ARV&#8217;s, so they would be used late game, but you have allot of damage enhancers to get you through the sites (You can play an average of 1.1 event booster card per site, I consider secret fire to be a damage booster, even though technically it&#8217;s a minion shrinker.)  However you probably won&#8217;t need to damage boost at every site because aragorn and 10 and boromir at 9 will be able to win most skirmishes.  <br>
<br>
The Balrog can be dealt with by having Sam take one for the team, and armored boromir taking 1 hit.  While this isn&#8217;t a focused tourney killing deck, it is a well balanced fellowship that will be able to double move at least twice per game, and more than likely 3 times.<br>
<br>
Boromir is not the star, but he will be right up there to the end taking hits, and dishing it out.  Battles at sites 3 and 6 are particularly easy for this fellowship if they intend to stop for rest.  Boromir and Legolass can exert at least two minions off the table, which will allow Gandalf, Arwen and Aragorn to apply serious pain. <br>
<br>
Again, it&#8217;s not a dedicated killing deck, but it shows how versatile the dynamic duo from Gondor can be.<br>
<br>
Now for some decent card combos featuring Boromir.<br>
<br>
ARV + Boromir&#8217;s sword.  DUH.<br>
<br>
ARV +  Elendil&#8217;s valor + Boromir&#8217;s sword = 2 dead minions.<br>
<br>
Dagger strike + Sentinils of Numenor + boromir sword, = Kill a fierce monster, it&#8217;s easy and it&#8217;s fun.  Add flaming brand to toast all Fierce Nazgul.  Add a shield to own the Cave troll with hammer.<br>
<br>
Armor + Boromir lord of Gondor DUH.<br>
<br>
Of course those were all fairly obvious but the one thing you should take out of that, is all of those cards are useful just by themselves.  The fact that you can get added usefulness by applying them to Boromir doubles their card efficiency.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are some Boromir combo&#8217;s with everyone&#8217;s favorite Wizard.<br>
<br>
Boromirs sword + Str of spirit = DUH.  Melee Veg o matic.<br>
<br>
Intimidate + Gondor&#8217;s vengeance = Why win skirmishes when you can just kill them for chasing after you.<br>
Again, the Gandalf Boromir tag team is nothing new, but all the cards have a simple application on their own, and work in a deck without a need to be a combo.  <br>
<br>
Now here is Some specific pains against specific cultures.<br>
<br>
4 Blood of Numenor + 4 ARV&#8217;s in your deck.  Sauron will spend the entire day exhausted.  Ouch.  If you have a buddy who plays allot of Sauron, give this a shot, it will ruin his day. You do have to supplement it with allot of healing and str of spirit (4 athelas + 4 str of spirit + 4 butterbur) But who cares.  He will be crying at the havoc you are reaping on his orcs.<br>
<br>
Blade of Gondor + Flaming Brand + Sentinels of Numenor + Dagger stike = Nazgul, you must be kidding.  (Except Catena, cause he&#8217;ll take your toys away.)  You don&#8217;t even need all these cards at the same time.  Two is enough to get boromir to str 12.  3 gets him to 16, all 4 is a ridiculous 18 and damage + 2<br>
<br>
Glamdring/Sting + A change of plans.  That can really upset someone who&#8217;s lured you in to a double move so he can drop a Moria or Uruk bomb on you.  Add a touch of Sleep Caradhras to remove &#8216;They are coming&#8217;.  Moria won&#8217;t be able to swarm effectively.<br>
<br>
Again, many of these cards are good to have with out thinking of Combos.  None of us like to hold cards for turn after turn, and Boromir simply provides increased versatility to many decks.  Acknowledging that versatility is the key to taking Boromir from &#8216;Hard to kill meat shield&#8217; to &#8216;Productive dispenser of death&#8217; aka Brick.<br>
