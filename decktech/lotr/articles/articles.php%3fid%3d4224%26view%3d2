They are a good example of how cultures require multiple modes of play to ensure they are not totally useless if their primary ability can be countered.<br />
<br />
The archers can be played as pure archery, as a dual archery/fighting deck, and even as a site control/archery deck. But first thing is first, what are the minions available? What can they do? And why should you use them?<br />
<br />
Band of Uruk Bowmen (Cost:5/Str7/Vit3): This guy is relatively low strength for a cost of 5, but he does have a strength of 3, which means he wont be easily destroyed. He is a damage+1 archer who gives +1 to the archery total if you control a site.<br />
<br />
Elite Crossbowmen (Unique, 7/9/3): You can see now that as a general rule these guys cost 2 more than an average minion with their strength. This is because again he is also a damage+1 archer. This rare monster can exert to wound an unbound companion, in that respect he is like Hate that you can use twice, he does not add to the archery total however. Very potent and extremely powerful if the Fellowship has no way of wounding him before his turn comes in the archery phase.<br />
<br />
Ranged Commander (Unique, 4/8/2): This guys is extremely cost effective, but he loses one vitality for the benefit. He is only an archer too. What he does do is reduce the cost of all Isengard Archers by 1, this makes him a staple addition to all Isengard archery decks. He can also exert to wound an unbound companion too and again does not add to the archery total.<br />
<br />
Uruk Crossbow Troop (4/8/2): Another of the cheaper archers and again you lose one vitality and damage+1 for the trouble, however it makes you appreciate the cost reduction of Ranged Commander. This guy, when played is the only guy who can place a token on a machine. In that respect, in an all archery deck your mad not to have four copies, when you see the machine you will know why.<br />
<br />
Uruk Crossbowman (3/6/2): You can see now that you will not find any cheap archers who are good fighters, in fact for 3 twilight a strength of 6 with a vitality of 1 is not that great, but he is the basic archer in the Isengard culture. He can like Elite Crossbowmen, exert to wound, and he also wont add to the total if this is done.<br />
<br />
There you have it, only 5 Isenhard archers for you to have some fun with. As you can see however they can be a great deal of fun, remembering of course that Lurtz and Orthanc Assasin from the first set are also archers with some potent abilities. Their cost is also reduced by Ranged Commander, which should bring a smile to a few players faces.<br />
<br />
So how to make a pure archery deck that is worth playing? First of all you can dump Band of Uruk Bowmen for Orthanc Assasin in open play as you dont play sites and the Orthanc Assassin in open play to give you some skirmish umph! If your stuck in a Two Towers tournament then tough! You should also add a Lurtz, at least one in open play too. Then you simply build the deck based on the primary guys, so that means you will want four of each. With four of each, (replacing Orthanc Assassin in for Band, and a Lurtz) you end up with 25 minions. This leaves you with room for anywhere between 5 cards to 10, 11, 12 and so on depending on the size of your deck. That gives you enough room to add some Weapons of Isengard.<br />

An Isengard Condition, Weapons of Isengard is the only machine in the game so far. When you play an archer you can add a token to this thing, then in the archery phase you can remove 2 tokens to make the archery total +2, then you can discard it. So by playing this with Uruk Crossbow Troop you can use the machine at that same site giving the Fellowship one Maneuvre phase to get rid of the condition. So you score two more wounds in a fast and cost effective fashion, as this machine is worth 2 twilight.<br />
<br />
We are now up to 29 cards, so what can we add to make the Isengard Archers more trouble. Perhaps we need something to prevent directed archery so we are free to exert to wound unbound companions. With that in mind, simply add Broad-bladed sword, at a cost of one it means that with Ranged Commander is basically plays for free. Your then left with a total of 33 cards. But you only have minions, 25 of them at that! Perhaps I think we should drop some to add some events or conditions, or just pile on some events/conditions on top of what you got. With that in mind what can we use?<br />
<br />
Cloud of Arrows is a nasty answer to the Fellowship Archery total (decreasing it by 1), and it makes the impact far more powerful by increasing the Minion Archery total by 1. it costs one exertion and it helps negate the effects of Hornburg Paclobert, if you fear that site. For a twilight cost of zero, and the knowledge that you have some vitality on your archers this can be a very useful card, especially in combination with the machine, potentially making the archery total +3 on top of what is already out for a low cost.<br />
<br />
Come Down is an interesting card that makes a meal of allies, It basically requires 2 archers and for zero twilight cost makes all allies take archery. Considering that only Rohan is ally heavy in towers and in open play allies do not seem to be immediately popular I suspect this card will not see play yet.<br />
<br />
Covering Fire is another really nice answer to Free-Peoples archery, a condition that lasts on until the regroup phase it basically prevents the Fellowship from all archery abilities and events. This means no bows, no Legolas, no Gondor Bowmen, no Double Shot and so on. Again for a cost of nothing, and all you need to do is spot 2 archers. This is then truly a useful cards giving you the freedom to exert to wound knowing that your guys will survive to skirmish phase.<br />
<br />
Driven Back is another interesting event that will have to prove its relative worth. For a cost of 3, you can spot two archers to make the archery total +1 for every card in the dead pile. If you consider the simple fact that potentially in one turn you can generate more than enough wounds from archery to kill off a companion, and you can also exert to wound to kill of exhausted companions with very little chance of failure, this card is almost a game winner if you have done the hard work already.<br />
<br />
Volly Fire is another card in the spirit of causing extreme pain to the Fellowship. For 3 cost and discarding 2 archers you can exhaust a compaion. So why not play 3 archers, use this card and leave behind an Elite Crossbowman who can then exert to wound the exhausted companion, and kill him/her. So the sacrifice of 2 archers has been well worth it as this will probably stop a Fellowship dead in its tracks. Unless of course your up against Ring-Bound decks, because Volley Fire is for Unbound companions only.<br />
<br />
That is about it for generally straight archery events and conditions. You get some interesting things to play with, some possible game winners and a few answers to some possible problems. So what do we add to our deck to ensure we have the most fun? I think two copies of Cloud of Arrows and Drive Back. This makes a 36 cards shadow side with 25 minions, 4 swords, 4 machines, 2 events and 1 condition. With this kind of pure archery deck, perhaps you need a companion like the rare Eowyn to be able to avoid hand clog with your minions in the case of low twilight. If however the twilight runs free you should have ample opportunity to push out many archers and get these combinations working to provide a storm of arrows that will hopefull destroy the Fellowship.<br />
<br />
Obviously then, what is the next strategy to explore? Well combining these guys with some kind of power/skirmish deck to create a dual effect or both archery and Skirmish winning power. For this type of deck you will want to retain the damage+1 archers as your archery component and combine then with you basic Uruk beatdown deck. What this means is they your normal Saruman/Troop combination that inflicts a great deal of wounds in general will be backed up by cards like Elite Crossbowmen and Orthanc Assasin to generate not only extra minions to worry about, but some archery and exert to wound problems too. This gives you another dynamic to the beatdown deck by creating a problem if a companion is exhausted, it also helps to add some burdens if the archery is soaked up by Frodo! This makes Worry a little more useful too. An example of this deck would be:<br />
<br />
(cards: 35)<br />
Saruman, Keeper of Isengard x4<br />
Elite Crossbowmen x2<br />
Ranged Commander x2<br />
Orthanc Assasin x4<br />
Troop of Uruk-hai x4<br />
Uruk Captain x4<br />
Uruk Lieutenant x2<br />
Beyond the Height of Men x1<br />
Sarumans Power x1<br />
Uruk Ravager x2<br />
Worry x1<br />
Sarumans Ambition x4<br />
Savagery to Match Their Numbers x4<br />
<br />
A twilight heavy deck perhaps, and you can use the Captains to return some of the archers if needs be for some of the lower cost guys for some extra minion power when the need arises. And with the abilites to play Saruman from your draw deck and discard piles at site 5 and 9 respectively, this deck should pose a problem for the Fellowship. <br />
<br />
Another interesting angle too look at, and this may be the most difficult is to add site control to the equation. We can already see that the benefit with Band of Uruk Bowmen if an extra point of archery, but what else can it do for us? For starters it can give us good form of condition removal with Burning of Westfold. No Dawn for Men is an interesting addition that provides some extra wounds in the Maneuvre phase, before the abilities of guys like Elite Crossbowmen come into play. The finally, and most importantly, Race Across the Mark which requires only one site. You remove 2 to remove an Uruk-hai from a skirmish. So if you play some weaker archers you can remove them from the skirmish to prevent them from dying so they are alive to wound again if the Fellowship chooses to move. This can be a game winner if moving from site 8 to site 9. So if you look at only Band of Uruk Bowmen and Race Across the Mark, you only need one site and you dont mind if you dont get it until later in the game. So adding two copies of Attack on Helms Deep should provide enough to be able to pull it off. An example of this would be:<br />
<br />
(Cards: 36)<br />
Band of Uruk Bowmen x4<br />
Elite Crossbowmen x2<br />
Ranged Commander x4<br />
Uruk Crossbow Troop x4<br />
Uruk Crossbowmen x4<br />
Orthanc Assasin x4<br />
Attack on Helms Deep x2<br />
Burning of Westfold x1<br />
Race Across the Mark x2<br />
Cloud of Arrows x2<br />
Driven Back x1<br />
Broad-balded Sword x4<br />
Weapons of Isengard x2<br />
<br />
So this gives you that archery and an ability to expand on the archery total with some site control, and you only need to take one site to make it all work. This is probably one of the more potent benefits of Uruk site control as well so it is well worth experimenting with.<br />
<br />
So I hope you got something out of this and now have a few ideas of what fun you can have with these guys. Finally here is a list of the best sites to use for this strategy:<br />
<br />
East Wall of Rohan for extra twilight of Western Emyn Muil to Meta against Ring-Bound. Wold of Rohan makes a nice site 2 to add some twilight so you have more if they double move to site 3. Site 3 can then be Golden Hall or whatever you need to support your Fellowship. Ered Nimras will add twilight for those extra companions and if you play Rohan then White Mountains scores even more wounds. Deep of Helm or Deeping Wall are probably the best choices for site 5 and site 6 is best up to you with a slight lean to Caves oeasterlinglarond. Definitely go for Hornburg Causeway in a pure archery deck for site 7, but Cavern Entrance never hurts to throw in either, and again if you play Roahn then Kings Room will hurt them. Wizards Vale is really the only choice of site 8 and for site 9 you have a choice of Fortress, Balcony or Chamber depending on your overall strategy and gaming Meta.<br />
<br />
So have fun with the archers and happy gaming.<br />
