Ive pondered giving up LOTR completely because of several reasons.  After reading as much as I can about the new expansion it seems to me that all of the money Ive spent on the game is now going to mostly worthless.  Decipher has decided that they dont want to support the majority of the cards found in the fellowship release.  The cultures of Moria, Nazghul, and to some extent Sauron have all been made worthless by the newest expansion about to be released.  Decipher has offered up crumbs to those of us who have purchased these cards by saying that they will encourage tournaments that rely solely on the Fellowship block of sites.  The downside of this is that Decipher will no longer be producing cards to support this Fellowship block and the game will become stagnant.  The fact that a card game can change with each expansion is one of the best parts of card gaming.  But, I ramble.  Regardless of my reasons, I do believe that the majority of my cards are going to be worthless with the next expansion of the game.  <br>
<br><br>
So what does a card gamer do when faced with this quandary?  I really only have two choices dont I?  I can just up and quit the game.  No more spending money on the game and no more worrying about Decipher breaking a game that I enjoyed.  I can also decide that I want to play the game and this entails the spending of a large amount of money.  Oh sure, you can spend a pittance on the card game and get some enjoyment, but if you want to crush your enemies and inspire a certain amount of fear youre going to need to get the cards and to get the cards you need to spend the money.  After playing LOTR for a year Ive got a good idea for the amount of money Im going to have to spend.  Let me breakdown what Ive spent on this game so far.  First, Ive purchased 6 starter decks and one deluxe starter deck.  That translates to ~100 dollars alone.  After the purchase of starter decks youre going to have to get some boosters.  Ive purchased around 5.5 boxes of premier and 2 boxes for each expansion.  If you can count fast, youve already figured that out to be 9.5 boxes of cards.  I purchased my boxes for about $90 per box, so that means Ive spent ~$850 in boosters.  If you add the boosters to the starter decks that calculates out to ~$1000 Ive spent on LOTR over the course of a year(I also spent money on singles and included that price in the final tally).  Now you might be saying $1000!, thats a lot of money and youd be right.  That is a lot of money to spend on one measly card game in just one year.  I certainly wouldnt expect everyone to have paid out that kind of cash for LOTR.  If you know what you like in the game, you can focus your cards and make trades to have one kick hiney deck for a lot less money.  But if you want to play competitively youre going to have to have a lot of cards as you give your opponent an advantage if he sees your face and knows exactly what youre playing.  How many tournament reports have you read where the author writes, I play Bill again.  Weve played a lot and I know his deck pretty well?  If you want to win at a card game youve got to have a certain amount of unpredictability.  There are a few stories that I would relish telling because the opponent didnt expect a certain card to come out of my hand, but that would take me further off topic.  Anyway, I enjoy making up new decks to test out certain cards.  I also hate losing to someone just because they purchased more cards and have some of the more powerful cards to use.  If I didnt spend the money on the game, I wouldnt enjoy it so much and that would mean I wouldnt play the game as much and that would mean the money I did spend on the game would be a wasted.  So, if Im going to be playing the game Im going to want a lot of cards and that means spending a lot of money, or does it?<br>
<br><br>
When you want to play a card game competitively youre going to want a lot of cards.  Usually a card gamer doesnt have a lot of money to spend on the game to get the prodigious amount of cards needed for some good times at the gaming store.  So whats a gamer to do?  They want to play well, and regardless of what some people say, that entails purchasing an obscene amount of cards.  Well, they either find a way to pay less money for the cards or they buy less cards.  Those people who want to play the game well are not dummies.  They are going to find a way to purchase those cards cheaper.  Some of the more enterprising gamers have discovered that they can go onto the internet and find people willing to sell the cards from anywhere to 30-50% off from the suggested retail price.  <br>
<br><br>
I myself purchased the cards at a ~30% discount.  I didnt purchase my cards off the Internet but from a local store that gave me a deal because I spent a $1000 in the course of one year!  I do know that if I wanted to, I could have purchased my cards over the Internet at an even larger discount, probably saving me ~$200.  I have a big problem with purchasing gaming supplies via the Internet.  The biggest problem is that people dont support their local gaming store.  This is the very same store where you hang out with others and bum around for an afternoon, evening, or an entire day.   Its also the very same store where new people get introduced to the game and where a large sustainable player base is created.  I do realize that card games are very expensive and that in the mind of most card gamers they feel should get the cards at as big of a discount as possible.  I agree that cards should be a lot less expensive.  Really, how expensive is it to manufacture a bunch of cards and bundle them up into booster packs?  I figure its a lot less than the $3.25 retail price.  So its really Decipher that should be punished for having a high price for the card game, but when someone purchases cards away from the local gaming store, they are still giving Decipher just as much money as they would if they had purchased the cards from the local gaming store.  Regardless of where the cards are purchased, Decipher still makes just as much money.  So from Deciphers standpoint they should keep the price where it is because the product is being sold at that price.  If people really want the price of the cards to come down, they need to have Decipher feel the pain not the local stores.  <br>
<br><br>
However, Ive found myself at a crossroads in the LOTR card game.  I really dont want to spend ~$1000 over the course of the next year to play the game, but I do want to continue to be involved with the game.  I believe that the Two Towers expansion is going to be a lot more complicated than in Fellowship, and thats a good thing.  And from what Ive read about the expansion I find it much more likely for me to play the Two Towers expansion than the initial Fellowship release and thats also a good thing.  I also enjoyed having the opportunity to play other people from across the nation in the two DPCs Ive attended and if I got out of the game I would lose that opportunity.  I dont have to lose everything though.  I can purchase cards at a significant discount away from my local gaming store and this discount is enough to persuade me to continue playing the game at the expense of supporting my local gaming store.  Youve all read the rant above.  Its a pretty big deal to me to support the store.  Is it worth it to forgo my support so that I can enjoy a game that I wouldnt otherwise play, or should I forgo purchasing the game, thereby punishing Decipher who created the high price of the game in the first place?  Its a quandary and I know that there are others out there who are thinking the same thing.<br>
