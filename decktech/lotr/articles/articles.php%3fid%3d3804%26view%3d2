Pipes<br>
     Well, since there are more pipes available now, pipeweed is obviously a more valid option. Currently there&#39;s a pipe for Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Frodo plus two any Hobbits (besides Frodo). Also, Gimli can exert to add to the number of pipes, bringing the potential max to about 10. 5 is easy to reach. <br>
     This would mean one of these options:<br>
 - remove 5-10 burdens (= all of them, most likely)<br>
 - heal 5-10 companions (= all of them, most likely)<br>
 - shuffle 5-10 tales from discard pile to draw deck (includes non-shire tales, such as Tale of Gil-galad, Saga of Elendil, Book of Mazarbul, Voice of Nimrodel and Still Sharp)<br>
 - remove 5-10 twilight (= probably all of it)<br>
 - heal a companion with a frodo signet 5-10 times (= heal fully)<br>
     Each of these is a powerful effect by itself, and especially if you include two copies of Gimli&#39;s Pipe, you should be able to get the full effect with any pipe early on.<br>
<br>
2. Dwarven Tales<br>
     Dwarven tales are making a comeback with Mines of Khazad-dum. By using multiples of the Mines, you can completely forget about stopping at sanctuaries, especially if you&#39;re using Frodo, Son of Drogo and/or Shoulder to Shoulder as backup. Gloin, Friend to Thorin will be happy (and almost immediately get his strength to 9).<br>
     Notice that powerful cards like Book of Mazarbul and Song of Durin are tales as well, making it easy to include plenty of tales in the deck.<br>
<br>
3. Mallorn-trees<br>
     Finally there&#39;s an actual use for Mallorn-trees, an uncommon from FotR. It&#39;s use was fairly limited and never saw much tournament play, but now it can be used with Beren and Luthien to punish any minions, including the Ringwraiths and nasties like the Balrog or Cave Trolls. <br>
     By using Mallorn-trees (or alternatively the uncommon Gimli, Dwarf of Erebor - or even Hugin, Emissary from Laketown), you can choose an elven card from your hand and place it beneath your draw deck. Then you merely have to exert an elven ally to give -1 strength to any minion skirmishing an elf. Now you have a use for your Galadriel&#39;s extra vitality (if you&#39;re not too worried about Tower Assassins), and your otherwise limited RotEL and archer allies suddenly become much more versatile.<br>
<br>
4. Regroup Twilight<br>
     Now it&#39;s easier than ever to clear up twilight left over from maneuvers and skirmishes; by using Consorting with Wizards, the new Aragorn and Dinendal, Silent Scout, you can make sure you have a clean slate when you enter a new site. <br>
     By combining this with the (overpowered) We Must Go Warily, you may be able to paralyze your opponent&#39;s shadow hand. By combining this with No Stranger to the Shadows, Bill the Pony and cards like A Talent for Not Being Seen, you may be able to reduce the shadow numbers of the sites so low, you won&#39;t be seeing anything larger than a Goblin Runner.<br>
<br>
5. Tower Assassin Weakened<br>
     Until now, Tower Assassin has been an almost unstoppable ally-killing machine, but that may be about to change. The new common elven ally Erestor, Chief Advisor to Elrond, can exert to prevent a wound from a Sauron card to an elf - and elves have been prime targets of the Tower Assassin anyway.<br>
     Unfortunately, he is unique and only has a vitality of 2, so he can only prevent one wound. Usually, that is all it takes though, as people keep their Elronds one step from exhaustion (which is now easier too, thanks to Vilya, Elrond&#39;s Ring). <br>
<br>
6. Archer Allies<br>
     In addition to getting additional versatility with Mallorn-trees/Beren and Luthien, and protection from Erestor, the elven archer allies also get additional healing with the new cards. <br>
     Friends of Old can with good chances heal 2 elven allies in the fellowship phase (if you don&#39;t have Galadriel, or if they were exhausted), while Master of Healing allows the archers to heal themselves either in the fellowship phase or the regroup phase (which is the more likely situation).<br>
     With a huge bunch of new elven allies, decks that revolve completely around elves will become more common. By having a few copies of Far-seeing Eyes (you want it out soon), Silinde, Elf of Mirkwood and Rivendell Valley, you will have a huge card advantage. Play 10 elves during the game: the opponent must discard 10 cards from hand, while you can draw 10 more. <br>
<br>
7. Forest Sites Revisited<br>
     With the new Voice of Nimrodel and the old A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, forest sites are no longer ignored as important site choices. By using the new Galadriel, Lady of the Golden Wood (who can also heal your elven companion every turn), you can actually get your forest sites 2, 3, 6 and 7. Who knows, perhaps Natural Cover will finally be seen as a protection against Moria and Sauron archery?<br>
<br>
8. The Romance Continues<br>
     Who amongst us hasn&#39;t at some point thought about an Aragorn/Arwen romance theme deck? Well, I have, at any rate. And the new cards in RotEL provide good additions to that very deck. Even though Beren and Luthien doesn&#39;t actually directly involve the two love-birds, it has one of the best pictures of the two, and it does help Arwen (especially Arwen, Lady Undomiel) in combat.<br>
     A more interesting card is the Gift of Evenstar. This condition gives Aragorn an ability similar to that of Gwemegil, except the effect is -1 to the minion&#39;s strength instead of a +1 to Aragorn&#39;s. It&#39;s not as powerful, but adding any additional power to the already super-powerful Aragorn is good.<br>
     If you&#39;re interested in the theme-deck idea, consider these cards: Arwen, Daughter of Elrond (Aragorn Signet); Arwen, Elven Rider; Arwen, Lady Undomiel; Asfaloth; The Council of Elrond; Defiance; Elrond, Lord of Rivendell; Elrond, Herald to Gil-galad; Elven Bow; Elven Cloak; Gwemegil; The Last Alliance of Elves and Men; The Splendor of Their Banners; Support of the Last Homely House; The Tale of Gil-galad; Dismay Our Enemies; Beren and Luthien; Gift of Evenstar; Master of Healing; Vilya; and Voice of Nimrodel.<br>
<br>
9. Elven Champions<br>
     Before RotEL, Arwen was the only elf even remotely capable of actually winning a fight, and even then it was likely only if you had both her horsey and her sword. In the latest set, the elves are a force to consider more seriously, especially Legolas - armed to the teeth with his Long-knives. <br>
     Even a fully equipped Legolas is only strength 8 though, but if he&#39;s fighting against Uruk-hais or Orcs, he&#39;s practically a 10. That alone wins many fights, but combined either with skirmish boosts (especially against Nazguls) or the support of the new allies, he can win just about anyone. <br>
     Two cards that never saw that much actions in the previous sets both activate only if an elf (or an elf archer) wins a skirmish - and that wasn&#39;t all that common. Now, Ancient Enmity (which forces two random discards from hand) and Dismay Our Enemies (which either forced a minion to be discarded or 3 twilight removed) become much more dangerous, especially when combined with the Bow of the Galadhrim - which allows you to wound a minion when Legolas win a skirmish. If you&#39;re in luck, he may be able to single-handedly defeat 3 minions (more, if you count his archery).<br>
     Also, if you&#39;re going for a deck with elves and their equipment, you might want to consider adding some Gandalf cards, both to lower twilight costs (Gandalf&#39;s Wisdom) and to add some extra power with the new cards Trust Me As You Once Did and Unknown Perils. Trust Me can potentially boost any companion by up to +15 strength or more (with SoS). It also happens that the elves best suited for battle happen to have the Gandalf Signet; Legolas, Prince of Mirkwood (who also kicks Nazgul butt) and Arwen, Lady Undomiel (who is in a way strength 13).<br>
<br>
10. Hand Recycling<br>
     I used to think having Ottar, Man of Laketown and the good old Elrond was a really good combo - draw a card, exert Ottar, discard up to 3 crappiest cards and redraw new ones; repeat every turn. Cool, but it rarely happened like that. Well now we have new cards to do the old tricks.<br>
     The Elven Ring given to Galadriel, Nenya, allows you to discard up to 2 cards to draw new ones in their place, once each regroup phase. This especially helps you to trade away some unusable shadow cards in hope for some extra maneuvers or skirmish boosts (or even regroup events). <br>
     On the shadow side, Saruman is abandoning his reason for madness, and it&#39;s working well for him. Abandoning Reason for Madness allows you to discard up to 3 cards and draw an equal amount back into your hand; it costs 1 twilight and an exertion of an isengard minion (like Saruman himself). In the pre-release tournament, this card helped me out a lot. We&#39;ve all been stuck with a hand with no minions in it when the FP player is just starting his turn. Well, if you have even one minion, you can try to get more with Abandoning Reason. We&#39;ve also all been just one minion short of overwhelming Frodo - same deal here, use Abandoning Reason for a last chance of drawing that last critical minion. <br>
     Suddenly, hand recycling doesn&#39;t sound so bad anymore.<br>
<br>
11. Resistance Remaining<br>
     It doesn&#39;t come down to that often, but when it does, you want every point to count. What am I taking about? A modified win based on remaining resistance. Just because you have 4 burdens and the opponent&#39;s ring-bearer has 3 doesn&#39;t mean you have lost - if he has made Sam the ring-bearer, you still win since Sam only has 2 resistance left. This doesn&#39;t happen that often though. <br>
     What you can do is add the new (earlier as a promo league card) Phial of Galadriel to your deck. It adds two to resistance to whomever is your current ring-bearer, which might possibly get you the modified win - even if your ring-bearer is Sam! <br>
     Oh, and the Phial makes it that much harder for you to be corrupted.;)<br>
<br>
12. Elven Stealth<br>
     Before, only Hobbits had the ability to skip skirmishes by hiding and running (except for Gandalf, who did it in a more flamboyant manned with his staff) - now you can start thinking of adding elves to your stealth decks. Voice of Nimrodel allows an elf to cancel a skirmish they&#39;re in, but it does cost an exertion and you have to be at a forest.<br>
     The good thing is, the new Galadriel can help you navigate to the closest forest. Also, Voice of Nimrodel is a tale, so you can set off a nice chain-reaction by using a couple of Songs of the Blessed Realm and a couple of the new The Shire Countrysides. By the time the skirmish is cancelled, you will have two less burdens and two less wounds (basically cancelling the exertion plus another wound). <br>
<br>
13. Broken Goblin Scimitars<br>
     Not that the Goblin Scimitars were BROKEN or anything, but now at least the whole Host of Thousands/Goblin Scavengers/Goblin Scimitar/Goblin Armories combo is a little bit harded to pull off.<br>
     The dwarves offer the Song of Durin to make sure the Moria orcs come poorly equipped (increasing the cost of moria weapons by +2), while Gandalf makes sure they pay for their Scimitars - Betrayal of Isengard gives out one twilight every time a shadow player draws a card during the shadow phase.<br>
     If it&#39;s not the Scimitars that&#39;s bothering you, you can also sack Song of Durin to discard two Moria conditions, basically giving the dwarves their first chance to affect conditions in the support area.<br>
     Another thing that allows the Moria swarm to thrive is the ability to get minions and weapons from the discard pile. The new site seven, The Great River, prevents this completely: &quot;cards may not be played from draw decks or discard piles&quot;. <br>
<br>
14. Sleeping Away All Worries<br>
     Sleep is a wonderful, wonderful thing. And when it is Caradhras that&#39;s taking a nap, life couldn&#39;t be better. If only it didn&#39;t destroy the FP conditions too... but wait, now it doesn&#39;t! The new Deep in Thought is basically a Sleep, C with a few limitations, but it leaves your conditions intact. <br>
     When using Sleep, C, you want to make sure your deck doesn&#39;t depend on any conditions to work (like the Mirror of Galadriel). With Deep in Thought, you have to be able to spot 4 twilight in the maneuver phase (which you can cause yourself with the right cards). DiT also gives out 4 twilight itself, but that&#39;s only one more that Sleep, Caradhras.<br>
<br>
15. Snows At Hobbiton<br>
     Have you ever had to fight Uruk-hais in a snowstorm? I bet you wanted to hide... Saruman&#39;s Snows is one of the few things that gets through Hobbit Stealths and Intuitions, but now there is an alternative that doesn&#39;t care about a few snow flakes. Start off with Gandalf and Depart Silently to avoid any conflicts. <br>
     What Depart Silently does is that it basically diverts everyone from Frodo (or any other hobbits) to Gandalf instead, who is better equipped to handle the ruffians (especially if there&#39;s only one or two). The event is used in the maneuver-phase, and can thus circumvent the effects of Snows. If you&#39;re not facing snows, you can use the rare Merry to pump Gandalf, possibly high enough for him to face three minions by himself.<br>
<br>
16. Gondor Tales Retold<br>
     Previously, having extra copies of The Saga of Elendil and The Choice of Luthien was both a blessing and a curse; you got them earlier, but was stuck with the extra unique conditions in the hand. Now we have two ways of handling this with ease: Answering the Cries and The Shards of Narsil.<br>
     Answering the Cries is a common condition that allows you to discard gondor tales from hand to pump a gondor companion by +2 strength. RotEL also gave 4 new tales to Gondor, so this might become quite widely used.<br>
     The Shards of Narsil can be used almost like Mallorn-trees, except only with Gondor cards, and the cards are stacked under this artifact. Shards is really not that useful until you start smacking down your Still Sharps - a free skirmish event that gives a gondor companion +3 strength and +1 damage, but only if you can spot the Shards. <br>
<br>
17. Saruman Sings<br>
     Decks using Saruman&#39;s Snows were popular at one point, but they faded out of the scene gradually. The new set brings a few main ingredients for a succesful new twist on the old favorite: A Fell Voice on the Air and both Sarumans.<br>
     If you have some luck, A FEll Voice on the Air, 4 Snows and 4 Sarumans, you can actually snow on the fellowship at every site of the game. By using the common Saruman, you can pinpoint the companion who dies (as no skirmish actions can now save him/her), or by using the rare Saruman, you can keep your Uruks alive through archery and then have them go fierce while the fellowship can&#39;t defend with their skirmish actions.<br>
     Another new twist available is to use the Isengard Orcs who can exert in the regroup phase to make the FP player wound a companion - by using repeated snows and the common Saruman, you can make sure they survive until the regroup phase (perhaps even woundless, thanks to Isengard Shaman), and then raise hell.<br>
<br>
18. Mixed Shadow Cultures<br>
     Before RotEL there were only very few shadow cards that worked mainly cross-culturally; Morgul Skulker being the main one. The new set brings one card for each shadow culture that only works in a mixed shadow deck.<br>
     Isengard gets Hate and Anger, which gets you 3 cards if you can spot an Uruk-hai and a Moria minion. Moria gets Malice, which allows you to wound an archer if you can spot a Moria orc and a Sauron orc. The Ringwraiths get News of Mordor, which gives a Nazgul damage +1 in a skirmish (very powerful), but only if you can spot an Isengard minion first. Sauron gets Get Off the Road!, which forces the FP player to discard x cards from the top of his/her deck, where x is the amount of burdens you can spot. You need to be able to spot a Sauron minion and a nazgul to do this though.<br>
     The only really powerful card here is News of Mordor - the Nazguls have some of the highest strengths in the game, and adding a surprise damage +1 (like Dark Whispers) is very powerful. <br>
<br>
19. More Swarm Cultures<br>
     Earlier, Moria has ruled the swarm-scene, while Sauron has the remote chance of swarming for a win. This doesn&#39;t change with RotEL, but a new swarm culture enters the scene: Isengard Orcs. <br>
     Having the same home site as Moria, and having low costs (several 1&#39;s, 2&#39;s and 3&#39;s), plus having cool regroup abilities, Isengard Orcs might be the next big thing. Some cool cards to swarm with: Isengard Axe (costs 0, gives back 1); Isengard Forger (cost 2, exert to get back one); Isengard Retainer (cost 4, ST 8, regroup); Isengard Servant (cost 3, ST 7, regroup); Isengard Shaman (cost 1, ST 5, pay 2 to cancel a wound to an Isengard orc); Isengard Warrior (cost 3, ST 7, prevents use of archery abilities); Isengard Worker (cost 2, ST 5, regroup); Trapped and Alone (all damage bonuses against Isengard orcs are cancelled). <br>
     The advantage Isengard has over Moria swarms is their high vitality; practically every Isengard orc has vitality 3, which allows them to survive huge archery, while Isengard Warrior prevents pinpoint archery. The disadvantage Isengard still has is that it can&#39;t recycle discarded minions well.<br>
<br>
20. The End of Super-Fellowships?<br>
     For a while now, the tournament scene has been dominated with high-power fellowships; Aragorn pumped with his sword and bow and miscellaneous conditions; Arwen and her horsey and sword; Gimli with his axe and helm. The new Isengard Smith can exert in the regroup phase to discard a weapon, or all FP possessions if the FP is running with 5 or more companions. And yes, this includes goodies like The Mirror of Galadriel and Asfaloth. <br>
     Everyone can rest assured that fellowships larger than 4 will rarely be seen after this set gets widely used, and even then the Isengard Smith can get rid of the main strength pumps of the fellowships. The only problem is is that he automatically becomes a prime target to be killed before the regroup phase. Use Isengard Warrior to cancel archery abilities (Greenleaf, Aragorn&#39;s Bow) or Spies of Saruman to cancel archery alltogether, use Trapped and Alone to cancel all companion damage bonuses from weapons, and use common Saruman to assign him to a weakling (if possible). <br>
<br>
21. Even Stronger Spirit<br>
     One favorite of all from the old sets is Gandalf&#39;s Strength of Spirit. Believe it or not, SoS becomes even more important with the new set. As Isengard Orcs (and the common Saruman) are now able to force exertions either in the regroup phase with their special abilities or in the maneuver phase with One of You Must Do This, SoS may be your only chance of surviving. <br>
     Intimidate becomes more useful as well, since the Sauron (and some Isengard) Orcs can exert in the regroup phase to wound - not that Hates and Mordor&#39;s Strengths weren&#39;t enough to worry about.<br>
<br>
22. Well Kept Secrets<br>
     Perhaps the least used ally, Erland, Advisor to Brand, may become useful with the new set. If decks that abuse The Palantir of Orthanc and other &#39;reveal card to do X&#39; effects become popular, he may be your best chance of keeping your secrets to yourself. <br>
     Erland will stop cards like The Palantir of Orthanc; Coming for the Ring; Dangerous Gamble; They Will Never Stop Hunting You; and The Dark Lord Advances, not to mention older cards like Alive and Unspoiled. <br>
     The Shadow cultures might be wise to keep their secrets as well - No Business of Ours (spot an Isengard minion to play) keeps all shadow players&#39; hands secret. This will stop the new cards Storm of Argument; Friends of Old; His First Serious Check; Might of Numenor; and Meant to Be Alone, along with older cards like The Mirror of Galadriel; Sting; Glamdring; Foul Creation; and Curse Their Foul Feet!.<br>
     <br>
23. Getting Rid of Saruman<br>
     With the new threat of Saruman looming in the horizon, many players are looking for ways to get rid of the &quot;no-skirmish-no-archery&quot; Saruman. The obvious solution is A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, which makes him harmless - but what if you&#39;re not at a river or a forest? <br>
     What Are They? will get rid of Saruman at sites 2 and 3, while Pursuit Just Behind can wound him in the regroup phase. If you&#39;re playing with the warrior Legolas, you can use the Bow of the Galadhrim to shoot at Saruman - it&#39;s technically not archery. <br>
<br>
24. Getting Rid of Allies<br>
     With the new Uruk Raider (who becomes a cost 2 strength 9, fierce, damage +1 uruk if you can spot a dead ally), and all of the new elven allies, it&#39;s time to revisit the options the shadow cultures have for getting rid of allies.<br>
     The old favorite still rules supreme: Tower Assassin is by far the most reliable and efficient way of getting rid of allies, and is a great card even if the FP player doesn&#39;t play with allies (but who doesn&#39;t?). The only drawback with him is that the new Erestor, Chief Advisor to Elrond can prevent a wound done by him.<br>
     One quite unused Moria event, Bitter Hatred, allows you to wound any elf if you can spot a Moria archer - using multiples of these can get get rid of big allies like Elrond or Galadriel, or a couple of smaller elven allies. It&#39;s all good. <br>
     The Ringwraiths have a real powerhouse of an ally-killer, with Their Power Is in Terror. Play two of these and most likely there won&#39;t be an ally left alive. This combos very well with the Uruk Raider and the new News of Mordor.<br>
     <br>
25. Corruption Imminent<br>
     Although the new set didn&#39;t bring a lot of new burdening cards, the few cards we got are very nice - although the Nazgul&#39;s can&#39;t get the job done by themselves. Oddly enough, Sauron might have the best chance of corrupting Frodo, especially by using the new deck discard effects with The Irresistible Shadow. <br>
     Gleaming in the Snow allows you to exert a Sauron orc in the regroup phase to add a burden, if you can spot a Gondor companion. Not too hard to do, and it&#39;s cost 0. Be sure you use Gleaming before you get rid of Aragorn with...<br>
     Can You Protect Me From Yourself: a maneuver that either exhausts Aragorn or adds 2 burdens - play several and you&#39;re going to have an exhausted Aragorn and several burdens, most likely. The drawback is that it&#39;s an Isengard event, and requires you to spot an Isengard minion... Combined with Worry, your Isengard deck might be able to win by corruption.<br>
     The new Nazgul, Ulaire Otsea, Ringwraith in Twilight can put a Blade Tip on the Ring-bearer if he wins a skirmish against anyone. With a steed, a sword and a few skirmish boosts, this shouldn&#39;t be a problem. And the burdens keep on coming.<br>
     In the new set, there&#39;s even a site that adds a burden; Eregion Hills automatically adds a burden when you move there - no ifs or buts about it.<br>
     <br>
26. Anti-Orc Cards<br>
     With a lot of new strong Sauron and Isengard orcs, cards that work specifically against orcs might be making a comeback. The dwarves practically have monopoly of these cards: Farin, Dwarven Emissary gets +2 strength against orcs; Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe wounds an orc if he wins a skirmish; Here Lies Balin, Son of Fundin deals out 2 wounds to any orcs; and last but not least, Let Them Come! kills any orc that loses a skirmish. This is especially powerful against the new orcs that come with nasty regroup abilities.<br>
     The elves don&#39;t have many anti-orc cards, but the few they have are quite powerful: Curse Their Foul Feet!, Secret Sentinels and Rumil, Elven Protector are among the most powerful ones.<br>
     Gondor has a couple of anti-Sauron cards: Blood of Numenor is a condition that exhausts all Sauron orcs that are played - but it is discarded at regroup; Flee in Terror discards an exhausted orc ieasterlingondor companion won a skirmish (unless the shadow player pays 3 twilight). Foes of Mordor allows a Gondor companion to exert to wound a Sauron orc.<br>
<br>
27. Canceling Regroup<br>
     As the new set brings with it a few new regroup events, the pesky Orc Ambusher becomes more useful - if you can keep him alive until the regroup phase. Too bad he can&#39;t cancel regroup actions too.<br>
<br>
