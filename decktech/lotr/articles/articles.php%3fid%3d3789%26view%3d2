This time our esteemed guest is Brian Hunter, #1 Star Wars CCG player in the world for X years running. Brian please fill in the X for us.<br>

Hunter: Esteemed guest? My mother would be so proud. Oh, let&#39;s see.... it&#39;ll be 4 years if I make it to the end of August.<br>
<br>
Neal: He is also the first and only two time DPC winner here at Decktech. Naturally we are going to talk some SWCCG first.<br>

Hunter: Fair enough.<br>

Neal: So Brian, give us your assessment of the &quot;state of the nation&quot; of SWCCG right now.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Well, I have pretty much the same position on this as I have for a while. Basically, I think we lost several players when Dcon was cancelled, and quite a few more when the license was lost. But, I think that the slide has slowed for now, and most of the people playing the game now will probably continue to do so for a while.<br>
<br>
Neal: Can you give me some examples of some names who are staying in?<br>
<br>
Hunter: A lot of people are excited by the new virtual cards, and the tournament scene is surviving. Well, we&#39;ve continued to see recognizable names like Hayes Hunter, Matt Lush, Brian Fred, and myself at notable events. Also Johnny Chu, the Twiggs, etc.<br>
<br>
Andrew: Clint Hays<br>
<br>
Neal: Tim Guzman<br>
<br>
Hunter: Yes, even Clint Hays. :) Tim Guzman, Paul Myers, Andy McClure, the list goes on.<br>
<br>
Neal: At the Vegas DPC I saw a long list of west coast players.<br>
<br>
Hunter: We&#39;ve lost a few, like Steven Lewis, but a lot of the top names are hanging in there.<br>
<br>
Neal: Like Clayton Atkins.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Yes, and Kevin Shannon wanted to make it too, but was unable to do so. He made it to regionals though, I think.<br>
<br>
Neal: Have you seen any resurgence in the game lately? For awhile it looked pretty grim.<br>
<br>
Hunter: I do occasionally hear from people that are teaching friends how to play the game. Brand new players into the fold.<br>
<br>
Neal: That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard, and that&#39;s very exciting.<br>
<br>
Hunter: This helps to contradict the theory that SWCCG has grown too complicated for new players to pick up.<br>
<br>
Neal: What are some of the factors causing the resurgence do you feel?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Turnout for some of the Regional Championships events has been pretty impressive. I think people are inspired by the prospect of the $5,000 payout at DecipherCon, for one thing. So qualifying for Day 2 has been a priority for many players.<br>
<br>
Neal: Well, in the space of a month, we went from 16 players at the Atlanta DPC to 33 in Vegas, to 44 or something at the Corellia Regional.<br>
<br>
Andrew: Yeah, 44 at Corellia and 51 at Endor.<br>
<br>
Hunter: And the virtual cards are bringing a few of the people back, who were dismayed when the license was lost, afraid the meta would never change again.<br>
<br>
Neal: You have mentioned virtual cards several times...What is your opinion of the two sets and the whole idea?<br>
<br>
Dave: Just curious, how many of the virtual cards are worth playing?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Well, I think they&#39;re worth mentioning. While the quality of the virtual sets can be debated, the theory is very sound. The virtual cards are what will keep the game going. I think the whole concept was an excellent idea. We can continue playing the greatest CCG ever made, and the cards will be free from now on. Decipher continues to update ratings, and there will continue to be prize support. What more could you want?<br>
<br>
Neal: Sounds pretty enticing actually.<br>
<br>
Hunter: On average, I&#39;d say that maybe 1 in every 4 virtual cards is tournament worthy. But that is strictly a matter of opinion. However, even when Decipher was making cards, there were always plenty of cards in each set that you could look at and say &quot;I will never use this in my lifetime.&quot;<br>
<br>
Neal: Are there going to be Objectives ever do you think?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Yes, there are plans to make virtual versions of existing objectives.<br>
<br>
Neal: So speaking of the plans...What do you feel about the player&#39;s committee and the advocates and such?<br>
<br>
Hunter: The PC is a little ragtag. The Advocates definitely have control, and the rest of the PC mostly just sits around. Whether or not the &quot;regular guy&quot; in the PC will have more say in the future remains to be seen. However, I think the advocates are doing as good a job as could be expected. They&#39;re really just players, like anyone else, who wanted to see the game continue, and volunteered to help.<br>
<br>
Neal: Ok, cool. Any chance of new blood in the PC?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Right now, I understand that the PC is not accepting new members. But that will change in the future, how far in the future, I have no idea. But there probably won&#39;t be new *advocates* anytime soon, which is a bigger issue. :)<br>
<br>
Dave: I have a question. What do you think about restricting sets to vary the playing environment even more?<br>
<br>
Hunter: I agree with the basic philosophy of keeping every set legal for &quot;standard swiss style events&quot;. Meanwhile, I&#39;m all for scenario tournaments. Episode 1 tourneys, &quot;no episode 1&quot; tourneys, highlander events, hoth scenarion tournaments, whatever the case may be. I loved bespin and beyond, as well as the endor/DS II formats.<br>
<br>
Neal: You liked Bespin and Beyond?<br>
<br>
Hunter: I&#39;m afraid so. *lol*<br>
<br>
Neal: I like deploying 19 cloud cars from hand.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Hey, that was how I got my first DLOTS t-shirt, right? hehe. I&#39;m just a big fan of alternate formats in general. Including draft and sealed deck too.<br>
<br>
Neal: that was fun, haha, right! So let&#39;s go a little controversial here...Do you feel there is any chance of Decipher getting the license back? How about WOTC picking up the SWCCG game?<br>
<br>
Hunter: I think there is no chane of WOTC picking up the SWCCG game mechanics. They have too much pride for that. They would rather just say &quot;we make better games than Decipher, that&#39;s why they lost the license in the first place&quot;. There are varying rumors about the length of time that WOTC will have the license. I once heard it was a one-year contract, so that if SWTCG flopped, Decipher could try to re-acquire the license. But, I&#39;ve also heard other sources who say it is a 5-year contract. So who knows?<br>
<br>
Andrew: Ok, here&#39;s a question for you. Some people claim that certain &quot;unpopular&quot; elements or cards need to be banned from the game, i.e. podracing, senate, etc, whats your opinion on this, and is there anything YOU would change about the game right now?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Decipher had a long-standing policy against the banning of anything. This was part of their own &quot;pride&quot;, as a means of doing things differently from WOTC, even when something clearly needed to be banned. For better or for worse, the Advocates think the same way. Nothing will be banned anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Edmund: What do you think about temporary bans?<br>
<br>
Hunter: I personally despise podracing and inserts, and would have banned them both long ago, if I could have my way. ;)<br>
<br>
Neal: Very interesting, I always felt the same way actually.<br>
<br>
Hunter: But for now all I can do is try to influence the card design as much as possible, to create new counters for those cards whenever possible. Temporary bans? I&#39;m not sure I know what you&#39;re asking.<br>
<br>
Edmund: Well, to ban something until a counter can be made in the next set. That&#39;s how I&#39;d like to see things done, but maybe that&#39;s just me.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Hmm, I doubt that such a thing will ever occur.(Not saying it&#39;s a bad idea, just won&#39;t happen.)<br>
<br>
Neal: Well, speaking of all these Bans and WOTC, let&#39;s move on to the next topic... Star Wars TCG. With the loss of the license, this has been a huge controversy here on DeckTech.<br>
<br>
Hunter: and anywhere else where SWCCG fans talk amongst themselves. :)<br>
<br>
Neal: haha, right! Now you were invited out to view the new game by WOTC, and seem to have quickly become a well respected player. So what&#39;s your opinion of SWTCG?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Well, interestingly, I was the only one of the people invited out to Seattle by Wotc, whose comments on the game never got posted on decktech. *lol*<br>
<br>
Neal: Uhh, whoops. I meant too!<br>
<br>
Hunter: Basically, the game is a blast. It&#39;s fast-paced, easy to learn, and exciting. Do the dice cause aggravating randomness? Yes they do. Will it balance out some over the course oeasterlingame, or tournament? Yes. Will certain games still hang on one die roll anyway? Probably. SWCCG players will definitely miss the &quot;total control&quot; they are used to having. But the game can be played competitively. (I think).<br>
<br>
Neal: I want to plug your SWTCG article a second, because it&#39;s a really great one about the use of dice and tactics. Let me get a link, in case anyone is curious. Meanwhile, please continue on SWTCG, is it popular?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Alright. I never did post an article for SWCCG, so I went all-out when I posted one for SWTCG. that sucker is pretty long. *lol* Is it popular? I think it is really too early to say. The tournaments only began on June 1st. We will know a LOT more about the game&#39;s popularity (or lack thereof) after events like DPC Houston, and especially Gen Con.<br>
<br>
Neal: I thought it was really good. And no longer than the average DPC tournament report is seems! http://www.decktech.net/swtcg/articles/articles.php?id=3774&view=2<br>
<br>
Neal: Do you think it has a future competitively? Would you play it at cash tournaments and such?<br>
<br>
Hunter: If the game catches on, and IS popular, and significant money can be made in it....I think I very well might play it competitively, yes. There is enough strategy in deckbuilding, setup, retreating, etc that the smarter player does have a notable advantage.<br>
<br>
Neal: Very interesting. Well, since you&#39;ve played so many games, and are known for shooting straight...I&#39;m going to ask you to &quot;grade&quot; some games, Professor Hunter.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Games will sometimes be won and lost on die rolls alone. But the strong players could only hope that it will all even out in the end, so that they can still come out on top with some consistency.<br>
<br>
Neal: A-F, pluses are allowed.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Alright.<br>
<br>
Neal: First Star Wars CCG.<br>
<br>
Hunter: I still say it is hands-down the best CCG/TCG ever designed. It is flawless? no, but it&#39;s the closest thing we&#39;ve got to flawless. I&#39;d give it an A.<br>
<br>
Neal: Wow! It&#39;s a great game. If it had better product development, it could have gone even A+. Ok, next. The object of some controversy on DeckTech currently: Magic.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Magic is &quot;the origin of the Species&quot;, no doubt about that. Magic is also (usually) quick-paced and exciting. Obviously there are decks that create exceptions to that rule. But Magic was an amazing product. I still don&#39;t think they ever fixed the basic &quot;too much/not enough land&quot; problem, and I don&#39;t like their Mulligan rules. I think there were better options. I&#39;d give it a B+.<br>
<br>
Neal: Excellent Opinion. How about Star Wars TCG? Or is it too early in the semester to grade?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Hehe, naw it&#39;s not too early. I sometimes form opinions quickly. ;)<br>
<br>
Neal: haha!<br>
<br>
Hunter: The TCG is fun. And that counts for a lot. But the dice are quite a hurdle for this game to overcome, if it wants to catch on with true strategy gamers. I&#39;d give it a B. But that may improve after future sets give us more ways to &#39;work around the dice&#39;.<br>
<br>
Neal: Wow, high grade off the bat...you&#39;ve got to figure it will improve too. <br>
<br>
Hunter: Well, we can hope. But some games only get worse over time, instead of better. My best example of that would be the Battletech CCG, which I would have given an A- after the first set, but a C after the third set.<br>
<br>
Andrew: Ahh, excellent comparison, I agree on that. <br>
<br>
Neal: Ok, here&#39;s a big one: Lord of the Rings TCG.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Lord of the Rings is more luck-based than SWCCG, and involves less strategy. you play your fellowship cards if you&#39;re lucky enough to draw them. You play as many minions as you can, as often as you can. And many decks are very similar. Meanwhile, LOTR is slower and less exciting than SWTCG or Magic. If you want fast fun, play SWTCG or Magic. If you want the best strategy CCG ever, play SWCCG. if you want neither, play LOTR.<br>
<br>
Neal: so grade professor? and let it fly, it&#39;s cool, it&#39;s DT.<br>
<br>
Hunter: Even after all I said about LOTR that was less than favorable, I&#39;ve played games that were far worse. LOTR is not spellfire, and not c-23. It is better than the average of all games I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;d give it a C+.<br>
<br>
Neal: One last question, on the grades. What&#39;s the WORST game you&#39;ve ever played?<br>
<br>
Hunter: Hmm, is there one called Doomtown or something like that?<br>
<br>
Neal: Haha, yeah the poker game, Mike Fitzgerald loves it.<br>
<br>
Hunter: I played in a free tournament for it at a Con, really bad.<br>
<br>
Neal: Haha, good choice. Well Brian, that&#39;s it for the questions from me, thanks a million. It&#39;s my pleasure. Well with that, I want to say great chat, and it&#39;s a pleasure having you, Brian, you are a quality player and person.<br>
<br>
Hunter: You&#39;re very welcome, glad I could help.<br>
