Hopefully in this article, unless I go way overboard on words again, I will get through Gondor, Isengard, Raiders and the Shire cultures.  This leaves me to look at sites and gameplay for the last article.   Now if youll excuse me, I feel the need to go off on a tangent now to talk about my pulls from my boxes.  Every expansion that comes out fills me with a new anticipation of ripping open packages and seeing what new wonders await me within.  It feels almost like Christmas, though unfortunately these cards were only gifts from me to myself, quite a burden on my quickly depleting wallet.  So my brother and I split two boxes and two starters and decided to have our own little sealed deck tournament, using whatever cards we got from the box and starter each.  But I wont go into that, since sealed deck tournaments rarely turn out worth remembering (not to say it wasnt fun, but highly uneventful).  So anyways, out of the two boxes we pulled most of the set, finding very few rare duplicates, though for some I wish we had pulled a couple.  Not much missing besides the rare Merry, Eowyn, Treebeard, Hides (there goes my Dunland deck), Saruman from Isengard, Ugluk (there goes my tracker deck), and most of the rare Southrons and yes, there too goes my Southron deck.  Regardless, Ive been on a tangent for a while, so its now back to the real reason I started these articles.<br>
<br>
GONDOR  Roam, Roam on the Range-r<br>
<br>
The Gondor culture had several Fellowship cards that dealt with adding more strength when you skirmished a roaming minion, but unfortunately there was no way to add to the minions shadow number, so after site 4 or 5, those cards would be half as good.  Well, now thats about to change.  Remember Swordsman of the Northern Kingdom, blah blah blah +4 if skirmishing a roaming minion, well theres a +4 youll be able to manipulate like theres no tomorrow.  With many of the new Rangers and the Gondor cards such as Forests of Ithilien and New Errand adding to the minions site number, you are free to use a whole lot of old and new events to make rangers ridiculously powerful.  A War and Valor and a Swordsman of the Northern Kingdom together give you a strength +7, damage +1 bonus to a ranger fighting a roaming minion.  Id like to see many shadow sides live up to those kinds of beats.  Also, along the lines of using several Ring-bound Men (as only Faramir and his merry band of rangers are) are the new conditions that take effect on your companions when they are at a specific site.  You are almost guaranteed to win your skirmishes at Henneth Annun as your opponent will be facing a 2 strength penalty if you are making them roaming (and with Ring-bound Men, you would be dumb not to).  Ruins of Osgiliath will ensure that you get to at least site 8 almost wound free, as you can sacrifice one of your rangers for the good of the game.  Also, with these conditions, once you are past the site, they have nifty little side things to do, like wounding minions, healing companions and liberating sites.<br>
<br>
Well, Ive talked enough about his little buddies, but now its time to look at the man himself. Thats right boys and girls, its all about the Faramir.  Your standard large fellowship deck is going to really enjoy the common Faramir, as he can live easily through some skirmishes with his opponent may not play skirmish events or use skirmish special abilities game text.  The rare version (strength +2 when fighting a roaming minion) is obviously more inclined to go into a deck only based on Rangers.  And luckily for us, he lets one of your Gondor Men in your starting fellowship be deploy  1, so you can play either a Ranger of Ithilien, Gondorian Ranger, Mablung or Damrod.  As a main character from Gondor, Faramir must have an assortment of possessions to use, as has become the custom.  His bow is just slightly less useful than Aragorns bow, but I think Decipher realized they cant make any more snipers for the Fellowship.  Never the less, his bow is at least helpful in making him an archer, and on top of that being able to wound someone in the skirmish phase, giving him the potential to deal 2 wounds without even finishing a skirmish.  His cloak is definitely one thing you want in a Ring-bound Ranger deck, because why settle for the usual strength 2 penalty on minions, when you can make it a 3 penalty.  <br>
<br>
(Ill try to keep this one short) So at last we come to Aragorn, and no set would be complete without giving him something to use.  I really like the Aragorn, Wingfoot version of him in this set, and makes for a great Merry and Pippin deck.  Starting those two hobbits and Legolas, and pulling Aragorn first turn will probably be a common start to many fellowship decks, as the Three Hunters take much benefit from the hobbits and each other.  Its also worth playing that type of deck since Hard Choice can heal the Aragorn signet fellowship members.  This includes the rare Legolas (who adds to twilight costs with the hobbits out), the rare Gimli (who gets more strength with the Hobbits out), and Aragorn, Wingfoot himself.  So this is an easy way of healing any of the Hunters, and Hard Choice is non-unique, so you can use several each turn.  Help In Doubt And Need is useful for any of you that want to mix together Gondor and Rohan, probably to tank up Aragorn and Eomer.  Also Aragorn is given a new sword which loses its damage bonus, but gains more strength when skirmishing an Uruk, so it will probably become more widely used, as Uruk decks are going to be plentiful at tournaments.  In closing, I think that Gondor cards from this set, besides the ones dealing with Aragorn, will be used either together in a Gondor only deck, or not at all.  They are very much like the Elves of this set in concept, as they require you to devote almost everything to them.  If you wish to make a Ranger deck, I do strongly encourage it, but I fear that after the minions stop roaking for good (around site 7 after you play your cards) youll be in for a rough ride.  <br>
<br>
Cards worth using:<br>
Faramir, Son of Denethor: Great for any deck that uses a lot of companions without weapons or pumps.<br>
Aragorn, Heir of Elendil: Exact same purpose as Faramir listed above, but he can take two guys on.<br>
Every other card for the most part if you are making a ranger deck.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
ISENGARD  Sub-class after sub-class after sub-class..<br>
<br>
Well, there are around 45 or so minions for Isengard alone, and they and their support cards are divided into essentially 4 different groups: the Archers, the Trackers, the rest of the Uruk-Hai, and the Saruman/Grima connection.  Ever since the Elf Lords set, weve had to face those fierce, damage +1 minions in nearly every tournament deck.  Well, guess what. Not much is going to change about that.  Many players feel that the Uruks are far over-powered, and well, my response to them is What else did you expect?  They kicked @$$.  At least in this set, we will get to see some diversity on how they are going to be battering the fellowship.  Ill talk about each sub-class indiviually.<br>
<br>
ARCHERS  Guided minion archery. Oh #@*&!<br>
<br>
Well, we knew this would eventually be coming, but its still going to be one of those things you will learn to hate very quickly.  We have several options to choose our archers from  Band of Uruk Bowmen, Elite Crossbowmen, Ranged Commander, Uruk Crossbow Troop, and Uruk Crossbowman.  That sounds like a lot, but thankfully for the fellowship player two of those are unique, and they are all rather expansive to play.  First well look at the Ranged Commander, because as his title suggests, he will be the leader of your archers.  Costs 4 to play him so that isnt bad and he lowers the cost of fellow Uruk archers by 1.  All that and a shot of guided archery.  The Elite Crossbowmen costs a ridiculous 7, but is still worthy since he can fire two guided arrows.  Band of Uruk Bowmen is slightly less useful because not only does it cost a lot (7!), there is no guided, so I think I would pass on them.  For the Crossbow Troop, the machine is rather blah in my opinion, so you could save a couple spaces by ignoring these guys, but the Crossbowman is a cheap (costs 3) way of dealing a guided arrow.  Now the archers as a whole dont look very impressive, until you factor in their respective conditions and events.  As I said, the machine Weapons of Isengard should only be used if you plan on building a deck based around killing through archery wounds, and not just using archery as a back up to your troops.  Volley Fire looks to me like it could be the Uruk archery card of the set just save in your hand 2 Uruk Crossbowman, a Ranged Commander and a Volley Fire in your hand and you could make quick work of a fully healed companion.  Come Down is another condition that could really make your archers do some damage.  It is one of the only ways Uruks currently can get rid of allies, and since most allies are going to be exerting to do stuff, you can easily cause several wounds to them with only a couple archers.<br>
<br>
<br>
TRACKERS  Ugluks posse is ready to start something.<br>
<br>
The Uruks trackers is a brand new theme of Uruks that deals mainly with throwing down a search condition, and using that to boost their power.  Many of the trackers have the ability to add 2 to their power when skirmishing a companion bearing a search condition, so they are going to definitely be worth playing.  Brought Back Alive makes for easy skirmishing of unbound companions, so dont fret about how to kill those discarding Hobbits or that exhausted Legolas any more.  Get Back is a great card for several of those tracker minions that become strength +X or damage +X in a fierce skirmish, as you can completely prevent them from being assigned during the first skirmish.  Mauhur is a great minion if you have the extra twilight, as he can keep your trackers alive and hopefully that will prevent the Free-Peoples player to stop moving.  Or he can be used with the strength +X in a fierce skirmish minions to ensure that they survive their first skirmish.  Ugluk is the leader of the trackers, and gets some serious bonuses when you throw down a few more trackers, and with his sword he becomes even better, as you can discard a minion you dont need from hand to play another minion for its cost 3.  This makes for a possible swarm of trackers, not to mention some of them are quite cheap to play anyways.  The Uruk Searchers and Seekers will also provide a fun way to use some of those search conditions, and the strength +2 bonus, combined with Many Riddles strength 1 penalty, could allow you to win a lot of skirmishes.  And with Weary you could get even more wounds on the companions skirmishing a tracker.  I think the common Saruman will make an appearance here to assign your Searchers and Seekers to companions bearing Weary, and this will make for a lot of wounds.  Finally, we come to Vengeance, a card that makes a tracker strength +2 for each card borne by a companion he skirmishes.  Well, Aragorn usually has at least 2, plus another search card or two, making for quite a massive bonus for any tracker fighting him.<br>
<br>
<br>
AND THE REST   We are the mighty Uruk-Hai<br>
<br>
Well, many of the Uruks just didnt fall under a class except for those guys thatll be kicking your butt all over the tournament or something to that effect.  But since that was too long to type (even though I just typed it), I settled on The Rest.  Well, I should probably start with Uruk Vanguard, since it is probably the biggest minion to come for a while.  This guy will be the Cave Troll, or the Witch-King for Isengard.  He has now taken over Lurtz as the biggest minion on the block, though by no means is Lurtz small now.  At strength 17, hes enough to overwhelm any unprotected companions, and at a battleground he is damage +2 and fierce.  This is one minion I hope not to ever see against me.  The Uruk-Hai Horde, Marauder and Mob are all the more reason to make an Isengard site control deck, using Down To The Last Child to accomplish control of a few sites, and then you can deploy these minions quickly and easily.  As well, there are many Uruks that stack on sites you control, effectively creating an Uruk deck that is very cheap to play, or the Uruks that receive strength or damage bonuses based on you controlling sites, making for a very powerful site control deck.  But enough about site control, because it is sure to clarify its power through time, and now onto some of the cards that will cause quite the disturbance to your opponents fellowship.  Orthanc Champion is a great way to get rid of unbound companions, especially finding one that is exhausted (hehehe, Greenleaf).  Uruk Spear becomes an easy way to get rid of those annoying Rohan horses, and if you arent playing a Rohan deck, well a strength +2 never hurt either.  Uruk Regular is an effective way to build up the swarm as he can bring down one last Uruk for not much at all.  Not to mention that hes non-unique, so you can use several to bring down more Uruks and build a huge swarm.  Pillage of Rohan and Burning of Westfold are two great ways to get site control to obliterate your opponent, by discarding conditions and helping to win skirmishes.  And I think I should make special mention of Lieutenant of Orthanc firstly because his game text is awesome (make another Uruk fierce), but mainly because it is the best picture thus-far of an Uruk.  <br>
<br>
<br>
SARUMAN AND GRIMA  <br>
<br>
Well, I have had it with all this talk of skirmish and fierceness and so forth.  Here are the real leaders of Isengard, and their cards are out to prove it.  Little needs to be said about this version of Saruman.  If you want him to fight, use him.  If you dont want him to fight, use the Keeper of Isengard version.  In the end, I think most people will choose KoI, but it would be fun to see Saruman kick Gandalfs butt in a skirmish.  As for Grima, dont expect to see anyone playing the common version because the rare version is great.  Yes, weve all heard the talk of the Grima-bomb, and well, the talk is true.  He sends back all sorts of possessions and conditions to the Free Peoples hand, and not only causes hand clogging, but helps you whoop them in the skirmishes.  Thankfully, he can even use his ability twice.  There are also several cards to help you out if you are relying on Isengard Men, and I will explain a few that I find worthwhile.  Banished is the easy way to wound Aragorn, because he exerts every time someone else loses a skirmish, meaning he wont be too far behind.  New Power Rising could be useful to get back a key minion, especially when you dont have very many Free Peoples cards to discard.  Wounded is almost like the Black Breath of Isengard, plus it lets you exert them when you play it.  Unfortunately it is only used with either Grima or Unferth (bodyguard), so isnt as useful as if Saruman could be targetted with it.  Regardless, there are a few benefits to using the Saruman/Grima conditions in your deck, but as for now, it still seems better to focus purely on skirmishes.<br>
<br>
Ahhhh, well there was a nice 2 pages of Microsoft Word used up, and a nice 3 hours of my time (ok, so I stopped to eat and watch The Simpsons).  And all of that just on Isengard. Sheesh.  Perhaps I should continue on to the Raider, Rohan, and Shire cultures in another article, as my Raider deck is now prepared, but needs some testing before its ready.  Thank you for reading my article again (or for the first time if you missed the first article).  I hope I have been at least slightly enjoyable and entertaining.  And on a closing note, I would just like to say that the picture on Dunlending Robber looks a lot like Dave Grohl from Nirvana and the Foo Fighters.  Anyways thats just my opinion.  Hope you read the next one.<br>
