Here, I will attempt to break down the new cards and each culture. I have tested all the cards very extensively on Apprentice for a very long time, so I assure you I know what I speak of.<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarves</b><br>
Dwarves get a huge boost in this expansion, with some powerful game mechanics. The strongest is of course discard. Dwarven Axe from the first set is very powerful, and is free, allowing unlimited transfers among companions in the fellowship phase. Dwarves also revolve around the painful and annoying event Nobody Tosses a Dwarf (complete with the hand-sign), and in this set, it is that much easier for the Dwarves to win skirmishes. Dwarves are also known as hard-to-kill stalwarts. A Dwarf with Endurance of Dwarves and Dwarven Armor and some basic possessions like Dwarven Axe and Dwarven Bracers to prevent wounds is almost impossible to kill. Before, the Dwarves lacked sufficient support cards other than strength-boosters, and were helpless against Shadow conditions. The Dwarves were simply too weak and not versatile enough to deal with every threat. All that changes for the better.<br>
<br>
First off, they introduce into their ranks two new companions, namely Gloin and Fror, allowing the possibility of a pure-Dwarf deck. Fror is simply a different version of Farin, and goes hand-in-hand with his predecessor. The new Gimli has an average ability, though he would probably see more play in variations of choking decks than a pure-Dwarven deck. Gloin is very strong, with a possible base strength of 9, 11 with Dwarven Axe, and much more with all the amazing Dwarven support cards around. He requires the spotting of Tales for maximum efficieny, which will be shown here.<br>
<br>
<b>Tales</b><br>
From the first set:<br>
Greatest Kingdom of My People - Dwarves are heavily leaned towards a discard strategy, and this tale is the perfect complement. Moria depends on swarming, and will discard very frequently as they attempt to play more minions. They do have trickeries to get those cards back, but not Sauron. Greatest Kingdom applies a penalty to all Orcs played which carry a great amount of risk to the opponent. Amazing, and it is free too. A definite must.<br>
<br>
Stairs of Khazad Dum - It only helps against one culture, and the strength-boost is often not needed, but it is cumulative, and most importantly, this tale is free.<br>
<br>
From MoM:<br>
Beneath the Mountains - A debatable tale to insert. A 1-twilight cost is rather disapproved of. Its text is also not very desirable, costing a potentially painful penalty of discarding 3 cards from the top of your draw deck. It does however allow early discarding of Dwarven Axes to free up card throughput and provides a back-up to retrieve the Axe when a Dwarf dies. Most important with this tale, however, is the retrieval and recycling of Hand Axes. These deploy for free, and can be readily discarded to dispose of annoying minions and the recycling of them can provide a good platform to win skirmishes (both from the strength-bonus and the ability to utilise Flurry of Blows).<br>
<br>
Great Works Begun There - This is perhaps the bread-and-butter of any serious Dwarf deck. If you plan to draw many Dwarves, this is an important tool. By discarding the top 2 cards of your draw deck, you have the ability to grab Dwarven events from your discard pile. These can either be strength-boosters, Delving or What are We Waiting For? The most powerful strategy however is to grab Nobody Tosses a Dwarf. As can be seen, this can be very damaging. Nobody + Dwarven Axe = 4 cards gone from an opponent&#39;s draw deck, and this card allows you to recycle them, and provide a platform to use them effectively instead of Grimir. Keep 1 of these copies swimming around your discard pile and the others shuffled back with Grimir.<br>
<br>
Till Durin Wakes Again - A very useful tale which can see use in any Dwarven deck. It deploys for free which is ideal, but its text effect is amazing. It eases the passage through Sites 4 and 5, and allows you to exert without fear for Delvings or other special abilities in there. A definite staple.<br>
<br>
All the tales, perhaps with the exception of Stairs of Khazad-Dum (unless your strategy is to defeat the Balrog and Cave Troll) are very useful and should be used, even if just for boosting Gloin&#39;s strength.<br>
<br>
<b>Possessions</b><br>
In the first set, Dwarves received one of the greatest possessions in the game. Dwarven Axe deploys for free (allowing it to be played freely and transferred freely among companions when required) and adds 2 STR and has a potentially useful discard effect. The problem was that the Dwarves were weak then. Gimli could only reach 8 STR with the Axe and that was laughable compared to companions of other cultures.<br>
<br>
Hand Axe - First off, like the Dwarven Axe, it deploys for free. It allows shuttling between companions and adds 1 STR. If Dwarven Axes are missing, a Dwarf can also bear 2 Hand Axes (Flurry of Blows maybe?) and transfer them to other Dwarves when the big axes arrive. They can be discarded in the archery phase to boost the archery total, and a possible total of 4 at once is non too shabby, especially against Moria or Sauron or in a last-ditch attempt at Site 9. The Hand Axes can also be retrieved through Beneath the Mountains once they have been used for archery. Overall however, the Hand Axe is really for dedicated Dwarven decks and is more of style than pure brute force.<br>
<br>
Dwarven Bracers - A Dwarf with Dwarven Armor and sufficient Endurance is nigh-impossible to kill, except with Direct Damage. This card prevents it, and against monsters like the Balrog and Cave Troll, it often provides the ability for the Dwarf to defend in the normal and fierce skirmishes. It does deploy for 1 Twilight, though, and that is never too good. Again, more for style, with that +1 STR. If you&#39;re more centric on Gimli than attending to all Dwarves, don&#39;t forget that Gimli&#39;s Helm is free and works much better.<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions</b><br>
Make Light of Burdens - The Dwarven version of Athelas, though more perpetual and consistent with it being a condition. It is costly too with its discard effect and exertion. In a pure-Dwarven deck however, this is your only defence against conditions, no matter how small, and it does kill off the Dwarf&#39;s greatest enemy: Saruman&#39;s Snows.<br>
<br>
Golden Light on the Land - Total crap. It is too culture-specific and temporary to achieve any significant use.<br>
<br>
Realm of Darrowdelf - The last-ditch effort. The discarding effect is punishing, but sometimes, it may save you from the overwhelm. Underground, bearing the pain of discarding can give you the luxury of killing the Witch-King or any high-powered minion while avoiding the fierce skirmish. The perfect epitome of throwing it all to the wind. A card for emergencies, though take care to use it if you put it in, or it fails to justify its 1-twilight cost.<br>
<br>
Endurance of Dwarves - So much has been waxed lyrical of this card and it is understandable. It is not unique or &quot;Limit 1 per bearer&quot;, allowing you to give Gimli 7 vitality if you wish (and son of Gloin 6 exertions for 18 STR if you wish) though that is impractical and the conditions should be spread among the Dwarves. It gives the Dwarves the ability to soak up wounds and exertions, and true to its name, makes them much harder to kill, whether it be Damage +1 minions getting frustrated or Hate and Enquea losing their effectiveness. A definite staple in any dedicated Dwarven deck.<br>
<br>
<b>Events</b><br>
Disquiet of our People - Dwarves have been accused of not doing a good job of protecting the ring-bearer. Sure, they may be good in skirmishes and hard to kill but ultimately, it all depends on making the ring-bearer hard to kill. Elves and Gondor have their archery and hobbit-support cards. Gandalf has his spells and such. Hobbits certainly help their kin. With this card, however, the Dwarves are of much greater use. They are hard to kill, so when swarmed, they can often fight 3 Orcs and live to tell the story. A good card which use depends on your strategy and meta-game.<br>
<br>
Flurry of Our Blows - A great choice if you play with a consistent selection of both axes. Experiment, however, and test whether Axe Strike would be a better addition. Spotting a companion is potentially hard (unless you start him, of course). Spotting a weapon on him is harder. Spotting TWO weapons on him is...<br>
<br>
Tidings of Erebor - Pure crap. If you do not plan to move, you might as well reconcile normally. If you plan to move, there is only that chance you might draw a useful Free Peoples event. The goods far outweigh the evil here.<br>
<br>
What are We Waiting For? - I will not comment on this card, as it has not been tested sufficiently. A card worth experimenting, which revolves around the idea of reducing the danger of the Fellowship, and thus perhaps a new mechanic to the game.<br>
<br>
<b>Verdict</b><br>
The Dwarves are definitely viable contenders, and are definitely the first choice for a discarding option. Dwarven Axe provides the foundation, and Nobody Tosses a Dwarf can be recycled easily with Grimir and Great Works Begun There. Greatest Kingdom can wreak havoc and at times caution the opponent against playing too many Orcs. These options put them above Elves, as they discard from deck, not from hand. In the first set, sure, these cards existed, but the Dwarves were simply too weak. They got bullied by conditions and were simply no-brainers with skirmish events (inconsistency). Now they rank right up there. Gloin spotting 4 tales, bearing a Dwarven Axe, Bracer and Hand Axe is a 13, which matches the best any other culture has to offer. Couple him with Dwarven Armor and Endurance of Dwarves and he is indestructible. Ditto with Gimli.<br>
<br>
What they have to worry of is Goblin Warrior and the mother of them all, Saruman&#39;s Power. Warrior discards the new useful Dwarven conditions, undermining their use and possibly lowering Gloin&#39;s strength, but most decks run at most 2 of it. Scarest is Saruman&#39;s Power because face it, it discards ALL the new useful Dwarven conditions, undermining ALL their uses and possible destroying the endurance of Gimli and Gloin, KILLING them possibly in the process. There is not much to do about Power, with the only way being how Shadow suffered under Gandalf: Safeguarding the conditions in hand. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3448&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
