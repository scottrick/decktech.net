I&#39;ll either get 1* for not being &quot;game related&quot; (or from a couple odd-ball people that like Virginia), or I&#39;ll get 5* for being semi-helpful and quasi-entertaining.  But either way, I fell for a big-time snow-job coming to Virginia, and it&#39;s my personal mission to protect others from my fate whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I lived in New Jersey for a large portion of my life, and I&#39;m sure most of you out there will agree with me when I say, I was never really overly-impressed with New Jersey.  So when my company paid a professional liar to come tell me about the wonders of Virginia (and offered me a small burlap bag full of cash), I &quot;headed up the truck and moved to Beverly&quot;, but it sure as hell wasn&#39;t the Hills.  Only now, stuck here in this region of the country, do I truly realize how lucky I was to live in the Garden State, and thus on goes my quest to get back.<br />
<br />
Now it&#39;s important to note, that when I refer to &quot;locals&quot; in the coming paragraphs, that I am *NOT* referring to the Virginia-living card players you will meet at D-Con.  There is a group of maybe 8-12 guys, that I see consistently at LotR and SWCCG tournaments, that have been a pleasure to meet.  The majority of people here that play Decipher games are top-notch guys, cool to hang with, and bring some high-quality game to the table (although if you were coming down for Yu-Gi-Oh, I&#39;d tell you to gouge your own eye out with a fork instead, those kids are little bastards).  Any time I say &quot;locals&quot; I am referring to the general population down here, not the gamers.  That being said, here are some tips...<br />
<br />
<br />
DRIVING 1:<br />
Budget extra time to get anywhere.  Do NOT plan on &quot;running five minutes up the street&quot; and cutting it close to the registration time of ANY event.  Traffic down here is so ridiculously slow, you always have to allow extra time.<br />
A) There&#39;s lots of traffic all day.  We don&#39;t really have a rush hour, so between unemployed people and soccer moms, we have about the same volume on the road from 8AM to 7PM.<br />
B) Nobody down here does the speed limit.  If it&#39;s a 35, they do 25.  If it&#39;s 55, they do 50.  That goes for highways, back roads, everywhere.<br />
C) Nobody can make a left turn, so traffic lights are crazy-long.  By the time every lane gets their own light, you can easily be stuck at a light for 90-120 seconds per light, times the 2-3 lights it takes to get through.<br />
<br />
DRIVING 2:<br />
Be careful.  The locals around here are the worst drivers you&#39;ll ever see.<br />
A) Don&#39;t tailgate on the highway.  Nobody down here knows how to merge, so if you&#39;re doing 55 on the highway, the car in front of you may come to a sudden FULL STOP to wave somebody from the merge lane in.<br />
B) Don&#39;t ride next to anybody.  2 out of 3 drivers down here just arbitrarily change lanes without signaling or looking first.  They just mosey wherever it is they were going, with no thought that there might actually be somebody else on the road.<br />
C) State Police cars in VA are manure-brown, as it&#39;s apparently the state color.  What this means is once you take down your Radar (which is illegal down here), it is a lot harder to spot these cops hidden in the tree-line.<br />

DRIVING 3:<br />
Figure out everywhere you might actually go while you&#39;re down here, and get directions from MapQuest before you leave.  Do NOT ask a local for directions.<br />
A) They have no idea about street names, distances, or directions.  Your conversation would go something like this:<br />
&quot;How do I get to XYZ?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, you go on out here down the road a bit, then get on the Interstate....&quot;<br />
&quot;Which Interstate, 64, 264, 464, or 664?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um, the one down this road here.&quot;<br />
&quot;64 or 264?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, whichever one goes sorta like, under the bridge thingy.&quot;<br />
&quot;East or West?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, whichever way Western Branch (or any other neighborhood not on any map) is, then you go down for a while to the Coonskin exit, and a way&#39;s after that, turn right at Bob&#39;s house and then you&#39;re there.&quot;<br />
B) The engineers who built our area didn&#39;t understand a compass.  So if you try to use logic, you will get lost.  Like when you come over the bridge, you have a choice of East or West.  Common sense says, I just saw the ocean to my East, so Chesapeake would be West.  You&#39;d be wrong, you have to take East to go AWAY from the ocean to the East of you.  Most signs have given up completely on the N/S/E/W concept, and instead just give town names.  Instead of 64E and 64W, you have 64 VaBeach and 64 Norfolk.  Then you just have to remember to NOT take the 64 Norfolk exit if you&#39;re trying to take 64 to the Norfolk Airport.  Norfolk Airport would obviously require you go *opposite* the way the 64 Norfolk sign points.<br />
<br />
TAX:<br />
VA taxes everything you can possibly think of.  Stuff that isn&#39;t taxed other places like clothes, groceries and toilet paper, is taxed here.  And things that are taxed elsewhere, they tax double.  For example, sales tax is 4.5%.  But, if you buy &quot;prepared food&quot;, i.e., a soda through the McDonald&#39;s drive-through, it&#39;s 4.5% sales tax, PLUS an additional 5.5% prepared food tax.  So if you&#39;re planning on following Eric Hunter&#39;s guide to eating cheap at Wendy&#39;s during Cons, budget a little extra $$.  $0.99 chicken nuggets are now a $1.09.  And don&#39;t even get me started on how I have to pay 4.108% tax on the value of my car every single year.<br />
<br />
RELIGION:<br />
Virginia is not technically in the Bible Belt, but it is definitely a religious place.  Now I have no problem with religion.  I think people should believe what they want to believe, and practice what they want to practice, I just hate having it forced on everybody else.  For example, I&#39;m from the NorthEast, so I say &quot;howyadoin&#39;?&quot; as greeting.  So if I go outside, my neighbor will say &quot;Hi there&quot;, I&#39;ll respond with &quot;Hey, howyadoin&#39;?&quot;, to which he gives me something like &quot;I&#39;m blessed, every day is wonderful when you have Jesus with you.&quot;  Like, I&#39;m happy that the guy is that at peace with himself, but I have NO FRIGGIN&#39; IDEA what the proper response to that is.  Me too?  That&#39;s nice?  What?  I don&#39;t know.  So instead I just don&#39;t say hi.  Even at Wendy&#39;s it&#39;s not &quot;thank you, come again&quot;, but rather &quot;have a blessed day&quot;.  Again, I have no problem with people being religious, I&#39;m just not used to it as every day conversation between strangers.<br />
<br />
PROFANITY:<br />
This is probably a derivative of the Religion topic, but people down here are all about not cursing.  Like during volleyball at the Y, I shanked a pass out of bounds and said &quot;sh_t!&quot;, and everybody just stopped and stared at me like I had three heads.  In fact, one of the card stores I used to go to had a policy where YOU could get thrown out of the store, if the person next to you was &quot;practice cursing&quot; (saying &quot;shoot&quot; or &quot;fudge&quot; instead of &quot;sh_t&quot; or &quot;f_ck&quot;) and you didn&#39;t tell on them.  Bob says &quot;dang&quot;, Billy doesn&#39;t tattle on him, Bob and Billy both get thrown out.  So you can imagine how they react to somebody like me who out of deigo-habit says f_ck in just about every other sentence.<br />
<br />
EDUCATION:<br />
Expect to be surprised at how many people down here can&#39;t read, can&#39;t write, and can&#39;t do basic math.  The state of Virginia has 13% of the eligible population without their diploma, and even Chesapeake, the so-called &quot;Big City&quot; has 10% of their people old enough to be out of High School missing their diploma.  So don&#39;t even bother doing things like giving cashiers $11.05 for your $6.04 order, they will never figure out that you wanted a five dollar bill back.  It was a three person, multi-register debate one afternoon at Wal-Mart about what &quot;10% off&quot; of $4.99 was. One of last year&#39;s big scandals was that the governor of Virginia couldn&#39;t even spell Virginia.  Multiple times in a hand-written letter, he called it &quot;VirginA&quot;.<br />
<br />
NIGHTLIFE:<br />
Last year D-Con was at Virginia Beach, so there were actually a few bars and clubs open around town.  Most of them sucked, but at least they were there.  In Chesapeake, we have NOTHING.  The population is all so thoroughly made up of relocated family yuppies and in-bred hillbillies who just drink turpentine in their back yard, that there is almost nowhere to go &quot;out&quot; at night in Chesapeake itself.  I&#39;ve heard rumors that a good time can be had if you want to go over to &quot;Waterside&quot; in Norfolk (which by the way, is the opposite direction of the ocean), but you&#39;re on your own to figure that one out.  I can tell you this, you&#39;d have to drunken drive at least 25-30 minutes back to your hotel from Waterside if you stayed near the Con. <br />
<br />
WATER:<br />
The water here is *not* good for you.  Plan on either bringing or buying bottled water, gatorade, soda, whatever, and even avoid ice when possible.  Don&#39;t drink out of the fountains.  It&#39;s no Montezuma&#39;s Revenge, but you will notice a definite difference after a day or two on our water.  It&#39;s like having those morning beer-shytes every day of your life, without the enjoyment of actually drinking beer.  Plus, there was a class-action lawsuit either still pending or recently settled by the local women against the City of Chesapeake because one of the minimal-cost water treatments they were skipping resulted in a large increase in the amount of miscarriages over a certain timeframe.<br />
<br />
ALLERGIES:<br />
If you have allergies, prepare for hell.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because we live in a swamp, or because of the jet-fuel that just floats out of the sky (we have a lot of military bases) and coats everything, or if it gets back to the water supply or what.  But people who have allergies tell me it&#39;s about 3-4 times worse for them here then wherever else they used to live.  Even myself, who has never had allergies, has woken up every morning for the last 17 months with my nose all gunked shut and my eyes all crusty.  I really pity those of you with Athsma.<br />
<br />
BREAD:<br />
We make bad, bad bread down here.  If you go to a franchise like Wendy&#39;s or the Olive Garden it&#39;s fine, because the bread is shipped in.  But if you go to grocery store or a Mom&Pop sandwich shop, the bread will be awful.  So the same way you should plan on buying as much water as possible, you should also plan on not buying any type of bread from a place that strikes you as &quot;local&quot;.  Oh, and they can&#39;t make pizza worht a sh_t down here either.<br />
<br />
<br />
But on a positive note:<br />
<br />
RADIO:<br />
We do have some decent radio stations down here.  Not many, but the one&#39;s we have are pretty good.  Based on what I&#39;ve seen on this site and who I&#39;ve met, a lot of you would probably like 96.1/106.1 or 98.7 if you&#39;re into the current &quot;modern rock&quot; type music.  By the way, 96.1 and 106.1 are the same station, it just depends on which one your car picks up better.  If you like more &quot;rap/club&quot; music, 102.1, 102.9, and 104.5 are good as well.  For more Top 40 type people, 94.9 and 93.7 are decent too.<br />
<br />
OTHER:<br />
There are a couple other cool things about Virginia, but most of them you won&#39;t be down here long enough to appreciate.  For example,<br />
A) We can burn anything we want on our lawns.  Trash, leaves, furniture, if you don&#39;t want it any more, go outside and light it up.  Every now and then I consider getting rid of my girlfriend this way.<br />
B) You can buy weapons in Wal-Mart, drunk, at 2AM.  Granted, you can&#39;t get like, a bazooka or anything, but air rifles, CO2 pistols, arm slingslots, bow & arrow, etc. can all be yours at any time.<br />
C) There is no C.  You may think this place &quot;isn&#39;t so bad&quot; when you come to visit for a few days, and trust me, this place can be more than O.K. if you&#39;re only coming down for a visit.  But when everything on this list happens to you every day of your life, and you have to pay EXTRA taxes to live it, you learn to hate it really fast.<br />
