Orcs of the White Hand, servants of Isengard. And now that I&#39;ve seen the movie... my respect for them hasn&#39;t diminished at all. These wee beasties are nasty. A common complaint of ccgs is the &quot;Mr Suitcase&quot; effect, ie, the person with the most money to spend will win. While I think that LotR suffers from this to an extent, it isn&#39;t as bad as Magic, or Star Wars. To that end, I decided to see what could be done with the Isengard culture, using only commons and uncommons. So here are my ideas. (I&#39;m assuming that you know the card text of the cards. If not, go get yourself a spoiler. I&#39;ll wait for you. Got one? Good :) )<br>
<br>
First of all, the conditions.<br>
No Ordinary Storm. Yes, it&#39;s situational. But you know if you have weather conditions in your deck. And trying to exhaust Gandalf is always a good idea - in a multiplayer game, your fellow shadow players will love you for it. (Then annihilate you on your fellowship turn.)<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s Ambition is a stable card of an Uruk-Hai deck. It&#39;s free, plays immediately, and boosts an Uruk-Hai by two. You don&#39;t even need to spot anything to play it. And hey, you might want to play an event cheaper.<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s Chill. The worst of the weather conditions in my opinion. But also the cheapest. It gives your opponent another reason not to move again, but also activates the No Ordinary Storm, and boosts up the Messenger. I&#39;d use a couple of them in an Isengard weather deck.<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s Frost. The second weather condition, and a bit better. But no where near as good as the Snows, because they only effect hobbits, the most important of whom tries to avoid fighting as much as possible. Still, it would massacre a dedicated hobbit deck.<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s Snows. Makes planning how a battles going to go much, much easier. Unfortunately not as effective if the fellowship has weapons out, but don&#39;t underestimate it. The Uruk-Hai can take almost anyone without anything else coming into it.<br>
<br>
Their Arrow&#39;s Enrage. How often have I seen in a decklist Arwen, and an Elven Bow to put on her. Or Aragorn, and his bow? This card makes them pay for it. Combine with the Armory to take down their archery total, and you and smite down your opponents companions much easier.<br>
<br>
Traitors Voice. I never really saw the point of this, to be honest. If you can spot the burdens or an exhausted ringbearer, things must be going your way, and you want the fellowship to move again, to give them a beating.<br>
<br>
Uruk Brood. Never really saw the point of this, either. If they&#39;ve already won a skirmish, they aren&#39;t going to be taking wounds unless the fellowship moves again. And if you&#39;ve got Uruk-Hai winning skirmishes, the fellowship won&#39;t want to move again.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai Armory. A good anti-archery card, and you&#39;ll always be able to spot an Uruk-Hai (Otherwise you don&#39;t need to worry about archery.) However, don&#39;t go overboard and put four of them in - most Uruk-Hai can take multiple wounds, so archery fire isn&#39;t as bad for them as it is for, say Moria or Sauron cultures (Who need their exertions to rock.)<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai Rampage. Great card. A staple of most Uruk-Hai decks. Sure, for three twilight, you could get another beastie altogether. Remember though, the fellowship gives you twilight during the skirmish phase, and the threat of a fierce minion might stop them playing their Defiance, or Mysterious Wizard.<br>
<br>
Worry. The reason why Uruk-Hai are so scary. They&#39;re strong, which helps them win skirmishes. And they&#39;re Damage+1, which is an added bonus, but effectively hitting the ring-bearer each time you win a skirmish? And it&#39;s only uncommon!<br>
<br>
And now the events.<br>
Bred for Battle. The best all-round pumping card of the game. Sure, you have to exert to do it, but most of the Uruk-Hai have >1 vitality anyway. And it adds three strength, all the time.<br>
<br>
Breeding Pit. I like to stick one or two in my decks, just so when it comes to the end of the game, and we&#39;ve both nearly exhausted our decks, I know I have some minions left for that one last attempt to wear my opponent down.<br>
<br>
Hunt them Down! Not as good, in my opinion, as Uruk-Hai Rampage. It costs the same, but is played during the Shadow phase, marking your fierce minion for annihilation. Besides, you could get another Uruk-Hai out for three twilight.<br>
<br>
Saruman&#39;s Power. Like Sleep, Caradhras, it&#39;s a two-edged sword. After all, you&#39;d get rid of your Ambitions and Rampages. But sometimes it&#39;s worth it to take out a Far Seeing Eyes, Shoulder to Shoulder, or Last Alliance.<br>
<br>
Wariness. In theory, it&#39;s good. And maybe you&#39;ll get lucky and catch the ring-bearer out when he tries to hide. But in my opinion it too much of a specific, situational card to make it into my decks.<br>
<br>
There&#39;s only one possession, making it nice and easy.<br>
Uruk-Hai Sword. Like all swords, adds two strength. The special ability doesn&#39;t do anything really, unless you were going for a discard deck, but it&#39;s nice to have around. They aren&#39;t as good as Goblin Scimitars, though. Still, stick a sword on someone, drop the snows, and you&#39;re almost assured of a win.<br>
<br>
And last, but not least, the minions.<br>
Uruk Brood. Like the Slayer, but Worse in my opinion. Same basic stats, but to start taking advantage of it&#39;s gametext over the Slayer, you have to have three other minions out. There are better all around minions out there.<br>
<br>
Uruk Fighter. I like these guys. For three pool, you get eight strength. And the possibility of a free fierce. Also, Five companions is much more common than six.<br>
<br>
Uruk Messenger. I&#39;ve thought about a deck with these guys, and weather conditions, but it never seems to pan out. A pity.<br>
<br>
Uruk Rager. These guys are nice in a discard deck. (Especially if they&#39;re carrying swords.) But for a general deck, for four twilight, I&#39;d prefer a Slayer or Raiding Party.<br>
<br>
Uruk Savage. The runts of the Uruk-Hai. But don&#39;t overlook them, three wounds is quite impressive. They can soak up archery fire, and could just be the extra minion you need to pull the ring-bearer into a fight. (At which point you Bred for Battle him twice and burn the Ambitions.)<br>
<br>
Uruk Shaman. I&#39;ve never actually seen these guys special ability be used. But still, they&#39;re solid minions for three pool. Eight strength will take an unenhanced companion, except for Gandalf.<br>
<br>
Uruk Slayer. I like these guys. Sure, they&#39;re expensive. But at the end of the game, when you&#39;ve got pool to spare, they&#39;re great. Or leave three in the pool just for him. Works great as an intimidation tactic.<br>
<br>
Uruk Solider. Good for the discard deck idea, but only one vitality is a real hindrance. Your opponent will know you can&#39;t Bred him, and he dies oh so easily to directed archery.<br>
<br>
Uruk Warrior. My favorite Uruk-Hai. For three pool, you get nine strength. enough said. His gametext has only ever come into use once that I&#39;ve seen. And unfortunately I was on the receiving end. But don&#39;t use him for that. Use him for his very impressive stats.<br>
<br>
Uruk-Hai Raiding Party. They have three vitality, which is nice, but I&#39;d take a Warrior any day. Hey, their gametext *might* get use.<br>
<br>
Well, that took a little longer than I thought it would. But there are all the common/uncommon Isengard cards in the game (So far.) What? You want me to build a shadow deck out of them for you? Oh, aright... you&#39;ve twisted my arm.<br>
<br>
4x Worry.<br>
4x Bred for Battle<br>
4x Saruman&#39;s Ambition<br>
2x Uruk-Hai Rampage<br>
2x Saruman&#39;s Snows<br>
4x Uruk Shaman<br>
4x Uruk Fighter<br>
4x Uruk Warrior<br>
2x Uruk Slayer<br>
3x Uruk Savage<br>
2x Uruk-Hai Raiding Party<br>
<br>
It&#39;s a quick, rather unsubtle Shadow deck. Get out minions. Beat people with them. Add burdens/wounds to Frodo.
