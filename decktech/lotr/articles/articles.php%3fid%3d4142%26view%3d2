<br>
<br>
    Several reviewers of the first article were disappointed because they expected to read more information about site selection. Hopefully, this article will meet their expectations. Besides my first article, Devon Clark&#8217;s article, The Advantageous Adventure Path (Part I and II) also objectively discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each site. Furthermore, several decks, under strategy have mentioned important points about site selection for the Adventure Path.  For example, Swarthy Ferne&#8217;s deck, Waiting for the Palintir II, discussed the meta game relative to site 9 selection. This article focuses on sites that support twilight choke and related running strategies. It is important for players getting information from this and similar Web pages to understand that the larger the tournament field one is planning and preparing for, i.e. Worlds, then the harder it is to apply definitive meta game strategies, especially with the selection of sites.<br>
<br>
    Strategies about bidding depend on a philosophy that one will prefer to adhere to. You may face bids of seven burdens or bids of only a single burden, even zero burdens. Either extreme should be expected as normal. For some players, being able to choose whether or not to move first (play the first site or the second site) is critical. Some players&#8217; decks, for example, revolve and succeed around putting Aragorn being put into the Fellowship as soon as possible. In order to do that then, being able to play site 1, The Prancing Pony, is paramount. And other players want to establish a card drawing engine early by putting Gandalf&#8217;s Cart into play at site 1, for example, by playing Shire Lookout Point. In the above two scenarios your opponent&#8217;s bid will more than likely be large. Other players believe their deck can be successful regardless of whether or not they move first, and these players may even prefer to move second so that they can play their sites 2 and 3 to overcome twilight choke. A deck heavy with Nazguls, for example, will prefer to play Bree Street, Weatherhill, or Ford of Bruinen at sites 2 and 3. In the latter two examples your opponent&#8217;s bid will probably be 0 or 1. A final point I&#8217;ll make about bidding is worth noting here. Many players view playing second as being able to draw extra cards, maybe four extra cards before moving from site 1 to site 2. Generally, they want to draw more Free People&#8217;s cards so that they will get defensive cards to support a brisk run by their fellowship on Turn 1, even as far as site 4 in some cases. Your deck will need to respond appropriately to either strategy.<br>
<br>
     Given the above backdrop of a high level of game play that begins with understanding bidding and starting sites I will talk about site choices that support a strategy that emphasizes twilight choke. Your first site should not be one that you are dependent on.<br>
A player pursuing a &#8220;lighter path&#8221; should avoid a deck design that depends on pulling Sam or Aragorn, for example from their draw deck. Sites such as The Prancing Pony and The Green Dragon Inn generally increase the twilight pool. This increase of twilight may be enough for your opponent to play a Nazgul at site 2 or even get a condition into play that requires a certain minion be spotted first. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    Select starting sites that will not promote some of the more common deck strategies at the least. In other words you should strive to leave your opponent dependent on her random, eight-card draw to be able to put additional companions, etc. into play. Which site #1s avoid most deck strategies? Three sites seem to best suited for this role. Westfarthing, Hobbiton Woods, and Buckleberry Ferry support the goal of avoiding most strategies while limiting twilight. Westfarthing reduces the cost of playing a companion or ally already in your opening hand by 1 twilight. Hobbiton Woods lets you replace site 2 with your own version of site 2. And Buckleberry Ferry keeps twilight low for an exclusively Hobbit fellowship. A fourth site deserving consideration, especially if you absolutely will not need to play a companion at site 1 from hand, is East Road. East Road will benefit you during your first Shadow Phase by adding extra twilight if your opponent plays a companion from hand at site 1.<br>
<br>
    It is my contention that site 2, overall, is more important than site 1 for two reasons. First, because for a deck that is designed to take advantage of it, one version of site 2 enables the fellowship to move to site 4 on the first turn. If the opposing fellowship had to stop at site 2,  then that fellowship is already two sites behind, and more than likely that opponent will have to kill Frodo in order to win. I am referring to Bree Gate. It increases your permitted moves by +1 if a Ranger is spotted in your fellowship. Second, because many starting fellowships of a deck include a Ranger &#8211; either a combination of Arwen/Sam or Arwen/Legolas site 2 should not be underestimated. Site 2 alone may be another reason so many players bid high. They bid high not to choose to go first, but in order to be able to play their second site, frequently that site is Bree Gate. And if they choose to play first then Hobbiton Woods is a popular choice since it can be used to play the second site too. <br>
<br>
    Whether or not a deck will benefit by certain sites, again, depends on your deck&#8217;s design. If a starting fellowship includes a Ranger then Hobbiton Woods and Bree Gate makes sense. Between the two sites, only an extra twilight token is added to the pool. On the other hand, if your deck does not have a Ranger in the starting fellowship then Westfarthing and Midgewater Marshes is a better choice of sites. Midgewater Marshes adds just one twilight token to the pool when the fellowship moves there, whereas the exertion of Frodo for using the site&#8217;s text will be removed at Sanctuary &#8211; site 3.<br>
<br>
     Similar to the above strategies above site 3 offers two significant choices, Council Courtyard or Rivendell Waterfall. Rivendell Waterfall supports a Ranger based fellowship. It works well with a Hobbiton Woods and Bree Gate set-up and a rapidly running fellowship. If a fellowship doesn&#8217;t spot a Ranger, then Council Courtyard is a an excellent alternative that sees frequent tournament use. The Courtyard will allow a player to put an ally, artifact, condition, companion, or possession into play without really adding twilight since two twilight will be removed when the fellowship moves to site 4. Should a player choose not to play any cards at site 3, or at least only play cards with no twilight cost, then when the fellowship moves to site 4 during the Shadow phase there will be seven twilight at most if the fellowship has only 4 companions. <br>
<br>
    The fellowship has now reached site 4. Before moving there, however, this article will make a final point about sites 2 and 3. An opponent&#8217;s sites 2 and 3 are a quick indicator, a barometer of sorts, that can indicate whether or not the shadow side of her deck is full of Nazgul. A deck that is solitarily Nazgul probably will not be able to swarm your fellowship which means you can allow a companion to be killed in a skirmish when you can replace the companion during your next fellowship. But a Nazgul deck has a propensity to skirmish with fierce minions, which needs to be considered when assigning companions to skirmishes or deciding to run (move twice) on the path. So if your opponent is not putting out Weathertop or similar Nazgul sites that benefit Nazgul, then he or she, obviously, will be using the Isengard, Moria, or Sauron cultures instead. The best way to know for sure which culture your opponent is using before moving to site 4, and to know what cards are in her hand, is to use Frodo&#8217;s Sting. Frodo&#8217;s Sting is so heavily in demand by tournament players because it is a &#8220;crystal ball&#8221; weapon. Just like in the book (and Movies) Sting senses the presense of Orcs! More importantly, by using Sting&#8217;s ability at site 3 you will know what you will face, more or less, at sites 4 and 5. Also, you will have a good idea about the opponent&#8217;s ability to successfully skirmish your minions. Playing Saruman when you know that an opponent has no Stealth Events in hand is a great edge. In the Lord of the Rings CCG &#8220;Knowledge&#8221; is Power!<br>
<br>
    When you are putting site 4 into play your opponent&#8217;s fellowship is probably ahead of your fellowship. I believe that it is paramount that you be able to stop your opponent&#8217;s fellowship from running (moving twice) at least one time during the game. Being able to stop the opponent&#8217;s fellowship from running between site 4 and The Bridge is the first good opportunity to do so because of the total twilight available between the sites. Some fellowships get stopped at site 2, but rarely, and usually only because of a very poor draw which a good player should not rely on. So if your opponent is able to run from site 3 to site 5 there must at least be a consequence. Twilight choke should never be a concern at sites 4 and 5. Instead, a site 4 should be used that supports the Shadow strategy of your deck. A list of some of the important sites and the Shadow culture(s) enhanced by the site follows.<br>
<br>
         Pass of Caradhas &#8211; Isengard (Weather Conditions)<br>
         Hollin &#8211; Isengard or Uruk-Hai<br>
         Moria Stairway &#8211; Moria Orcs (Goblin Scimitar)<br>
         Eregion Hills &#8211; Sauron (Gleaming in the Snow)<br>
         Mithril Mine &#8211; Ring Wraithor Moria Orcs<br>
         Moria Lake &#8211; Fierce Minions or Waiting Strategies *<br>
<br>
(* A waiting strategy, for example, is to play a fear card, i.e. Saruman and nothing else at site 4, or play nothing at all at site 4 in order to provide as much twilight as possible for 3 or 4 of your minions to be played at site 5 if the opponent&#8217;s fellowship runs to the Bridge. Small fellowships (4 or less companions) are very cautious and a waiting strategy is highly successful in slowing them, else they risk losing key companions, possibly the game at site 5)  <br>
<br>
    Between sites 4 and 5 top players will usually use most of the 15 twilight tokens that they generally have to work with to try and get the key cards from their deck they need in hand or into play to give maximum winning chances. And if an opponent or yourself has had the opportunity to peak into the other player&#8217;s hand (with Sting) many winning combinations are played here! Many players, however, will also make the mistake of playing one half of a key combination here, i.e. a minion, instead of waiting until they draw the other half of the combination. Later, at sites 7 through 9, they regret having played the card when they draw the second half of the combination. One has to know when to be patient, especially at sites 4 and 5. Key Tip: Do not become desperate to play a card just because there is twilight in the pool, even if your opponent cannot move again.<br>
I&#8217;ve watched strong players &#8220;pass&#8221; during the Shadow phase at site 4 and even discard a shadow card when they have no other Shadow cards in hand during their Regroup phase of the same turn. Why do they do this? A Strong player is using the &#8220;Waiting Strategy&#8221;  (discussed previously above) or is bluffing, either way they are making it hard for their opponent to decide whether or not to move the fellowship twice. A strategy employed by players preferring the &#8220;Lighter Path&#8221; is to avoid playing Free People&#8217;s cards during the Fellowship Phase, accept unless really needed to support the deck&#8217;s strategy, i.e. A Promise. Sites 4 and 5 are good sites to discard an unneeded Free People&#8217;s card (sometimes a strong event card) from hand during Regroup, i.e. especially an Event, to set-up an ambush. They are indicating that they have a hand full of Free People&#8217;s cards when in fact their hand is full of Shadow cards. So be careful not to fall into this common trap and decide to run thinking your opponent doesn&#8217;t have many shadow cards in hand when at the same time you don&#8217;t have enough cards in hand to support your fellowship during the Skirmish phase. You may just find your ring-bearer being overwhelmed.  The two examples above are excellent examples of how strong players play. Strong players will employ strategies that encourage their opponent to have to make decisions by guessing. Half of the time an opponent will guess wrong. So many players when faced with having to guess (facing the unknown) will avoid the unkown until they are forced to face it. This is a technique strong players use slow down their opponent&#8217;s fellowship on the Adventure path. While I&#8217;ve briefly mentioned the &#8220;unknown&#8221; I&#8217;ll move onto site 5, the Bridge.<br>
<br>
    There is no choice of sites to be made here since Decipher decided to have all players cross the Bridge, but site 5 offers a different kind of choice. All players do not know whether or not they will face the Balrog at the Bridge, but the threat is real. The Balrog is a common card, and most players make room in their deck for at least one copy. The Free Peoples player must calculate whether or not it is likely the Balrog will be played at the Bridge and the resources they have available to face it. On the other hand, the Shadow player must decide whether or not to play the Balrog &#8211; will its impact help them have a chance to win? How a player fights the Balrog depends depends on two elements: 1.) The Event cards in their hand, and 2.) The Fellowship -Companions in play. It is a good strategy to hold back at least one skirmish event card at site 5 &#8211; even if facing the Balrog or another tough minion, for skirmishes at sites 6 through 9, especially site 6, in case you don&#8217;t have an opportunity to draw another one.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Because you chose to let a companion be killed at site 5 instead of using an Event card your opponent may not expect you to have one in hand when you move to site 6, and this can help you survive the run from site 4 to site 6. It is a lot better to start your turn at site 6 than site 5! Also, holding back event cards during the first move of a turn supports twilight choke &#8211; it may mean the difference by a single twilight token of facing an additional minion. Only one the Shadow culture&#8217;s employs an effective strategy which can use additional twilight during the regroup phase of a second move &#8211; Isengard. Strategic Tip: When facing Isengard Orcs if your opponent has exhausted the twilight pool during the Shadow phase avoid adding new twilight during the Skirmish/Regroup Phases, etc. This can mean the difference between taking 5 or 6 additional wounds on your companions! So you have survived and have read this far then we will move now to site 6 &#8211; Sanctuary!<br>
<br>
    The fellowship has reached site 6. Ok, so Frodo didn&#8217;t bring Sting with him and your minions don&#8217;t have Saruman&#8217;s Palintir either. Well the correct site 6 will let you look into your opponent&#8217;s hand, unfortunately, if your site 6 is in play, then your opponent has had the opportunity to look into your hand first. We all hate giving up our privacy, don&#8217;t we? Since Galadriel&#8217;s Glade is a two-edged sword (it probably will cut you first and you thought you were supposed to heal at a sanctuary site!) then Dimrill Dale or Caras Galadhon are better options for your path. But Galadhon can be ruled out, along with Lothlorien Woods, because Galadriel can exert at a Forest site and can change the site anyway. Giving &#8211;2 twilight to a Moria Orc at Dimrill Dale is a better choice and doesn&#8217;t offer much for your opponent to write home about. <br>
<br>
    So far, Lighter Path site selection has been relatively easy to select or identify. Site 7, however, may be the hardest of the sites to pick from, unless you are absolutely sure of the meta game. (Meta game refer to what the majority of a field in a tournament will have in their decks) Beyond knowing that then, ask yourself (be honest) what frustrates your deck the most? At the least, your deck should have resources for dealing with strategies that pose it the most difficulties. Since all site 7s provide 6 twilight are choice is not narrowed. Answering the following 5 questions and focusing on the one or two questions that are most pertinent to your deck is a good guide for choosing the site that is best for your deck:<br>
<br>
1.	Will your fellowship have a Ranger in it when site 7 is reached?<br>
2.	Does your deck depend on Elvish Allies and Gift of Boats to pass your opponent on the path? (Or other allies to protect the ring-bearer?)       <br>
3.	Does your deck recycle its minions, i.e. Moria Orcs?<br>
4.	Does Archery devastate your minions or does your deck not have a way to reduce the opponent&#8217;s fellowship&#8217;s archery total?<br>
5.	Does your deck depend on minion archers to apply damage to the fellowship in order to stop it from moving before it reaches site 9?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Answers and the matching sites:<br>
<br>
1.	Yes &#8211; use Silverlode Banks<br>
2.	Yes &#8211; do not use Anduin Confluence<br>
3.	Yes &#8211; do not use The Great River<br>
4.	Yes &#8211; use Anduin Wilderland<br>
5.	Yes &#8211; Do not use Anduin Wilderland    <br>
<br>
The focus of site 7 selection has been on the Free Peoples half of your deck, which is unlike and the opposite of how site 4 was selected. Why? The focus has changed from the Shadow to Free Peoples half of the deck because at this point along the path if your site 7 has been played it means you are trailing. And that means you need to be able to run (double move) either between sites 6 and 7 or between sites 7 and 8. And to do that your fellowship needs to be able to survive moving twice with the cards you begin the turn with and against the extra cards your opponent will more than likely draw. Also, minions should probably be conserved &#8211; held back at your own site 7 so that you can put up maximum resistance against the opponent&#8217;s fellowship at either site 8 or 9 (both if possible).<br>
<br>
    Sites 8 and 9 are only about stopping your opponent&#8217;s fellowship &#8211; period! Their only consideration should be based on the Shadow culture and type of minions your deck is built around.  Nothing else matters!<br>
<br>
      If your strategy/deck preference is to overwhelm the opponent&#8217;s ring-bearer, then choose one of the sites that will support that method of stopping your opponent&#8217;s fellowship &#8220;cold&#8221;. Gates of Argonath (site 8), especially when combined with Anduin Confluence (site 7 &#8211; removes allies, Bounder, etc.) helps set-up a one-on-one or two-on-one skirmish (preferred) against the ring-bearer. The biggest threat against a swarming strategy is archery, especially directed archery. Being able to exhaust Aragorn or Legolas after site 6, but before site 7 is very helpful in carrying out this strategy. Assuring that Sam will not survive to carry the ring must be considered also.<br>
<br>
    Maybe your strategy is to ambush your opponents with Orcs (at least 5) at site 8 in order to stop the fellowship dead in its tracks, which gives your fellowship an opportunity to run pass your opponent&#8217;s fellowship and victory. Two elements assist that strategy. First, conserving minions so that you have enough smaller minions in hand at site 8 (this can be combined with a card drawing engine). Second, the Shores of Nen Hithoel is your site of preference for site 8. With just over 10 twilight being the minimum usually, if you conserved your smaller Orcs between sites 4 through 6 then your five Orcs should stop the fellowship from moving. Strategic Tip: If your opponent begins their fellowship turn at site 7 and you are employing this stopping technique with Nen Hithoel then the Waiting Strategy is an excellent tool to employ at site 7 &#8211; it conserves minions, including a regroup phase, which is an opportunity to draw that 5th Orc, and it increases the twilight you will have at site 8 if your opponent ran to site 8! Remember &#8211; there must be a consequence for running!<br>
<br>
    Maybe I missed the boat (Gift of Boats?) somewhere, but the only reason I see for having the Pillars of the Kings as a site in your adventure path is if you play with Pathfinder, Thror&#8217;s Map, etc. and definitely expect to be running ahead of your opponent and expect to run to your own site. Before moving from site 7 to 8, Pathfinder is used to put Pillars of the Kings into play. I think this is a risky strategy, but a beefed up Ranger -Aragorn is very popular. (Elvish Allies, Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and Gift of Boats are a tip-off that a player may triple run to the Pillars!) Unless the Ring-bearer stumbles on the path, eventually one of the two fellowships will reach site 9 &#8211; the pinnacle site. (Most of my games go all the way to a climax at site 9, don&#8217;t yours?)<br>
<br>
    The only reason to have a site 9, which offers little or no benefit to your minions, is if you plan on running to win most of the time. And as with Pillars of the King (site 8), which was already discussed, one will need to include a way to change the site. If that is your strategy then you will need to predict the meta-game and employ the site which offers the least assistance. If very few players use trackers, for example, then Tol Brandir is a good choice. So I&#8217;ll concentrate on matching sites with the Shadow cultures and minion strategies they best support since, obviously, site 9 is your last chance to stop your opponent&#8217;s fellowship and win the game. <br>
<br>
    Perhaps the best site 9 for dealing with Fellowship Archery is Wastes of Emyn Muil. Several Isengard Orcs that have a health of 3, because the Maneuver phase comes before the Archery phase, can devastate a fellowship&#8217;s archers before they can retaliate. <br>
<br>
   The Summit of Amon Hen supports a burden adding strategy or a meta game where bidding high is prevalent. Emyn Muil can be very resourceful, especially if you saved some minions who are reasonably tough and have enough vitality.<br>
<br>
   The weakest card, in terms of supporting minions is probably Tol Brandir. (Card to use with Path Finder/running strategy &#8211; see above). Trackers are the least popular minions because their abilities do not seem to compensate for their poor combination of low strength and low vitality. Very few players want to waste 8 vital card slots in a tournament deck just to assure that there will at least three trackers in the discard pile so they can have Tol Brandir as their 9th site. No thank you, I&#8217;ll pass.<br>
<br>
    Small fellowships &#8211; employing Lighter Path techniques and twilight choke, generally, are more vulnerable than larger fellowships at sites 7 through 9, but safer at the earlier sites. Since relying on a smaller fellowship (4 or less companions) seems to be very popular strategy despite the risks at the later sites, then the Shadow half of a player&#8217;s deck must have at least one method of defeating the ring-bearer at one of final three sites of the Adventure path. It is my viewpoint that very few decks that expect to win by only running will reach the finals of The World&#8217;s. The top players will be able to employ techniques that will disable small fellowships that expect to win with a Lighter Path only.                     <br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
       <br>
       In conclusion, Part II of the Lighter Path keyed on sites, especially which sites support minimizing twilight, and which sites probably should not &#8211; sites 4, 5, 8 and 9.<br>
Additionally, this article suggested some strategies employed at sites to stall a fellowship, make a player have to guess whether or not it is safe to run, or for setting up an ambush (encouraging a fellowship to run when it shouldn&#8217;t). The waiting Strategy is an example of one of the Strategic Tips provided. If the Adventure Path has not been made &#8220;lighter&#8221; by this article, at the least I hope it has been &#8220;enlightened&#8221;. Good luck at Worlds!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Note: I do not support or discourage the use of a Lighter path deck or the use of the techniques discussed in this article. This article and the previous article are to help a player recognize when another player is using these strategies and how one might incorporate them into their deck&#8217;s design if they believe they will benefit by doing so.<br>
