A Vitality of One? - Archery will eat them alive is the most popular response. So are they truly useful in a competitive sense? Is their a reason to play them? As my single favourite culture I will probably play them regardless, but at least for now here is an explanation of the spoils to be found.<br>
<br>
Probably the best place to start is to look at the most appealing aspects of this culture, the most obvious of which is possession removal. Given the strength of decks before the Two Towers was in possessions and the expansion also gives a few new really useful possessions, even an entire culture (Rohan) based on possessions this aspect is something worthy of exploration.<br>
<br>
In my humble opinion this culture has by far the single best possession removal in the entire game. It kicks anything like Cantea and shows up Grima for the temporary fix to the problem that he is, although Grima can create hand clog which probably makes him more useful. The five sources for removal in the Dunland culture can be found in the Dunland Pillager, Ravage the Defeated, Secret Folk, Wild Man Raid and War Club. They each have potent abilities in their own rights and in combination with No Defense, these cards can effectively make an entire deck built around the concept of possession removal. If only then you could combo it with Pillage of Rohan and score no possessions, no skirmish events and no skirmish special abilites! You would win nearly every skirmish and have a jolly good time in the process! But seriously these cards allow you to strip the Fellowship bare very consistently and punish any deck that utilises possessions as the main support cards for their Fellowship (most companions now have two possessions). <br>
<br>
Dunland Pillager is the simplest and most obvious choice for possession removal, purely because it is the only minion that can do it. A cost of three for a strength 9 character that can potentially strip to possessions from anyone in the Fellowship is very potent. The trouble is you need to keep him alive, and with a vitality of one that will not be simple, then you need to win the skirmish. Someone has probably already suggested Hides to you, and I will get onto that later, but the best way to keep this guy alive is to make the choice hard for your opponent. Team him up with a few cheap guys with some nasty abilities like those site control guys or Dunlending Robber. Hillman Band may make them think about it, as will cards like Wild Man of Dunland and Hillman Mob. Speaking of those two guys, you could use them to spawn the Pillager in the fierce phase solving the problem entirely. The point is however that you can force an archery deck to make hard choices, will they pop off the Pillager or will they pop off Hillman Band or cheap Ransacker that has been given a War Club that could potentially score a few sites and still remove some possessions too. The problem gets difficult when they know you play some of the heavy pumpers, so whilst you cant prevent the archery you can certainly make it painful. Going off on a slight tangent for a second, that is the beauty of this culture, if they attack your possession removal you will find it easier to handle sites and the opposite is true. It would take a very well built deck and very smart player to handle it all on the best of days.<br>
Continuing on the idea of archery, you should find it simple with the sheer number of ways to remove possessions to get rid of Aragorns or Faramirs Bow, leaving only Legolas to deal with and if you can get cards like Over the Isen working then your problem is solved very quickly. Then of course you have to handle Double Shot and Gondor Bowmen and so forth, is there an answer? Well to be blunt, NO! I imagine future expansion may attempt to address this problem. In the end however, avoiding archery is about putting pressure on your opponent to make tough choices instead of actually preventing the wounds, which is still possible. <br>
<br>
So back to possession removal, you also have the War Club, which is completely potent in every sense of the word. Able to play in any kind of Dunland deck you can make your nasties even more nasty with no only a strength bonus, but the added fear of losing 2 possession. Play this on one of the many minions that have fierce and strength bonuses from winning the initial skirmish and you can soon see how much fun you can have. Potentially in one move you can strip four possessions with this thing and that would cause an enormous headache for your opponent.<br>
<br>
The other useful, and yet not so useful removal cards are events and conditions. They all have requirements that can be difficult, but they are all very useful in their own rights. Ravage the Defeated is very useful, especially in a deck that uses Frodo as a fighter. Generally Frodo is beefed up so he cannot be overwhelmed and if you get a swarm effect with your Dunland Men then chances are a Dunland Man will be assigned to Frodo, maybe more so later in the game. One copy of Ravage the Defeated will leave Frodo with almost nothing to protect himself and leave your opponent in great peril and under pressure to do something fast. <br>
<br>
Wild Man Raid too is a neat addition to the culture as it is my experience that spotting 3 Dunland Men in the Maneuver phase is rather easy to do at all stages of the game. This then allows you to discard those Bows and other nasties before they get a chance to be used. In that respect this card actually becomes far more potent than one would of thought, and in that respect it earns its rarity. Finally too there is Secret Folk, which is a condition and subject to removal and it requires victorious skirmishes. You will therefore need to have this thing out for a few sites to get its full potential and it is great to use at site 8 to really make that final move a hard decision for your opponent. It is also another Maneuver action that allows you to remove up to 3 possessions. So if I were to make a Possession removal deck, I would play a deck that looked like:<br>
<br>
(Cards: 36)<br>
Dunland Pillager x4<br>
Wild Man of Dunland x4<br>
Hillman Mob x2<br>
Hillman Band x4<br>
Hillman Rabble x4<br>
Dunland Madman x4<br>
Wulf, Dunlending Cheiften x2<br>
War Club x4<br>
Dark Fury x2<br>
No Retreat x2<br>
Ravage the Defeated x1<br>
Wild Man Raid x2<br>
Secret Folk x1<br>
<br>
This deck has a real focus on the choices of discarding possessions while compounding the problem with potential site control and the nasties involved with No Retreat. You may make changes and no I have not really tested this deck against a great deal decks, but against my Trust Me deck which is yet to be defeated it came the closest ever, yes it did better than Isengard, Nazgul and Moria swarm. You may also like to exchange some cards for pumpers, but by removing possessions the hope is that pumpers will not be that essential to winning skirmishes. You may also like to swap out the site control mechanics for fierce bonus minions and some Iron Axes and so on, this would create more of a swarming, punishing deck that may work more consistently than site control.<br>
<br>
Site control than is another of the powerful abilities of the Dunlendings, when it gets under control you have an enormous twilight pool, and ability to force double movements (skipping Sanctuary), increased Card Draw, cheaper requirements and ultimately a great chance of destroying any tournament worthy Fellowship. The problem of course is gearing the deck with the right balance so that you can control sites consistently.  In that respects you need to make the choices difficult for your opponent when it comes to skirmish time, and you need to have a number of pumpers up your sleeve in order to win those skirmishes. Either that or you need to keep you Men alive because the only way you can take sites is by either winning or by having the right minions out when the Fellowship moves.<br>
<br>
Dunlending Ransacker (Cost:2/str7/vit1) is the lowest cost site control minion, he is also the weakest, so triggering his ability to take a site while winning a skirmish is not that likely unless you have some kin do swarm going, some weapons or pumpers. Oh and did I mention that when this guy wins you need to also spot another Dunland Man before you can take a site. Hillman Tribe (3/9/1) has the same function as Ransacker, it is just a little bigger and more likely to win. Then Wulf, Dunlending Chieften (4/10/2) can exert when another Dunland Man wins a skirmish to take a site. So you can imagine playing your Hillman Tribe with Wulf, if your tribe wins then you spot Wulf to take a site, then you exert Wulf to take a second site. Starting to sound appealing isnt it? You just need to win that skirmish however!<br>
<br>
Finally Hillman Band provides a site if you can spot another Dunland Man when the Fellowship moves. This again can become rather potent, because the minion is not unique, so if you have two out and they move you score two sites. Overall however these guys are weak with only one vitality so archery, Ring-Bound Rangers and the multitude of wound a minion cards available in all of the Free-Peoples cultures will cause a significant headache. So you need to either swarm these buggers or use Hides in a constructive manner to keep them all alive. Hides however are really expensive and require 2 twilight to prevent wounds.<br>
<br>
So this where the problem comes, in order to swarm you need twilight, in order to keep that swam alive you need more twilight and Hides, in order to get more twilight consistently you need No Refuge, in order to get no refuge to work you need to stack a minion on a site and to do that you need to control a site. Hence the problems that will plague Dunland site control players, to best win sites you need to win sites. What this does mean is if you can get sites going early on, and the Fellowship has no luck with liberation or has not included any in their deck then your going to have an absolute ball with this culture. In playtesting however you will discover that your site stacking minions that trigger No Refuge clog you early on and prevent the taking of sites. Now you may not worry, you may consider the benefit of No Refuge late in the game to be a good thing, however for my liking it is just not consistant enough. With that in mind I tend to focus on site control with No Retreat and possession removal. An example of the current Dunland deck I play is:<br>
<br>
(cards: 36)<br>
Dunlending Pillager x4<br>
Dunlending Ransacker x4<br>
Hillman Band x2<br>
Hillman Tribe x4<br>
Wild Man of Dunland x4<br>
Wulf, Dunlending Cheiften x2<br>
Hillman Horde x2<br>
Saruman, Rabble Rouser x2<br>
Hides x3<br>
No Retreat x2<br>
War Club x4<br>
Dark Fury x2 <br>
<br>
This deck gives me enough chances to take as many sites as possible really early in the game, and at the same time take away possessions just as fast. It really hits hard if the opposition Fellowship has no answer for strength 9 minions before site 3, which is often the case. Oh and I play only three copies of Hides because I am still waiting on my fourth.<br>
<br>
So while we wait for more potent cards to keep these guys alive, you need to play extremely smart with these guys and you need to put the right minions out at the right time to achieve your goals. To do this the culture has given you some useful cards to attempt to get things rolling. The first are minions by the names of Wild Man of Dunland and Hillman Mob that are both strong minions capable of playing another minion in the case of a victorious skirmish, that Minion is then fierce and damage+1. So in this respect a winning Minion here is now worth two minions, one of which is completely immune to archery. You can also punish the Rohan culture very easily with a simple condition called Living Off Rock that provides str+2 and fierce to all Dunland Men facing off a Rohan Man, Dunlending Ravager also grabs a str+2 against them. Over the Isen is also a must add, as it allows you to assign against unbound companions giving you greater choice regarding how your minions end up in the skirmish phase. You could then play a cheap Ravager and use Over the Isen to force a large companion like Aragorn to take him on, thus the Free-Peoples player cant use Aragorn to take on your larger minions. <br>
<br>
You also have a selection of some very potent pumpers for your Men, which can turn the tide of a skirmish very easily. Burn Every Village is a standard str+2 or str+4 if you have a site, not as good as Dark Fury which again is a standard str+2, but str+4 at a Sanctuary. You know site 3 and 6 will be a sanctuary and this may be enough to cause a double moving Fellowship that extra amount of grief. Death to the Strawheads, which does cost 3 twilight tokens but provides +1 for every companion. So you will generally get a str+4 bonus every time, and most players will be comfortable player there extra companions against A Dunland deck too, so there is potential to gain overwhelming strength with this card. Finally War Cry of Dunland provides a similar effect to Savagery, except not quite as potent, if a Dunland man wins a skirmish he becomes fierce and strength+4 until regroup. Obviously to have a card the same as Savagery would not be very good considering the abilities these minions already gain when they win a skirmish. <br>
<br>
Another pumper who has another nasty use is Saruman, Rabble Rouser. He can exert to provide str+2, a total of str+6, which can be a very strong support mechanism for your skirmish winners. He also exerts a companion for each Dunland Man when the Free-Peoples player moves, meaning a swarm effect with these guys becomes far more imposing and if you can combo it with No Retreat you can score a multitude of wounds in a short period of time. He can also soak up to three wounds from undirected archery, which is something that should appeal to the Dunland player regardless of the strategy they are going for in their deck. <br>
<br>
The only thing I would like to say is that they are home site 3T, which means that they can potentially wreak havoc. When playing the correct sites like Rohirrim Village they can swarm at site 3T (especially if the Fellowship double moves) and strip any early possession quickly or even take sites 1 and 2 if you moved first and still manages to get those sites out. In that respect, when you combo these guys with Ring-Bound Rangers and Pathfinder or you use Get on and Get Away from the start you can very easily destroy a Fellowship before the game even gets interesting. Finally, yes I have neglected to mention a few cards from the Dunland culture that I am sure you can look at yourself and have a play with, for now I will leave those cards alone until I find a use for them.<br>
<br>
So in summary what can you say about this culture right now?<br>
<br>
A)	They are very strong, with a general strength of 9 they will easily win skirmishes early and if swarmed, not all members of the Fellowship will be able to handle the high strength.<br>
B)	They have a low vitality, which might save them against Horses and cause some trouble for Eomer, but they die a horrible death against Rangers Bows and directed archery.<br>
C)	They have a reasonably low cost and are not-roaming at site 3, giving them a punch really early on.<br>
D)	They have some very useful pump cards that can easily put winning a skirmish out of reach of the Fellowship<br>
E)	They take sites very easily if you can swarm site control minions.<br>
F)	They can become very powerful if they are allowed to win even a few skirmishes.<br>
G)	They can strip a Fellowship faster than any other culture of all possessions.<br>
H)	They have extremely potent site control cards like No Retreat, which can potentially cause a game-winning event.<br>
I)	Without site control or skirmish winning, they are an average, even sometimes useless culture.<br>
J)	They require you to be very smart and strategically sound in the way you play them.<br>
<br>
Happy Gaming!<br>
