<br>
This article serves to help you identify your opponent&#39;s deck-type and in due course, plan effective counter-measures, and can also help raise your awareness of the different deck-types and the keys to their construction, to highlight to you the important components of the different types of decks. The most common and powerful decks (stupid decks like Dwarves/Men and pure-Elven archery are ommited) will be analysed here.<br>
<br>
Starting with Free Peoples:<br>
<br>
<b>Discard decks</b><br>
Discard decks aim to destroy your draw deck, depriving you of any resources to boost your fellowship or shadow. They may have a winning strategy behind it (Irresistible Shadow) or aim to overtake you in the late-game with their Fellowship with you unable to stop them due to having no more minions in draw deck.<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarven Discard</b><br>
Rarely seen in the first set, the Dwarves have come into their own, with the addition of several bonuses in the second set. Perhaps the only viable theme Dwarves can construct is deck-discard, owing to Dwarven Axe, Nobody Tosses a Dwarf, What are We Waiting For (with Grimir and Great Works Begun There allowing multiple uses) and Greatest Kingdom of My People, and owing to their tendency to win skirmishes. This deck aims to destroy your draw deck by at around Site 7 and using triple-move techniques like Durin&#39;s Secret and Gift of Boats at the Valley of the Silverlode to overtake you, leaving you without reinforcements for your minions.<br>
<br>
The pure-Dwarven Discard deck almost always has a Gimli (Son of Gloin or Dwarf of the Mountain-Race) and Fròr or Farin start depending on the meta-game. Gloin is usually drawn into, due to his initial weakness without any tales. Almost all Dwarf decks use Bilbo, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit as their defence against conditions due to their widespread use of tales (Make Light of Burdens is not adequate enough but may be added to compensate for Bilbo&#39;s inability to remove Tip/Breath/DDotR etc), Gandalf-Sleep would be suicide) and thus Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir is to be expected. They will aim to bid high and start the Hobbiton Party Field to pull Bilbo (realistically the only Site 1 useful to them). If they lose the bid and you go first, expect Midgewater Moors for Site 2<br>
<br>
For shadow, a Dwarven Discard will almost always feature a Sauron or Sauron/Isengard discard for deck synergy. Sauron is the best of the discarders with Inquisitors, Band of the Eye, Tower Lieutenants and Desperate Measures (and thus will it have a tinge of burdening to have the &#39;capital&#39; to remove for Desperate Measures, or perhaps qualify for The Irresistible Shadow), followed by Isengard with Ragers, Swords, Soldiers and Too Much Attention. Alternatively, it may feature a Moria half due to the ability for expansive Dwarf halves which a Sauron or Isengard deck might find cumbersome to cycle through early on, and the Dwarf half might just get rid of anti-Moria cards like Power According to His Stature.<br>
<br>
Unlike the Elven Discard deck, Dwarves discard mostly from your draw deck, allowing the potential of you losing vital cards from your deck before you ever have the ability to play them. The key to stop it is to prevent the Dwarves from winning skirmishes, though eventually, it will be shown as a non-permanent solution, due to the sturdiness of Dwarves. Greatest Kingdom only affects Moria and Sauron, and Moria has Goblin Warrior for it while Sauron has Shadow&#39;s Reach. While the Dwarven Axe and Nobody Tosses a Dwarf might look nothing but negligible annoyances, their cumulative effect with their shadow counterparts can quickly destroy a draw deck. It is important to go through your deck slower according to the situation, yet not compromise on the number of minions or vital cards played. If you do not dare to draw with Elrond, so be it.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir/Gimli/Dwarf start. Plays Hobbiton Party Field for Site 1. Plays Midgewater Moors for Site 2. Sauron Discard/Isengard Discard/Moria Swarms for shadow. Equips Gimli with Dwarven Axe instead of Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe. Also watch out for large draw deck due to their fast card throughput.<br>
<br>
Good Match-ups:<br>
Against Moria Swarms, the low-strength of the Moria Orcs is easy picking for the Axes and Nobody Tosses. Greatest Kingdom can wreck a Moria strategy, with 8 Orcs played = 8 cardshimmer the discard pile, and some Moria decks not finding the necessity or time to slot in Goblin Warrior. Care has to be taken if the opponent really plays with 8 Orcs as the Dwarves have no consistent forms of maneuver or archery damage (Here Lies Balin and Hand Axe) and though they are more than capable of surviving their own skirmishes, Frodo may need Power According to His Stature to do so.<br>
<br>
Against Sauron Direct Damage, there are usually mostly low-strength trackers in the early game, allowing Dwarven Axe and Nobody to kick in. Endurance of Dwarves and Dwarven Bracers are anti-Hate. The Dwarves also will not be bullied by the Sauron conditions so much with Bilbo&#39;s perpetual ability.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-ups:<br>
Against Isengard, Saruman&#39;s Snows can lead the way to a huge beatdown (Make Light of Burdens?), and the Uruks have rather high strength attributes and strong skirmish events without Snows. Scariest however is Saruman&#39;s Power. A well-timed one can leave Gloin shivering and naked and all your exhausted Dwarves hanging on to their Endurance dead.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, the Dwarves have to work much harder to win skirmishes due to the Nazgul&#39;s high strength and fierceness, and pay a huge price of biting the Tips and Breaths if they fail. Realm of Darrowdelf actually comes into use against Nazgul, and Make Light of Burdens could be a worthy addition to Bilbo.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Corruption, the Dwarves are again disadvantaged with their lower strength, and with their usual tendency to leave out Frodo-healers or burden-removers. No joke but Gimli, Son of Gloin (Frodo signet) - Frodo, Son of Drogo - Till Durin Wakes Again can actually be game-saving.<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarven/Elven Discard</b><br>
Unlike the Dwarves, the Elves focus more on discarding from hand. The Mirror, though errata&#39;d, is still a huge force and can play a huge part in lessening the danger of your fellowship, as it takes place during the fellowship phase. The White Arrows of Lorien, though a little costly to set up, is an effective foil to any strength-boosters, additional minions or important fellowship cards your opponent has in his hands. With 2 spread around and 1 exertion on each of the bearer&#39;s, an opponent&#39;s hand can be dropped quickly.<br>
<br>
However, pure-Elven discard is not too popular due to the Elves not being self-sufficient enough. They are weak skirmishers, and therefore will it be easy to throw them around once the archery is overridden. They are therefore often combined with Dwarves to beef them up, and also to complement a hand-draw-deck discard.<br>
<br>
The link in this deck relies purely on one card, Shoulder to Shoulder. This card single-handedly fuels the engine, spreading wounds from companions to allies for abusing of directed archery, White Arrows, Elrond&#39;s card-draw power and such. Thus, a timely Saruman&#39;s Power, Goblin Scrabbler, Beauty is Fading etc can totally destroy the deck.<br>
<br>
It will almost always have a Gimli (usually Son of Gloin) and Legolas (sometimes Prince of Mirkwood for White Arrows) start, to safeguard against nightmare scenarios like Elrond unable to spot an Elf and Dwarven Axe without a Dwarf. Gimli and Legolas are the two best representatives for each culture and allow cards like Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe, Tale of Gil-Galad etc to be played immediately, plus they can also survive rather well on their own. It will enlist a huge array of allies, with Elrond, Thrarin and Grimir at Site 3 to fuel card-draw power with Shoulder to Shoulder and Galadriel and Celeborn for the Mirror with possibly Rumil and Orophin for protection. Therefore, it can feature a heavy-sized draw deck, with Elrond (boosted with Shoulder steroids) and Delving fueling the card-draw, which smiles on the card-intensive nature of this deck. Expect Secret Sentinels as their basis for condition-removal.<br>
<br>
Like all discard decks, this deck will run a Sauron or Isengard discard (most probably Sauron since it is capable of discarding from both hand and draw deck for deck synergy), but unlike Dwarven Discard, it will almost never run Moria Swarm simply because the objectives of the Free Peoples and Shadow halves will have alienated too much from each other.<br>
<br>
With no Site 1 really complementing them, they will usually aim to start 2nd to get Midgewater Moors into play and cycle through their deck. Site 3 should feature Rivendell Valley for card-drawing. Site 4 should be Darrowdelf Chamber, simply because no other Site 4 benefits them greatly, and they have Gimli on their side, while not many decks do. Site 6 will almost certainly feature Lothlorien Woods so that the Site 6 allies can fight, and ARV can be used (usually spots Arwen so get rid of her fast). Site 7 should be Silverlode Banks as the other 2 alternatives would hurt (again, get rid of Arwen).<br>
<br>
A Dwarven/Elven discard is hard to build correctly due to its card-intensive nature, and its fellowship is usually rather weak (usually aims on softening the minions up enough with Elven archery for the Dwarves to prevail). A strong shadow can hurt it, though it must kill, not destroy, as Shoulder to Shoulder can quickly negate the wounds. Anti-Condition cards can be huge, with Shoulder to Shoulder, White Arrows, Dwarven tales all important to the deck.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Frodo, Son of Drogo or Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer/Gimli (non-Dwarf of Erebor)/Legolas start. Lets you go first. Midgewater Moors for Site 2. Lothlorien Woods for Site 6, or Valley of the Silverlode for Gift of Boats.<br>
<br>
Good Match-ups:<br>
Against the Snow-Bomb, it can discard vital cards required for the combo, where cards in hand and deck are both equally unsafe, and a couple of Nobody Tosses or Desperate Measures when the opponent is nearing the bottom are priceless.<br>
<br>
Against Moria Swarms, the Elves can waste the Orcs down with archery before the Dwarves descend on them with their axes. Greatest Kingdom triggers too, but a single Cave Troll or Balrog can wreak total havoc. Secret Sentinels is important.<br>
<br>
Against Sauron Direct Damage, Greatest Kingdom triggers again and the low strengths of the trackers leave them vulnerable to Dwarven Axes and Nobody Tosses. Shoulder to Shoulder negates the effects of Tower Assasins and Hate and capable of removing wounds when the going gets tough (read: the watching eye becomes BIGGER), though care must be taken against the Tower Assasin. Secret Sentinels is crucial.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-ups:<br>
Against Isengard, Saruman&#39;s Power is a huge threat, capable of destroying Shoulder, White Arrows, Greatest Kingdom and such. Spies of Saruman removes the threat of elven archery and once these monsters enter skirmishes, they are capable of having the Elves and Dwarves for dinner and their Damage +X can leave huge scars, so deep that Shoulder cannot remove them quick enough.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, the Dwarves will need many skirmish events to defeat the Nazgul and if they don&#39;t, the Tips and Breaths come flying, and Secret Sentinels is not an effective counter to it. Greatest Kingdom doesn&#39;t activate, Nobody Tosses and Dwarven Axe are harder, and White Arrows exertions might be better served to fight the enemy. Mirror is important here to lessen the danger.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Corruption, the companions can lose often against the twilight ringwraiths, and Frodo will soon desire to wear the ring, when all the screwball events descend. Using Frodo, Son of Drogo with somebody with a Frodo signet (Legolas Greenleaf, Gimli Son of Gloin  come into mind) is effective as the wound can immediately be shuttered off to the allies via Shoulder. Alternatively, the new Arwen the Elven Rider, when out, can shut this deck down entirely.<br>
<br>
<b>Archery Decks</b><br>
As their name suggests, these avoid skirmishes as far as possible, using great amounts of archery, directed or normal, to shoot down the enemy. These almost always employ Legolas, Greenleaf and Aragorn&#39;s Bow, with various techniques to support them. Ranger and Elven decks almost always fall into this category. The effects of archery are far-reaching. Any deck might just insert Greenleaf or a Bow into a totally unrelated deck, showing the versatility and power of archery.<br>
<br>
<b>Strength of Spirit Archery</b><br>
The downside to Aragorn&#39;s Bow and Greenleaf is the exertion, and Strength of Spirit removes it. Obviously, Gandalf will be needed for it, and Friend of the Shirefolk is a popular choice, as he is drawn into and not started (which in case, Grey Pilgrim would be more suited) and he is capable of 9 strength by just spotting Frodo, Aragorn and Legolas. In fact, this deck can be viewed as a normal Ranger/Elf archery deck with the inclusion of Gandalf&#39;s bag o&#39; tricks, which includes the aforementioned card, Servant of the Secret Fire,  Sleep and Ottar to complement Elrond, and Albert Dreary to get rid of the greatest enemy of archery, the Spies of Saruman. Thus is it strong, with the combined power of Gandalf&#39;s spells, Aragorn and Boromir&#39;s Beef, and Legolas&#39; sneak attacks and help from the Elven allies.<br>
<br>
An Arwen/Legolas start is almost always seen. Legolas is crucial for the archery engine to work early, and Arwen is really the only worthy companion to accompany him at the start. The Prancing Pony is compulsory to get Aragorn out early for his Bow, though the deck will still play with multiple copies if denied. Multiple copies of Gandalf and A Wizard is Never Late to get his buddies out. Barliman Butterbur is almost always employed to recycle the Strength of Spirits and Servants. Boromir, Lord of Gondor is often found as the main emergency skirmisher, and 5 companions are a little risky once the archery aspect is overcome. Athelas can be used widely to heal off exertions, or a savvy builder with card-slots can employ a Dwarf-Shoulder combination. Elrond draws, Ottar and Celeborn help. Galadriel heals and might have her mirror to check out her reflection. The Tale of Gil-Galad and The Saga of Elendil are staples. (note: the easiest way to note a novice is one who plays a single Elven Bow in this deck just for Arwen)<br>
<br>
For shadow, intimidation like Isengard and Nazgul are used. The fellowship is more than capable of shrugging minions off and so an Isengard and Nazgul half can allow it to lead the race. In fact, Strength of Spirit Archery is one of the most expensive to construct out there and if he pairs it up with Nazgul, the most expensive for shadow, beat up the rich idiot. Nazgul can slow the opponent down quite effectively but are heavily disadvantaged after Site 6 whereas nowadays, Isengard is becoming much more popular as the other half. It has better card throughput then Nazgul and unlike Nazgul, have the power to cause real damage through Damage +1, and even if they are not intimidating enough, a well-timed Wizard Storm can leave the opponent far behind.<br>
<br>
Strength of Spirit Archery takes quite a few turns to set up with the tales, bows, Gandalf and friends, weapons, allies etc to be drawn into, so early must be the time to attack or lead with your fellowship. Once it is set up, however, it can chow down minions easily, and requires a well-thought out shadow attack to bring down. A well-timed Anduin Confluence or Anduin Wilderland can land it in trouble, and anti-ally cards can work well.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer/Arwen/Legolas, Greenleaf start. Could let you go first if playing Nazgul. Prancing Pony for Site 1, Silverlode Banks for Site 7, Pillars of the Kings for Site 8<br>
<br>
Good Match-ups:<br>
Against Moria Swarms, strong archery can bring down the Orcs before they enter the skirmish phase, and Sleep and Dreary can get rid of the annoying conditions. Watch out for Anduin Wilderland.<br>
<br>
Against Isengard, Albert Dreary can get rid of Spies of Saruman. The minions can be shot down easily, including Lurtz, excluding Troop of Uruk-Hai. Do watch out if skirmishing Uruks however as you are playing with at least 5 companions to maximise the deck. Recycle Servant of the Secret Fire with Butterbur.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-ups:<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, a quick attack on the early sites before the engine sets up can be painful. Their Power is in Terror has the ability to completely destroy this deck.<br>
<br>
<b>Shoulder Fire Deck</b><br>
Another way to negate the exertions from aimed archery is to shuttle off wounds to non-archer characters, and this is the main theme of this deck. Shoulder to Shoulder and The Choice of Luthien are the main focal points, as it keeps Greenleaf and Aragorn healthy enough to fire regularly.<br>
<br>
Shoulder to Shoulder can also be used effective with Elrond&#39;s card-drawing capability, with the famous combo of Elrond spreading out his exertions among Thrarin and Grimir to draw at least 3 cards every turn, not inclusive of other factors like Celeborn etc. Unfortunately, this engine&#39;s momentum has been slowed by the new Rule of Four, but is nevertheless still very effective for card throughput.<br>
<br>
Like all archery decks, Arwen/Legolas start is to be expected, though sometimes, the opponent might start Gimli/Legolas to prevent the situation where he can&#39;t spot a Dwarf for Shoulder (these kinds of guys are filthy rich and have 3 Arwens or so in their deck to draw her). They will also start the Pony, and feature copies of Aragorn&#39;s Bow, and The Tale and The Saga are staples. 3 to 4 copies of Shoulder to Shoulder can be expected, with 3 to 4 copies of Elrond, and 2 each of Thrarin and Grimir. If he is able to do so, a Galadriel-Celeborn-Mirror combo can also be set up. Boromir, Lord of Gondor is again expected to be drawn into as the beef of the company, though if your opponent is really adventurous, he could replace Boromir with Haldir + The Splendor of their Banners (exertions gone with Shoulder) and subsequently get eaten alive by the Balrog.<br>
<br>
For shadow, slowing techniques are expected again, with Isengard and Nazgul being strong choice, plus the card throughput on the fellowship side helps these two cultures. <br>
<br>
The key to defeating it is to kill off the archery supporters, which includes conditions like Shoulder to Shoulder, The Saga, The Tale etc and the allies.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer, Arwen/Legolas Greenleaf start. Prancing Pony for Site 1. Silverlode Banks for Site 7. Only deck with The Choice of Luthien<br>
<br>
Good Match-Ups:<br>
Against Sauron Direct Damage, Shoulder to Shoulder and The Choice of Luthien prevents the unwelcome effects of Hates and Tower Assasins. Aimed archery guns down the Orcs before their Bowmen can shoot. Their need for quite a few turns for the engine to be set up is well-equipped to fight Sauron, who probably needs even more turns for their effects to kick in.<br>
<br>
Against Moria Swarms, big aimed archery can shoot down the Orcs, but preventive measures like Wilderland and Armory can leave them hurting. Regular recycling of Goblin Scrabbler with They are Coming or Host of Thousands is very huge. A copy or two of PATHS is still worthy.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, the effects of Blade Tip are quickly negated with Shoulder and The Choice. Secret Sentinels is vital to get rid of Black Breath, and watch out for Relentless Charge and Their Power is in Terror. Incidentally, both cards take place in the maneuver phase and can thus be prevented by the &#39;kissing&#39; conditions. ARV, as in against all Nazgul decks, is huge here.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-Ups:<br>
Against Isengard, the Spies of Saruman can be killed off with Secret Sentinels, but they also have Uruk Scout to cancel ARV. Greatest threat is Saruman&#39;s Power, which can destroy the engine very quickly, whereupon the Damage +1 maniacs will wreak havoc.<br>
<br>
<b>Hobbit Hospital</b><br>
Where the idea of pure-Hobbits sounds scary (and were not too feasible in the first set), the shorties have definitely come into their own. They are remarkable in the sense that as Frodo is a Hobbit, you have to be going to the correct path when you protect Hobbits. Unlike in other decks, Hobbit Stealth, Sting etc don&#39;t need to be put in to protect Frodo. In a Hobbit deck, you not only put these cards in to protect Frodo, they can protect your companions too, which has the revered effect of killing two birds with one stone.<br>
<br>
All Hobbits may start with 3 strength and 4 vitality and usually rather negligible game text, but when built well, these annoying shorties are very annoying and hard-to-kill. Their support area is extensive, containing all their allies, and these are the bread-and-butter of this deck. Filibert cancels fierce skirmishes, both versions of Bilbo have useful effects (incidentally, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit has offered this deck a basis for condition removal), Bounder makes the Hobbits two thirds as hard to kill, and the others? You just come 1 wound short of killing a Hobbit this turn and next turn, ALL the wounds on the fellowship magically disappear. Wow.<br>
<br>
There will definitely be a 4-Hobbit start, and the versions may vary slightly. Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir is a throw-in. Sam, Son of Hamfast also should be expected as it facilitates a high opening bid (which is important for these decks) and Proper Poet is really only useful as a late-draw. Both first set versions of Merry see equal play, Horticulturalist will forever be crap until they come up with a Pippin with a useful exertion ability. Pippin can be Frodo&#39;s Friend to meta against Saruman&#39;s Power, or the slightly more intelligent version to facilitate a high<b>ER</b> opening bid.<br>
<br>
As described, a high opening bid is important. They will usually let you go first, making you walk to Buckleberry Ferry, the King of all Hobbit-sites. Obviously, Hobbiton Woods is the best way to screw here. However, now THEY may start Hobbiton Woods themselves (another display of how Hobbits have improved with MoM) and STILL move into Buckleberry. Or they may start Hobbiton Party Field to pull Bilbo, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit (Retired Adventurer is more effective as a mid-game draw, whereas Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit is priceless at the start), which will complement tales like There and Back Again, Consorting With Wizards and O Elbereth! etc and make them literally twice as useful, and also paving the ability to use Practically Everyone Was Invited. Or if the player is lacking in imagination, he can start Bag End (facilitating a high<b>EEERRRRR</b> bid). Town Centre, Green Hill Country etc, while still having useful text, are not useful enough to replace the previous sites. Expect a FULL family tree, with The Gaffer, Rosie, Farmer F@ggot, Party Guests, BounderS, Filibert....I think I&#39;ll fall asleep. For protection, multiple copies of Hobbit Swords to be drawn into. Frodo has Sting, and Big Stature, with his Coward&#39;s Coat (A Promise x4 is also very good to draw into, another improvement). Whatever the case, expect them to have an easy stroll for the first few sites, with Hobbit Intuitions and Stealths (still, drop minions. A Stealth is used is a Stealth missing later). After it, the alternative effects of Stealth/Intuition kick in. Bounder prevents themselves from getting overwhelmed, instead letting them only receive wounds. And in their fellowship phase, their support area simulates a sanctuary, removing all the wounds on the fellowship to dispel all the negative lingering effects of the previous turn.<br>
<br>
Obviously, 3-strength and 4-vitality aren&#39;t going to get you far in life (or taller), and the Hobbits need a lot of support cards to stay alive and funky. This requirement thus sees it often paired with Moria. Ideally, Hobbit-Isengard or Hobbit-Sauron should work well, as Uruks and Sauron Orcs get bigger with time, and can kick in well in the latter part of the adventure path to facilitate the fellowship, but unfortunately, they do not allow card economy. Never try Hobbit-Nazgul. Both halves are early-game pacesetters, leaving you with a gaping weakness on the later sites. To summarise, always expect Moria if you see a pure-Hobbit deck.<br>
<br>
Hobbits have the illusion of deceiving you with (shamless quote) their Stout and Sturdiness. They are best attacked when naked and g@y (Frodo&#39;s Bedroom, anybody?) before they get set up i.e. in the early sites, but their Stealths, Intuitions, Buckleberry, Talent for Not Being Seen and twilight-choke prevent this. They are hard to destroy, and are often designed as &#39;walkers&#39; who take 1 site at a time to fuel a Moria Swarm and to utilise Stealths and Intuitions to the max. A Hobbit deck, however, can run anyday, because simply, if you don&#39;t kill them with one shot, but come a bit short (rhymes), you will have to start from scratch on the next turn.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Starts Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir/Pippin non-Mr. Took, plays Hobbiton Party Field, Hobbiton Woods, Bag End, Green Hill Country or Town Center for Site 1. Plays Buckleberry Ferry for Site 2. Plays Frodo&#39;s Bedroom for Site 3. Plays Valley of the Silverlode for Site 6. Plays Anduin Wilderland for Site 7.<br>
<br>
Good Match-Ups:<br>
Against Isengard, once Frodo has 4 Promises, Bounder, Sting and Mithril Coat on his side, he gets a free ride to Site 9. He will be at a base strength of 10 and thus needs at least 30 to overwhelm, and he only takes 1 wound a turn, and worse still, he is Beyond the Height of Uruks, the Coat cannot be discarded. He is more than capable of taking on 5 Uruks at Site 9. For Uruks, it is best to run with the fellowship, or try a different approach by killing Sam to neutralise Promises.<br>
<br>
Against Sauron Direct Damage, the wounds on the Fellowship can be healed off easily. Care must be taken against Tower Assasin, however.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Corruption/Return to Its Master, Frodo&#39;s strong power allows him to take on Nazgul in the event of Return to Its Master and even cancel with O Elbereth. The allies can remove the wounds on Frodo quickly to safeguard against the Twilight Nazgul and Resistance Becomes Unbearable, and when the burdens do come on, there is always trusty ol&#39; Sam.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-Ups:<br>
Against Moria Swarms, 4 companions is rather risky. Granted, they have Stealths/Intuitions to bail out of early skirmishes but the numbers game can catch up soon in a nasty manner. There are only so many PATHS to be used and once they run out, or are prevented by Armory, the Hobbits need all the Bounders and strength-boosters they can find to survive.<br>
<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, if victim of a not-too-good hand, it&#39;ll be tricky. The only form of condition-removal in this type of deck if Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit and if the Nazgul player is sneaky, he will only play the Black Breaths and Blade Tips on the turn you are going to bite them, not before. Blade Tip is not that scary with your allies but Black Breath can screw things up. Bad. Quickly.<br>
<br>
<b>Hobbit-Men Denial</b><br>
One of the most-overlooked and underrated deck-types, simply because it doesn&#39;t &#39;look&#39; powerful (personally I play this). This type of deck however is powerful in the sense that it is a hybrid spin-off of the pure-Hobbit deck, and incorporates beefy companions from other cultures to compensate for the lack of most of the Shire allies, and still leaves room for the Hobbits to protect themselves. Its spectrum is also broad, with Boromir/Merry for pure Hobbit-Men starts or Boromir/Pippin, Mr. Took if Gandalf is also used (in which case the denial aspect is lessened). Some decks may use Aragorn and Boromir as the main fighters with Merry, Friend to Sam supporting them, or some may use Aragorn, Boromir and Merry From O&#39;er the Brandywine as fighters, with Grey Pilgrim cancelling key skirmishes, and sharing his tools. The possibilities are endless.<br>
<br>
Another main property of these fellowships (and indeed also one of the reasons in their construction) is the denial element. No Stranger to the Shadows, A Talent for Not Being Seen and the upcoming Bill the Pony minimise twilight when moving. Most cards are usually free or cost only 1 twilight, and Sting can be instrumental against decks with Orcs. Another important feature of this fellowship type is it is the only one which supports adequately a starting fellowship with Boromir. Needless to say, Lord of Gondor is one of the sturdiest companions in the game and starting him is a huge boost compared to drawing him (not to mention how it goes well with economics)<br>
<br>
These fellowships generally have a small support area, with a sprinkle of Bounders and Filibert Bolger, or perhaps Jarnsmid and Albert Dreary if Gandalf is included, and absorb damage onto themselves. Such are the variations of the decks that utterly different strategies can be constructed out of this deck-type, but they all revolve around the same policy, of soaking up everything the opponent has to throw, or denying them of throwing everything. A Boromir/Merry or Boromir/Pippin, Mr. Took start is to be expected, and they more often that not start the Pony, as Aragorn encompasses everything they try to accomplish with their fellowship. Sam and Pippin are usually companions to be drawn into to provide late boosts. Gandalf, if used, is often the Grey Pilgrim, with his Aragorn signet, only 2 cultures to spot and his tendency to support the fellowship with his spells, than to get himself involved in skirmishes.<br>
<br>
The greatest weakness of this fellowship type is the lack of condition-removal, barring those which utilise Gandalf. At best, it only has Athelas. Moria Swarms and Sauron Direct Damage can take huge advantage here.<br>
<br>
For shadow, the card economy of this fellowship half means they can virtually pair up with any culture, except maybe less so Sauron, due to the latter&#39;s tendency to set up shop late. It can easily increase its deck-size with useful cards to contort to Moria&#39;s standards, or shrink to Nazgul and Isengard standards, where the shadow will slow down the opponent for the fellowship to run. The most common half, however, is still Isengard Beatdown as it is more suited than Nazgul as it kicks in strongly mid-game unlike Nazgul, which also makes you slow down in the early proceedings to get Ford in play. Moria is a little inconsistent, incompatible with this fellowship.<br>
<br>
Tell-Tale Signs: Starts Frodo, Reluctant Adventurer or Frodo, Old Bilbo&#39;s Heir, Boromir, Son of Denethor/Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine (Merry-centric), Boromir, Son of Denethor/Merry, Friend to Sam (Aragorn-centric), Boromir, Lord of Gondor/Merry, From O&#39;er the Brandywine (all-centric), Boromir, Lord of Gondor/Merry, Friend to Sam (Aragorn-Boromir centric), Boromir, any version/Pippin, Mr. Took (contains Aragorn AND Gandalf). Plays The Prancing Pony for Site 1. <br>
<br>
Good Match-Ups:<br>
Against Nazgul Tip/Breath, their only form of condition removal actually come to use. Aragorn and Boromir are more than enough to contain the threat of the Nazgul with Flaming Brands. The Tips should rarely come over, and the Breaths simply do nothing if transferred.<br>
<br>
Bad Match-Ups:<br>
Against Moria Swarms, no condition-removal means once Moria get out Armories, Relics, Swarms etc, they&#39;ll be regularly putting out more minions than your companions. The numbers game will catch up eventually. PATHS is essential but look out, as it alone cannot guarantee you safety with Goblin Armories out.<br>
<br>
Against Sauron Direct Damage, no condition-removal means that if the opponent gets out Watching Eye/Orc Bowmen out early enough, he can kill off your fellowship in the late parts of the game. Perhaps try running fast before the conditions set up, and of course, be very careful of Hate.<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
So there we have it. Hope you didn&#39;t fall asleep while reading &#39;cause I sure did while writing. Hopefully, this deck has helped you understand the main Free Peoples fellowships running around, and shown you how to counter, or even build it. Depending on the response to this article, I may or may not put out Part 2 concerning the shadow side. In the meantime, hope you managed to know something new in this article. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3628&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
