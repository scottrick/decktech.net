For every game there is, the trappings of psychology, by which you can mislead your opponent and compound him into causing errors, are a vital, if often neglected, method to victory, and I will adapt this for LotR in this article.<br>
When I speak of &#39;compulsion&#39;, 2 images can immediately be associated with it. There is the outright brash method, the unsportsmanlike behaviour of coming down hard on your opponent when he commits minute mistakes, or assuming an imposing aura, so that your opponent is intimidated into making mistakes. A truly despicable method of playing that destroys the spirit of the game, and borders on the illegal line. Then, there is the subtle way, the method by where you use your savvy and calculations to <i>predict what your opponent will do</i>, or <i>what he will think</i>, in his place, <i>play on his fears</i>, and ultimately lead him to neglect what would be the acceptable resolution to best you in his situation.<br>
<br>
All this relies on past experience, by which you can recount what you would think or do in certain situations. When decisions come to a critical point for your opponent, and you are the one with the answers (i.e. the skirmish event in your hand, the number of minions left in your draw deck), you must put yourself in his shoes, and identify what will be going on in his mind, pin-point his greatest fear (does he have a pump in hand? If so, maybe I shouldn&#39;t assign this extra minion to Frodo?), and through subtle manipulations try to use it to make the opponent think or do what you want (i.e. lead him into thinking you have a pump in hand when you don&#39;t, by, say, rearranging your cards in hand).<br>
<br>
I know that by this time, I&#39;m sounding like a babbling idiot so I will use an example to illustrate the most basic manifestation of this technique.<br>
<br>
<i>Your opponent has just moved into Moria Stairway, giving you quite an amount of twilight. You look at your hand and find that you have none of your Uruks. Your only resolution here is to drop a card, reconcile and hope to draw into something like Uruk Captain. In the meantime, your secret, silent wish, is for your opponent to, for some reason, do as you did and stop, and not get a free double-move into Site 5.</i><br>
<br>
Seeing you do this, your opponent will be in a dilemma. The immediate thoughts running in his head will be whether you really have nothing in hand, or are bluffing to incite a foolish double-move into Site 5 where hordes of bloodthirsty Uruks will be waiting for him with the generous dosage of twilight. You want him to stop, and to do that, you must lead him to <b>believe</b> that you are trying to bluff him into inciting a double-move into Site 5 where hordes of bloodthirsty......<br>
<br>
Obviously, especially in tournament games, you want fate to be twined around your hands, not on some hesitant deliberation on your opponent&#39;s part which has the potential of illiciting disastrous results not in your favour. You want to increase the chance of your opponent to submit to your will and stop. The final choice is his, but you can influence it subtly, and usually, a small doubt is sufficient to obtain the favourable response from your opponent.<br>
In this case, you can say nothing, discard a card and reconcile, and wait for his verdict. By doing this, you have done absolutely nothing to up the chances of him stopping. You have done nothing to affect his decision. Granted, he might still cede you the double-move, but you had done nothing to affect that decision. It was all a case of subjective perception on his part, and it will not work all the time, and it may fail you when you most want it to. You want to increase the chances of it happening, you want to be the master, you cannot leave loose ends untied in a crucial tournament game. Alternatively, you can also discard a card to reconcile and say blatantly, &quot;I have nothing to play.&quot; Congratulations, you just told him &quot;Hey, go double-move. And by the way, I&#39;m a stupid newbie. Kick my @$$.&quot;<br>
<br>
OR you can lead him into thinking you are bluffing. Ruffle the cards in your hand and scrunch up on your face. Mutter to yourself the bother of the twilight-intensive nature of Uruk minions and how roaming till Site 5 really sucks. Point at cards in your hand and say &quot;5&quot; to yourself (twilight cost of roaming Uruk Lieutenant, Warrior, Fighter etc) or &quot;9&quot; (big papa himself) and pretend to be doing some exuberant thinking and intensive mental calculations, closing your eyes in sheer torture. Make it subtle, don&#39;t look him in the eye and say &quot;I want to kill you at Site 5 instead.&quot; Empty threats never work.<br>
<br>
Take some time to plan over your supposed monumental assault at Site 5, but don&#39;t be such a jack that you end up wasting time. Then finally, let your eyes brighten and your mouth snarl in a smile, and DISCARD the card, and RECONCILE your hand with liquid grace and confidence, and watch your opponent, and declare &quot;I DON&#39;T WANT to play anything.&quot;. At best, you just prevented a harmful double-move and at worst, you made him think over the problem, and made him respect you as a tenacious, calculating opponent not to be overlooked.<br>
That is only the basic manifestation, and I am sure most of you already knew that, or practised it. This is only a part of the larger picture, and it is essential to know when to mislead your opponent, and continuously be aware of the possible truths to bend, until it becomes something short of a second skin to slip into, to confuse your opponent and misdirect him. Any decision can be influenced. You want to force most of them into your favour, especially the critical ones which with a Yes or No, can seal your fate, resulting in a win or loss. It is not something I can describe in detail here, it all rests on your ability to identify what are your opponents&#39; critical decisions (to PATHS or not to PATHS, to shoot or not to shoot, to exert or not to exert, to concede or not to concede). I will instead offer more detail of how to influence and compound your opponent to make the decision favourable for you.<br>
<br>
First and foremost is to FIDDLE with the elements and conditions involved in and entangled with his decision-making. In the first example, this means your hand. Fiddle with it meaningfully, creating the illusion of danger. If the worry is great, just touching the crucial element (i.e. your burdens against Moria, the Moria fear of PATHS is almost paranoia) is enough to make him wince. If you are the talkative type, try even some idle conversation on how &quot;it&#39;s a pity Frodo can&#39;t make himself defender +1&quot;. *wince*<br>
To illustrate, there was the time when I made a rash double-move into Site 9. I faced an exhausted Tower Assassin and 2 more Uruks than I had companions. I had 6-strength Frodo and 4-strength Sam. I had a Stealth in hand, nothing else. Crunch time.<br>
<br>
I hesitated very long during assignment, SHUFFLING the cards in my hand in mock display of nerves and TOUCHING my burdens, all the while closing my eyes in concentration. I muttered their vitality to myself, with a very special emphasis on &#39;1&#39; when I came to Tower Assassin. Then suddenly I sat up, made my mind, directed the Assassin to Frodo and an Uruk just capable of overwhelming Sam to Sam.<br>
<br>
He was left to assign 2 Uruks, and he hesitated. A normal setup would have him assigning one each to Frodo and Sam, but the situation became that if the Assassin was removed from the skirmish, the Uruk on Frodo could not overwhelm him. It all rested on whether I had a PATHS in my hand and after I had highlighted it and done some acting...<br>
He put the 2 both on Frodo. Frodo died, and he was a little perturbed. The Ring went to Sam and he Stealthed out of an overwhelm.<br>
<br>
Where all my above examples have concentrated on trying to sway a decision, why not eliminate it completely from the equation? This stems from careful planning of what you play. The roleplay of being in your opponent&#39;s shoes takes on a deeper approach, you must be able to interpret the cards you play the way he actually does. A couple of Bows played here and there will cause him to harbour intentions of trying to bluff on single-moves, allowing you to be prepared. The appearance of Flaming Brands or intensive burden-removal will cause him to dump Enquea, whereupon you can sneak in a 6th companion when ready. The usage of PATHs once during the course of the game can cause a Moria player to be more focused on killing non-Frodo companions first. Being able to detect the inference your opponent draws from what you play will allow you to slowly mould him in the direction you want him to go, until he is a mindless zombie, influenced by you. With this understanding, you will be able to hint at what he would think of during critical decisions, and then make the necessary arrangements to encourage or discourage it. Insert random Sun Tzu know-me know-you quote.<br>
I&#39;m getting bored by what I am writing, so I will use another example. My opponent was once down to Boromir and Frodo. Contrary to protecting Frodo, he played -- of all things -- Blade of Gondor, a self-protection card. He moved, and 3 minions came out. He ARVed (back in the pre-errata days) and assigned an exhausted minion to each companion, secretly praying I would not stick the extra minion on Frodo. In a normal situation, I probably would not for fear of PATHS, but why now? If I stacked on Boromir, he would simply kill a minion with Blade and resolve to kill the other one? My opponent left me no other alternative but to put the minion on Frodo and overwhelm him. He reduced his chances of survival from around 20% to a big fat zero.<br>
<br>
Let&#39;s run a quick analysis on the common psychological influences certain cultures can have on a player.<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarves</b><br>
If you actually get to see a Dwarven deck nowadays...not much really, Your opponent might hesitate where your crucial Flurry of Blows will go (Gimli chops the Troll and takes away the Scavenger on Frodo?).<br>
<br>
<b>Elves</b><br>
Again, not much. What they do (archery) is easily seen by the opponent, and holds no surprises, just rude wounds. Secret Sentinels is something though. A not-exhausted Elrond, Lord of Rivendell or one less use of the Mirror by Galadriel can immediately draw the conclusion that Secret Sentinels will be coming, allowing you to make the necessary preparations.<br>
<br>
<b>Gandalf</b><br>
Any deck which utilises a large part of Gandalf immediately sparks off Servant of the Secret Fire suspicions.<br>
<br>
<b>Gondor</b><br>
Used to have a really nice one in A Ranger&#39;s Versatility (&quot;Hey whoa, next site&#39;s a river? Excellent!&quot; when you don&#39;t have it in hand). <br>
<br>
<b>Shire</b><br>
Most options, simply because of the abundancy of widely-used events. Power According to His Stature has been mentioned aptly in previous examples. Hobbit Stealth and Intuition add to the list, especially in the early sites where paranoia of it (i.e. have 2 or 3 Hobbits out) can lead to veering away from Frodo or other Hobbits.<br>
<br>
<b>Isengard</b><br>
For the Orcs, there is a fear of putting 3 wounds on Frodo for Isengard Warrior. The Trees are Strong creates a reluctance to put wound tokens on a companion to exhaustion.<br>
The paranoia of skirmish events against Uruks is extremely high. Early usage here and there can create fears of losing skirmishes and vital companions because of pumps and result in weaker companions being pushed up.<br>
<br>
<b>Moria</b><br>
Will he discard the Armories? Which ones will he save?<br>
<br>
<b>Nazgul</b><br>
Will he transfer the Blade Tips and Black Breaths over? To who? <br>
For the Twilight Nazgul, your opponent is always doubtful and hesitant about wearing the Ring, due to fear of Return to Its Master, Wraith-World etc, which can be exploited.<br>
<br>
<b>Sauron</b><br>
Hate causes opponent to avoid exhausting companions. Enduring Evil might cause opponent to avoid assigning vital companions and push up weaker ones (&quot;how many burdens do you have?&quot;.<br>
<br>
This article is a little tainted as an &#39;example-expository&#39;, but the point I&#39;m trying to get across through them is to illustrate the importance of psychology and influencing critical decisions in LotR, through the (boys and girls, say it together!)  prediction of what your opponent will do, or what he will think, in his place, and play on his fears. Furthermore, this ability also allows you to have a firm grasp on how your opponent will react in certain situations, and what his intentions are, in time for you to plan effective measures or to cajole him with ease towards what you wish him to do. The key to victory in logic games like chess lies in the prediction and analysis of opponents&#39; moves and tactics, and this certainly can be applied here.<br>
<br>
Just be sure to vary your level of psyche. A seasoned competitor will definitely think of immediate threats in certain situations, but a newbie may not even know that a card called Power....Power....something exists. Just like you will not expect a newbie chess player to have schemed up some mind-blowing 3-move checkmate of doom, don&#39;t overestimate his intelligence. Fiddle with your burdens and he&#39;ll still put the minion on, wondering if you fear Frodo will get corrupted. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3953&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
