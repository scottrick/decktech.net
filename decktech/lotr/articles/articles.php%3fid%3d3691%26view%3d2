Whether &#39;tis nobler on the path to suffer<br>
The Wounds and Burdens of the Hating Sauron,<br>
Or to take aim against a sea of Moria,<br>
And by opposing shoot them? To die: to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The Worries and thousand damage bonuses<br>
That Isengard is heir to, &#39;tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish&#39;d. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: Ah, Im a scrub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what wins may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this Mithril Coat,<br>
Must give us pause . . . <br>
<br>
Now, you might recognize the passage above . . . or something like it (so sue me, Im not Shakespeare) . . . as a soliloquy from Hamlet--a monologue that characterizes the inner struggle over a choice between life and death--a debate that we, as Lord of the Rings players, continue every game.  To kill or not to kill . . . To die or not to die.  Ah, yes!  That is the question . . . <br>
<br>
The simple truth is that dead companions win games!  They win for your fellowship and shadow sides alike.  And knowing that dead companions win games, wouldnt we all benefit from the knowledge of how to use these deaths to our advantage?  Well, if you feel you have already mastered this subject, then by all means, stop reading now, but if you have not, let me suggest that we all become like mortuaries and turn anothers death into our profit.  Its easy.  If we kill companions intelligently, we place ourselves in a better position to control the flow of our games.  We place ourselves in a better position to win.  This article will attempt to provide you with the tools, the insights, and some suggestions to allow you to make the most out of a dead man.  They have more uses than just medical research . . . <br>

<B>DEATH AND THE SHADOW</B><br>
<br>
The purpose of any shadow side is to kill companions . . . in particular Frodo.  Therefore, your shadow side is the most logical place to begin any discussion regarding the strategy of a dead companion.  Now, how do we go about killing?  Well, everything in Lord of the Rings begins with preparation and understanding.  So, lets start there.  How do you prepare and build your deck to kill companions?  The answer: You must understand the Moria Window.  <br>
<br>
<B>What is the Moria Window?</B><br>
<br>
You as a shadow player have a 3-site opening, the Moria Window, in which you can defeat your opponent with your minion side--sites 4 to 6.  True, there are 5 other opportunities for your shadow to strike, but they arent as important as the Moria Window.  Why not?  Any wounds dealt prior to the first sanctuary will, in all likelihood, be healed because of the immense constraints on your shadow prior to the first sanctuary--fewer opportunities to attack, roaming penalties, and low shadow numbers translate to an impotent shadow at sites 2 and 3.  Therefore, any action you take at the early sites should not be meant to kill companions, but rather to set the stage for the following sites by allowing you to draw cards, put certain fears and doubts into your opponents mind, and set your discard pile.  Sites 7 to 9 are a different matter, entirely.  Now, a dead companion anywhere on the adventure path is acceptable, even commendable, but chances are that you wont kill a companion of consequence after the second sanctuary unless you have utilized the Moria Window to its maximum effectiveness.  An opponents mainstay companions will have to have wounds left over in order for you to kill them, and that means that you have to force your opponent to take 10+ wounds from sites 4 to 6.  You have to do your work in the Moria Window.  If you havent done your job, chances are that you wont kill anybody, or if you do, it will be too little too late and Frodo will stroll right up to Saurons doorstep and offer him tea.  If your Moria Window is closed, you had better start looking towards your fellowship for help, because that may be your only hope of winning . . . <br>
<br>
<B>Okay.  So, what does this Moria Window mean for my shadow side?</B><br>
<br>
It means that you need to build your deck accordingly.  You must prepare and plan so that the Moria Window is a reliable, predictable series of events . . . and Im not talking about the Savagery to Match Their Numbers kind!  You must build your deck so that youll get your most important cards underground.  AND you must have a plan of attack for what you will do when your opponent enters the mines.  For example, one of my favorite Nazgul strategies is to play Ulaire Cantea at site 4.  Why?  Because your opponent has just healed, hes moving into the most important leg of his journey, and then you play a minion who forces your opponents archers to exert or have companions who take wounds and/or lose weapons at the first opportunity.  Those wounds/exertions set up sites 5 and 6 as killing grounds for your shadow, and that means that you do your job in the Moria Window.  Every deck should have some tricks like this, and when you include these tricks in your shadow side, you must design so that you get the right cards at the right times (For example, with Ulaire Cantea, you have to play at least 3 of him, preferably 4, to be able to rely on him at site 4).  You must design your deck in such a way that you get the most efficient shadow cards at your underground sites.  Four Balrogs is hardly an efficient card allocation because you only need the minion once and you can pull him with the site 5 text.  Therefore, even with only 1 in your deck, you know what to expect in 95% of your games at site 5, making that 1 Balrog an effective card allocation in your shadow side.  In short, you must consider how often (and when) a card needs to be played and adjust your numbers accordingly to make your shadow (and fellowship) predictable and effective.  Only with this kind of tweaking will every card slot yield the best results.  Fortunately, there are 3 methods that any player can employ to make educated card number adjustments in his deck--testing, experience, and probability analysis.  Whatever your chosen method for tweaking (and I would use a combination of all 3), getting the numbers right is paramount to an effective shadow side.<br>
<br>
<B>Is that all?</B><br>
<br>
No, It is also important that you play at least 8 cards that kill companions!  Every culture has a subset of cards that kill companions.  Without these companion killers, your shadow is about as effective as a possum to a speeding Mack truck.  In order to slow your opponent down, you must have a relatively steady stream of cards that kills companions.  You must average 1 per site, and that means that you must play at least 8.  Now, some of these cards are obviously killers (such as Relentless Charge and Lurtzs Battle Cry); others kill indirectly (They Are Coming and Tower Assassin); and still others are simply big, costly, damaging minions that your opponents have to deal with.  Whatever the reason a card may kill, you must play a few in your shadow side or your shadow will never kill anybody . . . logically.<br>
<br>
<B>Okay!  What cards kill companions?</B><br>
<br>
Well, rather than give you a comprehensive list of every one out there (and believe me, I wanted to, but it was too difficult), Im going to list criteria that make a card kill and give examples so that you can make your own judgment on whether a card kills or doesnt . . . <br>
<br>
The most obvious cards that kill all have one thing in common--they add a wound to companions.  Lurtzs Battle Cry, Hate, Blade Tip, Bitter Hatred, etc., all add wounds to companions, and that makes these cards formidable forces.  Legolas is exhausted from his Archery fire . . . Bitter Hatred finishes the job.  Aragorn has 1 wound on him as he skirmishes Lurtz . . . the Battle Cry changes Aragorn from exhausted to dead.  If any card deals wounds directly to a companion, that card kills.<br>
<br>
Another common effect of these killers is an indirect means of adding wounds--for example, by making a minion fierce or by not allowing a companion to heal.  Savagery to Match Their Numbers, Black Breath, and Goblin Armory are all examples of cards that kill by dealing wounds indirectly.  Arwen has 2 wounds and a Black Breath on her at a sanctuary.  Losing the ability to heal twice is the same thing as wounding her twice.  Gimli with his Battle Axe wins a skirmish vs. a Moria Scout and opts to wound a Scavenger fighting Boromir.  You discard an armory to prevent the wound and keep the Scavenger in the fight.  Each of these cards, if used correctly, also deals wounds albeit in a slightly unconventional manner.  And the ability to deal wounds (directly or indirectly) makes a card a killer.<br>
<br>
The third criterion of a card that kills is not unrelated to the second.  If a card stops an opponents defense against your shadow, that card wounds indirectly.  Examples of cards that deal wounds indirectly by eliminating an opponents defense are the Tower Assassin, Beyond the Height of Men, and Stricken Dumb.  Rumil is picking apart your orcs . . . the Tower Assassin kills him to get your minions past the archery phase.  Boromir keeps assigning to your biggest Uruk-hai because hes protected by armor . . . Beyond the Height of Men makes him mortal again.  Aragorns flaming stick is keeping your Nazgul at bay . . . use Stricken Dumb to discard it.  Each of these cards kills companions by shredding a fellowships defense against you.<br>
<br>
And the final type of card that kills is a shadow card that overwhelms companions.  Mostly, only large minions fit into this category (e.g., the Cave Troll, Lurtz, and Witch King), but there are a few other very notable cards that fit into this set of companion killers--most notably Enduring Evil.  Minion power boosters typically arent efficient means of overwhelming companions because it takes multiple boosters to do the trick.  However, cards that reduce a companions power also affect the overwhelm condition, and that makes those cards killers.  Consider Aragorn with his Sword and a Flaming Brand in a 5 companion fellowship vs. a Morgul Hunter.  If you can spot 4 burdens, Enduring Evil will kill Aragorn by reducing him to a 7 power.  However, if you were to boost the Morgul Hunters power by 4, that would not overwhelm Aragorn.  Hence, Enduring Evil is a companion killer, but Denizens Enraged is not.  So, if a card is a large minion who overwhelms easily or a card that reduces a companions strength, it fits into the category of companion killer.<br>
<br>
<B>Okay, what am I going to do with all of this information?</B><br>
<br>
The key to being successful with your shadow side is, as I said, understanding and preparation.  If you understand the damage that you have to do in the Moria Window with your shadow side, youll build a deck with companion killers to make use of that window and deal 10+ wounds to the opposing fellowship before they reach the second sanctuary.  Beyond that, its all testing and tweaking.  <br>
<br>
<B>DEATH AND THE FELLOWSHIP</B><br>
<br>
Ask anyone.  Card games are contests of control.  Whoever controls the most important aspects of the game controls that games flow AND ultimately its conclusion.  Now, knowing what we know about the Shadow sides reliance on killing companions, we can build our fellowship sides in such a way that we deny our opponents the opportunities to kill our important companions, therefore taking control over who lives and who dies.  And since that is the most important factor in the game, if we do this successfully, we can learn how to take control of our wins and losses by controlling whom we kill.<br>
<br>
<B>Why would we ever want to kill our own companions?</B><br>
<br>
Were not intentionally killing our companions.  Were allowing certain supplementary companions to die.  There is a big difference.  I have never seen a consistently effective deck where every companion was absolutely essential for victory.  The reason these decks fail is because shadow sides thrive on killing companions, so if one of these strong shadow sides manages to kill an important companion, your entire deck has just been derailed.  In other words, you have to have other characters that can step in and take the fall for your King in Exile and Friends of the Shirefolk.  Otherwise, you had best be prepared to have all characters die.<br>
<br>
<B>Okay, I get it!  Companions die!  But how is that going to help me win games?</B><br>
<br>
Its going to help you win games through understanding and preparation.  The best players and best decks achieve greatness by understanding the risks of the game and preparing their decks to beat them.  Perhaps the best means of preparing yourself for these risks includes supplementary companions.  You cant make a reliable fellowship with 4 or fewer companions, because every shadow culture can get 4 minions out in a turn.  Even 5 is risky!  You have to have alternatives.  You need multiple companions.  Furthermore, you cant just throw 5+ random companions together and expect to be able to tackle the road to Mordor, either.  Every companion should have a purpose . . . and you must understand that purpose.  If that companion has exhausted his usefulness, his best use is as a wound repository, or as a buffer for the Cave Troll or Lurtz.  For example, youre playing against a Sauron Bowmen deck.  You play the rare Pippin to give Legolas an extra arrow.  Then, having served his purpose, Pippin exerts twice for Under the Watching Eye and takes 2 Bowmen arrows.  For 1 twilight (plus the move), youve basically healed 5 wounds by allowing your fellowship to not take those wounds.  Thats the power of a dead companion . . . <br>
<br>
<B>So, youre saying I should play the Rare Pippin?</B><br>
<br>
No!  Im trying to illustrate that when you build your deck, every companion should have a function.  Sam secures the quick start.  Arwen guards against Nazgul.  Dwarf of the Mountain Race chokes your opponent at sites 4 and 5.  But if youre ahead in the race at site 6 against Isengard; each of those companions has served his purpose and that makes them prime candidates for death.  Gandalf, however, needs to survive, because your events rely on spotting or exerting him, and you should assign accordingly.  Every companion has a purpose, and once that purpose is served, his purpose is to die instead of Frodo (or Sam, in those rare occasions).  Now, Im not saying that you should seek to kill a companion immediately after hes served his purpose.  Im just saying that an extra companion is an excellent means of risk mitigation.<br>
<br>
<B>What do you mean--Risk Mitigation?</B><br>
<br>
As I said, the best players account for the various risks that their fellowship will face on the adventure path.  They include in their decks answers for shadow conditions, wound placement, and swarms.  AND a variety of supplementary companions is the most effective way to mitigate each of those risks. <br>
<br>
<B>How do supplementary companions mitigate these risks?</B><br>
<br>
Having a larger fellowship means that your opponent must play more minions to ensure that any get through to the ring bearer.  Thus, supplementary companions are an effective means to handle swarms.  <br>
<br>
Next, we have shadow conditions . . . what shadow conditions do you typically worry about?  They Are Coming; Goblin Swarms; Orc Bowmen; Under the Watching Eye; Desperate Defense of the Ring; Black Breath; Blade Tip; Worry; and Thin and Stretched.  Well, for They Are Coming and Goblin Swarms, its the swarm argument revisited.  As for Bowmen and the Watching Eye, you have places to put wounds, so they arent an issue.  With Desperate Defense, Black Breath, and Blade Tip, you have multiple companions to assign, so you severely reduce these conditions effectiveness.  Now, there isnt much that supplementary companions can do to counter Worry and Thin and Stretched, but those cards dont win games by themselves.  On the other hand, large fellowships do combat the strategies that those conditions compliment.  <br>
<br>
Finally, we have Wound Placement.  Now, given that there are 8 sites where your opponent can attack, and given that a decent shadow will average about 4 wounds per site between exertions, archery, and skirmishes, your fellowship needs a place to put 32 wounds (lets call it 35).  Youll heal 10 at sanctuaries, and a good deck will have alternative methods to heal at least 8 more.  That leaves 17 wounds for your fellowship to absorb.  And since your common 5 companion fellowship only has a combined 21 vitality, everybody would be exhausted and one companion would be dead, with the given wound situation.  In other words, you have NO room for error.  However, if you have extra companions, you have extra vitality, and that affords you a degree of freedom that a small, dedicated fellowship does not have.  In other words, supplementary companions are the best means of risk mitigation.<br>
<br>
<B>So, what does this mean for my fellowship?</B><br>
<br>
It means that you should have multiple supplementary companions.  It means that you should prepare a set of conditions that defines when you can afford to sacrifice any companion in your deck.  (I mean, when you get right down to it . . . even Frodo has a right time to die.)  So why not play a single copy of Sam, Gimli, or Pippin for the express purpose of letting them die?  After all, why do you play Hobbit Stealth?  To cancel a skirmish or keep Frodo alive!  Wouldnt a single copy of Pippin be just as useful as a Hobbit Stealth for canceling skirmishes or keeping Frodo alive . . . AND he comes with other benefits.  With just one copy of Pippin, you get a Hobbit Stealth, an Athelas, and a place to put 4 wounds, all in one, for the low low cost of 1 twilight per move.  Thats twilight efficiency.  True, you have to measure the pros and cons of an extra companion.  Still, supplementary companions can add an entire new dimension to a deck.  They keep Frodo alive that much longer and get the ring that much closer to Mordor.  Thats the power of a dead man.<br>
<br>
<B>DEATH AND YOUR DECK</B><br>
<br>
The moral of this story . . . err, article . . . is that your Lord of the Rings success hinges on your ability to define the time and terms of companion death.  And that comes down to preparation and understanding.  You must understand what your opponents have available to them--both prior to and during your games.  You must prepare your fellowship and shadow to overcome these obstacles--to mitigate these risks.  For your shadow, you must play 8 cards that kill companions; otherwise your opponents fellowship will make it to site 9 intact.  Still, even with 8 cards that kill companions, you must adjust your shadow side so that it ramps up the pressure and deals 10+ wounds from sites 4 to 6.  Furthermore, you must design your shadow so it is reliable and predictable at these sites.  Meanwhile, for your fellowship, you should play multiple supplementary companions to mitigate the risks that your free people will face against an opposing shadow.  Understand what each of your companions adds to your fellowship and when their purpose is exhausted, prepare that companion to die instead of your important companions.<br>
<br>
In short, your mission is to play god over Middle-Earth by dealing out life and death as you see fit.  By controlling this aspect of the game, you control your destiny and your fortune.  So, become omnipotent--a broker of death--and you will become a god of the LotR tournament scene.  So, what will you do?  Will you dismiss this information as just another one of my insane theories on the macro game . . . OR will you begin to use companion death as a part of your LotR strategy.  Either way, its your funeral!<br>
