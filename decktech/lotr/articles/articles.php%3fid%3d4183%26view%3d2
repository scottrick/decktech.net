<br>
Dunland:<br>
<br>
Dunland Ransacker, Hillman Band, Hillman Tribe and Wulf, Dunlending Chieften are the only cards that take control of sites, and they are all minions and they all require surviving the skirmish pahse. With the exception of Hillman Bane you need to win the skirmish and spot another Dunland Man to take a site and for Band, the Fellowship needs to move again.<br>
<br>
So the areas to focus on are plain for this mechanic, wound prevention (mainly archery), possession removal and pumpers. Dunland have the best possession removal in the game in War Club (in my opinion). It costs nothing, provides +2 in a skirmish and then strips two possessions from any Free-Peoples characters! Then there is Secret Folk, which also works off winning skirmishes, but when used can strip up to three possessions from any Free-Peoples character again! You will be able to strip the entire Fellowship (conclusion based on current tournament decks) very easily if you win the skirmish.<br>
<br>
So now we have two effects of skirmish winning, Site control and possession removal. The next to worry about it pumping the buggers up high enough to win the day! Burn Every Village will assist, but it mainly kicks into gear once you have sites. Dark Fury comes highly recommended, because a Fellowship will most likely double move to site 3 and you can easily use this card, in combination with Golden Hall to win a skirmish. Death to the Strawheads is really expensive for the culture, and it generally will give you +4 each time, but it will also punish to overwhelming standards any large Fellowship! War Cry of Dunland is like a watered down version of Savagery! Saruman, Rabble Rouser can also pump +2 for each exertion he makes, so keep him in mind too (he has other uses to be discussed later). Finally Iron Axe is a +3 weapon for 0 cost, need I say more?<br>
<br>
The rest of the pumpers rest already on winning a skirmish so you dont need to worry about them so much as you need initial pumpers for the initial skirmish. So all that is left is wound prevention. To start with you can use sites to your advantage, here is a list of sites for Dunland Men that can not only be used for wound prevention, but other uses too!<br>
<br>
East Wall of Rohan (1) : Because it gives you more twilight.<br>
Eastemnet Downs (1) : Because it gets rid of some cards from the Free-Peoples hand, maybe killing of a skirmish event.<br>
Western Emyn Muil (1) : Fear Ring-bound in your area? <br>
Rohirrim Village (2) : Prevents wounds during Archery phase to all Dunland Men!<br>
Golden Hall (3) : Get rid of all those Free-Peoples weapons that he got early.<br>
Westemnet Plains (3) : Prevents wounds during Archery phase to all Dunland Men!<br>
Ered Nimras (4) : More twilight from large Fellowships.<br>
White Rocks (4) : More twilight from mounted Fellowships.<br>
Deeping Wall (5) : Play Saruman from you Draw Deck.<br>
Helms Gate (5) : If you stripped the Fellowship of possessions and you play War Club and Iron Axe, this is some extra pumpers for you.<br>
Hornburg Armoury (6) : Dunland can swarm, this will assist if you play the weapons.<br>
Hornburg Causeway (7) : Archery bonus against large Fellowships.<br>
Ring of Isengard (8) : Draw more cards!<br>
Wizards Vale (8) : Combat twilight denial.<br>
Fortress of Orthanc (9) : Punish Large Fellowships with more twilight.<br>
Orthanc Blacony (9) : Play Saruman from the dead for his pumpers!<br>
Orthanc Library (9) : Draw more cards for a large Fellowship.<br>
<br>
You may decide some other sites will benefit you, but that will depend on your Free-Peoples and overall deck strategy. More ways to prevent wounds are with Hides, which someone described as Armoury on steroids. This is not quite true as you really need twilight to get them going and you only get twilight once you have sites and No Refuge has kicked into gear! Hillman Horde is the same, you need two sites to skip the archery phase. Another way to avoid wounds may be to play minions like Dunlending Arsonist or Hillma Rabble that allow you to play another Man after they win a skirmish, so you skip every phase and jump straight to fierce skirmish with a new minion and you dont have to worry about wounds.<br>
<br>
Still you will worry, in open play cards like Greenleaf may eat these decks to pieces and ultimately it will be too hard to have minions out to win skirmishes. They do need another support set for the culture to combat Archery, something like Spies of Saruman would be nice or even a new Saruman, Keeper of Isengard for Dunland.<br>
<br>
So why should you control sites with Dunland Men anyway?? Here is a list of the benefits, and you will soon see why it is worth trying.<br>
<br>
Anger: Reduce requirements to make a Dunland Man Fierce.<br>
Burn Every Village: +4 instead of +2.<br>
Dunlending Looter: Can be stacked on a site (extra benefit with No refuge). And can be re-played for 2.<br>
Hill Chief: Card Draw (3 cards).<br>
Hillmans Horde: 2 sites  no archery. 3 sites  all Dunland Men are Fierce. 4 sites  all Dunland Men are Damage+1.<br>
Hillman Rabble: See Looter.<br>
No Refuge: While a minion is stacked on a site (see Rabble & Looter) each site is +5. <br>
No Retreat: Force the Fellowship to move again!<br>
Over the Isen: Assign Dunland Men yourself to unbound companions.<br>
Wake of Destruciton: Make Dunland Men Fierce.<br>
<br>
So as you can see this culture has some very appealing combinations to be used when sites are under control. It is work a look at, but you need to be on the ball with your deck construction and play testing. I am unsure at this point if this thing is tournament worthy, as it is so hard to get going but time will tell.<br>
<br>
Isengard: <br>
<br>
You have more options here for taking control of sites with Isengard and it is my opinion that this is unfair as Isengard is already a great culture and it would of made more sense to pump Dunland with these cards than Isengard.<br>
<br>
All the same, Attack on Helms Deep is a token condition, play and Uruk to add an Isengard token, remove three tokens and discard an Uruk to take a site. Down to the Last Child is even easier, place a token each time an Uruk wins a Skirmish, remove 2 tokens to take a site. Uruks are healthy (high vitality) and they win skirmishes regularly as seen in the current Meta, I am disappointed then that this card is so easy to take sites, given what I said in the previous paragraph.<br>
<br>
A less powerful way of taking sites is with Uruk Stormer, who requires the death of a companion or Ally to take a site. But considering recent Uruk decks have quite easily defeated companions, even those who are quite beefed up then this may not be all the hard really.<br>
<br>
So what is it that you need to get this going? You need to basically win skirmishes again, but this time the methods for skirmish winning are already well known with Uruks and just a quick look at some of the Minions available in the Two Towers set will reaffirm how easy it will be to win. If you looked specifically at the types of Minions you would play in an Uruk site control deck their strengths are around 8, 10 or 12 and they have a vitality of between 2-3. Use some Uruk-Hai Armoury, or Saruman, Keeper of Isengard or Spies of Saruman and the chances of these Uruks lasting long enough for you to win a skirmish is obvious. <br>
<br>
So I can now jump right to the benefits of site control, and one of the more obvious is controlling sites with the keyword Battleground. With that in mind here are some sites that will help Uruk Site Control:<br>
<br>
East Wall of Rohan (1) : Because it gives you more twilight.<br>
Eastemnet Downs (1) : Because it gets rid of some cards from the Free-Peoples hand, maybe killing of a skirmish event.<br>
Western Emyn Muil (1) : Fear Ring-bound in your area? <br>
Uruk Camp (2) : Battleground.<br>
Golden Hall (3) : Get rid of all those Free-Peoples weapons that they got early.<br>
Ered Nimras (4) : More twilight from large Fellowships.<br>
White Rocks (4) : Battleground. More twilight from mounted Fellowships.<br>
Deep of Helm (5) : Battlegournd. First Uruk is 3.<br>
Deeping Wall (5) : Battleground. Play Saruman from you Draw Deck.<br>
Helms Gate (5) : Battleground. <br>
Hornburg Courtyard (5) : Battleground.<br>
Hornburg Paclobert (5) : Battleground. <br>
Caves oeasterlinglarond (6) : Remove 2 to make an Uruk Fierce.<br>
Great Hall (6) : Battleground.<br>
Hornburg Causeway (7) : Battleground. Archery bonus against large Fellowships<br>
Fortress of Orthanc (9) : Battleground. Punish Large Fellowships with more twilight.<br>
Orthanc Blacony (9) : Play Saruman from the dead!<br>
<br>
Again you may decide some other sites will benefit you, but that will depend on your Free-Peoples and overall deck strategy. Not every Battleground is of benefit to you, the most obvious is Uruk Camp and Hornburg Paclobert, which may actually hurt your shadow, but the Battleground keyword can be potent.<br>
<br>
Advance Uruk Patrol is already strength 10 at a cost of 5, controlling a Battleground makes him strength 14. If he is at a Battleground he is Fierce and he is already Damage+1. So if you get the combo going you have the same as a Witch King with one less vitality for a cost of 5. Band of Uruk Bowmen adds an extra archery, while Burning of Westfold allows you to discard an Uruk to discard a condition. No Dawn for Men allows on Uruk to be exerted causing X unbound companions to exert, and X is the number of sites you control. Race across the Mark allows you to cancel a skirmish with an Uruk, and if Pillage of Rohan can spot a minion stacked on a site then the Free-Peoples player cant use Skirmish events of Special abilites. Think about this one for a minute, the Grima Bomb, Pillage of Rohan and the initial site control card Down to the Last Child. All of a sudden winning skirmishes and taking more sites become so easy in comparison to the Dunland culture that it is almost a crime. <br>
<br>
Uruk Assault Band is another Battleground pumper, he is base strength 14 for a cost of 7, and he is Damage +1. Then whilst at a Battlegournd he is fierce. But the best part is when you control a Battleground he is strength +6 and if you control two Battle ground he cannot take wounds. So for a cost of 7 you potentially get a strength 20, Damage+1, Fierce minion who cant take wounds. Combine that with Pillage of Rohan and the Grima Bomb and then you can kiss two companions goodbye almost 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
Uruk Besieger can stack on a site during regroup, hence making Pillage work and he can also play again for a reduced cost. Uruk Trooper too has the same function. Then there is a slew of strong Uruks that benefit, from the Veteran to the Mob they all have a reduced cost of 1 if you control a site, while Uruk-Hai Band is strength +2.<br>
<br>
Finally a card called We Are the Fighting Uruk-hai makes Lurtzs Battle Cry look utterly pathetic. It pumps an Uruk to strength + 2 and then an extra damage+1 if you control a site.<br>
<br>
So at the end of that you can see how powerful the fighting Uruk-hai really are when you can get some site control going. Sure it is hard, because only three cards allow you to take sites, but it has far reaching benefits and to me this is a little unfair and I would of though Dunland would have been good to develop these kinds of site control dynamics!<br>
<br>
Raider<br>
<br>
There are only three minions that can take sites and they all do it in the regroup phase. Desert Lancers and Regiment of Haradhrim exert twice in the regoup phase to take sites, while Southron Explorer must exert once and remove 5 to take a site. Admittedly the first two are strong and have a high vitality, chances are they may survive, but give archery and the Ring-Bound exert to wound a man strategy it may be harder than first thought.<br>
So you need to be able to heal your Men or prevent wounds of this nature. Arrows From the South at first glance looked to be an option, but it heals at the wrong time. You could attempt to use the exert to exert strategy of the Southron Archer to prevent the Free-Peoples player from exerting to wound you. Or simply the amount of Southron Archery you can create with burdens and Rapid Fire and a few other helpful support cards may nullify it enough! You can also effectively kill of the Ring-Bound strategy early so they cannot exert to wound you with Eastern Emyn Muil, this also has a secondary function to allow directed damage onto Ring-Bound companions including the Ring-Bearer.<br>
<br>
The benefits of site control are not so broad sweeping as Isengard or Dunland but they are effective. Southron Archer makes the archery total +1 for each site, whereas Southron Sentry adds 2 for each site. These are both important as archery is a prime mechanic of the Raiders and many of the Southrons have remove X to wound abilities. Men of Harad is very expensive and the chances of spotting 3 Southrons is low at the start of the game, but it lets you draw a card if you remove 2.<br>
<br>
Basically that is about it for this culture, it is not such a large mechanic, but it still has benefits and can easily support the major mechanics of this culture regarding archery and removing twilight to wound.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the opposing strategies of Liberating sites and how this can be achieved.<br>
<br>
Elven.<br>
<br>
Haldir, Emissary of the Galadhrim is the first companion in the set to be able to liberate a site, and he would want to because as long as no one controls a site he is strength +2. The problem is you need to exert him and another Elf, so already you see you need more than just one Elf to combat sites.<br>
<br>
Night Without End is an event that allows an Elf who won a skirmish to exert to liberate a site, and along with this you can alternatively wound a minion if not up against site control. This is fantastic for hand clog and means the card has a use similar to the Bow of the Galadhrim if no sites are controlled  hey even more ways to kill off the Saruman, Keeper of Isengard. Another such event is Sword-wall that must spot 3 elves (hey another card for more than one Elf). You also get a way to combat No Refuge or Pillage of Rohan as Thandronen can exert to discard a minion stacked on a condition or a site.<br>
<br>
Gondor.<br>
<br>
Liberating a site is a little easier than the Elves, you just need a few Copies of Forests of Ithilien and you can exert a Ring-Bound man and discard the condition to liberate. It also has an alternate advantage making the site number of all Men +2 at site 5 helping their roaming events and pumpers.<br>
<br>
That is basically it for Gondor and it only works for the Ring-Bound Rangers, but it is an easy and simple answer to site control and one asks, is it too easy? This may be the reason that Ring-Bound Rangers become popular.<br>
<br>
Rohan.<br>
<br>
The Rohan get a few ways to combat sites and so they should, because if you control a site that is the home site of the majority of their allies, then that ally is lost to the discard pile.<br>
<br>
Ceorl can exert to prevent a site from being taken if you can spot a villager. Helm! Helm! Can liberate a site if you can spot 2 mounted Rohan Men or draw 3 cards, meaning it is not a complete waste of space if your not playing against a site control deck. Theoden can also lend a hand, playing with the common version, Son of Thengel you can spot a Rohan ally and exert him to liberate a site. The problem being that Theoden has only 2 vitality, so you would need his sword (which has an extra vitality) and probably his Mail too!<br>
<br>
You can see from the start that Rohan site liberation works off allies and spotting more than on Roham man, this means you will be stuck to Rohan heavy decks in order to save sites, unless you use Theoden outside of the deck. Even then you will need to have a Rohan ally, but that should be rather easy considering the wide range of allies. Perhaps a Gandalf/Theoden deck that uses Harken to Me to prevent Theoden from being targeted by Shadow conditions and a few mounts so that Weland can be used to heal them. Well Stored will then in turn heal Weland. This may make site liberation accessible to more than just a few deck types.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
And there you have it, site control explained. You will notice that there is not many options for deck types that use site control, you are stuck with a particular strategy unless you use Isengard. In that case you can use fighters or archers or a mix and there may be room for further exploration.<br>
<br>
To liberate as well is very hard to handle, Elves, Gondor and Rohan can do it but they are all limited by spotting cards specific to their culture and in some cases spotting many cards from their culture. This leave Dwarf heavy, Gandalf heavy, Shire heavy or Unbound Gondor heavy decks in a little bit of pain and I expect then that you will see site control is a huge way in tournament play. Maybe not right up off the cuff, but it will catch on! At least if everyone starts playing site control the Meta will change dramatically.<br>
<br>
Happy gaming all the same and see you on the other side!<br>
