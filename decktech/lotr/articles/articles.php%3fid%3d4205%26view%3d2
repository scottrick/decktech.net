<br>
The very first thing you will notice if the cost of these cards, in total the average cost of the whole Raider culture is approximately 3, but the average cost of their minions is approximately 4. They are also roaming until site 4, which makes them a little better than Uruk-Hai, especially now that Hollin is no longer a factor here.<br>
<br>
The added bonus for this is they also have an average strength of approximately 9 and an average vitality of approximately 2.5 creating a culture that will be formidable in skirmish. The first thing however is getting your head around the dynamics of the culture, around burdens, archery, direct damage or exertions, site control, ambush and a few other just plain mean abilities. Here I will try to explore in a meaningful way each of these dynamics and how they fit in with one another.<br>
<br>
The first and most obvious thrust behind the culture is archery, they have some of the most potent archery generation abilities that can ultimately wipe out multiple companions with little trouble. If these guys become a strong force in play, along with Isengard Archery, expect to see a lot of those unused Fellowship anti-archery cards in open play!<br>
<br>
Lets start form the beginning, minion archers! Each of these minions are archers and can exert to exert any companion (including Ring-Bound companions giving the edge over Isengard Archery, but not the Ring-Bearer of course), they have been suffixed with their cost/strength/vitality: Desert Lord (Unique, 6/11/3),  Elite Archer (4,8,2), and Southron Bowman (3,6,2). In addition to these three minions, there is the Southron Archer (3,6,2) who generates extra archery for each site you control while you can spot another Raider man and the Southron Troop (7,14,4) which not only has an ambush of 1, but can spot 7 companions to assign itself to the Ring-Bearer (the Free-Peoples player may discard a companion to prevent this). So there you have 5 very reasonable minions, 2 cheap archers, one moderate and two beasts for you to play with. But the fun does not end there, there are extra cards that can make these guys rather potent and a real archery force to be reckoned with. <br>
<br>
Chances are these Minions are potential Skirmish winners, especially if you play with some of the pumpers that I will discuss later on. In that case the first card in the Raider set is Arrows From the South, which receives a token for each victorious skirmish, you can then discard to condition to heal Raider archers for each token on the condition. I like the looks of this card, played early you can rack up a few skirmish wins and then in the nest turn use the exert to exert abilities, heal the raiders and then exert to exert again! The fun does not stop there.<br>
<br>
Rapid Fire is an expensive burden related archery card, but ultimately it is worth more than the beast that is Southron Troop in terms of its ability to add wounds, so the cost of 6 is justified! Basically you exert a Raider archer to add 1 to the archery total for each burden. Given the burden adding abilities of this culture that I will look at later you can see how potent this card may be. I can picture a Frodo with 9 burdens at site 9, you play one low cost Raider and then hit them with Rapid Fire producing upwards of 9 archery. That is at least two companions in any game, if not four. So despite the cost of this card, it is a trump card that can be stored and used at the right time or simply discarded if you feel you wont be able to use it. I have thrown one copy into my new Raider deck and it makes me feel more comfortable.<br>
<br>
The final fun to be had with Raider Archers is in the Southron Bow. It has a high cost at 3, but potentially it allows you to add Easterlings or Southrons who are not archers into a Raider Archer deck. It even allows you to make a complete non-Archery deck a little trickier to deal with. You see the card plays on any Raider Man, and make them an archer; this means you can make some other beasts archers and triggers Arrows From the South too. On top of this, if you can spot another Raider Man (not an archer, just a man) you can add 1 to the archery total. So potentially for a cost of 3 you score two more points of archery. The real treat is you dont even need to be using an Archer deck to do it!<br>
<br>
This then flows onto the Burdens, the Easterling strength that as you can see the culture already benefits from in terms of Rapid Fire. Adding burdens is really simple with these guys and as you will see the benefits are huge. The first dynamic is exerting to add a burden when skirmish an unbound companion, the following minions do this: Easterling Guard (4,9,2) and Easterling Lieutenant (3,8,2). These two guys are the staple of any strong burden deck, sure it fails big time against a Ring-Bound deck, but there are ways around this problem that we will look at later, at this stage however. The trouble then is Fellowship archery, because without it you score up to 8 burdens if you play 4 copies of each (and not even stealth cards can save them from this). I will explore ways to deal with archery later, but at this stage just know there is not much you can do at all.<br>
<br>
There are more ways to add burdens that are probably a little less complicated in terms of predictability of effectiveness. Gathering to the Summons is a 0 cost answer to the Ring-Bound problem but spotting a Raider Man in a skirmish with a Ring-Bound companion (includes the Ring-Bearer) to add a burden. Rather simple really, and you can spot any skirmish regardless of what your resolving right at that point. You can try it in combination with Vision From Afar that costs 2 and forces an Easterling to Skirmish the Ring-Bearer unless a burden is added. So in this combination you score a burden either way. None the less Vision From Afar is potent in itself because most of your Easterlings will defeat Frodo a great deal of the time, making the choice of the burden for the Free-Peoples player appealing. New Fear will also punish large Fellowships allowing you to exert a Raider Man to add a burden for each companion over 4. They can discard 2 companions to prevent it which is still potent, so the cost of 4 for this card is warranted.<br>
<br>
So there you have it, three methods and four cards to add burdens quickly and easily that in the whole have a much better effect against unbound decks simply because of the restrictions on the minions and the fact that most Ring-Bound decks will be able to remove burdens quickly with cards like Frodo, Tired Traveller. So how then do you combat a Ring-Bound deck in the best way possible?<br>
<br>
Well not only do the Archers of this set allow you to target Ring-Bound companions directly but there is a condition that can single-handedly destroy a Ring-Bound deck very early on. Eastern Emyn Muil, a unique condition that needs to be played when the Fellowship is at site 2T, so you need it in your starting hand if your going second (remember you can call a mulligan). When the Fellowship moves from site 2T, each Ring-Bound companion must exert twice! This includes the Ring-Bearer believe it or not. On top of this you can exert a Raider Man, discards the condition to exert a Ring-Bound companion, again including the Ring-Bearer. This card is also then not wasted on unbound decks as the Ring-Bearer is always Ring-Bound and if this cards is out you score 2 exertions from site 2T to site 3T then you can use this card to score a third exertion on the Ring-Bearer. Having said that, against a Ring-Bound deck every companion will have 2 wounds, so everyone but Sam, Frodo and Faramir with Boromir, My Borther will be one wound away from death. Then if your playing with Archers you can surely knock off a few companions, if not you can inflict a load more than 5 wounds meaning the Free-Peoples player moves to site 4T still carrying wounds. If you play with sites like Western Emyn Muil then if this combination works you will have a completely exhausted Fellowship at site 3. In anyones books this is a very comfortable position, especially since this combination works on the Ring-Bearer in an unbound deck too.<br>
<br>
So with that in mind, throwing in four copies of Eastern Emyn Muil, and playing a site 1T of Western Emyn Muil is a very logical choice for almost all Raider decks. Eastern Emyn Muil will also allow you to wound Ring-Bound companions late in the game to stop effects like Rangers Bow that can wound Men in a skirmish.<br>
<br>
So at this stage I would like to propose a sample Raider Shadow Side that uses the cards and combinations I have spoken about so far, including some pumpers that I am yet to discuss:<br>
<br>
(Cards: 34)<br>
<br>
(5 Conditions)<br>
Eastern Emyn Muil x4<br>
Arrows From the South x1<br>
<br>
(21 Minions)<br>
Easterling Lieutenant x4<br>
Easterling Guard x3<br>
Southron Bowman x4<br>
Southron Archer x3<br>
Desert Lord x2<br>
Elite Archer x4<br>
Southron Troop x1 <br>
<br>
(1 Possession)<br>
Southron Bow x1<br>
<br>
(7 Events)<br>
Rapid Fire x1<br>
Vision From Afar x2<br>
Gathering to the Summons x1<br>
Men of Rhun x3<br>
<br>
Site Path:<br>
<br>
[1T] Western Emyn Muil<br>
[2T] Wold of Rohan<br>
[3T] Golden Hall<br>
[4T] Ered Nimras<br>
[5T] No site is beneficial, Free-Peoples strategy shall decide<br>
[6T] No site is beneficial, Free-Peoples strategy shall decide<br>
[7T] Cavern Entrance or Hornburg Causeway (Preference Choice)<br>
[8T] Wizards Vale<br>
[9T] Palantir Chamber or Fortress of Orthanc or Orthanc Library (Preference Choice)<br>
<br>
You can see from this shadow deck that you have the ability to:<br>
A)	Combat Ring-Bound strategies<br>
B)	Provide large amounts of Archery<br>
C)	Provide burdens are different levels depending on your opponent<br>
D)	Win Skirmishes<br>
E)	Target the Ring-Bearer Directly (wounds and archery)<br>
<br>
These five dynamics are important in this deck and if you can combine it with a Fellowship that is capable of running very early on, you may find with the sheer number of wounds this deck can place on the Ring-Bearer that you will put enough pressure on your opponent to move twice when he probably should not. Hence giving you the twilight you need to get your cards out of your hand and in play. Yes this deck will suffer against twilight denial, but by targeting the Ring-Bearer it will make it hard for those decks to get away from you too quickly, which is why a running Fellowship that burns its own cards fast is so important to go with this shadow. You can also see that you will want to go second, so you may need to bid for that choice so be wise in that respect.<br>
<br>
There are other uses for burdens too, and there are many Minions that use the Burden strategy to gain some very powerful abilities. Desert Legion (6,13,3) goes nuts with burdens, if you can spot 4 he is strength +5, for 5 burdens he is fierce and for 6 he is damage+1. Ultimately for 6 burdens you get a strength 18, fierce and damage+1 minion with a vitality of 3 for a cost of 6. It is also Ambush 1, meaning you add some twilight to generate a possible pumper! Another card like this one is Easterling Captain (5,11,3), but it is more like a pumper, spotting burdens and removing 2 tokens you can pump up any Easterling and the more burdens you spot the more power you get. Other smaller minions like this are Easterling Axeman (2,6,2) who is Strength + 3 and fierce for 2 burdens, Easterling Infantry (3,8,3) who is fierce and damage +1 for 3 burdens, then Easterling Trooper (4,9,2) gains the same as Infantry. <br>
<br>
So a deck example that uses the burdens to create more powerful Minions would be:<br>
<br>
(Cards: 34)<br>
<br>
(4 Conditions)<br>
Eastern Emyn Muil x4<br>
<br>
(23 Minions)<br>
Easterling Lieutenant x4<br>
Easterling Guard x4<br>
Easterling Axeman x4<br>
Easterling Infantry x4<br>
Easterling Trooper x3<br>
Easterling Captain x2<br>
Desert Legion x2<br>
<br>
(7 Events)<br>
Gathering to the Summons x1<br>
New Fear x1<br>
Vision From Afar x2<br>
Men of Rhun x3<br>
<br>
The site path is not so important, and it is basically the same principal as the previous deck example I gave you. This is a basic burden pumper deck that is a little tookeaper than the previous deck and is also less likely to suffer against a twilight denial deck. It can really put a great deal of pressure on because the number of burdens needed to trigger the lesser effects are not the great and will probably come about from bidding anyway.<br>
<br>
Moving on I have already touched on pumpers, so lets take a look at what you can do to make your Raider Men more powerful in Skirmish. First lets look at Men of Rhun and why I chose to use it above the others. Men of Rhun makes a Raider Man strength +3, so all my minions get a benefit and it also adds an extra strength of 1 if you spot 4 burdens. It does have a cost of 2, so you may not get a chance to play it, but none of the Raider pumpers come for anything less. Fearless is another, but it only gives Southrons +1 for each burden (limit +5) and every other Raider man gets +2 again for a cost of 2. Then another 2 twilight tokens will allow you to play On the March, which is a standard +3 (of +5 if you spot 6 companions). One asks where the Savagery is for this set? I do think it needs one!<br>
<br>
All three of these pumpers give you a choice based on what you think is going to happen in the game. Will there be burdens? Am I playing mainly Southrons? Or will there be large Fellowships. There cost is all 2 so the choice then is up to you and the Meta your playing in at the time, so make a wise choice. The twilight need too then flows onto the next ability of the Raider culture and that is adding twilight after the shadow phase.<br>
<br>
A huge portion of this set is about adding twilight after the shadow pahse and then using it, and in that respect you can also counter the common Gandalf of this set and reduce him and his staff to an old man with a walking stick again (another Meta choice for you already). The primary way in which twilight is added is with the new keyword ambush. For those in the dark it means add the number of tokens displayed next to that keyword when the Free-Peoples player assigns that minion to a skirmish. Just as a point of note, the Free-Peoples player does not need to assign anyone and he can leave it up to the shadow player, this nullifies the ambush effect but it also means you can stack all your minions onto the Ring-Bearer for some skirmish fun!<br>
<br>
The Minions capable of Ambush are: Desert Legion  Ambush 1 (6,13,3), Southron Commander  Ambush 1 (5,10,3), Southron Fighter  Ambush 1 (5,10,3), Southron Scout  Ambush 2 (1,3,1), Southron Soldier  Ambush 2 (2,4,1), Southron Troop  Ambush 1 (7,14,4), Southron Veterans  Ambush 1 (5,10,3), and Southron Wanderer  Ambush 1 (3,8,2). Quite a few, and the majority of them are quite large too. So while you can add twilight with these guys, can they do anything with it? Heh, no not really! This is the sticking point of the strategy, you need extra minions on top of this to be able to use the twilight. You see Desert Legion uses Burdens in his ability, Southron Commander spots 6 companions to assign to the Ring-Bearer unless an Unbound companion is discarded (hey use this in combination with Gathering to the Summons), Southron Fighter too spots 5 companions to make the Free-Peoples player exert a companion,Southron Scout and Southron Soldier do nothing, Southron Troop we have already spoken about, Southron Veterans spots 6 companions to exert to force the Free-Peoples player to exert 2 companions and Southron Wanderer spots 5 companions to assign to the Ring-Bearer, this time the Free-Peoples player can add 4 to prevent it (again use Gathering to the Summons).<br>
<br>
So you cant really use the Ambush with those Ambush minions. You can use Southron Commander, Southron Veterans and Southron Wanderer with the Minions that need this Ambush twilight, because they all have benefits will aid that strategy, and Southron Scout and Southron Soldier will also work with the strategy as they are cheap and can add a bit of twilight. But Southron Troop and Desert Legion seem best used in burden/archery decks like the one previously presented and you can use the Ambush twilight for pumpers like Men of Rhun or On the March. You can use this Ambush to generate sort of direct damage effect with Whirling Strike that costs three to wound a companion or ally a Raider Man is skirmishing. This would be quite an interesting deck to try as most of these Ambush Minions are very strong and come with small support minions to add more twilight for low cost.<br>
<br>
A Sample Deck would be (including what I now call the staple Raider Emyn Muil combination): <br>
<br>
(Cards: 35)<br>
<br>
(4 Conditions)<br>
Eastern Emyn Muil x4<br>
<br>
(21 Minions)<br>
Southron Scout x4<br>
Southron Soldier x4<br>
Southron Fighter x2<br>
Southron Commander x2<br>
Southron Veterans x2<br>
Southron Wanderer x4<br>
Desert Legion x2<br>
Southron Troop x1<br>
<br>
(10 Events)<br>
Gathering to the Summons x1<br>
Men of Rhun x4<br>
On the March x3<br>
Whirling Strike x2<br>
<br>
Once again similar situations apply with card recycling, twilight denial and so forth. However twilight denial decks will not as big a problem with these guys, they still will cause headaches however. As you can also see this deck is primarily about Pumpers, so steer clear of Cavern Entrance and be weary of cards like the common Faramir, but hopefully the Emyn Muil combo works them out early.<br>
<br>
Now before I look at other ways to use the Ambush twilight, there are other ways to generate the twilight, they range from easy to difficult. The best twilight adder is Flanking Attack, it costs 0 and works in both Skirmish and Maneuver and adds 3 for the cost of an Exertion (from A Southron only). 3 twilight tokens is a lot and will be clearer soon as to why it is valuable. Southron Sentry is also quite useful, but it works only with site control, which I am yet to talk about. You can exert this guy to add 2 for each site you control, (hey this guy can be thrown into any site control deck as twilight generation for any culture). Easterling Skirmisher is like the Sentry, but it spots burdens and adds1 for each burden (limit 4) and the rest is all conditions. Ithilien Wilderness (mainly a multiplayer card) can add 8 twilight is at sites 7T, 8T or 9T there is less than 7 tokens at the start of your shadow phase. Then finally a less than appealing condition called Raiders from the East lets you remove 3 and exert a Raider Man to add a token, you can then Remove a token to add 1, gosh darnit costly if you ask me!<br>
<br>
So moving right along, what about ways to use this twilight that is not a pumper? Well the most obvious is Southron Spear, which works very well with the Southron Wanderer as it removes 4 along with an exertion to wound a companion or ally that the bearer is skirmishing. It cost is 1 and gives a strength bonus of +2. So potentially Southron Wanderer is strength 10 and if your spot companions you can trigger this whole effect. Remember if they dont add 4 twilight token to let you use Southron Spear you will be skirmishing the Ring-Bearer at strength 10, this all for a total cost of 4.<br>
<br>
There are also a whole pile of minions that use this twilight to do some nasty things indeed, Some that remove 3 tokens to wound are: Desert Soldier (4,9,2), Desert Spearman (3,8,2) and Desert Warrior (2,6,2). This is a sort of Damage +1, but it means you can inflict a single wound without reducing your vitality and it means you have a better chance of being alive at the regroup phase and still inflicting wounds if you lose the skirmish. These cards are great in combination with Flanking Attack or the smaller Southron Scout and Soldier who are lackeys to add twilight. <br>
<br>
Other Twilight removal can be found in Easterling Capatin (5,11,3) who works for Easterlings and burdens and needs 2 tokens to use his effects. There is also a condition called Howl of Harad, where a victorious Southron (in a skirmish) allows you to remove 4 to make the Free-Peoples player wound a Ring-Bound companion, and in an unbound deck the choice is only the Ring-Bearer and that wound may also end up as Burdens too! None the less it is a very potent condition. Finally Southron Explorer (2,5,3) likes to have 5 token in the regroup phase to take a site under control, but I will talk about that later!<br>
<br>
So lets try a deck that revolves around the remove to wound theory:<br>
<br>
(Cards: 34)<br>
<br>
(4 Conditions)<br>
Eastern Emyn Muil x4<br>
Howl of Harad x1<br>
<br>
(24 Minions)<br>
Southron Scout x4<br>
Southron Soldier x4<br>
Desert Soldier x3<br>
Desert Spearman x4<br>
Desert Warrior x4<br>
Southron Wanderer x3<br>
Southron Fighter x2<br>
<br>
(6 Events)<br>
Flanking Attack x4<br>
On the March x2<br>
<br>
Again this is a very basic remove to wound, Scout Soldier, Wandered and Fighter and Flanking Attack all add and the rest remove. This is probably not a very strong deck at all, but it displays easily the dynamic and is worth playing so you can see how the dynamic works in the game and decide for yourself what you would add/remove.<br>
<br>
Finally we come to something far more complex than I have explored to date and that is Raider Site Control. It is hard and its uses are spread right over the culture and its dynamics, I will try here to nut it out. <br>
<br>
There are three ways to take sites and they are: Desert Lancers (Unique, 5/11/3) who must exert twice in regroup to take a site; Regiment of Haradhrim (Unique, 8,16,4) who also must exert twice in the regroup to take a site; and finally Southron Explorer (2,5,3) who must remove 5 and exert to take a site. So the first problem you will all see is that you need to survive to regroup with all these minions and receive no wounds. This makes taking sites from archery decks and Ring-Bound Rangers with Bows next to impossible (you cant really heal your Raiders after skirmish). So this kind of site control is a huge gamble.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lets look at the benefits of site control and how erratic they actually are. Men of Harad is a 0 cost condition and if you can spot a site you control and 3 Southrons then you can remove 2 to draw a card. Talk about long winded, given how hard it is to take sites it may be difficult to meet the other requirements too. Southron Archer (3,6,2) can spot another Southron to add +1 to the archery total for each site you control. This actually sounds very nice, but at most you could probably get 1-2 sites with the site control minions and the combination in practice is a little hard to establish, so it is not that appealing yet. Southron Sentry (4,9,2) as spoken about before adds 2 twilight for each site under control but it does it in the Maneuver phase so it wont help Men of Harad. Surprisingly now that is all you can do with site control with the Raiders and it is all pretty much restricted to the Southron aspects of the culture.<br>
<br>
So at this stage Men of Harad will probably not see much play, nor will Southron Sentry as you can already see the twilight generation can be achieved easily without the complexity of site control and the archery strategy is also very good at this point without again the added complexity of site control. You can experiment in your own time with the ideas and if you get it working then drop me a line to prove me wrong, but at this point I am not going to bother much with it.<br>
<br>
This leaves us with some competitive deck ideas to sort through. You have seen the burdens and what they can do for you, Archery, the Emyn Muil combo and the twilight generation after the shadow phase. Hopefully now you see how Archery benefits from burdens, burdens work well if you can assign Raider Men to the Ring-Bearer or Ring-Bound companions, Twilight generation assists with pumpers especially considering the high costs of some of the minions and so on. My two favourite strategies in this set would have to be the archery/burdens deck and the straight burdens deck and sooner rather than later I would like to explore a Nazgul/Raider deck. <br>
