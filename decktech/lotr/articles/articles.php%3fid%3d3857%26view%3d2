<br>
The basic idea behind discard decks is to make your opponent toss as many cards as possible, to the benefit of both your free peoples and shadow turns. The greatest shadow threat comes from the later sites (7, 8 & 9) where the most twilight is generated. If your discard deck is working properly, two situations should have occurred by this time. First, your opponent should have tossed most of his or her fellowship support cards, making them weaker to your shadow attack and forcing them to move only once per turn. Second, your opponent should have also discarded most of his or her shadow cards and minions, allowing your fellowship a free walk through to site 9.<br>
<br>
The great irony of the current discard debate is that the complaints have mostly been about the Elven discard cards - The Mirror of Galadrial, The White Arrows of Lorien and Far-seeing Eyes - which have all been available since the original Fellowship of the Ring set was released.<br>
<br>
This is important to note, because there are two main themes to discard decks - discarding from hand, and discarding from your draw deck. The new Sauron cards can play to either theme with suitable aplomb, and if done correctly, both can be devastating to your opponent.<br>
<br>
Discard-from-hand<br>
This is currently the most popular of the strategies. The main reason for this is because it allows players to play Elves as their fellowship side. But it also adds some strategic advantages. If a player loses his hand, he cannot play anything against you, even if he can draw more cards the next turn. Also, a lot of players stockpile power cards in their hands, like Nazgul and A Ranger&#8217;s Versatility. Many of the discard-from-hand methods allow you to choose certain cards, allowing you to discard the power cards, which is obviously a good thing.<br>
<br>
For the strategy to work though, it is important that your shadow side is just as powerful as your fellowship side. So let&#8217;s take a look at the new Sauron cards using the discard-from-hand theme:<br>
·Tower of Barad-dur: Every culture now gets a stackable so-called &#8216;citadel&#8217; condition, and for Sauron, the Tower is it. It really is a power card. A lot of time, one or two cards from hand will have been played during the fellowship phase, leaving less than 8 cards in hand. With 4 Towers out, most of the remaining hand will be tossed when the fellowship moves, removing the majority of the events for the remaining phases. Besides the obvious advantages to removing maneuver, archery and skirmish events, one of the best things about the Tower is that it will remove those nasty regroup actions that are so essential for double moves. No more Deft in Their Movements, We Must Go Warily, An Able Guide, Gondor&#8217;s Vengeance, or Pursuit Just Behind. No more Pathfinder type cards. And then if the fellowship does still move twice, the Tower will make sure there are no more cards remaining.<br>
·Hand of Sauron: Exert a Sauron minion to discard a card at random from your opponent&#8217;s hand. Probably the best thing about this card is that it is a common, so it will be easy to get four of. But the 0 twilight cost and maneuver phase timing are also good. Overall, it&#8217;s reasonably useful, but you end up wishing you had more than four in your deck. Especially since it activates Old Noakes. But it is nice since it helps to use up minion vitality, possibly making your deck more efficient. Provided you get a minion out, you should be able to use it. With Orc Inquisitor and two of these you are tossing three cards from hand.<br>
·The Dark Lord Advances: ROTEL has a lot of these types of cards. Potentially good, but potentially not. At two twilight cost and being a regroup phase card that also requires a minion exertion, I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth it. Your opponent shouldn&#8217;t have too many cards in hand by the regroup phase, so even if you select the Balrog, Cave Troll or Witch-king, you will still only likely discard a maximum of 2 or 3 cards if you&#8217;re lucky. It gets an honourable mention as the only other ROTEL Sauron card that specifically targets the player&#8217;s hand.<br>
<br>
Only three cards? That&#8217;s hardly a theme, right? Well, you can&#8217;t deny the power of stacked Tower of Barad-dur. And too play those, you will need four minion exertions, with the other cards being non-ROTEL cards, like Tower Lieutenant and Orc Inquisitor. That may take you to sixteen cards. So what about the rest? There&#8217;s a good reason there&#8217;s not too much focus on discard-from-hand in ROTEL Sauron. First, because it&#8217;s meant to combine with discard-from-draw deck. Second, because of the most powerful Hobbit in the world. Old Noakes is the bane of all shadow discard-from-hand decks. You can have 3 minions out against only 2 Hobbit companions, with one of them being a Tower Lieutenant, and the one Hobbit can lose and then Old Noakes will discard one of the other minions. And when Tower of Barad-dur makes you discard a card from hand, Old Noakes can then discard a condition, like Tower of Barad-dur.<br>
<br>
The recent FAQ addendum did have something to say on Old Noakes. If it&#8217;s a choice between discarding and something else, Old Noakes isn&#8217;t activated. The main use of this is for Desperate Defense of the Ring, which becomes a potential power card in a discard-from-draw deck shadow deck, as we shall see.<br>
<br>
Discard-from-draw deck<br>
Personally, I feel this has been hideously overlooked. Why? As powerful as discarding-from-hand is, it has a limit: a maximum of eight cards, usually. There is even talk of a rule of four to limit it. And a lot of the discard mechanisms only take effect after the minions, companions, allies and possessions have been played, meaning less than eight cards in hand. It&#8217;s important to remember that most players try to stick to around 30 cards a side to avoid clog, meaning the draw deck is around 50 cards after the starting companions have been played and the initial hand been drawn. Tossing 5 cards is 10% of the draw deck. Discarding from the draw deck is the other side of the coin, so to speak - to try and shift the opponents draw deck to their discard pile in the shortest time possible.<br>
<br>
ROTEL Sauron has some mighty powerful cards in this respect, and they go well with many already existing Sauron cards. Here&#8217;s the rundown:<br>
·His Cruelty and Malice: Such a nice card. Cheap and easy to play, and makes good use of any leftover minion vitality. All Sauron Orcs have at least 2 vitality, which is at least 1 card discarded. Most of the new ROTEL Orcs have more than 2. It all adds up. The largest Sauron Orc, Morgul Hunter, can toss 3 cards. If you play Tower Assassin, but there are no allies to kill, you can use his vitality to discard more cards. And it&#8217;s not a directly threatening card. It doesn&#8217;t wound or burden, so many players will likely save up their Secret Sentinels or Seen and Unseen for Under the Watching Eye or Orc Bowmen. The first time, at least. ;-)<br>
·Massing in the East: ROTEL has quite a few cards like this as well. If Hobbit companions also triggered it, it would have far more use. Once again, it not only costs twilight and an exertion and can only be used during the regroup phase, but it usually doesn&#8217;t discard more than one or two cards, with four being the absolute maximum. I had three of these in the pre-release tournament, and realized afterward the slots would have been better served with extra minions, even be those Isengard. Still, they do play to your theme, and the Boromir starter does have three, so you can use them until you get some better rare events, to help your deck keeps its shape.<br>
·Get Off the Road!: This card has serious potential. With ROTEL bringing out the Phial of Galadrial, the ring-bearer can have as many as 11 burdens. Who better to add burdens than Nazgul? 0 twilight cost, and no exertions. Add Eregion Hills and Desperate Defense of the Ring to add burdens. The amount of cards you could be discarding is immense. But more on this later.<br>
·Orc Warrior: A nice minion. 3 cost, 9 strength and 3 vitality, he&#8217;s useful just for skirmishes. His text can be difficult to trigger. But there are a lot of semi-redundant easily played Sauron conditions, and it&#8217;s a sweet deal if you can toss two of those for four cards from your opponents draw deck. But in the end, it just doesn&#8217;t quite fit into a dedicated discard deck, because of the slots used for the extra conditions. You could use one or two still, just to finish off your opponent&#8217;s draw deck and discarding cards like His Cruelty and Malice than are no longer useful when his deck is empty. Otherwise his vitality can be used to discard 2 cards via His Cruelty and Malice.<br>
<br>
A quick extra on Orc Warrior: Another potential Sauron deck is one that uses a lot of extra Sauron conditions. There are a few of new minions (Orc Guard & Orc Veteran) that have text similar to Orc Warrior that key off tossing conditions, and also Orc Butcher, who gets stronger with those conditions in play.<br>
<br>
Other cards<br>
7 cards out of the 19 new ROTEL Sauron cards are discard exclusive. But what must not be forgotten is that there are a few already existing pre-ROTEL Sauron cards that fit well into discard themed decks. Here&#8217;s a few of the best:<br>
·Orc Inquisitor: Already mentioned, he tosses a random card from hand when played. That&#8217;s a fair ability, but it&#8217;s his 9 strength and 3 vitality that really make him useful. Just beware of Old Noakes.<br>
·Tower Lieutenant: His text is triggered when he wins, discarding two cards from hand. He is unique and 4 cost, but a high 10 strength and once again 3 vitality. Again though, beware of Old Noakes. Though if all you&#8217;re going for is the win-discard, he&#8217;s a keeper.<br>
·Desperate Defense of the Ring: If played on key fighters, your opponent will quickly start discarding cards or face a corrupted ring-bearer. Best of all, it doesn&#8217;t trigger Old Noakes. It&#8217;s important to remember that the text is triggered straight after the assignment is made, so even if he has Hobbit Stealth, Hobbit Intuition or Gandalf&#8217;s Staff and the skirmish is cancelled, and whether you win or lose, your opponent will be adding a burden or discarding. A nifty little trick is to play both Desperate Defense of the Ring and Thin and Stretched on Frodo, so that whether Frodo fights or not, he takes a burden.<br>
·Desperate Measures: This goes well with Desperate Defense of the Ring. All those burdens you generate you can use to discard five cards from the draw deck. It may cost two, but you only need to spot a Sauron Orc and it plays during the maneuver phase, so you could play multiples off a lowly 1 cost 5 strength minion.<br>
·The Irresistible Shadow: One of only two instant corruption cards, and also one of the most powerful cards in the game. In my opinion the more powerful of the two, as it is a condition that can sit out of hand. Discarding your opponent&#8217;s draw deck is a very real possibility, and with Desperate Defense of the Ring and Eregion Hills, 5 burdens is not hard either. All it needs is a minion exertion, which with Sauron is always possible. One of the best things is that, unlike Despair, it&#8217;s not phase related. If the fifth burden is added during the fellowship phase, shadow phase, assignment phase, or skirmish phase, your opponent&#8217;s ring-bearer is immediately corrupted.<br>
·Orc Butchery: Its best attribute is that it is cheap. But discard decks generally aren&#8217;t geared toward killing companions. Still dead allies go to the dead pile, and Terrible as the Dawn and Tower Assassin can put a few there. Also, against multiple Hobbits, Orc Assassin is deadly, often getting an overwhelm. It has huge potential, because it is 3 cards discarded per card in the dead pile. You could build a shadow discard deck based purely on this and His Cruelty and Malice. Remember too that as a response, multiple copies could be triggered by the same event. Combined with exert-to-hurt minions, Hate, and Under the Watching Eye, your opponent could end up discarding around 20 cards or more from one companion&#8217;s death.<br>
·Southern Spies: Combined with Nazgul, this card can hurt. Nazgul get the ring on the finger well, and this 0 cost response can discard your opponent&#8217;s entire hand. Just remember that if he has Old Noakes out, playing this card could result in your Witch-king being discarded.<br>
<br>
Suggested decks<br>
The main reason I can think of for discard-from-hand being more popular than discard-from-draw deck is the fellowship side. For best results, you need your shadow and fellowship to play to the same strategy. The Elven discard fellowship using Far-seeing Eyes (thank goodness they are no longer stackable), The White Arrows of Lorien and The Mirror of Galadrial is by far the strongest. The only discard-from-draw deck fellowship you get is a Dwarven deck, using Dwarven Axes and Nobody Tosses a Dwarf. It relies on your Dwarves winning skirmishes, but so do most Dwarven decks.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see anyone combine the two. You can play 3 Elven archers in Legolas, Haldir and Arwen, all with The White Arrows, Galadrial and her Mirror, and Gimli (and possibly Fror for a boost versus Uruk-hai) as your Dwarven side. With Son of Gloin, all you need is the Dwarven Axe, and Shoulder to Shoulder to heal him. Once again, Nobody Tosses a Dwarf is a 0 cost response event that could all be triggered off the same win, besides the one discarded for every win. Also, Greatest Kingdom of Our People will toss a card for each Orc played, which helps against Moria, Sauron and the new Isengard sub-culture. Let Them Come and Lord of Moria will also help against those nasty regroup wounding Orcs. Grimir and Storm of Argument will allow you to recycle your Nobody Tosses a Dwarf. The deck has serious potential, but I don&#8217;t personally have enough cards to test it.<br>
<br>
On the shadow side, there are a number of combinations you could use. Personally, unless you have a sure-fire way to kill Old Noakes, I&#8217;d suggest you stick to discarding from your opponents draw deck. <br>
·Isengard/Sauron is strong and cheap. Uruk Ragers and Uruk Soldiers combined with Uruk-hai Swords can help discard cards. Also, if you want to add Tower Assassins to rid you of Old Noakes, you may as well add some Uruk Raiders, who will help kill off companions, or at least exhaust them so you can play Tower of Orthanc to add twilight.<br>
·Sauron on its own can be built around the already existing exert-to-hurt, Hate/Mordor&#8217;s Strength and Under the Watching Eye strategy, with added ally killing from Tower Assassins and Orc Assassins to kill off extra Hobbit companions. Possibly a common Balrog to overwhelm larger companions, a couple of You Bring Great Evil to prevent sanctuary healing and His Cruelty and Malice to make the most of your minions vitality. Then four Orc Butchery will be enough to discard hideous amounts of cards.<br>
·Nazgul/Sauron is another deck type with a lot of potential. It will play well with the new twilight Ulaire Otsea, with It Wants to Be Found and a couple of Blade Tips, Thin and Stretched, Desperate Defence of the Ring and Verily I Come will add heaps of burdens to Frodo. Desperate Measures and Get Off the Road can use those to discard cards, and The Irresistible Shadow to corrupt the ring-bearer and not have to try and outrun your opponent. Morgul Skulkers can recycle your Nazgul cards, and Too Great and Terrible can get rid of Gandalf and/or any Sleep, Caradhras your opponent may have been planning to use. Nazgul are also good at getting rid of archery (Wreathed in Shadow), archer companions (Relentless Charge, They Will Never Stop Hunting You) and annoying allies (Fear, Their Power is in Terror), as well as using Helpless to prevent Sam, Son of Hamfast removing burdens.<br>
<br>
Verily I Come was listed as being good for adding burdens. It&#8217;s good against Book of Mazarbul and other drawing schemes, but the main I&#8217;ve listed it for use against The Shards of Narsil and Gandalf&#8217;s Cart. Many players will see those cards as a way to avoid discard decks. But they may change their minds if every card the retake into hand adds a burden, as well as possibly twilight.<br>
<br>
Last mention goes to Eregion Hills. It adds a burden when the fellowship moves there, and is not a shadow card, so there&#8217;s no way the fellowship player can stop it. Useful for a couple of the listed cards.<br>
<br>
In summary, discard decks have always been around. They&#8217;ve always been powerful. With the new ROTEL Sauron cards, it&#8217;s just that much more powerful, and people are beginning to realize it. Hopefully I&#8217;ve helped to give a bit of a heads-up on the topic, and given you a few ideas so you can get the jump on your opponents. Most of the cards listed are either common-ish or not often used, and should be easy-ish to trade for.<br>
