<br>
Chapter 1: Introduction <br>
<br>
This article will be looking at minion and fellowship archery and the various ways a player has to deny as much of the damage as possible. It is quite a long article but hopefully will prove useful to players from wide ranging experience levels. Some of what has gone into this article will seem very basic, and a lot of it you could find out yourself if you went to Decipher and checked in the spoiler lists for the cards. Hopefully, however, you&#39;ll forgive me for this as I think this article brings the concepts behind archery and the cards you can use to help or hinder it together in an easily readable way. If you would like to go look at the spoiler lists on Decipher&#39;s website the web address is http://www.decipher.com/lordoftherings/cardlists/index.html. This may prove useful as I do not plan on going into every card in full detail so those who wish to know more about a specific card can look there. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 2: Free People&#39;s Archery <br>
<br>
This chapter will look at the cards that give the fellowship its archery total or may help boost that total. It also looks at the possibility of directed archery. <br>
<br>
2.1: Dwarves <br>
<br>
The Dwarves really didn&#39;t have much to do with archery in the Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) but the fact that Mr Cannon-Fodder...err, I mean &quot;Thrarin, Dwarven Smith&quot; is exerted to allow him to participate in skirmishes and archery fire made strange people like myself wonder what would be coming in Mines of Moria. And, lo, there came from the new set the &quot;Hand Axe&quot; so thoust may boost thy Dwarven strength and discard this possession to increase thy fellowship archery total by one. &quot;Make light of burdens&quot; can <br>
be used to rid a site of a weather condition such as &quot;Spies of Saruman&quot; which cancels the archery phase (mentioned in archery denial). OK, there we are, short and sweet, just like the Dwarves themselves. <br>
<br>
2.2: Elves <br>
<br>
When looking at Free People&#39;s archery the Elven culture is the main culture to go for. First and foremost is in this category is Legolas as he is automatically an archer whether you play the uncommon or the rare version. This companion is particularly potent in his rare form, &quot;Legolas, Greenleaf&quot;, as he can basically exert to wound a minion. Other elven companions may all be made into archers with the simple addition of an elven bow. Some elf allies are already archers, Orophin whom you can exert to wound Uruk-hai and Rumil who may be exerted to wound an orc. Both are site 6 allies and so can take part in ordinary (read non-directed) archery fire when at this site. Other elven allies can also be made into archers with elven bows and will then participate in archery at their home sites. You can create a very nasty barrage of archery using certain cards that enable allies to participate in archery and skirmishes, such as &quot;Support of the Last Homely House&quot; and &quot;Swan-ship of the Galadhrim&quot;. <br>
<br>
This isn&#39;t enough for you from the elven culture? Well then lets talk even cards and conditions. First condition I&#39;m going to mention isn&#39;t technically anything to do with archery. &quot;The Tale of Gil-galad&quot; is a card that is played on an elf and can be discarded for a strength boost but whilst on your elf gives them an extra point of vitality. This is very helpful for Legolas, Greenleaf and his directed archery ability. It could also come in useful for other exertion cards such as &quot;The Splendor of Their banners&quot; which plays on an elf. If the bearer of this card is an archer you may exert them to increase the fellowship archery total by one. The last card in this culture dealing with fellowship archery is the rare event card &quot;Double Shot&quot; where you spot an elf archer to raise the fellowship archery total by one. <br>
<br>
Other cards worth mentioning here include the cards &quot;The White Arrows of Lórien&quot; and &quot;Bow of the Galadhrim&quot; from FOTR and &quot;Dismay our Enemies&quot; from MoM. &quot;Bow of the Galadhrim&quot; was not mentioned earlier as Legolas, the only character who may bear this weapon, is an archer without this possession. The bonus it gives is extra strength to Legolas (+1) and the ability to wound a minion each time Legolas wins a skirmish. This can be extremely useful against Moria swarm decks. &quot;Dismay our Enemies&quot; is slightly better in that any elven archer winning a skirmish can force your opponent to discard a minion but as an event card you need to have it in your hand at the right time. Still there&#39;s nothing like the look of horror on your opponents face as they realise they have to discard their rare Balrog with all his toys because your Elven archer has won a skirmish against the sole little moria orc and the only minion left in play is the Balrog.  The &quot;White Arrows of Lórien&quot; is simply a discard ability card. Played as a condition on an elf it can be used to force an opponent to discard two cards at random from their hand. To do this the bearer must be an archer and able to exert, making it a relatively nice card but not essential to a deck. <br>
<br>
2.3: Gandalf <br>
<br>
There is nothing, nothing...but hey he has staffs and Glamdring does he really need a bow? Of course he could help you directed archery by playing &quot;Strength of Spirit&quot; to prevent the necessary exertion. <br>
<br>
2.4: Gondor <br>
<br>
In this culture we again have only a small amount of archery in the form of Aragorn&#39;s Bow. This makes Aragorn an archer and also allows him to exert to do direct damage. There is also an event card &quot;One whom men would follow&quot; that brings an ally into archery and skirmishes. A card I mention in a purely technical way is &quot;The Saga of Elendil&quot; which can be used in the same way as &quot;The Tale of Gil-galad&quot; but on Aragorn. &quot;Boromir&#39;s cloak&quot; is another card that can technically be useful for fellowship archery if your opponent plays &quot;Spies of Saruman&quot;, which is covered later in this article. To remove this weather condition exert Boromir and enable archery again. <br>
<br>
2.5: Shire <br>
<br>
A culture with no fellowship archery total, maybe Hobbits are just too small to hold a bow... <br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 3: Shadow Archery <br>
<br>
Looking at the cards that add something to the shadow archery total. <br>
<br>
3.1: Isengard <br>
<br>
There are two archers from this culture both of whom came from the first set of cards. These minions, Lurtz and the Orthanc Assassin, are both nasty enough without the added bonus of archery. <br>
<br>
3.2: Moria <br>
<br>
Moria started out with two archers in FOTR. The &quot;Goblin Archer&quot; is one and has a low strength but higher than average vitality for a Moria minion and can also play a part in archery denial. The second, the &quot;Goblin Marksman&quot;, has a higher strength but its low vitality make it a possible victim of fellowship archery. This culture benefited the most in terms of archery from the MoM set with three new archer minions. First up we have &quot;Archer Commander&quot; who boosts the shadow archery and at the same time gives a +2 strength bonus to any other Moria archer. This possible strength bonus is definitely helpful for the &quot;Goblin Archer&quot; and another newbie to the fray, the &quot;Goblin Bowman&quot;. &quot;Goblin Bowman&quot; is really just there as a cheap archer with only 4 strength and 1 vitality he&#39;s not likely to do much else, and of course can fall prey to the fellowships own archers. The big guys of the new archer minions are the &quot;Moria Archer Troop&quot;, not only do they come at strength 8 with 3 vitality but you just have to spot another Moria archer to add another one to the shadow archery total. This means that with two of these minions out you have a minion archery total of four. :: Steeples her fingers in front of her, smiling sinisterly :: Excellent. <br>
<br>
3.3 Ringwraith <br>
<br>
The only shadow culture without archery, instead of throwing arrows around they give you blade tip and black breath. Archery added to these conditions would just be too nasty. Maybe I should look at a mixed culture deck just for that. <br>
<br>
3.4: Sauron <br>
<br>
The final shadow culture, alphabetically, does have a small amount of archery power provided by a card from the first set. &quot;Orc Bowman&quot; is a condition that adds 1 to the minion archery total if you can spot a Sauron Orc. Not bad but not exactly brilliant. Stack four of these conditions and you have a possible four archery wounds for your opponent&#39;s fellowship to think about. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 4: Shadow Archery Denial <br>
<br>
This chapter looks at ways the free people&#39;s side of your deck may prevent archery wounds. Unlike the previous chapters this section did not seem to lend itself to being separated out into culture so I&#39;ve tried to place everything together in other ways. One form of archery denial is simply to prevent the wound; another way is what I consider true archery denial. That is the use of events, possessions or conditions that bring down the minion archery total. True archery denial for the fellowship can be seen in a few places from FOTR and some cards from MoM. <br>
<br>
4.1: Dwarves <br>
<br>
No true anti-archery is available to this culture, which makes them vulnerable unless you use some other form of archery denial or have a good way to heal your Dwarf companions.   By this I mean there are no shields or such like that you can play whilst only playing the Dwarven culture, you can always play a mixed culture, maybe an Elven ally in order to play a cloak (see later in the article).  There is also the card &quot;Here Lies Balin, Son of Fundin&quot; which can be used during manoeuvre phase, oh alright &quot;maneuver&quot; phase, to rid yourself of pesky orcs, including archers.  Whilst not technically a specific anti-archery card it can be used to remove some of the minion archery total.<br>
<br>
4.2: Elves <br>
<br>
From MoM came a new Elven card that fits here nicely and this is Hosts of the Last Alliance. Not only may this card be discarded to prevent a wound to an elf, whilst this condition is in your support area and you can spot an Elf companion the minion archery total is -1, this is something I consider to be true archery denial. The elves have elven cloaks that may be placed on any companion giving a permanent -1 to minion archery. Also from this culture comes the event card Lightfootedness where all you need is an elf companion to bring the minion archery total down by one. <br>
<br>
4.3: Gandalf <br>
<br>
From Gandalf&#39;s Culture comes &quot;Intimidate&quot;, spotting Gandalf to prevent a wound on any companion is a useful trick in many settings. There is only one more possible form of archery denial for the fellowship and that is shown by Sleep, Caradhras. This event exerts Gandalf to discard all conditions, good for removal of any annoying shadow conditions including Orc Bowman but not really useful in a condition heavy fellowship strategy. <br>
<br>
4.4: Gondor <br>
<br>
From Gondor comes the Great Shield, the bearer of this possession must be a Man (personally I think they should clarify this. Do they mean male, a Gondor companion, or a male Gondor companion? Ill have to look at the reprints to if its been changed) and like the elven cloak this gives permanent -1 to the minion archery total. <br>
<br>
Ah says you Then why not always play the elven cloak as they can be played on any companion? <br>
<br>
Eek! I reply Because I forgot to mention you must spot an Elf in order to play the cloak and I suppose that not everyone will play an Elf. <br>
<br>
Looking at the new MoM set we find two new archery denial cards for the Gondor culture. Natural Cover requires a ranger and a forest in order to be active. Well if youre playing a ranger style deck this shouldnt be too much of a problem although forests are a lot harder to come by. If these game text stipulations can be met this condition brings the minion archery total down by two. Plus it can be cumulative, have four of these cards out and see the minion archery total diminish by eight. Very nice if facing lots of minion archers but also very specific and it wont help you at site 4 or 5 which are never forests or at Brown Lands should your opponent have placed this as site 8. (Sites are covered in more detail later in this article.) As this is likely to be the place you need archery denial most the card seems a little less worthy of a place in your deck. <br>
<br>
Shield of Boromir is a unique possession that may be played on any Gondor companion and provides permanent -1 protection from the minion archery total. As an added bonus play it on Boromir to watch any minion facing him lose the strength bonus from weapons they are carrying. <br>
<br>
4.5: Shire <br>
<br>
Not entirely within the shire culture but as only Hobbits may be ring bearers so far I have placed The One Ring under this section. With &quot;The One Ring, Isildur&#39;s Bane&quot; you can put on the ring and place 2 burdens instead. Definitely not my favourite idea but in a 1vs1 game you are unlikely to be facing and archery and corruption deck so I mention it as a possibility. &quot;Nice Imitation&quot; from the MoM Shire culture is another wound prevention card and as it is a condition you can simply play it to your support area until you need to discard it and prevent a wound. This makes it a very nice wound prevention card so it is not surprising that Decipher made it specific to Hobbits, they had to do something to keep Gandalf&#39;s cards in play. <br>
<br>
&quot;Orc Bane&quot; is a nice rare to come out of the MoM set, it allows you to spot either Sting or Glamdring and exert the bearer to wound orcs or uruk-hai.  Now this can be placed under Gandalf seeing as Glamdring is obviously Gandalf&#39;s weapon, but it&#39;s not as the card is all green and has the little hobbit leaf in the top right corner.  Anyway where was I?  Oh that&#39;s right exert to wound, and this event takes place in the maneuver stage just like &quot;Here Lies Balin, Son of Fundin.&quot;  So if you use it to kill orc archers it will remove them from the minion archery total.<br>
<br>
The final card I mention is Mithril-coat from MoM, this is an armour artefact that plays on Frodo and also gives a permanent -1 to the minion archery total and stops strength bonuses from weapons for any minion facing him at the same time as taking away any damage bonuses they may have. An all round nice card and as, unless something has gone wrong, everyone is playing with Frodo in their fellowship Id say this card could be a staple in any deck. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 5: Fellowship Archery Denial <br>
<br>
Looking at the denial of fellowship archery and archery wound prevention possible for your shadow side. <br>
<br>
5.1: Isengard <br>
<br>
Isengard were given a few nice anti-archery cards in the first set of LOTR cards. Sarumans Power works in a similar way to Sleep, Caradhras discarding all conditions when an Isengard minion is exerted. It suffers from the same problem of not being useful in a condition heavy deck strategy but it would remove any of the conditions that help the fellowship archery such as The Splendor of their Banners and The Tale of Gil-galad. Spies of Saruman is a weather condition hat plays on a site by exerting an Isengard minion and prevents the archery phase. Another good card for this culture is Uruk-hai Armory which is an archery denial condition that can be used cumulatively. For each copy of this card you have in your support area the fellowship archery total is -1 whilst you can spot an Uruk-hai. Their arrows enrage allows a greater likelihood of a skirmish win against an archer by making all fellowship archers strength -1 whilst an Uruk-hai is in active play, and its a condition so it stays in your support area and can be cumulative. Caradhras has not forgiven us is a nice weather condition to use when the fellowship have five or more companions. Look for those exhausted direct archers and exert an Uruk-hai to discard them. It works for any exhausted companion but I think the archers are asking for it. <br>
<br>
5.2: Moria <br>
<br>
Moria has the possibility of discarding the Goblin Armory condition to prevent a wound to a Moria orc, though it may be better to take the wound and keep this condition in play for its twilight accumulation abilities. The Goblin Archer makes the fellowship archery total -6 whilst you can spot another Moria Orc and the Goblin Wallcrawler brings the fellowship archery total down by one under the same conditions. Moria also has the condition Pinned Down which lowers the fellowship archery total by one if a Moria archer can be seen, great if you are playing a Moria archer strategy deck. Then we have Bitter Hatred which is played as an archery ability when you can spot a Moria archer and it allows you to wound an Elf companion. If you make Legolas the target of this card you can prevent some of that direct archery damage, or if hes already done too much direct damage and is exhausted you can kill him. Unfamiliar Territory is an event card that boosts the strength of your Moria orc by four if facing an archer in a skirmish and may help you to kill some of those fellowship archers. This is, I must admit, a rather permanent form of archery denial. <br>
<br>
MoM brought with it some new archery denial possibilities including the common Balrog. Whilst this minion is out the archery phase is skipped. The rare Balrog does not have this feature but there is the condition Fill with fear which causes the archery phase to be skipped if the Balrog is in play and has the added anti-archery effect of allowing you to exert the Balrog in order to discard a ranged weapon. This could seriously hurt the fellowships archery, especially if Aragorns bow is removed taking away his possible directed archery. Also seen with the advent of the MoM set is the Cave Trolls Chain, when played on your Cave Troll this possession boosts his strength and forces the fellowship player to decide whether or not to skip the archery phase. If they do not any wound taken by the Cave Troll during archery allows you to wound an archer companion. If you place all the wounds in archery on your Cave Troll, no matter how many archers were creating the fellowships archery total you can place the wounds all on one or two archer companions. This gives a high possibility of killing those archers.   Plus if you have &quot;Relics of Moria&quot; in your support area you can pull this lovely weapon back when you need it.<br>
<br>
5.3: Ringwraith <br>
<br>
The Ringwraiths have several cards that may be used to counteract archery. To prevent a wound you may play the event All blades perish. Along with the twilight Nazgûl in MoM came the condition card His Terrible Servants that enables you to remove one twilight to prevent a wound on a twilight Nazgûl. Wreathed in Shadow is a condition that allows the removal of one twilight token during the archery phase to make the fellowship archery total -1. If you want to wound every archer companion you can use the event Relentless Charge and exert one of your Nazgûl. This is a very nasty card and can help prevent directed archery or kill an archer companion who is already exhausted. <br>
<br>
Beauty is Fading is an expensive card to play but if you do so and exert a Nazgûl you can remove any Free Peoples possession from play. If that wasnt enough whilst you cannot spot any possessions you may use this condition to discard an ally or companion (except the ringbearer). You may prefer to rid yourself of someone like Aragorn, a good companion to discard especially when he has his bow, or any other archer present. Stricken Dumb is a card that appeared in MoM that isnt quite as nice as Beauty is Fading but then it doesnt cost as much to play. In order to play this card you exert the Witch-king and then you can discard a weapon or a tale. So any bow or archery beneficial tale can be removed. <br>
<br>
Ùlairë Cantëa, Lieutenant of Dol Guldur can be exerted to discard a weapon borne by a character he is skirmishing as can Ùlairë Lemenya when holding his sword Sword of Minas Morgul. When playing a mixed culture shadow strategy some of the archery allies may be even more annoying than when playing a purely Ringwraith shadow strategy, there are several ways in which the Ringwraith culture may be useful in countering this problem. Fear is used to discard an ally and Their Power is in Terror can be used to exert every ally preventing special archery abilities and the use of support cards such as Swan-ship or last homely house in some cases. Ùlairë Attëa, The Easterling from MoM wounds an ally when played and may exhaust or kill that ally. <br>
<br>
5.4: Sauron <br>
<br>
Sauron does not have any cards that are straightforward archery denial but several cards can become so if used in the right way. Curse from Mordor spots a Sauron orc to discard an elven condition and Shadows Reach is played by exerting a Sauron orc to discard a Free Peoples condition, Splendor of their Banners springs to mind here. Hate and A host avails little are direct damage cards that enable you to wound a companion. Again I believe that directed archery ability may have been overused enough for you to use these cards to give you a kill. In MoM comes a card called Memory of Many Things which lets you exert a Sauron orc to discard an ally, or two allies if both are elves. Now you may want to rid yourself of other allies but this card covers the elven archers. Another nice card in the Sauron culture from FOTR if you need some extra twilight and your opponent is playing with lots of archers is Mordor enraged. Simply play this card on your Sauron orc and exert the bearer to add twilight for each archer companion. Now you can put that extra twilight to good use and try and kill some of those companions. <br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Sites and archery <br>
<br>
For archery denial there is one site worth mentioning and that is Anduin Wilderland (FOTR common site 7), which skips the archery phase. This site is a virtual must for Moria swarm decks (although Anduin Confluence is good for removing those Bounders) and may now see some use in fellowship strategies. This site was never really seen as necessary in the past the new minion archery possibilities from MoM have made this site more appealing to fellowships that dont use archery themselves. <br>
<br>
Any of the sites that aid archery fire help on the side of the minions. The first site I would put in my 9 if I were playing a minion archer strategy is Brown Lands (site 8). This site from the first set of cards adds one to the minion archery total for each archer minion. Of course they put a limit on this, but at a limit of four you can still have a minion archery total of ten or over. If you can get out several Goblin Bowman and Moria Archer Troop you can watch your archery total rocket upwards. Ive played this site with a couple of Moria Archer Troop and a few Bowmen (requiring a total of 18 twilight, foolish people allowing that much to build into the pool) and had a minion archery total of eleven. This is of course not always going to be the case but Ive never had a minion archery total of less than six here. Another possible site 8 from the first set is Anduin Banks. This site is good to use in a non-moria deck, especially good in a Sauron deck that is already playing Orc Bowman. For every companion over four at this site, a very welcome boost to wounding in almost any deck. Dimrill Dale (site 6) can be helpful purely for the -2 twilight cost of the first Moria orc played each shadow phase. <br>
<br>
The one site to come out of MoM that should be a staple in a Moria archer deck is Great Chasm. This site gives you a little extra twilight to play with at site 4 with a cost of four to move here. It then helps you out even further by allowing you to play your first Moria archer each shadow phase for -2 twilight. Now bear in mind youve just moved to your home site so this is a great boon. You could play a Goblin Bowman for free and then decide how to spend the rest later. <br>
<br>
<br>
Chapter 6: Strategies and Conclusion <br>
<br>
Possible fellowship archery strategies have been tried and tested from elven archers through elf/ranger to ARV/ranger archery decks. MoM hasnt really put much of a new spin on things although you may wish to use some of the new events and conditions for any archery deck involving elves. The only real difference is with the Dwarves, a good Dwarven strategy will undoubtedly involve hand axes for their strength bonus and use with cards such as Axe Strike and Flurry of Blows. You shouldnt forget the possibility of doing some damage by discarding these possessions during archery. You never know when it might make all the difference. Throw them at the twilight Witch-king to prevent him exerting to wound the ringbearer. Or maybe use them to rid yourself of some Moria minions to prevent that overwhelm. They are a good addition to a deck strategy that may not include other fellowship archery. Id say that fellowship archery is still one of the strongest Free Peoples strategies. <br>
<br>
On the shadow side, wow, what a change for Moria, lets hear it for those archers. The MoM set has done a lot for minion archery, making it a viable shadow strategy for the Moria Culture. Before this set came out I would normally have foregone any Moria archers either using another shadow culture strategy or the Moria swarm idea instead. Strategy wise if you are going to play with a Moria Archery deck you need to stick to it and be ultra-specific. Do you really want that Balrog?  The Balrog is very nice and could find a way into many an archery deck, and no you don&#39;t have to have any other Balrog cards but if you&#39;re playing the rare version, you may well want to get Fill with Fear down. This is a big problem for archery decks on either side. Add to this the fact he can be stealthed by a Hobbit or have the skirmish cancelled by Gandalf Id say he just isnt always worth playing in an archery focused shadow side. Youd need his toys to come along to be sure of any damage and you just cant afford that deck space.  In certain strategies he may work but with archery you may find that you are stuck with only your high cost archers in hand making playing the Balrog harder, unless you use the common and then you have a one turn throughput stopper. Of course if you don&#39;t play him you can always discard him at a later point to help you use &quot;They are coming&quot;. <br>
<br>
Stick to the basics, stick to your archers, and put in ways of adding twilight as youll want it to bring all your archers out. Goblin Runners are good for this in any deck.  Try some Goblin Armory cards with scimitars to place on your archers. This way you can add twilight, increase your minions strength and allow yourself to draw a card in one nice combo. Host of thousands and They are coming are good for bringing back archers youve already discarded.  You can also use &quot;Goblin Swarms to stack any of your orcs that win skirmishes.  Sometimes you have to guess whether your opponent is going to move again or not but if they&#39;ve reached their move limit this is a great way of ensuring that you have more minions to play on them.  Using &quot;Goblin Domain&quot; to make your opponent play exhausted companions at site 4 and over is great for your archers. Relics of Moria pulls back your scimitars if necessary.  Playing Pinned Down will help to counteract fellowship archery.  In this sort of deck you have to plan ahead, if you are going to try running for it you need to be using a site replacement strategy.  If you have no site playing strategy you want to be second in a 1vs1 game in order to get your sites down, only really good if you&#39;re sure of a kill or enough of a slow down to allow you to push ahead in the final stages.  Multiplayer is a whole different matter but archery is still a good bet for your shadow side. <br>
<br>
Personally Ive tried playing archery based strategies for both my fellowship and shadow sides and it has worked quite well. Ill let you decide whether you want to play with either, after all when it comes down to it you have to decide and build the deck yourself. I hope that this article has perhaps helped you with the decision and understanding of archery within the game, especially since the release of MoM. Id like to thank everyone who made it all the way to the end of this piece, I hope you didnt find it overlong.  I&#39;d also like to thank all those who commented on this article on GPN, I hope you&#39;ll see that the comments have been acted on and incorporated into the article. <br></font><BR><font class="bfont"> <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php?id=3656&view=1'>Read the Reviews</a><font class="bfont"> | <A HREF='/lotr/articles/articles.php'>Back to List</A></font><p><font class="bfont"> <b>You must be a member to contribute to Decktech.</b>  <p>Please <a href='/lotr/main/join.php'> become a registered member</a></font></font></td><td background="/lotr/gfx/mom/whi_09.gif"></td></tr>
