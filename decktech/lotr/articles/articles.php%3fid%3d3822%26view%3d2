<br>
Let&#39;s dive in:<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarves</b><br>
Contrary to what you might think, Dwarves actually get a rather big boost in this set, and all from a not-obvious-at-first-sight card, but I will delve into that later. First, we examine the new Dwarven deck-type possible, and the &#39;internal&#39; Dwarven cards. You have heard of the Hobbit Hospital, now brace yourself for the...Dwarven Doctors.<br>
<br>
They lie in 2 new conditions: A Royal Welcome and Mines of Khazad-dum. Mines is a solid choice for any Dwarf deck reliant on Gloin and Bilbo singing tales, and A Royal Welcome really shines in that it is now possible for a somewhat weaker &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot; style to transfer wounds away from companions, and as you will see later, it combos exceptionally well with the card I will reveal to you later.<br>
<br>
The 2 new tales are also a boost. Song of Durin virtually blows Stairs of Khazad-dum apart in the anti-Moria department, unless you are planning to kill the Cave Troll and/or the Balrog (which in my opinion is too long to set up and too unproductive). The Book has already been immortalised in the League Kit, with its massive card-draw capability and ability to work round the Rule of 4. Definitely at least 2 in every deck.<br>
<br>
Now comes the card you have been waiting for.......<b>Elrond, Herald to Gil-Galad</b>, whose influence on the Dwarves beats Bilbo, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit in MoM by a long mile. First off, note that unlike Lord of Rivendell, he does not require an Elf or Gandalf to be spotted, allowing him to be played immediately in the customary Gimli-Gloin start. His heal-twice works wonders with himself and Grimir, who you might need often for A Royal Welcome. And his text is solid, regroup phase healing. Combine with A Royal Welcome (ALSO regroup phase healing), Till Durin Wakes Again and Mines of Khazad-dum and you have a very serious healing machine.<br>
<br>
But that is not even half of it! Take another look at <b>Vilya</b>. On first sight, it might not look well but in truth, I have found both Vilya and Nenya to be wonderful in playtesting. But back to Vilya, it gives 1 vitality, which allows you to use both of Elrond&#39;s abilities (one more of course with Vilya) twice at once sometimes, but the focus is on Vilya&#39;s text.<br>
<br>
It single-handedly almost seals up the Dwarves&#39; glaring weakness: the Nazgul.<br>
<br>
In past sets, the Dwarves got pushed around by Nazgul as they were not tooled to fight them and once they lost skirmishes, the Tips and Breaths would fly and Bilbo could not remove them as they would be on the companion, not on the support area, and Make Light of Burdens plain sucked. With Vilya however, you can bounce the Blade Tips and Black Breaths on your companions back and if you manage to do it twice in one turn, you can even seriously choke his hand (if he&#39;s smart, he&#39;ll discard them. If he&#39;s not, he&#39;ll keep trying to play them each shadow phase and engage in a hopelessly losing ping-pong match). And it&#39;s not just restricted to Nazgul. Against Isengard, it can get rid of key annoying conditions like Snows, Wizard Storm and such, and bounce back that Trapped and Alone in time for your Dwarves to CHARGE and kill those Orcs. Against Moria, it can bounce back that Swarms before your opponent&#39;s massive Orc horde reaches you or it can bounce back that Goblin Armory or 2 in time for Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe and the next-mentioned card to go through. Against Sauron, it can dump a Bowmen to prevent key damage. Combined with Bilbo, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit, they are the ultimate anti-condition team.<br>
<br>
The last card on the list. As we all know, Dwarves are really only good in protecting themselves, which leaves Frodo vulnerable if he is reached by an Orc, and thus Dwarven decks of the past used to include Frodo-only stuff like Mithril-Coat, Sting, PATHS and Bounder. Now, DUMP THEM ALL. All you need is Isildur&#39;s Bane and <b>Frying Pan</b>. As aforementioned, it is really only the Orcs that can get through to Frodo. If the Uruks or Nazgul do, your Dwarves simply didn&#39;t do a good job. If so, Frying Pan simply embodies everything its predecessors combined to do and a Moria swarm, Sauron Site 9 swarm and Isengard oops-I-swarmed-you can fall apart, combined with Gimli&#39;s Battle Axe.<br>
<br>
I personally have been amazed at the boost of the Dwarves, and it is mainly due to Elrond and his Ring. True, you are giving those Moria Scouts an Elf to spot, but it is better to weaken yourself a little against Moria to almost totally negate your weakness against Nazgul. And if anything, Song of Durin makes your opponent pay for his swarm, and it is not cheap at all.<br>
<br>
<b>Elves</b><br>
As is obvious, they perhaps receive the greatest boost in the set. In this section, I will concentrate mainly on archery, their benchmark, and just look at the vast number of new deck-types possible with the Elves.<br>
<br>
Courtesy of Ben, <b>Pipeweed Archery</b>. All based around Frodo&#39;s Pipe. Spot X to heal a companion with the Frodo signet X times. Know what that screams? Yep, Legolas Greenleaf and Aragorn, Heir of the White City with his trusty Bow. Combined with Aragorn&#39;s Pipe, you can simply just shoot every turn and heal it off every turn. Arwen can be excluded entirely from this deck and her starting companion position replaced by Gimli, whose Pipe is another worthy addition. For this deck, all the Pipes you really need are Frodo&#39;s, Aragorn&#39;s and Gimli&#39;s. In fact, a denial element can be added with The Gaffer&#39;s Pipe adding to the reductive abilities of Aragorn, Heir of the White City, No Stranger to the Shadows and Gimli, Dwarf of the Mountain-Race. Definitely one deck to consider.<br>
<br>
Again courtesy of Ben, <b>The Countryside</b>. So you have read the Second Look on Decipher&#39;s site concerning Shire Countryside. But Narya? What about...4 Songs of the Blessed Realm and 4 Shire Countrysides (a little overshooting but you get the idea)? The text of both cards are cumulative. Picture this, play a Last Alliance, remove 4 burdens, remove 4 wounds! And another beauty of the deck. In a skirmish, play Voice of Nimrodel (a tale) and you can immediately heal your archers exhausted from the archery phase! And look at it again. Play House of Elrond for Site 3 and you just used a sanctuary without ever passing it! And if you run out of burdens to remove? What about using PATHS to add those burdens on yourself! Or use Isildur&#39;s Bane and get Frodo whacked.<br>
<br>
Also new, but not so original are the respective Site 3 and Site 6 decks. Do not even try mixing Site 3 Elven protectors with Site 6 Elven protectors. You&#39;ll never have space.<br>
<br>
As for cards worthy of mention. Vilya, as mentioned before, is a powerhouse in ways you will never expect, and is compatible with any version of Elrond, though perhaps more suited to Herald of Gil-Galad as you will be compromising on Lord of Rivendell&#39;s drawing capability. Nenya, seeming inadequate, is a powerhouse in card-advantage. I have used Nenya while pondering the double-move against Nazgul and drew A Ranger&#39;s Versatility, and I have dumped 2 redundant Fellowship cards to fix up my hand for my next Shadow phase. And both add 1 vitality to their bearers, which in itself is extremely useful.<br>
<br>
Herald to Gil-Galad is a wonder, not just in Dwarven decks but in Elven decks, notably the Site 3-Protector deck. Lady of the Golden Wood however, is much more limited in use. She can only find space in an archery deck utilising Galadriel purely for the Mirror and nothing else. Do not forget that she heals Legolas Greenleaf. I also am at the conclusion that Long-Knives + Bow may be fun, but a little overrated. You won&#39;t find space for it in a normal archery deck with the more useful toys for your other main companions, and unless you&#39;re going to put more than 1 of each copy, it&#39;s going to take very long to set up. And once it does, what then? So you are 8 strength against Nazgul (11 with Prince of Mirkwood), can beat 9-strength Orcs and 9-strength Uruks. Big deal! As can be seen, 8 strength against nazgul is nothing. 9-strength Orcs are more in the Sauron category but this is rather redundant. As for Moria Orcs, why beat up the Scavenger to kill the Runner when you can beat up the Runner to kill the Scavenger? As for Uruks...you think to win and he flashes that Savagery and suddenly, your Fellowship is half-dead. It does look promising against Isengard Orcs however.<br>
<br>
<b>Gandalf</b><br>
I feel Narya is not much to be excited about except that it gives Gandalf 1 more vitality, giving him a total possibility of 6. This is certainly useful as he is been preyed regularly on by Sauron and Moria. And it combos well with one more new card, Deep in Thought. And you thought Sleep was broken? Give him loads of twilight and use Narya for a little help and make him unable to use it up. Or even better, use twilight-intensive maneuver events like ARV to boost it up yourself! The trick here is your opponent must use up all the twilight or not use any at all so that the maneuver phase is skipped, and both definitely suit you.<br>
<br>
The <b>Gandalf-Hobbit</b> deck is now possible with the advent of Depart Silently. Its use is amazing. From Site 1 to 5, let Gandalf take on all of them and swish his Staff, then later, it can prove a blessing at Site 9. But don&#39;t let it be your life. If you do not possess Gandalf&#39;s Staff, bringing all of them up on Gandalf...well. And don&#39;t use so much of it that you get choked with Stealths and Intuitions. The first part of the text of each of those cards means you cannot use them even if the Hobbits are not in a skirmish in the first 4 or 5 sites.<br>
<br>
Hobbit start is definitely better than Gandalf as Buckleberry Ferry can be taken advantage of and it boosts card-efficiency. Pippin, usually the odd one out can actually be of some use now with Mr. Took. As for Gandalf, as you are always playing with just Hobbits, use The Grey Pilgrim as Friend of the Shirefolk will only be at strength 7. Gandalf and his spells are definitely a big boost to any deck and this set allows him to aid the Hobbits.<br>
<br>
<b>Gondor</b><br>
Also a big boost. Aragorn, Heir to the White City and Boromir, Defender of Minas Tirith seem to go together hand-in-hand the way KiE and LoG did. They can be used widely in Gondor-Men denial, emphasising the main aspect and even include the Horn of Boromir to ensure a safe passage. And to get even more nasty, We Must Go Warily is definitely the perfect complement to Deft in Their Movements, in addition to No Stranger to the Shadows, Bill the Pony and A Talent For Not Being Seen, and Citadel of Minas Tirith can provide some key healing against traditional enemies like Sauron.<br>
<br>
The Shards of Narsil is also an interesting card, allowing you to stock up on key events to the time where they would be key and fulfil their use to the greatest. Extra copies of Aragorn or Boromir can be stacked for a &#39;hidden&#39; Gondor Athelas, Valiant Man/Elendil&#39;s Valor/Banner of the White Tree (don&#39;t like Banner) can be saved for Site 9 for the last hurrah. Not versatile in the Bridge of Khazad-dum? Hide it under your Shards. No pursuit yet? Pursuit Just Behind later then. And who knows, maybe you can stick Change of Plans underneath and with Sting find opponent&#39;s hand to be too good? CHANGE CHANGE CHANGE! The possibilities are endless.<br>
<br>
<b>Shire</b><br>
Much has been elaborated in the Gandalf section. There are a few more, though. Frying Pan is a godsend to those decks which do not have room for Frodo-personal-Secret-Service. They have a new Tale for Bilbo, Well-Spoken Gentlehobbit (though most decks might now switch to Gandalf for condition-removal): Three Monstrous Trolls is anti-Moria.<br>
<br>
<b>Isengard</b><br>
First off, the Orcs introduce a whole new gaming level. You&#39;d better defeat them in skirmishes or wound them or the regroup phase, often skipped, will be a pain. Those Orcs can use their ability, Come for the Ring, wound you once more, then show you that the Trees are Strong to cap it all off. Key in this deck is Saruman, Servant of the Eye, who is extremely powerful for a common. He can pick off those exhausted companions, and if unable to , can often inflict some cheap &#39;wounds&#39; and in its first few days of legal play, expect to see this scenario:<br>
<br>
Saruman: Legolas 2-Backside, come meet Mr. Overseer.<br>
Legolas: No thanks.<br>
Saruman: No? Hmm.......then.....COME!<br>
Legolas: Argh, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>
<br>
Isengard Warrior is absolutely lethal and totally removes the need for Spies of Saruman. Unless your opponent somehow gets rid of him in the maneuver phase, you can direct archery wounds to him, unless of course your opponent&#39;s Ringbearer has 3 wounds, which in case, he does well if he survives. In fact, he can see use in a Sauron deck. Though the first part of his text is redundant, if he survives...we all know how easily Sauron can get 3 wounds on the Ring-bearer.<br>
<br>
And also, Site 8 - Anduin Banks, Site 9 - Wastes of Emyn Muil is downright nasty. Later on, some people might catch on and try to kill their worthless companions off with Banks to prevent you the luxury of picking the good ones off at the Wastes but until then, enjoy the sheer horror.<br>
<br>
Do note that they cannot usually kill Frodo off in the Regroup Phase unless your opponent uses the Ruling Ring and has to assign wounds with companions exhausted or dead, but must beat him in skirmishes, and thus they can only be built to slow, never to kill. With this respect, Wizard Storm is also a good choice. A Fell Voice on the Air can help for &#39;Weather&#39; decks.<br>
<br>
As for Uruks, they have Saruman, Keeper of Isengard, to make the Uruks literally TWICE as nasty, and also removes the need for Spies of Saruman, and allows you to use Slopes of Amon Hen to play a horde of Uruks who are fierce to boot. It is a toss-up between which to go for, but it has to be Keeper. Servant of the Eye, however, can be awesome in a deck centric around Worry-Can You Protect Me From Yourself?. If the exhaustion goes through, Saruman punishes Aragorn. If it does not and the 2 burdens does....Bring on Enquea and Orthanc Berserker, where in both cases you can simply exhaust a companion and finish them off with Saruman if you ever have the godly amounts of twilight. Care has to be taken to use Uruk Scout to protect Saruman, if possible, though.<br>
<br>
<b>Nazgul</b><br>
What little there is to be said of them has all been elaborated in the Decipher Second Looks. One thing, though. Otsea can&#39;t win skirmishes without help. If he does, it is early on, and your Blade Tip may not be out yet.<br>
<br>
<b>Moria</b><br>
Just look at the number of anti-Moria cards in this set (mention to Betrayal of Isengard, first part of the text does not require to use Gandalf). They have taken a falling. Depths of Moria is perfect for punishing double-moves along with Goblin Flankers and Hide and Seek can cause the surprise death of a companion. Malice can be used for the rarely-seen and unstable Sauron-Moria Archery deck to complement Hate and to reduce its vulnerability against archery.<br>
<br>
<b>Sauron</b><br>
They have not had much to add towards their Direct Damage capability, only to Overwhelm and Discard. For Overwhelm, an Orc Banner deck can be used to great effect with the new Orcs: check out a deck I posted, Enduring Evil of Orc Banners. For Discard, there are new engines which seem to work, though discard still seems a little random for this game yet. They can definitely deck an opponent much quicker now, discarding from hand and deck very fiercely.<br>
<br>
Interesting among the additions is Orc Guard. For the measly cost of 1, he can break down Combo-decks. Experiment.<br>
<br>
Orc Slayer and Morgul Slayer are simply not worth it. The only way they are going to avoid archery wounds and skirmish death is if you have more minions than their companions and how often do we see that with Sauron? In Site 9, yes, but don&#39;t forget, the game ends in the Regroup phase. Total thrash until some Sauron-Regroup-Healing card is released. Enduring Evil can help them survive, but there is often not enough density in a Direct Damage deck to concentrate fully on the devastating effects of Enduring Evil.<br>
<br>
