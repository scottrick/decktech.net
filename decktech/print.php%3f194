<h2>decktech.net</h2><b>location of article:</b> <hr>New Virtual Cards for Star Wars posted by DeckTech on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Well, seems like Star Wars may be on the comeback trail.  Interest is picking up again, no doubt, and the DPC's are being well attended.  At 33 players in Vegas, Star Wars is really looking strong through the rest of the year.  Top Players like Brian Hunter, Matt Lush, Clint Hays and Hayes Hunter have vowed to continue playing, and it seems even some newer players are taking advantage of the cheap prices to pick up sets at next to nothing.<br>
<br>
So without further ado, here is the latest set of Virtual Cards.  Enjoy<br>

Interest here in Atlanta has definetly picked up.<hr>Justin Stratton said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>Great news for all SW:CCG players!  This set looks great, and I'm excited about some of this stuff.  Long live SW:CCG.  Props to the PC.<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Wed May 29 2002 <br>I don't like this new set of virtual cards AT ALL! I got a bone to pick with Doug Taylor.<hr>Brian Hunter said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>the cardlist is drastically incomplete.  the first half of the demotion text runs into the second half of the Han's dice text, and then everything after the first half of the Luke's Back text is just missing altogether.  At least, that's what I'm seeing on my screen...<hr>neal said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>yeah something must have cut off, let me retry it, maybe it was some special symbol<hr>neal said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>there that should be all of them.  Oh and stratton: you are WELCOME for me posting them<hr>Simon Lee said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>For the complete cards:<br>
<br>
http://www.theforce.net/ccg/sw/pc/vcards.shtml<br>
<br>
I must say I'm quite disappointed with this new set.  Of the forty cards, 6-7 of them are playable, if that.<br>
<hr>Steve Marshall said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>I'm almost upset that JAWAS are so powerful now. Just wait 'til AZ regionals - if I've got the cards, you'll find out what I'm talking about.<hr>Justin Stratton said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Thanks Neal, I thought you would have seen my thanks on the community buzz, where I originally put in the hint that these should be posted. Thanks here also!  Kudos to you, good sir.<hr>Jason Herrin said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>The new cards are interesting to say the least. Some of the cards I do see a use for, while they seem to have hindered strategies that they just created in the set. An example is the new text for troopers and the new defensive shield to counter them. This in my oppinion made NO SENSE at all. They're troopers, they're freakin easy to kill! Why screw up somthing that you just fixed? And as for a pick up in the games popularity? In my area it has never waivered. To check the area out take the link to the Rebel Strike Team.<hr>Legolas Greenleaf said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>These aren't worth it.  Except for some strange über-Jawa strategy that I know someone is going to find, there aren't really any great cards in the set.  I've had 'em printed out for three days and haven't yet been able to use one.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Strat: fair enough, then you are really welcome.  thanks.<br>
<br>
Herrin: Well, just because it never wavered where you were doesn't it mean it hadn't, cause it had.  One of the advocates mentioned to me that tournament attendance was In March down to 15% nationwide of what it had been in November.  That's pretty huge.<br>
<br>
But now it seems to be picking up again, for many reasons.  Not the least of which is the movie.  Also not the least of which is Decipher is out of the picture, and not able to screw it up.  This expansion is probably the best since Death Star II, to me.  Plus you don't have them pushing their lameplayer crap on us anymore.  Now that they aren't around, I know I feel a lot more interested.<hr>Eric Olson said on Thu May 30 2002 <br>Thanks to Neal for the compliment, and for posting them.<hr>Seth Horn said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Are they purposefully trying to kill combat decks? i like a couple of the cards, but for the most part i really dont like them. cantina brawl makes luke look really scary. i do like that. i also like pie, but thats besides the point. good day.<hr>Erich Hawbaker said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Finally... Biggs Darklighter HAS COME BACK to my Hidden Base pilot roster!!! <br>
It's about time.<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Hi Neal, I know this isn't the right spot, but it was more logical than anywhere else:  The links to the Star Wars CCG section seem to be down and are posting "fatal error" messages.  Just wanted to let ya know!  <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Now, as for the virtual cards, I'm gonna see if there are any used this weekend at the tournaments I'm running.  Personally, I'll be adding the LS Combat shields in my decks at least.<hr>Mitch Velasco said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>Neal, I pasted an example of the error for you: <br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Fatal error: Call to undefined function: phpadmentor_getad() in /usr/local/www/vhosts/decktech.net/htdocs/global/includes/460_80.php on line 7<hr>Evan Fitzgerald said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>LSC wasn't destroyed - it was just made a bit more resonable (especially with the matching weapon card). you can still drain for 4 turn two with Maul...the cap only kicks in with two jedi. Only using one combat card actually gives the opponent a chance to not get wiped away...using two in a turn was lame to start with.<hr>mike minker said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>i dont understand, are these cards tournament legal? i didnt see anything on decipher about them, could someone please explain a little further for me, i would greatly appreciate it<br>
<br>
thanks<br>
<hr>Andrew Howard said on Fri May 31 2002 <br>They are tournament legal as of Satuday June 1st, legal for Championship Circuit Events as of Saturday June 8th. They will not be posted on decipher.com, as that is no longer allowed.<hr>Patrick Dennis said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>What are you talking about!?!?!?! Im lready preping my next rendition of Wittens Revenge! Oh and you guessed it.. JAWAS RULE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait till i can see jaa beats..<hr>Keith Watabayashi said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>The new anti-combat shield is stupid and too powerful! Anyone who has played Combat well against a GOOD player knows that you HAVE to have those two destiny, otherwise you'll lose, period. The designers had no idea what they were doing when they made that shield. The shield should do something like "Lost force to combats may come from any source" or "Opponent's Jedi <hr>Patrick Dennis said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>My friend.. My friend.. If you cant track a number to save your butt.. THEN STOP COMPLAINING! If you need that second destiny maybe you should hone your tracking skills. You had to know combat was going to get trounced one of these days.. they do it to promote creatvity.. nobody likes seeing the same deck fifty times over!<hr>Michael Walklate said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>How can people say these cards are not useful? Sunsdown is going straignt into my ISB deck, Fear Will Keep them in line is straignt into SYCFA, non-unique Imperial Class Star Destroyers are good now, Jawas are playable, Imperial Reinforcements looks very tough, Djas is playable (esp with Blaster Rack - the most game changing card in the V sets so far), one of the shields is very (too?) tough and that is just the dark side.<hr>Peter Jurcovic said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>The set is just great. But you cannot expect to get 50 game-breaking, ass-kicking, ... cards in it. All of the cards are playable and all alter the game in some fresh and interesting way. <br>
<br>
The PC definitle deserves two thumbs up for making Premiere a great set. I'm really looking forward to virtual Hoth, ANH, etc. This game just still rocks.<hr>James Sowden said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>I like some of the new cards for this set, but there are 3 I hate. the 2 that screw over combat and Fear Will Keep Them In Line. I hate the things that go against combat because I had really good decks and now they suck and as for the fear will keep them in line, SYCFA was already really strong, now they made it even strong, so thanks to those nerds on that commitee that did this, you really screwed up royally<br>
 <hr>Jack Burgess said on Sat Jun 1 2002 <br>Whoa what happened here? Magic Bullets are flying everywhere.  The LS "--Back" cards do what they should have to start with.  Thats cool.  Any worth though?  I'm a little worried about this.<br>
Preach on Watabayashi! I got your back.<hr>Fernando Medalón said on Sun Jun 2 2002 <br>VC Set #2 is really nice.<br>
<br>
Oh! anyone noticed there is no acces to the member place of the swccg section?<hr>Paul Myers said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Jawas playable?  What the heck is he talking about.  Ive already played in a post-V2 tourney and the cards dont chance much.  There are only 5-6 useful cards out of 40 and i think thats a pretty bad percentile.  SYCFA was already really strong!???  When was the last time anyone used that to win ANY big tournament!?<hr>Seth Horn said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>i was just wondering. why cant decipher post the new virtual cards on their website?<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>I'm going to go ahead and slam the advocates yet again, unfortunately.  One guy, Eric Olsen posts here.  John Arendt talks to me about the cards.  The others are once again proving why I slammed them early on.  Come on Helfrich, you've got a big mouth all the time, and radke too.  Step up to the plate and promote your cards, you bozos.  You gonna ruin this comeback too?<hr>Doug Taylor said on Mon Jun 3 2002 <br>Hey, I post on here occasionally too, Neal!   :)<br>
<br>
I finally signed back up (haven't had a membership here since the site first started, back in the day when you had to submit content to keep an account active).  Lately, I've posted a bit under someone else's signon, but now I've got my own account and will be more active here.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the props on the latest set, Neal!<br>
<br>
Doug Taylor<hr>John Anderson said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>I know Damian pretty well, we test and go to tourneys together. I've been to his house once (DPC w/ Paul Myers and Jim) and he's been over to my place once and he's coming again Friday. My word's good, right Neal? Anyway, Damian moved here in July or so from Wisconsin. He's an all right guy, just a yankee (you know how those guys are). He can get a little fired up a bit, but when he's calm I think he's a pretty good member. As for his typing skills, he has dysographa (I believe I spelled that right) and that causes him to screw things up. As for his 'luck' with girls, he has a steady girlfriend, who is not quite as attractive as the girls I've dated, however, she seems attractive enough.<hr>John Anderson said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Oops, wrong thread. If you'd clear these up for me, Neal, I'll repost to the coorect one.<hr>Neal Razi said on Tue Jun 4 2002 <br>Good Doug, excellent.  It's a nice set.  You guys need to come on, sell it a bit though.  You've got a chance to really kick the game in the butt right now.  I'm telling you guys, i'm a master of this... The Timing is perfect right now.  If you miss this chance, it might be a critical error.<hr>Doug Taylor said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Neal, I totally agree.<br>
<br>
Give me some advice on where the best place to "sell" and promote things is here.  The "Rumors" section?  Or is there a better place to post discussions about stuff/write announcements/answer questions, etc.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help.<hr>James Collins said on Wed Jun 5 2002 <br>Where are the printable versions?<hr>Scot Vales said on Sat Jun 8 2002 <br>I really liked these cards too.  New possibilities have opened up.  Cards that have dust on them might get a comeback.  <br>
I'm most glad to see more Defensive Shields.  It's just what I wanted to see from the first day of RefIII.  With more to chose from, some decks might not have the automatic tombstone they once did.<br>
<br>
As for the comments about usefulness:  I changed one of my decks to trade out three unique ISDs and replaced them for non-unique ISDs and threw in Comm. Praji whom I never played with before now.  C-3PO is going into my Regionals deck and I'm trying out a Jawa deck.  Also, Leia's Back might need to go into every future deck with a Leia.  +2 Force Drain?  SURE!!!!<br>
<br>
