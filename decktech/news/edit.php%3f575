#1 - A Survey!
First off, we’d like to announce the very first Player-Wide Survey. The survey questions will be listed below. If you complete the survey, the PC will send you TWO random rares free!!! (One is guaranteed to be either Coruscant Rare or a Reflections III premium card!) Just follow the instructions below for submitting your survey. 

#2 - An Election!
As part of restoring the Competitive Balance Team, the PC decided that we wanted to give the community at large a greater say in managing the ever-shifting meta. After a long and substantial deliberation, we settled on opening the last two spots of the CBT to a public vote. We have narrowed down the field to the 7 candidates who presented the strongest applications and now we’re leaving the final choice up to YOU! Everyone can vote for up to 3 candidates and the two candidates with the most votes will make it on the final team. Voting will end January 15th at midnight pacific time. 

So here is how it’s going to work: 

The only people eligible to vote will be registered forum users who have an account registered before 12/20/2009. 

In order for your vote to count you need to:

A) Send a Private Message to “OfficialPCVoting”
B) Please indicate your selection of no more than THREE candidates from the list below.
C) Include BOTH your full name and city of residence (or else your vote may not count!)
D) Include any answers to the 8-question survey below. 
E) Include your FULL mailing address so we can send you 2 free rares for filling out the player survey!!!
