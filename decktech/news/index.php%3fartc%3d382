Mitch Velasco is the newest Advocate</B></font></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td bgcolor="#000066"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">DeckTech reports on Fri Nov 7 2003  | SW:CCG<P>Star Wars CCG players. I want to give you some *very* good news.  The PC has selected a replacement for the late, great Andrew Howard (now on board with DT). And I am very, very pleased to tell you that it is none other than FL hometown hero, <b>Mitch Velasco</b>.<br />
<br />
Rather than giving you a copy of <a href="http://www.swccgpc.com">the excellent bio of Mitch on swccgpc.com</a>, I want to talk from personal experience.<br />
<br />
I've known Mitch for years here in FL. Mitch is the greatest guy, he is so dedicated. He runs or helps run basically every large event.  He knows his stuff, and is willing to go the extra mile for the players. Hell, he's been a Premium Member here right from the beginning.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Mitch is a really talented individual. Working in civil service(as your handsome narrator present used to long ago, my brothers), he is in charge of a much of the funding and such for the City of Jacksonville! Very responsible, very competant.<br />
<br />
Now you might think "nice guy, but nerd alert here". No way! Mitch is also one of the most fun guys here in FL to hang with after the tournaments, he can talk about everything from cards, to nudie bars, to the Simpsons, to Scuba Diving.<br />
<br />
Definitely post a few thank yous. I'm sure the game will definitely prosper with him on board the PC.<br />

Andrew did a great job for us, but I think it's a better "fit" to have him still working with us, but from the DeckTech side, while Mitch, being one of the most organized guys there is, is a perfect fit for the Tournament Advocate position.  We also learned from past mistakes, and have spread some of the workload (Andrew was doing enough for two people) to other Advocates.  Josh Radke will be helping out much more on the Tournaments end of things as well, and I think this new setup benefits the PC, DeckTech, and the SWCCG playing community in the best possible way!</td></tr></table><p><table width=100%><tr><td bgcolor=#008080>Mitch Velasco - Fri Nov 7 2003 </td></tr><tr><td>Thanks everyone!
