Now why the hell would YOU care about giving DT money?  Believe me, <b>you do!</b><br />
<br />
It's not just paying for the HUGE entertainment value of DeckTech (at about 2.50 a month, probably a penny an hour), it's not just about improving your game, it's not just about saving TONS of money in the DT Discount club, it's not just about supporting DeckTech and it's not just about getting tons of incredible website features.<br />
<br />
It's about pooling resources.<br />
<br />
Here's the way it's going to work.<br />
<br />
For every 25 members that are active at any one time, every premium member gets something!  It could be tech points, it could be a new DT feature.  And eventually, it means a GUARANTEED Cash Tournament voted on by the Premium Members!!<br />
<br />
Let's take a look.<br />
<br />
25 - 750 tech points to every Premium Member.  Use 'em for priority dmail, use 'em to delete reviews, use 'em to give undeletable reviews, or buy some website upgrades.<br />
<br />
50 - A new DT feature (probably an option to dmail your responses directly to the reviewer so you get the FINAL word sent home.)<br />
<br />
75 - Another 750 tech points to every Premium Member.  <br />
<br />
100 - Random give away to Premium Members (Probably 5 Rook Steel cases).  Let's give something monetary back to the players who are helping<br />
<br />
125 - 750 tech points to every Premium Member.  <br />
<br />
150 - A new DT website feature (TBA)<br />
<br />
175 - 750 tech points to every Premium Member.<br />
<br />
200 - This is the biggie!  A guaranteed cash tournament, <b>voted on by the<br />
premium members</b>!  There'll be prizes of 500, 300 and 200 guaranteed bucks right for<br />
SWCCG, Lord of the Rings, Magi Nation Duel, or Magic (or another game?), but the votes decide who gets what.  So if the premium members vote MND, then hell, MND gets the guaranteed 500 bucks.  Also, there'll be one of three locations to vote on (TBA), and those lucky 200 WILL be deciding it's location.<br />
<br />
What comes after that?  We'll see, but it'll be good.<br />
<br />
As you can see, <b>the sooner you sign up, the better</b>!  Those who sign up early are going to get EVERYTHING that comes later.<br />
<br />
So get on over to that link.  Learn a little about it.  Get signed up, help DT out, and get in so we can get to 200 Premium Members and YOU can decide where'll it be, and to what game the prizes go!<br />
