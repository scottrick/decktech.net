More info to be posted soon.<hr>Baroni said on Wed Oct 17 2001 <br>Which of these is equivalent to day 2 of what would be dcon. And which one would be the qualifing one to get into this. Im just a little confused<hr>darthbooker said on Wed Oct 17 2001 <br>Will there a day 1 that 20+ can qualify for day 2?<hr>Hayes said on Wed Oct 17 2001 <br>patience people!  you guys are demanding info so they are giving it to you to help planning.  they'll get to the specifics eventually...<hr>Nicholas Burke said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>Anyway things can get pushed back onto the sunday... i already canceled the days off i was going to take for D-con, it would be better i think for alot of people if they didn't have to take days off at all...<hr>Outlaw said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>Since SW doesn't start till Friday, everybody that is there on Thursday and is not playing in other events,should take a trip down to Decipher and each give Warren Holland a piece of our mind personally!<hr>Raphael Asselin said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>Excellent schedule, don`t change a thing... <br>
<br>
we have sunday to drive back home (16 hour) and that will be the same for many people... same as previous year for dcon.  I also suggest that there is many poeple to qualify from open.. since this will allow a better competition for day 2 .. (but do whatever you want, i am already im :)<br>
<hr>Hayes said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>raph- try to bring yannick and dom with you, even if they don't play!<hr>H2O said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>i hope they come too, you guys are my heroes!<hr>Black 7 said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>Outlaw:  I plan to put together a trip to do just that.  Also, someone on another list suggesting collecting Fear cards to give to him.  It is a great idea, so I will have a great big box there to collect the cards in, I hope to get thousands by the end of the weekend.<hr>Mayhem said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>So what's "Last Man Standing" then? Like a knockout tournament, winners play winners and losers are out entirely until you have one person left at the end?<hr>David said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>I realize that Decktech has really gone out and done a lot for the players of all 4 games by organizing this, but some comments on the schedule.  At D-con Star Trek and Star Wars were scheduled to go first, with Young Jedi and Jedi Knights events to take place on the weekend.  I am sure part of the reasoning for this is that Star Wars (and Trek to a lesser extent) is a well established game.  The World Championship could be 3am on a Tuesday morning and the players would show up.  YJ and JK on the other hand need a little help.  I can't take two days off from work in the hopes that I might qualify to the finals.  I could however leave after work on a Friday and devote the weekend to trying to make the finals.  Maybe I am the only one out here, but I just can't participate in those events if they are during the week.  I doubt that most Star Wars players would say the same about their events.  If I am the only one that feels this way then Decktech and the players should not care if I am not there.  If I am not however, than the day of the week for YJ and JK is going to have a direct impact on the player field.<hr>PapaLorax said on Thu Oct 18 2001 <br>As told to me by a Decipher employee - Star Wars was scheduled on Thurs/Fri to get it out of the wat ASAP.  To me, in only makes sense to have the premier game with the premier timeslot. Keep everything just the way it is.<hr>Your all wanna be D-Cons. said on Sat Oct 20 2001 <br>This Is very Cheesey, wanna be Decipher Con.<hr>Brad Reinhold said on Sun Oct 21 2001 <br>thanks a ton guys!<hr>Jedi Guy said on Mon Oct 22 2001 <br>Why go though the trouble of holding FreedomCon at Virginia Beach if you don't stick to the DecipherCon schedule?!  My airplane ticket has me flying into Norfolk on 11/17, so I can play in the Young Jedi World Championship on 11/18.  Then I fly home on 11/19.  The FreedomCon schedule does me absolutely no good!<hr>Jedi Guy said on Mon Oct 22 2001 <br>...and what happened to all of the "Day One" events?!<hr>Adam Drake said on Tue Oct 23 2001 <br>You know, you guys are complaining when you should be kissing the ground David and Neal walk on. If it weren't for them, there would be NO world championships for your stupid little games. You guys would complain about something even if the WCs were held in your own living room. Geez, people, gorw up!<hr>Alan Sagan said on Tue Oct 23 2001 <br>Hey I might be able to go.. where can I find information on hotels and stuff?<hr>Adam Drake said on Tue Oct 23 2001 <br>i am a dumb ass.  i do not even know how to spell.  I attack individuals because i have nothing better to do.  i am self centered and do not take the time to look at things from other perspectives.<br>

PEACE OUT!<hr>Sith Slayer said on Sun Oct 28 2001 <br>On the Young Jedi open qualifier, I heard that only 20% will go on to the Finals.  The problem I have with this is because YJ is so hard pressed to get players because of all the competing events, normally the top 36 from the Open qualifier went on.  But if you only have 32 players as we did last year for the Open, 20% means only 6 players would go on to meet the 36 second day champions, which would only yield 42 players instead of the 70 for the second day and the then the final twelve for the world final.<br>
   My vote is for the same way it has been run at the previous Cons!  We don't have that many players to start with, not counting the crossover players, who play YJ just because they have time on their hands.
