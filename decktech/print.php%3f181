Maybe even more ghetto than Haldir<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>Yeah, he's garbage, but he's a premium and will probably be good in the sealed deck. At least he's better than the Grey Wizard...<hr>Mike Blumberg said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>AT least he has Aragorn signet...one plus...undirected archery pretty much hugs a nut.<hr>Alexander Bagasra said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>Hmm, ARV, 4 Double Shots, and this guy - I can see it already...<hr>Eivind Guneriussen said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>Some people just doesn`t get it, this dude could be good. ARV, double shot, maybe some other elves. Lego could rule without havin to exert.. All cards have a good side! I just do not like the pic. aka - Twelveoliphantsinabarrel<hr>Wes Simpson said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>...And you're facing a Goblin Archer, which makes all those Double Shots and Legolas' game text useless. The reason this card isn't good is because Greenleaf is just so much better...<hr>Jonathan Thiffault said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>I think that this card is a good one. It is sure that it can't be as good as the rare one but I think this one is easily playable.<br>...As WES SIMPSON said, it is not because this Legolas is bad, it's because the other one is much more powerfull.<br>Also, it depends of the situation in the game??? Which one is better if you consider that Legolas is exhaust? <br>This card really don't stink... this card can be really helpful!<hr>Alan Sagan said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>how to make this card.. maybe playable over the other.<br>

Legolas's Pimpin' Bow<br>
0 twilight<br>
Play on legolas.   Add one to the archery total.<br>
Archery: Exert legolas to wound a minion.  That wound may not be prevented.  This bow does not add to the archery total.<br>
<br>
Well maybe that's a bit overpowered, but it just goes to show how much better the real Legolas is.  <hr>Ryan French said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>i think its kinda cool, useful in sealed decks.  greenleaf still rocks, unless there's some kind of support cards that only work with this guy.<hr>Charles Bickford said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>Think of it this way throw a splender of their banners and a premium aragorn on table and you got 3 archery every 2nd move now that with  double shot or even a shoulder to shoulder would be a lot of continues archery<hr>Neal Razi said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>Come on, this card is nowhere near as good as greenleaf.  Denny, i call 'em how i see 'em.  When i get beaten down by that card's wonderful one if not two undirected archery, i will say you were right.  Unfortunately, that is never going to happen.  At least premiere sucky legolas can withstand nazgul for a turn or two.  Oh, and i'm deleting your post for being obnoxious.<hr>Edwin Harris said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>i think its good casue now new players can play a versatillity deck with no rares pretty much, and you can heal with aragorn.<hr>jason wade said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>wow. I love how you bash a card when it as no actual game play behind it. Also the fact that this card can be very very nice to work with. 2 undirected archery + aragornbow + arwen with a bow makes 4 archery a turn under the right conditions. That is HUGE. You drop 4 guys 2 die to archery (all of them if he plays versitllity). BTW the new gandalf is also very very nice. There are alot of people who start him or use him in a deck. You guys are always narrow minded about new cards. Sure a greenleaf is good but I had much rather use this new one bc is has argaron signet plus play that tale to extert a archer to make archery total +1. That plus the heal from aragron is big. That is 3 archery coming from one guy for only one exteron. Keep bashing away until everyone starts to use him in a deck.  <hr>Michael Dalton said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>You play this Legolas, I'll play the other Legolas and we'll see who wins more :).<hr>Wes Simpson said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>There's so many ways to hose the fellowship archery total it's not even funny...<hr>George Wilson said on Sat May 11 2002 <br>great<hr>Josh Bartel said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>the card is ok<hr>Alexandre David said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>I Think its great that now everyone can get a decent legolas for once. Of course they wont make him better than the rare one, what did you expect?<hr>Benjamen Lim said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>i think with gil galad and splendor of their banners this legolas can kick ass and with the new long dagger and asfaloth...whoaza<br>
-ben<hr>Conor Brace said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>"There's so many ways to hose the fellowship archery total it's not even funny?"  Like what?  There's the Goblin Archer, who nobody plays with because he's almost always useless and far too expensive; there are cards like Uruk-hai Armory and Pinned Down, which nobody uses because they're usually dead cards.  If a few good people actually use the new Legolas in a deck (with other archery and ARV as discussed already) and can make it work, it'll force Shadow players to use counter cards they wouldn't otherwise have used... isn't that the definition of a good card?<hr>Zach Bruckenstein said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>Legolas SOT, 4 Double Shots, Arwen, ARV, Aragorn W/ Bow, Haldir W/Bow, and Splendor of their Banners =<br>
<br>
At least 6 archery!!!<hr>Benjamen Lim said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>actualy conor has a point..if u play goblin archer...you wouldn't have enough twilight for anithing else...the onli down side is the inability to kill off sauron orcs to prevent bowmens text to realise<br>
-ben<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>You guys, this is a bad card because <br>
<br>
1) It's just nowhere near as good as greenleaf.  It's undependable.  You get swarmed at the bridge, and you get one undirected archery, and we'll see who you like better then.<br>
<br>
2) This card is just a stupid common, just like those lamer league cards.  You can will get like 10 of them when you get a box of Realm.  It's an AI, whoop-tee-do.<br>
<br>
Personally, these pre-releases are not that exciting to me.  You spend inflated prices to get a bunch of junk you'll get when you buy your box at a decent price.  And WOW you get an AI of some crappy common.<br>
<br>
My advice - save your money from the marketing gimmick, and buy yourself the cards you need to play the game competitevely.  It's always better to have cards you need I think than dumb stuff like league points or AI Prancing Ponies and stuff.  I know a lot of people who waste their money on that stuff and then can't get the cards they need.<hr>Jeremy Hodes said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>neal.. how are you going to get 10 of them? unless you buy a box of starters, but why wouldyou do that?(its premium)<hr>Michael Carr said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>Neal - normally I am not one to disagree with you.  You always tend to be a straight shooter and call it like it is.  However, in regards to leagues and Pre-Releases, I will have to disagree.  In regards to the League - I am in favor of it just because it has helped a guaranteed large turn out locally (normally) for tournaments.  The League allows people to play some wacky deck formats they normally would not play in a tournament - ie Moria Super Archery or Elven/Sauran/Isengard Discard decks.  The premiums - while not overly powerful - do allow for a taste of something not currently there.  The AIs?  Just a way of providing something different (The AI Pony is really cool in my opinion).  So far as the Pre-release...well I haven't read too much up on it yet, but I have heard from the local store that DGMA is providing some sort of huge prize for the winner - beyond the AI Legolas.  Not sure what yet, but supposedly it is going to be well worth it to compete for it.  More importantly, I feel players should go out and support these pre-release tournaments.  To me, it appears to be an attempt by the DGMA to raise funds for itself to get itself going.  As the DGMA is technically a separate business entity from Decipher, they need their own cash to make things work.  By coming out and supporting the pre-release events, not only are you supporting your local economy (by coming out to the store and buying product) you are also helping DGMA provide what people have always wanted - big prize tournament structure.  One of the big complaints of SWCCG had always been there was not big tournament prize like their had been for Magic.  Some even go so far as to suggest that this was one of the reasons that SWCCG never gained the popularity of Pokemon or Magic.  The DGMA appears to be Decipher's answer to that.  However, as with all fledging business ventures, it is in need of some immediate cash inflow.  Thus the pre-releases.  Do you get something that you normally wouldn't?  No.  Something you couldn't wait two weeks for?  Nope.  Just some packs, a starter, an AI Legolas, a chance at what is supposed to be a sweet prize, and the chance to buy packs prior to anyone else.  Sure the cards aren't tournament worthy, and sure it won't effect terretorials any.  None the less, pre-releases are always a good time.  It always is just that little bit cooler to be opening the packs for the pre-release and not know exactly what you are getting.  The ooh ahh factor is just a little bit better.  Granted, that is just my 2 cents, and you may disagree with it all you want.<br><br>  PS League cards are lame?  Can you imagine the impact on the tournament scene with the Vial for tiebreakers?  How about the drawing engine for dwarves in the Book?  Or twilight denial for Bill?  Or the brokenness of Horn of Boromir/Consorting with Wizards/Bilbo Baggins?  Or the additional recursion engine in Fireworks?  LOTS of possibilities.  Oh, and in regards to the Moria Archer snubbing poor premium Legolas?  Not going to happen if you are facing twilight denial of any kind.<br><br>Again, my opinion.  Not sanctioned or approved by anyone or promoting the ideals of anyone other then me, myself, and I.<hr>Neal Razi said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>No problem on the disagreement, buddy.  I'm glad you disagreed, I see some of what you are saying in a new light.<br>
<br>
I like what you say about the league's wacky deck's.  That does indeed sound fun.  I think wacky decks are one of the best things about lord of the rings, and i'm glad there is a place where you can play them.  It also sounds like it's good for getting players together and an efficient and easy way to build a local scene.  That is cool.  I also think that it's great for people to spend some green at the local stores.<br>
<br>
I'll further conceede these type of cards as are as cool as you think they are (the ooh ahh factor).  My biggest complaint against the league/pre release thing for a lot of the teens is they end up buying stuff they are never going to use.  I know guys who went out and bought gimli starter decks and stuff just to get league points or get goofy cards, then they are stuck trying to haggle and trade to get cards that actually let them play competitively, because they are broke from buying junk.  Maybe it's fun junk, like the league cards, but since you can't play them in tournaments, and they'll be out as commons soon, they seem like junk to me.  But it's possible I'm just too serious about it.<br>
<br>
That's kind of how I see the pre-releases.  It seems like a money making gimmick to me.  You get an AI of a card that'll be a common in the next set.  And it's not even a card that'll see much play (imho).<br>
<br>
Then these teenagers, who are already pretty broke as it is, are going to have to try to throw down even MORE cash to get their box of realms.  It just gets to the point where people are spending so much money getting premium cards, then boxes, then singles for the decks, that it gets so expensive to keep up, people start quitting.  That doesn't do anyone any good.<hr>Michael Carr said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Neal - Okay, you have me wondering something here.  You keep talking about league points.  I am slightly confused (happens a lot ;) ).  What are these league points you keep talking about?  From participating/running a local league, I am not aware of any league points.  Now maybe you are referring to the stamps you need to get to earn the cards.  Now for that, yeah, some stores can require you to play the sealed deck requirement to earn your cards.  But that is out of Decipher's hands in the hands of the league master (store owner or TD or whomever).  Not all leagues run the same.  Example - the one store in my area has added this rule:  Sealed deck refers to playing with 3 random rares and the fixed cards that come from the sealed starter deck.  No purchase requirements.  However, like I said, it varies from store to store to store.  However, your points in regards to the players spending money hand over fist to try to get premiums - 100% agreed - that does eat into the play experience.  And unfortunately, it does have its negatives - it does start eating into the players cash flow and having them quit.  However, the one thing Big D has said time and time again is that all premiums (barring the starter deck premiums) are just previews of cards to come.  Now I can understand the problem had Decipher gone and done what they did with the JK League - release good premiums that are available only through the league.  But that is why they did what they did.  They wanted to make 100% sure that no one had to go to a league to get cards or go onto eBay and drop a $100 to get a card.  Now personally, I think that doing previews is a whole heck of a lot better then the other way.  Now if you are referring to the starter deck premiums as your major problem with the premiums, I can see what you are getting at.  However, again, lets look at JK.  The second set saw the release of an all new set of deck themes.  Any new starter decks?  No.  And where did player drop off occur?  Right there.  I remember the day on the JK list serve when it was announced there would be no starter decks with Scum and Villainy.  Oh the number of people who swore they would quite just rose sky high.  They had a good point - how were they supposed to get these cards that at the time were uber powerful, when in the first set they were just given to the players.  So I look at the alternatives:  They can do it like they did JK - no starter decks, make the premiums rares and let people spend more money trying to get a set.  Or they can provide you with the ability to drop $10 per starter, get the premiums, 3 rares, and go about your merry way.  Again, given the choice of the two, I would rather go with the way things area.  Could things be better?  Of course - nothing is ever pefect.  However, I think one of the most important things players can remember about the preview cards and the pre-release is:<br><br>Premiums are 9 times out of 10 preview cards or alternate images of existing cards to be made available in future sets<br>Premiums could be made a lot harder to get - such as through winning tournaments (as is done with L5R or Raw Deal) or exclusively through leagues or eBay at high prices<br>We could always get nothing and be in the position we were in with Star Wars - no leagues; no premiums outside of Anthology's and Enhanced products<br><br>PS  I do agree that this Legolas will not see as much play as Greenleaf (geez, could you imagine HIM with an Aragorn Signet?!?!?).  However, in my area, there are tons of Fellowship Archery decks running rampant.  I think it is time I break out my Anti-Run and Gun deck (never before seen or tested) and rip a whole in some of these Archers.  Then the new Legolas will see gameplay....<br><br>Again, my opinion.

Not sanctioned or approved by anyone or promoting the ideals of anyone other then me, myself, and I.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Why would the new Legolas ever be better?  The only real bonus he has is sometimes he adds 1 more to the archery total (which will rarely be useful).  The Aragorn Signet is not really much of an advantage in my opinion (you couldn't pay me to play that Aragorn anyway).  So you give up the option to exert to wound, there's nothing saying you have to exert to wound, it's just a very useful option to have (that I see used in like every game I ever play).<hr>jason baretta said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>i hope that isn't the flagship card for elf lords. MoM had almost no worthwhile cards for tourney quality decks. a couple weeks after MoM was out ppl went back to their nazgul ranger decks and whatever else they played from Fellowship. ok MoM was similiar to ANH in that respect, i just hope that Elflords shakes things up abit, Dagobah style.<hr>John Arendt said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>This guy is a common or uncommon, fixed card in the starters - I'd expect him to be at the same power level of 'Prince of Mirkwood' or 'Dwarf of Erebor' - actually, he's a little bit better.  In an ARV deck, exhausting two minions and throwing two archery is usually enough - most Uruk or Nazgul decks only throw down a few minions anyway.<br>
<br>
This guy would definitely be better if unaimed archery was getting a boost.  Dunno, guess we wait and see.<br>
<br>
He's no Greenleaf, but I think he's better than Prince of Mirkwood.  I'd consider using him with White Arrows and King in Exile for the slow healing.<br>
<br>
As for why to go to a pre-release - yeah, its pretty much a money-making thing.  Its for the excitement of opening new stuff ahead of time.  Decipher pre-releases would be more successful (they're successful, I'm just saying more successful) - if the whole set didn't get spoiled ahead of time, so there were some unknowns at the pre-release.  We'll see.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>I'll let the responses run on a bit before commenting, but i had to laugh at this.<br>
<br>
A reader wrote me wondering if I "get paid by Decipher to stir up controversy".  <br>
<br>
Haha, believe it or not Decipher's lamebrain marketing dept is stupid enough NOT to realize how much publicity they get by my controversial comments.  Kyle Heuer, far from paying DT, generally harasses me, and already was whining about this.  You'd think those lunk heads would want people discussing their crappy cards, cause the discussion here is as much news as this card'll ever get.<br>
<br>
It'd be much worse for them if this came out and it rotted on some lamer website of theirs with no one ever talking or caring about it (hmm, maybe I should take it down after all?).<br>
<br>
For the record though, haha, I am not in the employ of Decipher, or anyone else.  I just speak how I feel on a variety of topics.<hr>Kenneth Bradford said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Hey, Neal, remember why you do this thing.  The gamers!  Yeah, we rule, baby!<br><br>I like this Legolas from a fun perspective.  I'll likely use him in a deck designed to run up ridiculous archery totals.  Will I take it to a tourney?  Um....no.  But I also don't take any of my other decks that I have the most fun playing either (from Dwarves to Hobbit beatdown--Frodo overwhelming the Witch King is TOO funny).<br><br>I'll take my three rares for decks and save the Legolas for such fun uses.  Not every card has to be Aragorn's Bow to like and enjoy it.<hr>jason wade said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>The new legolas is for players who know how to control the archery and there sites. A greenleaf is good but this card can be BETTER than a greenleaf in certain situations. For one you don't have to extert him to add to the archery total at 6 out of the 8 sites that you move too. they take 2 anyway. vs swarm decks they will armory away the damage at the right time (that is if a good player didn't secret sentails away them before hand. ) vs uraks you versatilty and make them take 2-3 (which means they will loose at least 1 to archey, they should loose 2) This new legolas is as good as a greenleaf. Plus this new one can be healed to do the white arrows every turn. The point is that the new legolas is very very good IF you know how to play him right. But to a player who is additiced to the shoot with legolas at blah blah blah then he is not going to like this new one bc he is used to the legolas power. most of the time you verstailly and shoot with legolas anyways. with this new card you can just use double shot once and make him take 3-4 achery (aragron with bow) so the out come it the same. difference no exterting to wound and can be healed every turn for the tale to add one to the archery total. This new legolas is tech just like the new gandalf. <hr>Neal Razi said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>I hear you kenneth, buddy.  It's cool with me, man<hr>Michael Hawley said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Neal Razi: on the Decipher payroll - LOL. That is worthy of a whole new thread. Hey Neal, how do I get in on that deal?  <hr>Michael Dalton said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Legolas Greenleaf is better if you know how to use him right.  Undirected archery just isn't very powerful.<hr>Alex Weavers said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>Greenleaf is great, in some situations (for instance, with Vit+1, or when facing a bunch of Vitality 1 minions and Cave Troll), but this guy is sweet too.<br>
<br>
One: He's less likely to get himself killed by overexerting.<br>
<br>
Two: Once exhausted, he can still add archery.<br>
<br>
Three:  This has already been noted, but Splendor of their Banners<br>
<br>
Four:  Hate doesn't detract from your archery skills.<br>
<br>
Don't go axeing anything before you see it played in a deck that's made for it.<hr>Neal Razi said on Mon May 13 2002 <br>guys think abot it.  Splendor of their banners and new guy.  It's two cards that are undirected greenleafs.<br>
<br>
Give it up<hr>Casey Honeysett said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>I think that this Legolas would be useful in a couple of ways.    Playing him and other early forest/river sites such as Trollshaw Forest and the Ford would give you an extra advantage in the early game.  Consider this: Start with Arwen and this new Legolas.  Put in those forest/river sites and maybe an elven bow on arwen and you have 3 archery early in the game.  Most roaming minions will get killed by this archery especially with low twilight for them to use, giving you a significant advantage.  He would also be useful in twilight choker decks with no stranger and a talent for not being seen, combined with high archery and the option of killing him off to a powerful minon if the need for more stealth arises.  When looking at a new card like this, dont instantly bash it because it is not immediatly as useful as the rare version.  There are many types of different decks out there, and this one would definately work with some of them.  It is also a good newbie card (better than POM) and one that has definite potential.  Wait for new ROTEL cards and see if this new Legolas doesnt get a boost somehow.  <hr>Michael Dalton said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>You guys are really only kidding yourself.  Legolas adds to the archery total when exhausted too!  And get this, he actually does something useful w/ his vitality besides getting butt-pirated by some random uruk + battle cry.  And get this, you don't need to play a junky card like Splendor of Their Banners to do it!<hr>jason wade said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>wow. Michael I am sorry that you can't see the incredable use of this new card. Not only for people who have first entered the game but also for the experiaced player as well. The fact is that a greenleaf is good but this card CAN be better under different situations where a greenleaf is just not going to cut it. At the sites where greenleaf kills the most minons is at a rivier bc of versitilly. This new legolas adds 2 to the archery total at that site. Lets think 3 uraks, 2 are versitilly and the third is alright. he takes 4 archery (one from arwen, one from aragron, and 2 from legolas). They all die and you move again. The uses of this new card can go on and on.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>Greenleaf in the "right deck" is more powerful than the new guy in the "right deck". Period.<hr>jason wade said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>Simply Stunning. Wes a greenleaf can't dish out 2 archery and take a hit from a minon and be able to do it again at the next site now can he? Once an exasted legolas has taken a hit he is dead but this new one can be healed and take a hit and add 2 to the arhcery total. The new one in the "right deck" is alot more powerful than a greenleaf. Period.<hr>Michael Dalton said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>Under very specific circumstances that will occur rarely this new Legolas is actually better.  This makes the new Legolas not playable in comparison to Legolas Greenleaf.  If you're waiting to play your ARV so that the new Legolas's archery total can actually accomplish something for you then you might never get to that point.  How often is 1 more archery on the total really gonna help you?  How often is the ability to exert to wound a minion gonna help you?  The players who lose lots of games will pick the new Legolas, the players who win lots of games will pick Greenleaf.<hr>Wes Simpson said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>Greenleaf doesn't take "hits". He kills the minion(s) he would have been skirmishing and lets the big guys (Aragorn, Gandalf, Boromir, etc.) do the fighting.<hr>Paul Goldberg said on Wed May 15 2002 <br>It's simple.<br>
Arwen/Elven Bow/Splendor<br>
--Aragorn Signet<br>
Legolas/Splendor/Tale<br>
--Aragorn Signet<br>
Aragorn, King in Exile<br>
Aragorn's Bow/Saga<br>
Aragorn has more HP so he is generally more reliable for both combat and directed archery...<br>
Coupled w ARV, Double Shots Etc. Splendors make your undirected Archery go through the roof. 200 arrows are bound to hit something. On top of that, both of your elves can now be healed by Aragorn. The concept is almost like Mordor Orcs, they space out the damage between Watching Eyes, Orc Bowmen, Beatdown and a Hate to top it all off. Greenleaf is the man for all you people that prefer one big nuclear blast as opposed to well timed, more effective shellings. Also...when you start using karats ("") to signify sarcasm on an internet chat board...you need to seek counseling. Hurrah to all of you that were open minded.<br>
Paul, NOT THE WRESTLER, Goldberg<hr>Norman Harrison said on Wed May 15 2002 <br>Wow, look at all this controversy, truly a sign of a site that represents ALL gamers and ALL opinions. With what we know now, it appears Greenleaf is going to still come out on top. If you look above people are going out of their way to make a deck that makes Son of Thranduil Good, while i haven't made a deck yet i didn't throw him into, cause he's awesome. Best unaltered character of the game, SO FAR. Stay tuned, cause i'm sure that there are more twists and turns in this next set than just a pipe and a Legolas.<hr>Lisa Gansky said on Wed May 22 2002 <br>I actually do like the pic (tee hee)...the only good thing is the Aragorn signet for KIE players... but otherwise it pretty much sucks. Why would you want to add cards to your deck to make him good when you could just use Greenleaf who's already good?<hr>jason wade said on Wed May 22 2002 <br>bc with those other cards in your deck to make him better he can become more powerful than a greenleaf. The new weapons for him plus his bow makes him a 9 and when fighting a orc or a urak is like an 11. plus when he wins he can wound a minon and he adds 2 to the archery total. he is like a machine. add 2 archery, win skirmish, wound a minon with the bow. That is 4 wounds coming from one guy for only the use of 3 cards plus he can do it again next turn bc he doesn't need to extert like greenleaf does. That is why he is better. look on decipher page and see his new weapons. They are good.<hr>Dylan Jambrek said on Sat Jun 8 2002 <br>You guys are fools, this is a fighter Legolas with Bow of G, His new knives and white arrows of lorien along with aragorn healing hes a monster<hr>Wes Simpson said on Tue Jun 11 2002 <br>It takes <b>all that</b> to make him a monster?
