<br>
In these small articles legendary players are asked some questions about the new Star Wars game, after playing the game for a few hours. The comments written by these players will be presented unedited (except for spelling and grammatical purposes). These opinions are the actual views expressed by these players. They are not exhaustive commentaries; rather these are the first impressions. <br>
<br>
Some opinions might be favorable while others are not. The opinions of these players do not necessarily reflect the opinion of DeckTech and it&#8217;s staff. <br>
<br>
Here are legendary player Raphael Asselin&#8217;s opinions. <br>
<br>

<br>
HIGH<br>
<br>
1.Having a card game supported by Wizard of the Coast can simply mean if the game work out well there will be big tournaments and big prize support.<br>
<br>
2.Having a new card game can be a high in itself, but it always depend on how original it is and how the already saturated market will react to this game.<br>
<br>
3.It will include card of episode 2, which is now impossible with SWCCG<br>
<br>
4.The game is very easy to learn (in fact I think all of us caught on before he finished explaining it) and will bring new players.<br>
<br>
5.The mechanic of deploying cards with the 30 starting point is interesting. It is a good way to involve strategy before starting the game.<br>
<br>
6.The game is very fast, actually 2 games out of the dozen we played finished in a first turn win.<br>
<br>
<br>
LOWS<br>
<br>
1.Well for sure my first low would probably go to the incorporation of dice in the game. Who really wants to rely on luck in a critical situation? Not me.<br>
<br>
2.Luck can make a person win on first turn... needless to say that it can be frustrating.<br>
<br>
3.I would have like a total new mechanic as interesting as the SWCCG, but feel SWTCG is much more similar to YJ and JK.<br>
<br>
4.Since it is pretty easy to learn, it might attract a lot more kids than young adults, I wouldn&#8217;t like being the only person at 25 and over and having 20 kids of 10 or less. Easy to win, but so boring.<br>
<br>
5.No prize money initially. Only items such as replica of light saber and other Star Wars type prizes. I mean they are cool, but I doubt my wife would want me to put it on our fireplace?<br>
<br>
6.Also some ruling that might have not been explained correctly that left us suspicious.  For now there is not much interaction between all 3 arenas (or theaters).<br>
<br>
7.The game in coming with a bad public opinion. That game is considered to be stealing the one we are already use to (SWCCG).<br>
<br>
So my final opinion would probably goes with my heart.  There might be good thing in the new game, probably some good one and some bad ones, but I will always be a SWCCG players.  Nothing will make my mind change (LOTR didn&#8217;t do it either).<br>
<br>
<br>
If you have questions about the new game or Mr. Asselin's opinions feel free to post them bellow and if he has time perhaps he can answer them for you.<br>

Stay tuned for legendary Player Brian Hunter&#8217;s opinion.<p><small>edited by DeckTech on Thu May 9 2002 </small><hr><b>comments</b><hr>Fernando Medalón said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>First turn winning??? That was the main reasson why I left Magic.<hr>Erik Lopez said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>Never thought about the first turn wins.  How cheap is that? Only strengthens my disdain for this game.<hr>Joseph Paul Nazzari said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>Ive played a lot of ST:TCG games and unless you really make a crappy deck there is no way you are going to loose on the first turn<hr>matt wehner said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>Okay, I've played hundreds of games of SWTCG, bought thousands of cards, and never have we seen a first turn win.  What on earth were these guys given as a demo to the game?  The twoplayer starters?  Those starters were horrible and just a quick explanation of the game.  Kinda weak to think that all these reviews are based on what was seen outta 30-40 card decks....<hr>David Sidhu said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>I decided to pick up a pack of it, but i looked at the name on the back, star Wars, and I realized that it did not belong on those cards, it only belongs on the backs of SWCCG cards.  So i literally tore the SWTCG cards up, maybe not the smartest thing to do but i could never see myself playing them and I know its not Wizards fault but I hate the cards (SWTCG) and I dont think that can ever change.  The name Star Wars belongs on the backs of our beloved game and no other game out there.<hr>jacob filyaw said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>Wow you tore up your cards?  lol you must have money to waiste.  I like the game.  I do think the card design is a little eh but the game is fun and fast.  I cant wait for the next expansion and I really cant wait for the sets from the original trilogy.<hr>Neal Razi said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>matt, i think the version they tested was probably different.<br>
<br>
Dude, tearing up your cards was, uhh, smart... hey, do me a favor, next time you want to tear up some swtcg cards, send 'em to me, and uhhh, i'll tear them up for you.<hr>matt wehner said on Thu May 9 2002 <br>Wow!  Neal talked to me!!! Badass:)  Hehe, just kidding Neal.  For awhile I hated decktech, but then somehow that goofy Tractor Beam deck I created managed to find it's way to #1 for about a month.  You guys rule.  Going to any Cons this summer?  I'd love to get together and play a game of SWTCG against the guy who runs decktech.  Would be fun..<hr>Antoine Fortier said on Fri May 10 2002 <br>The game give a great balance between players. It's not a game for competition but only for joy and play. LEt it a chance<br>
<hr>shawn nitcher said on Sun May 12 2002 <br>I think Mr. Garfield could of done better  than taking the abilities off magic cards changing a couple words and putting them on scenes from the new movie. <hr>Sean Trimm said on Tue May 14 2002 <br>I think all of the CCG players are upset and blinded by their fear of change...Yoda in a Y-Wing? Chewbacca on Dagobah? WTF? Why? If you are talking about being true to the series, how can you put up these examples as why you like the game? Goofy, if you ask me. Why play a game where you rewrite the series any way you want? Then its just MadLibs on cards....Or a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (remember those?). Gameplay with stories that modify the story they are based on just doesn't make sense to me.  That to me is more 'kiddie' than a combat/strategy game.  The TCG isn't rehashed Magic, it's a NEW GAME. Get a grip. Things change in life, you either roll with the changes or get left behind whining about how things were in 'the old days'.<br>

  <hr>Bill Persell said on Tue May 21 2002 <br>Greetings. Given the loyalty displayed by the SWCCG gamers, I can see why there are those that would be hostile. I would like to point out that  when Magic first hit the shelves, it was universally panned by the conventional Gameing community (I speak, of course, of the D & D community, the minitures community) I would suggest the following....Hey folks! Give it a chance. If the game does nothing more than bring in a younger generation, then the entire TCG/CCG community wins. With it's simplified game mechanics, easy to learn instructions and potential for strategy, this game provides a perfect forum to introduce cards based games to a whole other demographic.
