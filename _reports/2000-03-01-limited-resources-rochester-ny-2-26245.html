<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Decipher Swiss tourney at Millennium Games and Hobbies in Roche NY. Director Richard Buckner (Rogue 18). 19 (?) participants.<br>
<br>
Well the weather was great this past Saturday and I got the feeling I should be out playin frisbee or something instead of sitting inside a windowless comic shop floppin cards all day ... nahh.<br>
<br>
My DS deck: TIE/lns and Sienar Fleet.<br>
My LS deck: My EPP Yoda w/Snake deck that nobody liked, check it out on my page. Only made one small change - took out the 2 Tunnels for 2 Visored Visions.<br>
<br>
Heeeeere we go:<br>
<br>
Round 1, Game 1:<br>
My DS vs. Dan's CC drain bonuses ?<br>
Think about your local card shop, and the players there. Can you think of a player who religiously attends tournaments, buys boxes and boxes of cards, but can never seem to finish in the top half of a tournament? This kid is our shop's version of that. So of course I have some preconceived notions as I go into this game.<br>
I start Wakeelmui and Twilek for SFS, he gets Leia's Hut and Signal for Goo. 'This probably won't do much against you,' he says. So why's he deploying it? ....<br>
My opening hand has Endor and a PotF (schweet). But I don't have any capital ships, so I just deploy the Endor/PotF for activation and draw. I get Vengeance (extra schweet). He goes and deploys some random 2/1 CC site. I'm like whatever, activate, drop the Vengeance to Endor, two TIEs accompanying for free (retrieve my Twilek), and I've got a nice drain of 3 for the rest of the game. He eventually gets Massa Luke w/Ani's and a Proficiency Downtown, but I drop my beautiful foil U3PO there and Luke goes elsewhere :-) I also get Dreaded Imp Starfleet out to cancel another of his drains, and set up shop at a PotF'ed Kashyyyk with a Dread and 4 TIEs (All Power in hand of course). He tries to spread out, but U3PO owns Downtown, and DIS cancels his second biggest drain, where Luke had gone (West Gallery?), so I'm not losing much, and what I am losing I'm retrieving (hrmm, I don't need this Torture, I'll toss it to a drain then retrieve the nice destiny 6 into my deck next turn). He Revolutions Endor to make me drain for one less, but CtR is in my hand and I drop it, search for Evader, and say no-no to Revo. That's about all he's got, he loses a Pucumir of the top to one of my drains and curses, 'That was my only one!' I Short-Range for 8 late game, and my lost pile is near empty when I drain him out.<br>
Full win by 26<br>
2 (26)<br>
<br>
The good: Gotta love easy first-game matchups.<br>
The bad: Ehh ... not much.<br>
The ugly: One Pucumir??<br>
<br>
Round 1, Game 2:<br>
EPP Yoda w/Snake vs. Kevin's RalOps/Tempest Scouts<br>
Kevin had played against this deck last week and lost horribly to it, and he wasn't ready this week either. He started Broken Concentration, but I overcame it quickly. I Signaled for Battle Plan.<br>
I'm not too familiar with RalOps, but he seemed to be proceeding rather slowly, and by the time he flipped, Test 2 was near completion. Of course once he flipped I started fearing a Failure/Cave combo, but for no reason, BrokCon was his only MWYHL defense. He had about 5 drains out on Ralltiir, and I shut down two with Projections and one with Boussh. Every now and then I'd Surprise Assault a lone Tempest Scout with a tracked 7 to keep him honest. That and my Anger Fears dealt some early game damage. He also spread to Kashyyyk with some random capital ships to fulfill Battle Plan, but of course I Clawed his drains there. After flipping, he rarely used the objective to get a card, I guess there wasn't much he felt he could do.<br>
This game was pretty uneventful except for one turn when he activated, then deployed Secret Plans, then announced a drain on Ralltiir. No way, said I. He pleaded with me, but the dude's a 1700+ player so he should know better.<br>
Anyway, I pretty much shut all his drains down and completed my tests. Once I got Test 5 done (and paid 10 for the phat retrieval) I sent Old-school Obi and his Saber to my Carbonite Chamber for a game-ending drain of 3 (with some help from AFA). Most of his guys had already been deployed to Ralltiir, so he was stuck. I Off and On The Edged (each once) to empty my lost pile, though I had a lot on table.<br>
Full win by 18<br/>
4 (44)<br/>
<br/>
The good: My deck just went perfectly as it is supposed to.<br/>
The bad: Not a very exciting game to write about.<br/>
The ugly: Cmon Kev, get your phases straight! =P<br/>
<br/>
Round 2, Game 1:<br/>
EPP Yoda w/Snake vs. Joe's Helmsmen/numbers.<br/>
Joe's been playing this deck forever, I can still remember losing to it in my first tourney at Millennium in September 1999. Anyway, he starts Death Star and Decree, I start Battle Plan.<br/>
My opening hand contains a Don't Forget the Droids, so I am happy. First turn Yoda is at his Hut with his Hope and Luke's Backpack just waiting to be transferred. Joe's first turn, he drops Hoth AND Yavin systems (I make a random comment, 'Both systems in opening hand?' - not like I care, my deck doesn't drain anyway =P). I go, get Luke and Test 1 out, still looking for an Anger Fear, I draw up all. My second Dont Forget the Droids! I figger hey, I'm set.<br/>
WRONG.<br/>
Next turn, he activates. Then pays 4 force. 'Lost.' Of course, it's a frickin Monnok!! There go my DFTD's and, really, my only hopes of winning. He then proceeds to deploy a VCSD and a couple Helmsmen to Hoth, gives me a 3720 to 1, and I'm screwed.<br/>
I spend the rest of the game trying to avoid the inserts, but it just can't be done. A couple turns later he deploys Ability x3, so I have to activate and deploy something each turn (usually a ship which I Claw, or Jeroen or Obi on a ship, blah blah). He's not draining any because of my Claws, but the inserts and AAA make this not a very fun game. He's not playing CHYBC or Secret Plans, so I get EG-4 set up at the Carbo Chamber and start Off The Edging him for retrieval, but that just can't keep up.<br/>
I complete the 5th Test and even get a 7, but I can't do much as I wasted my Obi in space earlier to satisfy AAA. I start battling to try to kill off his VCSD's, but he's got serious forfeit fodder on em, so even my 7's don't make their impact fast enough to deal with the numbers cards. And AAA was still taking it's toll every turn too.<br/>
Full loss by 14<br/>
4 (30)<br/>
<br/>
The good: No CHYBC or Secret Plans.<br/>
The bad: The Monnok on my DFTD's, of course. Inserts hit me 5 times that game, for at least 7 each time.<br/>
The ugly: Losing to a bunch of VCSD's and Imperial Helmsmen.<br/>
<br/>
Round 2, Game 2:<br/>
My DS TIE's vs. Rob's LS Tosche/Hut start with Celebration?<br/>
Heh seems like every tourney I bring my TIEs to I end up playin Rob with em. So he knows my deck pretty well. I've got a decent idea of what his is, so I start Milwaukee and Twilek for There Is No Try, fearing S/A. I know he's not gonna come to space against me (he knows better =) so I get ready for a drain race. I draw Fondor, the Ex, a copy of Sienar Fleet, the Death Star, and Kuat (yeah baby). So first turn I deploy all the systems, draw a little, let him go. He deploys Mos Eisley, Ben to the Hut (move to Tosche) and draws. I go and drop SFS so I can retrieve my Twilek =) All Power lost to get some TIEs, drop the Ex (on second turn, oh yeah) to Fondor, 3 TIEs with it, and a PotF too. He drains for 1 at Tosche, deploys Cantina, draws, Alters SFS and the PotF on Fondor (loses the Alters and 4 force also to There's No Try). I draw and eventually get a Dread to Endor with some TIEs, and Bossk in Bus holding Kessel down by himself. Rob is Shuffling Ben and Han in the Cantina, and draining at the Jundland Wastes with Luke and someone else (Leia?). I get another PotF out (this one on Endor) and U3PO to stop some of his drains, and start stacking my TIEs for a Short-Range. When I have nine of em out, I play it, he goes to Sense, but nope - it's immune. I retrieve 9, including my second PotF (the one he Altered earlier). He tells U-3PO that he's Sorry About the Mess, so he's draining at the Cantina again, but then I get Dreaded Imp Fleet out and Twilek for the long-lost PotF again. He decides to Alter DIS before I can even use it, but that's fine with me, he's losing three cards and I'm losing one. Plus I still have both PotF's out and am draining for 6 a turn. We're pretty even down the stretch, though, and it ends up like this:<br/>
My turn, I've got one card in hand, one in reserve. He's got 6 in hand, 3 in reserve. I'm draining for 6, he'll be draining for 7 (Cantina, Jundland, Eisley, and various Saber bonuses), no Battle Plan or Order on table. I drain him for 6, he drops his whole hand, leaving him with just 3 in reserve. He thinks he has me, then .... bang! I play the one card in my hand - Limited Resources! Game over, I win by 1.<br/>
6 (31)<br/>
<br/>
The good: Limited Resources baby!! That card rocks! Mad props to There is no Try also as he lost about 12 cards to that throughout the game.<br/>
The bad: Not much. Good game Rob.<br/>
The ugly: We knew each other's decks, and the game was just a drain race. But oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Round 3, Game 1<br/>
My DS vs. Dave's Profit and Arconas ...<br/>
I knew this guy's deck too, had played against it last week. Unfortunately for me I have no ground in my deck so I can't do much about lone Arconas draining at the Jundland Wastes for 2 &gt;=0<br/>
Anyway, I start Kashyyyk and PotF knowing I'll need an early jump. He starts something meaningless (Goo Nee Tay?).<br/>
I get some ships to Kashyyyk first turn and drain for 3 there for the rest of the game. After he has nine in lost pile, he frees Han, then proceeds to spread out over Tatooine. I get Milwaukee and SFS out mid-game, but that can't save me from his ugly spreading out on Tatooine. He's draining me for like 8 at 5 different sites, then I'm losing four to the objective. I set up in space with Endor and a PotF, and even at Fondor for a drain of 1, but I just can't keep up. I get U3PO and Dreaded Fleet out even, nothing helped. Short-Ranged for 6 mid-game. He just out-drained me, with major help from the objective. Bah.<br/>
Full loss by 3<br/>
6 (28)<br/>
<br/>
The good: Not much. Drain race.<br/>
The bad: Friggin Arconas on Tatooine! Makes me wish I had a Vader in my deck, I could play Rebels Wont Escape Us and smack those gay salt-smokers upside the head with a saber! =)<br/>
The ugly: Not a single player challenged my TIEs in space today. I think I shall have to rename my TIE deck to ... The Notorious T.I.E.!<br/>
<br/>
Anywayyyy...<br/>
Round 3, Game 2.<br/>
EPP Yoda vs. Brett's Big Blue somethin-or-other.<br/>
He starts the Death Star and Twileks for CHYBC or something. I Signal for Battle Plan as usual.<br/>
I go first for the 5th time in the tourney =) and get Yoda to the Hut first turn. He drops some twix sites and draws. Luke comes out on my turn and gets ready to talk with the Great Warrior. Brett takes his turn and deploys ... the Dagobah Cave. I'm not very happy, to say the least; I figure if he's playing the Cave he's playing Failure too. Just to save you, the reader, the suspense and worry, I will tell you right now that he did not deploy Failure at all this game =)<br/>
So I go and complete Test 1, then he takes his turn and deploys Kessel with a Dread and IG in 2000. I play Visored Vision during his draw phase (I hadn't drawn the card at all yet this tourney), call Control (what was I smoking?), and get nothing (of course).<br/>
I do have Lando in Lowrider in hand, so next turn I send him there and Claw the drain. Test 2 is complete also, and I have an AFA floatin around in his deck somewhere. So next turn he deploys DVDLOTS, his Saber on him, and Tarkin to the Dread, then transfers them to the IG-2000, and I can see what he has in mind. He flies Iggy and crew over to Dagobah and says go.<br/>
I, however, have in my hand a lovely WB OBi-Wan Kenobi and his foil Saber. They and Jeroen Webb go on the Falcon, and follow that evil IG-88 to the Dagobah system. Meanwhile our good boy Luke finishes Test 3 (at the Cave, nonetheless).<br/>
He goes, pays 3 to drain for 1 at Kessel, then lands the ship right on top of Luke and Yoda.<br/>
I go and complete Test 4, then deploy Test 5 on the Hut and move Luke/Yoda over there. The Falcon lands there and Obi and Jeroen get off, ready to rumble.<br/>
His turn he pays to drain at Kessel, then marches Vader and Tarkin over to the Hut. IG also takes off to the system.<br/>
My turn, I decide it's best not to flip Luke upside-down just yet, and initiate battle instead. Swing at Vader, draw two 5's, one of which Tarkin cancels. He swings at Luke, draws a 4 and a 2, starts to rejoice, until I remind him - Test 3 is done! Luke lives, and I lose the Falcon to attrition (he loses Tarkin).<br/>
His turn, he drains then starts another brawl at the Hut. Vader swings at his boy again, but no dice. Obi hits Vader and he goes packing along with about 8 force in damage. I lose Jeroen to attrition.<br/>
I go, and set Luke up on his head.<br/>
He decides he hasn't had enough, and deploys another (Premiere) Vader with Saber to the Dread at Kessel, scoots it over to Dagobah (leaving the Bus at Kessel to drain), transfers Vader to the Iggy 2000, then lands it at the Hut.<br/>
I say whatever, and pull a surprise move on him by deploying the Carbo Chamber and Boussh there (break her cover immediately), then Red Leader in Red 1 with a Claw to Kessel so I satisfy CHYBC and can retrieve ten when I complete test 5, draw a Bionic Hand, and flip the objective.<br/>
He goes and battles, swings at Luke and misses horribly again. Obi takes out Vader and he has some battle damage to deal with (Iggy in 2000 helps with some). Then he moves the Dread back to Kessel, draws, and I go. I drain for 3 at the Carbo Chamber, and I'm thinking this is how it's gonna end up, but then he U3POs that drain, and I'm not quite prepared for Undercover spies. So the game is at a lock:<br/>
He has a huge stack of ships at Kessel, more than I can hope to take on with only Red Leader and Lando, even with a BD of 7 every time. I have Boussh at the Carbo Chamber, and she's near-invincible with immunity to attrition less than 6 with Test 3 and Yoda/Hut, plus she creates attrition of 7 against anything he fights her with. However, she's only good for On/Off The Edge since her draining is stopped by U3PO. I have no other ways of dealing damge except AFA's, and he won't activate, as he is at a standstill also.<br/>
So I just retrieve everything with Edges and that's that.<br/>
Timed win by 35<br/>
7(63)<br/>
<br/>
The good: Shootouts at the Hut, and our hero Luke surviving them all!<br/>
The bad: Brett told me this game dropped him to even differential [6 (0)]. Sorry Brent!<br/>
The ugly: The game was a chess match, but I really wasn't in the mood for such a game since it was the last game and didnt matter much.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up in 6th, one of the poorest showings I've had in a long while. I'm pretty sure my LS would've gone undefeated had I not got my numbers protection Monnoked that game (that REALLY sucks). And I think it's time to retire the TIEs for a while, it's no good when everyone knows your deck ;-)<br/>
Anyway, props to the winner, Charles Clarkson, maybe you'll get over 1900 with this one. You woulda lost had I played ya foo' &gt;=)<br/>
I got one big fat pack o' Reflections for consolation, pulled Avenger foil. Ehh. Thanx fer readin. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
