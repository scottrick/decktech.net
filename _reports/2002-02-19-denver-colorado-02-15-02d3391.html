<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">  Genghis Con whats up with that? it was crap there were like three or four tourneys and they all sucked I could have gone to greleey to play the same games but over all I can’t complain cause well I walked away with a foil Maul w/ stick so that ain’t bad at all but the others just sucked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tourney #1 sealed Deck Booster draft <br/>
Game #1 well thats all there was because I was the only one to show up.<br/>
<br/>
Toueney #2 02/16/02<br/>
Game  #1  well as if that wasn’t a crock of @#$%, at first I was the only one to show up, then out of the blue a second player shows up and plays a jank @#$% game the guy I played was a serious jack @#$% poor attitude and just took the fun right out of the game.<br/>
Game #2 well I played the same guy and I don’t really want to go into what I just went through in the game abov.<br/>
<br/>
Tourney #3  02/16/02<br/>
Game #1 well that was fun I played Fanchi that was a good Game I just had my @#$% handed to me in a lunch box and politely asked to eat my lunch good game though. It was a quick game it went by fast Fanchi and I got into a drain race right away, then he played the gayest part of WYS and retrieved aloy of force then he jsut flat out won the drain race.<br/>
Game #2 I played Craig still a good game but things just didn’t add up right and I didn’t have as much fun as I did in the first game.  I just set up and went to town had great fun actually winning for once in a great blue moon. <br/>
Game #3 I played Tom M. that was a good game but I once again I lost but thats all good, I only lost by 8 thast kool and that was against a WYS  as well, I just had Loads of fun and well Like I said before I lost.<br/>
Game #4 well I played Craig again and Lost and once again I don’t have much fun in this game and we will leave it at that.<br/>
Tourney #4 <br/>
well that wass supposed to be the Team tourney and that didn’t happen I wish it had but it didn’t and well sice I was the on;y one to really be there again I got the trophey that was just handed to someone. Well thats all folks for this tourney report.   Peace out Ed </font></td>
