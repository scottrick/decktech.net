<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament from Modesto weekend before Christmas(ya!)<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
Finally the school year is coming to the end and Christmas break is about to start.  Since<br>
about October I decided that I was gonna quit and have stuck to it till about a week ago.  <br>
I see on our listserv that theres gonna be a tournament on Sunday the weekend before Christmas.  <br>
A urge to want to play again builds up and I decide to bust my cards out of the garage <br>
and throw some decks together.  Problem I dont have any R3 or Theed.  I hop online and order some<br>
up hoping it will get here by Saturday so I can build decks.  Friday rolls around and<br>
school finally ends(YES!).  I go home and my stuff hasnt come yet.  So I build the decks<br>
I wanna play minus the cards I need.  Saturday comes around and the boxes actually come<br>
and I realize that I still need most of the dshields and 3 Qui Jedi Master.Crap.  I get<br>
the most part of my decks together and head out Sunday morning early hoping to get <br>
some trades to complete my decks.  I show up and the store is preety deserted execpt for<br>
Andrew Meewis.  I buy some packs of R3 hoping to get what i need.  I pull Qui-Gon and a <br>
dshield.  Robert Selby and some friends show up and I end up getting everything <br>
I need from him which is crazy.  Now im ready to play and my decks are set up perfect.<br>
We start around 1 with about 12-14 people there.<br>
<br>
Decks<br>
LS:  Combat High destiny Spies<br>
DS:  Comat Racing.  Hope it works<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Alex Stefankos Hunt Down<br>
<br>
We start off and I get an ok draw but I havent tested this deck and can already see <br>
problems.  He draws up on his first turn and we lose to visage.  I drop QuiGon to the <br>
Generator with his stick and drop honor the prevent damage.  He loses first strike right <br>
off the top.. Good stuff.  He no escapes it back and drops Lord Vader and Veers against <br>
Quigon.  Battles and retrieves then weapon levs my saber.  Plays Command and hits up<br/>
Quigon for about 5 more.  Ouch.  I take Visage now great.  He drains me for a few turns <br/>
while I set up my hand.  I clear off his Vader in combat and move over to the generator core<br/>
while we both take damage.  This time Obi wan gets beatdown by vader again for 3 more <br/>
breakthrough.  I clear him off the board and drop Qui to Core with Yoda and Luke to<br/>
Jedi Chamber.  He deploys a Stropper Garrison to Core which I it can wait back to his hand.<br/>
I move my guys over to prevent beatdown next turn.  His garrison comes back and draws. <br/>
I hit a edge for 6 force or so and play Mace and battle killing the garrison and a few<br/>
breakthrough.  After that we just lose to visage and my drains kill him in.  FW(+7)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning a close one<br/>
Lows:  Deck needs some changes<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs Eric Shannons WYS Palace Raiders<br/>
<br/>
When I saw this I knew it would be problems since this is Kevins brother.  He <br/>
doesnt have a podracer which is good i guess.  I start off the race and get maul<br/>
and his double to the Core and set up my hand some.  He goes for a Dbay but its<br/>
not in there so I verify his deck early which was a big help.  Grabs Kesssel<br/>
from deck and draws the rest.  I hit him for drain of 4 and race.  I save some<br/>
force and draw some.  He gets a palace raider in craft to tat dbay and luke with stick<br/>
plus talon to cantina for the flip and gets another dbay.  I drain which he it could<br/>
be worses and race which I havent won yet.  I set up Vader with saber to the other site <br/>
and save more and draw.  He drains me and searches for Falcon again but its not <br/>
there.... good stuff for me! ;)  Then saves more and draws some.  I drain and race<br/>
which i win finally but only have 8 left in my force pile.  I just get on with it and <br/>
retrive and lose.  He sets up Dash and Outrider to Kessel and Phylo to Dbay with another<br/>
Palace/Craft to another dbay.  I drop a spy to Cantina which helps with drains which<br/>
are getting bigger.  I play Emperor to Pod Arena and save force.  He drains for about <br/>
6 and Retrives with Celebration.  Then plays Meanace Fades which limits my drains some.  <br/>
He saves up most of his force.  I drain for 5 and play Boba BHunt and Xizor against 1 of <br/>
the palace raiders.  Battle.  He reacts and we draw destiny.  I get 2 and i guess he gets<br/>
2 since it adds.  I clear a Raider and Craft while he clears me out.  He drains and retrieves<br/>
with celebration.  and moves around some.  I drop Mara against Palace/Craft and we clear out.<br/>
His drains are cutting into me and im getting low on force but so is he.  He retrives a few<br/>
and drains for some and draws for Falcon.  Again I drop Mara with stick against Phylo and<br/>
kill her with 7 breakthrough.  After that the drains get him in but it was a close and<br/>
fun game.  FW(+6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning Another Close one<br/>
Lows:  Not much deck seems solid cept for few cards<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
LS vs Paul Feldmans SYCFA Space<br/>
<br/>
So I get to play Feldman.  Fun.  I knew this was gonna be a good game from the start.<br/>
He hasnt played for a while so he didnt know how to play against the combat decks.  <br/>
Plus I played against it before and had the shocking in there to stop Merijek.  He starts<br/>
by getting Rendilli and D* War Room with Merijek there and gets Kashyyyk.  I get a preety <br/>
good start with Jedi Council Chamber and Qui-Gon to Generator.  I shocking<br/>
the War Room so he cant pull a System but he grabs it which sucks for me.  He comes down <br/>
with Maul+Stick and Ponda Dr E. Ig with Riot and battles.  Lucky for me he misses both hacks and draws<br/>
low and I draw a 3 and have to lose Qui and a few but it coulda been worse.  I drop Boussh<br/>
where mauls at and Threepio to Dbay.  He gets a Dreadnaught to Kashyyk and gets Naboo out.<br/>
He drains there for almost the rest of the game.  I get a few duels in against Maul and <br/>
kill him with Qui-gon.  I send Yoda and Qui against Ponda Dr.e Iggy and 4-Lom.  <br/>
He moves them all over to Obi and Mace.  I tell him that Iggy is lost and he goes why.<br/>
I tell him cause of the objective and I am gonna beatdown on Ponda and 4-lom but he<br/>
ghhhks out.  Then he says that I couldnt kill a droid cause its not ’Present’ but a <br/>
droid is ’Present’ but doesnt have ’presence’ right.  Someone Answer me.  Anyways<br/>
after that he drops U-3po and blocks a drain which shouldnt have happend.  Oh well. <br/>
After that all i get is drain for 2 and hes getting 4.  Game.  FL(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Close game but I think i got rule screwed by TDs and weak Squad Members<br/>
Lows:  Not much fun game!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
DS vs Alex Stefankos Reinholds Combat Racing<br/>
<br/>
This game was fast, hard, and furious for who i bet your asking.. Read On..Were both <br/>
racing and combat..  interesting!.  I flash and start off the race with a bad destiny<br/>
1.  Gay.  I get out Holotable for some activation but I cant deploy crap cause of <br/>
Goo Nee Tay.  He gets out Qui Gon fast on this turn with a Combat card.  We race and <br/>
I draw a 4 and he draws 2 5s which makes him 1 behind.  I drop down Maul with his double<br/>
against Qui-Gon.  Combat.  He pulls a 6 from Combat and 1 from Deck.  He Strike Blocks <br/>
my Combat which was a 7 but I draw 2 7s again.  Qui-Gon Dies and 4 from top of deck. <br/>
He just draws up on his turn.  I drain for 4 and race.  7 baby and he draws a 2 and 6.  <br/>
But steps his 6 and my 7 back.  I set up my hand more.  He comes down with Obi with stick<br/>
and a combat card.  Combat.  He pulls a 5 off his guy and 3 from deck.  Once again 7 from <br/>
guy and 6 from deck.  His guy dies with 4 more AGAIN.  The deck is rolling.  I race on my <br/>
turn and draw a 5 and have 21 to his 22.  I drop Vader and stick to the Core with a Combat<br/>
card.  He comes down with Mace against Vader and again loses the Combat.  On my turn we <br/>
race.  I draw a 7 and he draws so were both even at 27.  I decide to play Collision.  It<br/>
gets through and i put Han/Chewie Falcon into his hand.  So I retrieve my 6 and he loses 6.<br/>
I move my guys together.  He drops Corran to the Podrace Arena for drains and Obi to Core<br/>
and inserts Odds.  Great I dont have Cannot Hide.  I get around it though.  I drop Emperor<br/>
To make my total higher and go to kill off Obi in Combat which I make him lose 4.  He drains<br/>
and combat which I finally lose.  Numbers Pops on my turn and he loses 4.  After this we <br/>
have some combat here and there and I kill him with Mara and stick against Corran. <br/>
FW(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Deck Killed<br/>
Lows:  Not much<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs Nick Stefankos DS Combat<br/>
<br/>
This game was fairly quick.  All we had is lots of combat battles which was fun.  <br/>
Nothing really exciting happend.  We combat and I win some and he wins some but <br/>
gets unlucky with him losing all his Mauls and a few Vaders early so He didnt have Much <br/>
to fight with.  FW(+32)<br/>
<br/>
Going into the last game and have to play Nick again<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs Nicks RST Beats<br/>
<br/>
His deck was supposed to be a fast kill and looked anti combat with not many Jedis.  I<br/>
start the race off with the box on table.  He doesnt have strike planning so i get lots <br/>
of force.  I play Flagship Bridge and draw waiting to see what he does.  He plays Threepio <br/>
and Jedi Council Chamber.  I race and drop Maul to Generator so he has Power +2 and play<br/>
Holotable.  He comes with Lando and Luke with Stick.  He misses the hack but I have to<br/>
lose some breakthrough.  I come down with Vader and stick against him and battle.  I hack<br/>
and hit him for some breakthrough but we kill each other.  He then OOCs Maul CRAP!  I<br/>
gotta work around this I guess.  I set up Emperor to Core with Janus there.  Luke comes<br/>
back with hit and run and takes out Janus.  I drain and play Visage to Holotable for some<br/>
drains.  After this it seems like he doesnt have anything else left.  He plays Queen<br/>
Amidala to Endor RLS along with Threepio whos been sitting there for a while.  I deploy<br/>
Xizor and Boba BH there which kills his plan of Were you looking for me.  Battle and kill<br/>
off both and about 10 more which preety much seals it.  FW(+27)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Little Shaky in the beginning <br/>
Lows:  Need some anit beatdown stuff<br/>
<br/>
All and all I think I played ok for how long its been since Ive touched my cards.  I go<br/>
5-1 with about 94 diff which is good enough for 2nd behind Kevin(as always).  Got some<br/>
Theed and pulled Nute Gunray Ai and Queen which is preety cool.  Look for Tr from <br/>
next weekend.  Hopefully Ill get to go.  If you guys have Qui-Gon with Stick or Lord Maul<br/>
D-mail me.  Thanks.  Later ;)<br/>
