<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tourney was a nice break from the rigors of college life.  I left school on Friday for the 3 1/2 hour drive home.  I arrived home and did the typical weekend stuff, just hanging out with friends.  Sunday rolled around and I got ready for the quick 4-gamer at Dragon’s Den.  I arrived, did a little trading, and we got started.  We had 9 but Randy, the TD, decided not to play, leaving 8.<br/>
<br/>
Light Deck-Version of Raveling’s Watch Your Step, tweaked to local meta with anti-scum.<br/>
<br/>
Dark Deck-RalOps with AT-ST’s.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game one - DS vs. Isaac Denke’s WYS/Harvest<br/>
<br/>
I started RalOps, Prepared, IAO, Mob Pts., and Secret Plans.  He starts WYS, Frigate, Menace Fades, DODN/WA, and Squassin.  First turn I dropped the Exec: Dbay and jungle with an At-St pilot on TS3.  He searches for Kessel, but he activated it, so I got to see his entire deck on the first turn.  He was playing plenty of Harvest’s with Lars’ and the farm.  He was able to grab the Outrider with Dash and Mirax, deploy them to Tatooine, along with I’ll Take the Leader, and move over Raltiir.  I drain, deploy the forest, Cor: Dbay, and Thrawn with an At-St pilot to the forest and pick up all but one.  He drains and picks up a few.  I just drain and pick up looking for an imperial to flip.  ON his turn he gets Cpt. Han and Wedge on the Falcon at Kessel.  He also lands the Outrider at my Spaceport Dbay.  This kind of screws things up, because I was planning on flipping next turn.  I dropped Lord Vader, Tarkin, and Xizor against his smugglers.  He loses Mirax and the Outrider.  Next turn, he deploys another Outrider along Talon and moves them up to the system.  I take the opportunity, deploying Bossk at Raltiir to flip and land him at the Dbay.  Now he’s draining for two and I get a Presence on the Forest to help the drains.  He then gets Owen &amp; Beru at the Lars’ Farm, along with a Raider and Patrol Craft, and plays Harvest twice for 8.  I then drop Mara, Iggy, and TS2.  Capturing the Lars, I was able to beat up the Raider, but he had enormous forfeit, of course.  After a few turns of maneuvering, the Falcon was still at Kessel, the Outrider was at Tatooine, and Bossk at Raltiir.  Isaac brought down Melas and a Cap’n but Melas felt the barrier.  Mara moved to the Tat: Dbay, so the Lars would never see the light of day.  Jedi Luke found his stick and decided to hang out at the Cantina for a turn or two.  Tarkin and Vader came over to Tatooine as well.  The Outrider started chasing Bossk around Raltiir, Rendili, and Tatooine, but could never keep him in one place.  4-lom visited Luke and Vader and Tarkin joined them.  Luke ran to the Dbay and Isaac kept drawing and playing the Wind Chimes.  After a couple turns of maneuvers and drains, there was a showdown at the Tat: Dbay between Vader, Tarking, 4-Lom and Luke.  The dust cleared and 4-Lom was left there scratching his head.  The next turn, time was called.  We counte up force and Isaac had 8 to my 7.  I would have drained him out in two turns.<br/>
<br/>
TL (-8)  0(-8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing a very good game that could have gone either way.  <br/>
Lows:  Not much interaction.  Our guys just chased each other around the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were the last game to finish, so we got set up for the second round and got going.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game two - LS vs. Adam Nemmers’ MKOS<br/>
<br/>
I start WYS, Frigate, Ins., and Staging Areas.  I would have started Aim High, but I don’t have one and neither did anyone there.  He starts MKOS with Jabba’s Palace, TINT/OE, Power of the Hutt, and No Bargain.  His first turn he tries to go for the flip but forgets that he needs to occupy two battlegrounds to stay flipped, so he drops Mighty Jabba and Gailid at the Audience Chamber.  I abandon the first turn flip in order to put Artoo and A Gift in the Audience Chamber.  His turn, he tries to flip with the Lower Passages and Audience Chamber, but I remind him that I deployed the Home One: Dbay.  I get Mirax in the Skate at Tatooine and Chewie, Protector and Lando with Blaster at the Cantina for the flip.  He comes down with Guri and Xizor.  I shoot Guri and draw a five to kill his guys while Chewie goes down to destiny.  I get Talon and a Cap’n at the Cantina and Lando and a Raider at the Dbay.  He gets Dengar w/Carbine at the Audience Chamber to sniper Artoo.  Chall and Bib take the Spaceport Dbay and an Abyssin and Ephant at the Lower Passages.  Bubo comes down with Myo to the Tat: Dbay.  Bubo eats Lando and Myo hits the Raider for two.  This was his gravest mistake, though.  My turn, I tunnel vision for Luke w/Saber, then from lost pile for Han w/Blaster.  Luke gets barriered, but The Bith Shuffle &amp; Desperate Reach becomes my new favorite card.  Bubo gets chopped and Myo gets shot and beat for 21 force.  That pretty much ended the game.  After that, there was whole lot of maneuvering for better drains, but only one battle.  Fett in Slave 1 went after Mirax, but we both drew 5’s, he added 2 to a 3, but Wedge went aboard next turn.  Jodo Kast came down against Talon and a Raider in a Patrol Craft hoping to Hidden Weapons the Raider, which I’m not sure if he could do, but Barrier was played from lost pile to stop that.  I let him have his Palace drains because I was draining for enough to kill him before he could kill me.  I drained him out after a bit.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+9)  2(+1)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Huge beatdown.<br/>
Lows:  Winning only because he made one stupid mistake.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty quick, but there wasn’t a whole lot of time between games.  We paired up and I was still pretty low in the bracket.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game three - LS vs. Aaron Stevens’ Raithal Ops<br/>
<br/>
He started Imperial Occupation at Raithal with the Forest, Twi’lek and Expand the Empire.  I had the same as last time, only with Ounee Ta, as well.  I just had mad activation the entire game.  He picked up for the first three turns.  I was a little leery about going for the first turn flip because I feared trooper beatdown.  I dropped Talon at the Cantina and Mirax at the Tat: Dbay.  He dropped Garindan and undercover to stop the drain at the Cantina.  I just maneuvered my hand to get a decent beatdown crew while he picked up and dropped sites.  I added a Cap’n at the Cantina and Dash at the Dbay.  He eventually deployed a Raithal Operative, IT-O, Barquin D’an and Bossk with Gun at the forest.  I dropped Lando w/gun for 1, a Raider in Patrol Craft for free and Han w/Blaster for 1.  I love Ounee Ta.  After shooting Bossk and the operative, I lost Lando to the Tank and he lost the site and several more.  I held that site and took over the Spaceport Dbay at Tatooine for some small drains while he put the Tyrant and a TIE Interceptor at Raithal.  He then dropped the Avenger alone at Tatooine.  I brought a Raider in the Skate and a Cap’n in the Outrider.  I didn’t even draw both destinies.  I was feeling really bad for the kid.  I was in complete control and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it.  The game ended a few turns later.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+25)  4(+26)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning<br/>
Lows:  Beating a scrub hardcore.  I could tell he wasn’t having fun, and that’s the point of the game.  I ended up giving him like five packs at the end of the tourney.  I hope he got something good out of them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This game ended real quick, but I didn’t feel like watching any other games.  We called pairins for the final game and I found myself playing Dom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game four - DS vs. Dominic Nemmers’ QMC Sabaac<br/>
<br/>
I start the same as last time and he starts QMC with the Downtown Plaza, Frigate, DODN/WA, Battle Plan, and Ounee Ta.  I decide to not deploy any sites to Raltiir until I have to.  Arnet goes to the Exec: Dbay first turn for some activation.  HE drops the Casino and picks up.  I get and At-St pilot on TS2 at the Cor: Dbay and let him go&gt;  He deploys Cloud City and picks up.  I get TS1 with Arnet and draw for my three sites and let him go.  He gets Lando and Lobot to the Casino but I Set For Stun Lando before he can do any Sabaac.  I flip next turn with an At-St pilot at the jungle, tarkin at the forest and move everyone around.  He brings Lando back down with a Z-95 Bespin Fighter and Wedge in RS1 at CC.  He gets the flip and moves up to Bespin.  I search and get a Presence at the Forest and the Dbay.  He deploys Red Leader in Red 1 to Bespin and Sabaac’s a couple of times.  I start draining a lot, and he loses a lot of Sabaac’s.  The Executor comes down with Zuckuss to kill the Z-95.  The other two ships run to CC, so I flip him back, cancelling CC Celebration as well.  Vader and Xizor visit the Casino along with TS6 to kill Lando.  Drains take place, for me at least, and he tries to position his guys.  I give up the Caino for the Plaza when he brings Obi, Luke, Corran, and Lando back.  Bespin becomes the main battle ground, where I have Zuckuss, Bossk, Executor, and Chimaera against Home One, RLiR1, Wedge in RS1, a Z-95 and Han in Falcon.  After the first battle, Zuckuss, the Z-95 and RLiR1 go down thanks to some good destinies.  After the second battle, it’s down to the Executor, Bossk, Home ONe and Han in Falcon.  After the third, it’s the Executor vs. Han in Falcon.  Han runs to Cloud City and hides.  The Emperor and Janus go to the Spaceport Dbay to drain for three and we end up in a drain race, where he’s draining for..oh..none.  He doesn’t have enough to retrieve for his Sabaac.  Any Sabaac’s that do happen end in ties.  He did end up with Mara’s Saber and Fett in Slave 1, though.  The game winds down and I just have him in a complete lockdown.  <br/>
<br/>
FW (+19)  6(+45)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Big battles at Bespin.<br/>
Lows:  Sabaac<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I end with a decent finish, taking third.  Adam beat Mason Crawford in the final game to take the victory.<br/>
