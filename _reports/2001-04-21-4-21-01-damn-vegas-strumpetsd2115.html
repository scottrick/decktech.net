<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">-This tourney was run by Tim Guzman, who was expected to win based on the fact that every tournament director has won his own tournament here for awhile, with one or two exceptions (namely Brandon Gravo). Anyways, it was held at our usually tournament place - Awesome Hobbies. We only had 10 people show up, two of them late.<br/>
<br/>
-My decks:<br/>
Light: A marvelous example of great German engineering - Wilkenhaus’ Watch your step deck, with two changes (Bith shuffle/desperate reach and Menace fades for a freighter captain and a few manuvers.<br/>
Dark: My Agents of Black Sun deck that has done exceptional for some time. I will be posting it with the recent changes under the name "Somebody set up us the bomb." Look at it if you want to see perfection.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My light vs. Jeff Lavigne’s Set Your Course Manipulation bullsh*t deck.<br/>
-First of all, Jeff usually plays Ralltiir even though it doesn’t work so well anymore. This is the first tournament that I have seen him NOT play ralltiir ops. Anyways we do our starting stuff and I get a crappy hand - only one character and its mirax, the rest is red. First turn, he screws me and gets nothin. Then he deploys Miyyoomith and Captain what’s his name that lets him pull screws. Great. First turn, i grab HO:DB and deploy mirax to tattooine since Kessel isnt there. From there on, it was pretty much a drain race as he deploys vader to cantina and like three scrubs to the db. I drain three and so does he. I backup my crew and we pretty much wont be battling eachother as I cant keep a character and he cant find any space. I try to use mirax and tunnel vision to get something, but i get screwed every time. Then he comes to space with fett and zuckuss, which cant touch me. I chase him around, losing my drain three, then decide to stay at kessel. He comes with bossk and dengar while deploying search and destroy. Now, i run from him and find melas to deploy to an unoccupied site. He transits dr. E. and butt-buddy to melas and we fight. Both are lost. Whatever, He drains me out and pisses me off. I lose by 19.<br/>
-After the game: I play Jeff in Raw deal where he proceeds to beat me 2 out of 3 games with XPac, the guy who sucks the most in the game. Now the clouds seem to be coming in to ruin my sunny day.<br/>
The good: Jeff finally changes his deck.<br/>
The bad: Jeff finally changes his deck (I would have beat his ralltiir).<br/>
The ugly: Zuckuss and Fett running from Dash and a freighter captain, I mean what kinda wuss does that?<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My dark vs. Brandon Gravo’s Watch your step (same as mine).<br/>
-The night before, I had played against this deck twice, pissing him off so much that he quit halfway through each game. Then he plays me with his EBO that went undefeated at States - it lost too. So he goes into this game with the mindset that he is going to lose. I dont remember much about this game, but here goes. We start and I get an awesome hand, but since I forgot to start with a Xizor, I have to redraw. Then I get another crappy hand. I move Xizor to the Coruscant:DB and put a vigo there. Second turn I flip and he puts a dash and ship to kessel. Next he spreads out and puts another Red 10 to tatooine. I deploy zuchuss to tatooine, he gets barriered and i frown. I put 4Lom on it for backup. Next turn he goes with wedge and ship to spaceport db on tatooine to save a force, puts cannons on red 10 and initiates. Zuchuss gets reamed. The next turn I lose stinger and bossk off the top. Meanwhile, the emp and xizor are chillin with vigos to accompany them at the cc:db and ds:db respectively. Luke wants to chill at the cantina, along with Han and a captain. I go down with Snoova and jodo cast, but snoova gets barriered. That damn card screwed me out of two beatdowns. He runs to the db next turn and I get to drain a little, since i have to pay. IG comes down to the other db and the emp comes over to have some fun. The hunters come outside to have an encounter, but get let down as he moves back into cantina. I follow and see that i have an always thinking with your stomach in my force pile, so i dont move the emp and IG to force a battle. Next turn he moves over and I set up a five for the drain. I get luke missing. He finds him and runs while he drains me out in space. I lose again by 14, but the deck is still 2 and 1 against the number one rated deck on decktech.<br/>
<br/>
The good: Getting luke captured.<br/>
The bad: Stupid drain at Kessel that I couldnt touch.<br/>
The ugly: I whooped him twice last night, but I lose when it counts.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My dark vs. Matt Berta’s our most desparate hour mains deck.<br/>
-I’ve played against this deck before, and before this tournament, this was the only loss against my dark in like 25 games. It was a timed loss that I could have won if I wasn’t so stupid. I played hidden weapons and he sensed. I had a control but forgot to play it and luke would have been captured and han would have been raped if I paid attention. Now I want retribution. This game starts out as usual, I set up and he puts luke alone with his toy at tatooine db. I get my favorite card and he drains. I play my always thinking and he senses, this time I remember to play the control. I get luke and he looks like he wants to cry. He deploys Ben with saber and some scrub to that site. I only have a snoova, but what the heck, I go down battle and capture ben. Yeah! I play Jabbas through with you and kill the scrub too. I then transit some backup for snoova. Later I have snoova, the emp, and a vigo at the db and he brings lando with booya ax and tawass khaa to scrap, takes my ax and goes for the emp with lando. i draw a five and the emp stays. Tawass uses her ax and gets the emp out. He gets 2 destinies to get a five, so that I have to lose snoova (Vigo’s forfeit is four). He draws two ones. Ha! Tawass runs to Home ONe and Snoova chills. From there I pull Search and Destroy and He is Shut down. I win by 23. I get my retribution and smile because my dark now has a positive win loss ratio against anything its played.<br/>
The good: capturing ben and luke getting hungry.<br/>
The bad: Tawass could have stolen two of Snoova’s axes. (He had another weapon lev. if we battled)<br/>
The ugly: Admiral Ackbar in Matt’s deck. He doesnt belong there as there are definitely better people. Sounds like a deck building problem to me too. Also me being so out of it that i screwed up the math on both matt’s and my command cards after the game.  <br/>
-During this game we hear somebody yell "Germans ROCK!" Turns out is was Brandon as he Power pivots the executor with like ten guys on it and hits Kris Lavigne for battle damage of 42. Later he finds out that it could have been more because he forgot power destiny for red 10. He gets Lavigne later for another battle by twenty to win the game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My light vs. Tim Guzman’s Court - Space/Anti watch your step deck.<br/>
-I’m just glad that I did not have to play Tim first game like usual. I’ve played him first game more than 40% of the last couple of tourneys. We start and he gets cheerio at the executor db and fatty jabba to the audience chamber. I put Han to the cantina so i dont have any court damage (im holding a dodge, weapons malfunction, and an old ben in hand). He wants to take Han but waits a turn after deploying Battle order. I drain and have no backup for han so I want to draw, the only problem is that Tim is holding a monnok. So i only draw a couple and get the droid combo and lando. He comes with IG and fights Han, I play the dodge, and he draws his six, saying something about tracking and how much of a SWCCG god he is and I say he is full of crap because he just shuffled and had some blind luck. Well the droids and lando come down to fight IG. He tries to rule that only droids fight with 3PO + R2’s game text, but I point out that he’s wrong again. I miss with lando, play the slight malfunction and he sends the droids to my used. He loses Ig on attrition and I old ben lando and han joins him. Next turn He comes with Mara and Dengar and fights, He loses dengar and i lose both homies. I throw down talon karrde to cantina and luke to db, play bad feeling, initiate, luke runs over and slices mara. She punks luke and the site clears with him losing mara and 14 to battle damage. Next turn, my other han and talon come back to the cantina thanks to dunee ta. I go to space to with Red 10. Vader picks a fight with the pair of smugglers and everybody but han dies, how fitting. He comes with zuckuss and a lat. damage on red 10. I lose the ship and pilot. Now he is controling space and han gets to the db somehow (i forgot). He moves xizor out to the pit and transits piett, cheerio and merrijx to tatooine. I deploy wedge and fight, piett gets shot and I clear the site while losing wedge. He now has jabba, xizor and space with now other characters in his deck. I cant find any space but I find chewey, he goes down and fights xizor. Im telling you, if chewey missed with blaster proficiency, he sucks, but thankfully barely nicked xizor. They both die. Han moves to cantina. Jabba comes out and i lose to space drain. Luke fights jabba, cant hit him and they both die. he lands zuckuss with four cards left. I drain for two and move to block drain at db. This is where I admit that I am THE dumbest Star Wars player on earth. Even after Kris says that if I lose after battle with mara, I suck, i go ahead and do this. Tim battles and kills Han. I am stupid because I cant find anything to cause force loss. He wins by 2.<br/>
The good: Mara dying a deserved death. "Germans ROCK!"<br/>
The bad: Me being STUPID and not winning.<br/>
The ugly: Xizor and Jabba sitting in the chamber for half a game. What were they doing in there?<br/>
During the game: Tim is asked for a ruling. I seems that Luke is under Fetts captivity and wants to be fed to the sarlacc, but the question is that if the sarlacc fails, is Luke freed? Tim gets a little confused and says yes and that sarlacc must eat fett after, then changes his mind when he hears that Fett is on jabbas barge and is doing it during control phase. Somebody says it is a reinactment of the movie. Now answer is no. Tim says that all Shane has to do is play the signal to win the game. <br/>
Brandon wins the tourney and Little Lavigne comes in second. I think I took like fifth or sixth.<br/>
That concludes my report and be sure to rate my awesome dark when I post it in the next 24 hours. It rocks just like it would if it were engineered by a German. </font></td>
