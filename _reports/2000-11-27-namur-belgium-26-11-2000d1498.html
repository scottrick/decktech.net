<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is the report of my sunday’s tournament during which I have won :-)<br/>
<br/>
Pre-tournament:<br/>
I was so disappointed for not going to the Bochum’s tournament last week that I was very happy to make a belgium’s tournament again. I just wanted to play Hunt Down because I haven’t played it for so long. So I have built one and playtested it this saturday: OK Janus is just the man for the duels ! In lightside I chose the same fabulous deck as Jimmy Faelens my friend: it’s a quiet mining colony which retrieve a lot (on/off the edge and tracked perfect sabacc). This deck is a tracking machine :) So I went with some friends to Namur in BELGIUM. 24 players showed up for this tournament so it was very good...<br/>
<br/>
Game#1 Dark against Patrick Stevens (Profit)<br/>
I started Crush the rebellion (to avoid clash of saber) in addition of the traditional IAO/Mobilization Point. I added Mara Jade and Dr. Evazan in Audience Chamber. I pulled off Rendili and executor docking bay for activation. Since I can’t afford deploying Lord Vader I deployed mara’s saber from reserve deck. We lost from Visage and he took his turn: Ben Kenobi + his saber + master luke + Kal faln c’ndros against Mara + Dr. Evazan. He tried to send evazan in my hand but failed. I hit Kal and she is emmediatly operated by the evil doctor. Ben Kenobi suceeded to hit Mara and after battle destinies, my 2 characters were dead (I lost 3 more forces) and Ben just revived Luke. OK it was a bad start since he released han. At that time he was draining of 2 and I was losing 1 from profit and 1 a turn from my own Visage. I just put Janus on executor for activation and to plan some tracked destinies. I drew a lot and played Monnok (he had no card against duel)... I then put Lord Vader &amp; Saber + Tarkin, initiated Vader’s Obsession and drew my tracked masterful move + visage. Of course I won the duel , he gave me Luke and lost 5. I initiated and hit Ben. He failed to hit Vader (I think he wanted I lost like him from Visage), I canceled his destiny and Han took the attrition (he flipped back)... I then moved at Jabba’s Palace to drain for 3. I put Boba in Slave 1 at Rendili. He lost from my two drains and visage and drew a lot. He put Lando with vibro axe on holotheatre and canceled my visage. I took it back with no escape, put IG-88 in front of Lando and initiated. I captured it... Without Luke and without lando he couldn’t stand in front of Judge Dred (Lord Vader + Saber) and Tarkin. I used Masterfull move like a reactor terminal with Janus (replace a card and draw your masterful move, play it with no hologram in the deck and redraw it each turn). My drains and visage stopped the game fastly...<br/>
FW 2(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Game#2 Light against Jean Philippe Buchkremer (Ralltiir Ops)<br/>
When I saw his objective, I felt very bad. I couldn’t drain if I didn’t flip (it’s hard to hold on Bespin system against Ralltiir). Like all the Ralltiir ops, he set a big activation with Carida and Mobilization Point. But Jean Philippe was playing Biker Scouts and Speeder Bikes instead of At-Sts ! Since I was playing Patrol Craft and Palace Raiders, I feared High Speed Tactics :( At the end of his second turn, Ralltiir Ops was flipped. I have just put all my sites and drawn a lot of cards. I drew a card which will perhaps help me: Surprise Assault. My strategy was to track big destinies to play it and then retrieve it. But the first card I lost from my deck was Off The Edge. So he immediatly pulled off Something Special Planned For Them :( I put a pile of characters on Cloud City (including Patrol Craft and Palace Raiders) to avoid a lost Monnok. I then recycled some 6’s and he should have thought it was for On/Off The edge. So he drained on a site where 5 cards where present (all unique Biker Scouts and Speeder Bikes with a total power of 10). I played Surprise Assault with a tracked 6/6/5’s destinies. A 4’s and a 3’s have been added and he had to lost 14<br/>
 14 forces :) Then I transited on Ralltiir to avoid one drain and to force him to play an early High Speed Tactic (I had a stack in hand to grab it). My plan worked and he played one with his lone Speeder Bike. I grabbed it and lost my Patrol Craft. Since his force pile and his hand was small (because he has deployed and lost a lot of cards) he moved away is Biker. He stopped draining by fearing another Surprise Assault. He didn’t come on Cloud City due to my lot of battle destinies (Palace Raider, Lando with Blaster, Han EPP and Luke EPP). Then I played an Off The Edge and an On The Edge (they were placed out of play) to retrieve 12 forces. I came back on Cloud City, added Patrol Craft and good aliens (Raiders and Taws Khaa or perhaps Melas I don’t remember...), spread out and flipped. He read my objective and started his turn: Zuckuss came on Bespin and flipped it back. He went on Ralltiir to avoid a beatdown (I had retrieve a lot of cards and I could activate a lot). I played Tunnel Vision and took Home One. I put it with Hash’n and Thaneespi then added I’ll Take The Leader: the Super Home One was now complete ! I put the Celebration and moved a patrol craft on Cloud City sector and flipped again. He organised his troops to drain safely (with just Lord Vader for example). But at that time my drain of 7 (1 on bespin, 1 on cloud city, 1 on casino, 2 on dowtown plazza and 2 on the docking bay with the admiral order) couldn’t be canceled or modified ! My celebration retrieved all my lost pile and I won without cards in it :)<br/>
FW 2(+31)<br/>
   4(+53)<br/>
<br/>
Game#3 Light against Marc Thery (Hunt Down)<br/>
He started quickly with Palpatine on my Casino. I lost a few from this drain and Visage. I pulled off all my sites to activate a lot and draw cards which allowed me to go fight. He has added Vader early to prevent him from losing from his Visage. I put Mantellian Savrip with Lando ECC and a palace raider aboard a patrol craft then moved before his guys. He added some small characters for forfeiture and initiated. I drew 2 poor battle destinies (1’s and 2’s I think) and I had to lost Home One for Savrip :( I start tracking my high destinies to retrieve a lot of cards and allow me more maneuver. But he put Something Special Planned For Them. However, I retrieved 12 forces with On/Off The Edge and deployed Luke + Han EPP aboard another Patrol Craft. Now he had to lose also from his Visage. I succeeded to track a 5’s and a 6’s to make perfect Cloud City Sabacc with Lando on Casino ! So I could retrieve the forces I lost from Visage. I followed Vader and Palpatine with Han and Luke. A lot of battle took places and my Savrip help me well. But he has put Insignificant Rebellion so I lost some forces. When he realised I was going to win this game, Boba Fett in Slave 1 came on Bespin system to drain and Marc put another Palpatine + Sim Aloo + Janus Greejatus + Presence of the force on Lars Moisture Farm. I answered with a palace raider and harc seff aboard a patrol craft on tatooine docking bay. I took once the drain on bespin but canceled the other with Harc Seff. Then I activated all my reserve deck, played Tunnel Vision, took Home One in hand and put it on Bespin with major hash’n. I couldn’t cancel the drain on the farm with Harc Seff that turn and he reinforced bespin with zuckuss but he coudn’t battle this turn. I realised that the celebration was stacked on Insignificant Rebellion but I continued to make some tracked perfect sabacc. I shuttled Melas on Home One to have more than 6 in ability. At that time my drains, my  perfect sabaccs and his Visage started to reduce his deck’s size. So I won a game which had started bad for me due to the high pressure...<br/>
FW 2(+17)<br/>
   6(+70)<br/>
<br/>
Game#4 Dark against Fabien "Red 71" Jacques (Mind What You Learned)<br/>
Fabien started with Draw Their Fire, Battle Plan and You Insight Serves You Well. So I had to be careful about Draw Their Fire/Frozen Assets combo. I began by setting up my activation: Rendili and Death Star Docking Bay (executor docking bay was in my force pile). I also took immediatly Holonet Transmission to avoid Transmission Terminated. I drew a few and we lost from visage. He pulled off Yoda on his hut for 5 forces (Yoda came from his hand) and we both lost again from Visage. I deployed executor docking bay with Lord Vader (without his saber) who transited on Death Star Docking Bay. I didn’t lost from visage but not for long ! He played 2 tunnel visions and put some 2/0 locations for a big activation. He deployed Obi Epp against Vader, initiated and hit Vader due to Your insight Serves You Well (he drew a total of 6 in weapon’s destinies). My battle destiny was 2 and his was higher. Yoda reduced the attrition so Obi lived and I lost Vader and a few cards (including my Cloud City Docking Bay :( Fabien has lost 2 millenium falcons from reserve deck from Visage so I deployed Chimaera and Ozzel on Rendili. I played my holonet transmission (since visage is hurt me too) and took Janus who went on Executor Docking Bay for activation and tracking. Then he canceled my visage with transmission terminated :) I drained a few on Rendili, put Lord Vader+saber with Janus and drew precious cards like You are beaten, Disarmed and Trample. I didn’t want to fight before having Crush The Rebellion (to prevent from Clash of Saber and Destinies adders). I then drew Mara Jade and my Barrier. Fabien felt the beatdown so he deployed all his mains (han, leia and luke) with Obi Wan. He put Count Me In, I’ve with you too and That’s One. Mara+saber came into the Yavin 4 War Room for a drain of 3. I caught Crush The Rebellion but since I didn’t find my Monnok or Masterful Move and since he had played a lot of Tunnel Vision I chose I won’t try the duels. Instaed I recirculated them for some 6 destiny. When I got Dr. Evazan, I deployed him, Tarkin aboard a blizzard and moved Lord Vader+saber before his mains. I played a Trample on Luke and drew a tracked 6. At that time the Trample and the 6’s are both on the top of my force pile and my reserve deck was empty. Fabien started his next turn and I immediatly redrew the Trample with Janus (so the 6’s was on the top). On his control phase I used Disarmed on Han Epp and operated him. So he lost in one time half his army and his diabolic effect (I’m with you too). And I had my barrier and the trample ready to stop another guys. He couldn’t afford initiating a battle and Obi+Leia+Chewie came on executor. At that time I was draining for free of 6 (with my sabers) and I added Palpatine on Death Star with Janus to enhance my drains. He drained a few on executor (even with his own Battle Plan) but I had a few cards in hand to throw up. The game ended very quickly...<br/>
FW 2(+15)<br/>
   8(+85)<br/>
<br/>
Game#5 Dark against Jimmy "My Master" Faelens (He was playing the same deck as me)<br/>
My third starting effect was Crush The Rebellion for that game. As usally I pulled off Rendili and Executor Docking Bay. I put Vader, DLOTS on his Casino in my first turn. He lost during the first turns from that drain and my visage (I didn’t...). He pulled of all his sites too. In my second turn I added Tarkin aboard an AT-AT with Vader. On his turn, he played a tunnel vision and apparently he took Harc Seff because he deployed it aboard a patrol craft along with a palace raider. So he canceled my drain every turns and I followed him prevent him from draining. I searched for my Death Star Docking Bay to avoid harc seff, but I had to show him my deck :( So Boba Fett Fett in Slave 1 went on Cloud City sector for another drain of turn. I added the lightsaber on Vader to make him pay more forces with Harc Seff. He was still losing from my visage and now I drained on his Cloud City sector. So his deck’s size was reduced slowly. I play monnok and he lost 2 on the edge. Since I have seen a cloud city sabacc and an Off The Edge I twilek for a Secret Plan. I put Sim Aloo on Executor to check is destinies if needed and Zuckuss on Bespin System (he had no starship in hand). He succeed to hide Obi Wan in a patrol craft (I had to lost from my visage). So on a CC site he had Lando with Harc seff (in a craft) and on a second CC site he had Obi and a raider (also in a craft). I couldn’t block his two drains (he could block mine on the ground with Harc Seff) so I lost from one drain and Visage. On my turn I drained higher than him (CC + Bespin system). I moved in front of Harc Seff and Obi Wan (he had reorganized his troops moving harc seff with obi). I played Weapon Lavetion on my 4 cards used pile. I took Mara’s Saber and my 3 other cards are 4’s, 5’s and 6’s in destiny. Since my reserve deck is empty those 3 cards recirculated. On his turn, he played a CC sabacc to prevent me from dueling this  turn. I could have drawn a perfect sabacc but instaed I had 5 and 4. I stop drawing to keep my 6’s on the top. He put Luke + Han both in a patrol craft and they took off on Cloud City to stop my drain. At that time, all his characters on the ground were present since the patrol crafts took off. I played Trample on Harc Seff, drew the 6’s. I didn’t activate on my turn, drained on Bespin and on Vader’s site. I moved Vader and Tarkin before Obi then Boba Fett on Bespin. During his control phase I disarmed Obi, played the Circle is now complete and drew the 6’s and the Trample. His destinies are medium but mine were big and Vader’s had his saber. Jimmy lost 9 and I didn’t lost from the visage anymore. Visage + my drains are too high for him and the game ended...<br/>
FW 2(+20)<br/>
  10(+105)<br/>
<br/>
Game#6 Light against Matthieu Buchkremer (My Kind Of Scum/Chevin)<br/>
I was very confident since I was the lone undefeated player and a My Kind Of Scum deck don’t put pressure. He established an early drain of 2 in Audience Chamber with Mighty Jabba, Boelo and Gailig. I deployed quietly my troops on Cloud City: Lando in a craft with a raider and Han + Leia both aboard another craft (to avoid disarmed + dr Evazan). We were both draining of two when he came on Cloud City. The most bored character was Ephant Mon since I can’t react neither with Han nor with Lando. My Savrip served me well and I sent some suicide characters (EPP obi and leia) before Ephant Mon to try to kill him. I protected them with Savrip and in case of Masterfull move I had a Narrow Escape in hand. My first attempt to kill Ephant (with EPP Leia) failed but the second (with EPP Obi Wan) succeeded :) In the first battles he had retrieved my early drain with Scum and First Strike. He occasionnaly retrieved Ephant Mon, but Matthieu didn’t have enough characters to stand before mine. So I could easily spread out on my three sites, cloud city sector and Bespin system. I flipped my objective, put I’ll Take The Leader (to enhance my drain on dock) and the celebration. And I was tracking some perfect cloud city sabacc :) He started to deploy all the jabba palace sites with alien on each (he had sure None Shall...) and he drained like a mad with Gailid every turns. But he never drew secret plan or stack ! So I played my sabacc, and on/off the edge quietly. In addition of the celebration, I retrieved all my lost every turn. He eventually played Omni Box but I stacked it and continued my retrieval combo. I was draining for 7 and he couldn’t use Den Of Thieves. At the end he was (funny) angry by my retrieval combo...<br/>
FW 2(+20)<br/>
  12(+125)<br/>
<br/>
So I won this good tournament (24 players) during which I had played some interessing and hard games. I have gained some CC and Death Star II boosters + the jabba sealed deck’s light cards. It is the second concecutive times I win against my own master (see  my last report of Paris FRANCE on my own page ...)! So I keep the first French place by rating...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Jean Marc for organising a free (yes !) tournament with a lot of boosters distribued during the game (if you lost at the first or the last table you gain a Death Star II boosters) and at the end !<br/>
