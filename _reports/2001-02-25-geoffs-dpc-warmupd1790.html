<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">here’s the beef:<br/>
<br/>
i’m starting to worry about saturday (’cause it was supposed to rain alot and be generally sh1tty weather).  only about 30 people show up, and at the last minute, girard is like "hey alread, gimme your dark deck" so girard plays his dumb light deck (WYS...which i’d beaten twice earlier that day) and joe’s Court Mains.  i play the same damned decks i’ve had for like...ever (Blitzkrieg and Hidden Phil), ’cause i hate trying to find time to experiment with new stuff, and organizing everything for this damned weeked was driving me nuts.  <br/>
<br/>
i’d picked up girard and lingrell at the bloomington-normal airport on thursday, and we’d gone and played some Counterstrike on the LAN here at my store.  fun stuff...and the 4 of us (alread too) just kinda hung out for awhile.  uneventful night.<br/>
<br/>
okay...next day (friday) i get up around 11:30 after staying up playing lingrell like 4 games until about 5.  i’m like "girard! get your a$$ crack off my couch and play me with your WYS which you claim is so nasty!" so he’s like "mumble mumble...mountain dew" good thing i’d stocked the fridge.  so we play 2 games ’cause the first game i positively wrecked the b1tch-beaten Lars family for like 7 cards.  the second game my 14 attrition at the system wrecks his space contingent (which consists of beefed up outrider and SUPER falcon of course).  me 4 (+34) ...or something like that.  girard 0 (-34) ...yeah of course ...heh.<br/>
<br/>
so i get a phone call from the store at about 1:30 and it’s amanda and she says "geoff: a mr. Steve Brentson called for you and he’s waiting for you at the airport"...SH1T!! i forgot about brentson.  so i get brentson, and we all head to the store (Cyberia/Gamer’s Haven) and they hang out while i take care of store stuff.  30 people are here for the 6pm tournament (and the winner gets in free saturday).<br/>
<br/>
game 1 DS vs. steve brentson’s fake base tatooine celebration. <br/>
<br/>
i start out fightin’ him at the tatooine system, and then at the Docking bay, and then at the other docking bay...and i’ve got 3 cards on insignificant rebellion.  out comes harc seff (my arch nemesis) and sits in the cantina w/ lando/ben kenobi and drains me for 3 in there.  he runs to rendili and i cannot follow, and cannot hope to contend with the 20 power he has there (for i’m out of ships after winning at the tat. system).  i get secret plans, and he retrieves a bit with OTE, and finally drains me out after retrieving some 15 force or so (there was some celebrating on tatooine earlier).  <br/>
<br/>
0 (-14)<br/>
<br/>
game 2 LS vs. some guy<br/>
<br/>
i won.  it’s fuzzy, but retrieval is cool.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
game 3 DS vs. TJ holman’s TRM (new-er style)<br/>
<br/>
holman is fun to play against, as always.  his first turn he uses strike planning to get Walex blissex and Crix Madine.  wtf.  Walex is like lame as hell...but not THIS walex.  this walex has an AFRO!  i dig the disco walex, and tj is activating about 20+ force per turn because he drops like 4 twix locations on turn 1, plus walex to H1:db.  this is fine, cause i don’t think he’s running any battlegrounds (’cept maybe 1).  i make a mistake.  i put emperor at rendili docking bay for activation with blizzard walker and 2 pilots for activation bonus, he invades DS2 throne roon with TwassKha and cracken.  i’m not prepared for this, and it screws me for the entire game.  i lose CHYBC off the top, and there’s an immense throwdown for like 8 turns at rendili between home 1 and the chimaera w/thrawn and about 4 pilots....i stack 8 cards on insignificant rebellion, and when i cannot beat tj out of the throne room, turning luke is going to be impossible.  lost this one by 15, but it turned out to be closer than you’d think...because of all the back and forth spread-out 1 on 1 fighting because of first strike AND dtf.  he ended up retrieving quite a bit after i retrieved alot...and back and forth, and then his drains got to be too much.  <br/>
<br/>
2 (+8)<br/>
<br/>
game 4 vs. derek hwong’s SYCFA/Space stuff<br/>
<br/>
i run around in space, he gets emperor at d*:db and i drain him down alot, he probes my base eventually...<br/>
<br/>
i cut the emperor w/ luke and get orrimarko at the db to hold off further imperial incursions (with backup obi/melas) and then start retrieving w/ OTE and OMDH ..which i’m beginning to think is pretty damned gay.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+38)<br/>
<br/>
so i go 2-2 losing to some good games, and that’s all good...got to take a look at Tj’s scum deck and we laughed about it alot (Scum and T1tties...Leia’s Fetus...Leia’s Clit...OH and the one for No Bargain with Luke’s d1ck in Bib’s ear...what a scream...jackoffasaur)<br/>
<br/>
and now the fun part of the evening is at hand.  i close up the store and we head out for a night at the bars and food, etc.  me, chris hunter, matt berta, tim guzman, mike girard, scott lingrell...but brentson just wants to sleep..so he sleeps on the floor of the store until we get back at about 2am.  i’m supposed to have some dudes from michigan stay over...and they’re out somewhere waiting until we get back.<br/>
<br/>
this bar called rocky’s has an "18+ policy" and so we go there...heh.  hunter is like...mackin’ on some teenieboppers, guzman is guzzling sambuca, we all do some shots of rumpleminz, berta is screaming something about guiness, and girard is bustin a move.  i am wearing the "ghetto do-rag" and people are calling me "justin timber-slut" and i’m wasted ...and we go get pizza and go back to my apartment (and lingrell drives ’cause i’m too far gone).  <br/>
<br/>
best part of the cons:  Secret Squirrel.  we invented this format at d-con 2000 while i was wasted and running around pissing on cars at the doubletree parking lot.  you just get 4 people, and you all split up a box of UL premiere, open all the packs without looking at any of the cards, and you have to play with ALL CARDS FROM BOTH SIDES IN YOUR DECK!!!.  it’s cool as hell...ex-specially when you’re drunk and Girard KILLS OFF YOUR LEIA W/ HIS On The Edge after saying 6!!! whoa.  <br/>
<br/>
past highlights of Secret Squirrel format:  girard actually pulls off a 4 point OMDH!! I play "bad feeling about this" and Warrior’s Courage and do like 20 damage.  I tallon roll girard’s Y-wing with HIS tie L/N.  lots of fun stuff!<br/>
<br/>
this time we threw a 2nd anthology into the mix, and i get mon-mothma, AND the MonCal cruiser which i deploy at yavin.  Imperial Helmsman wins a battle at the dark side Yavin IV jungle piloting an Saurosub and being under nightime conditions.  Leesub sirlin takes about 12 cards from girard (including lat. damage), he b1tch beats my jawa for about 12 cards, but i get out reactor terminal and counterassault his 2 jawas and a stormtrooper for like 16...and then my tie scout drains for 3 at LS kessel for like 10 turns.  i win by about 8 cards, thanks to "we’re doomed, 2x ICBWorse, Timer mines, etc"  <br/>
<br/>
what a blast.<br/>
<br/>
tomorrow is the DPC #1, and i’ve got to open the store at 8am....and i’m wasted...and it’s 5am.  sh1t.<br/>
<br/>
more to come!<br/>
