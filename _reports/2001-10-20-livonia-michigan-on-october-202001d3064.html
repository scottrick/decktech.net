<br/>
Ok so Ive been hearing about this league Clint Prong has been running in Livonia for the last year or so. He promotes it heavily on decktech and screwy.net and even sends personalized e-mails to players to get them to show up. As a result he gets huge turnouts and he always has tourney foils. Oh and he also updates ratings within a week in a completely accurate manner and even double checks Bojo to make sure everything goes through ok.<br/>
<br/>
I havent played a sanctioned tournament game in literally 6 months but I figured I still understood the environment and will show up and give this league thing a chance.<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
<br/>
Dark: A Watto deck with racing that began as a clone of Bastians but I altered it to include more Mauls and some Mauls Strikes and 3 enter the bureaucrats and a grabber.<br/>
<br/>
Light: A very outdated profit with like Master Lukes and starting premiere Han in the chamber.  You know how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: dark versus Tristan Gruber(1700) playing HB flip with matching pilots<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I start Wattos box and he starts three effects one of which was squadron assignments and another was the aim high combo. Opening hand I draw Watto and 7 interrupts so Im stuck and spend two turns drawing up a huge handsize looking for characters. He grimtaashes used, damn it. Before I even flip Watto he flips HB, which is NEVER supposed to happen. The turn after he flips he has ships at Coruscant, Naboo, and Kiffex and is ready to drain. I look on in fear, BUT WAIT; I for some reason drew all 3 copies of enter the bureaucrat last turn. He drains at Coruscant and I get to throw them down on all 3 of his systems, thus insuring he will never drain for more than one the rest of the game. Next turn I win the race and get out search and destroy. For the next 15 turns we sit there, him draining for 4, and me search and destroy on each of our turns. I end up winning by 6 due to the swing from the race.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+6)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: light versus Gary Deluca(1719) playing court with choke vader mains<br/>
<br/>
I thought court was dead, but it was alive and well at RIW where about 6 players were using it. He starts Dr.E+Ponda and Mara in the Chamber. By turn 4 he has Dark Lord with Saber and Tarkin in there helping them. I get tired of taking court damage and sitting there like a scrub so I deploy master luke and ben with some people to the site. Thanks to big destiny draws, and the fact that I grabbed his sense, I end up clearing the site over 3 or so turns. He was racing with wattos box but I retrieve almost all of it when I get the Han back because he still hasnt found secret plans. He ends up in a bad situation when mara is facing off against like 5 mains and takes a pile of battle damage. Two turns later maul suffers the same fate. Battle damage ends the game quickly. Full Win by about 20.<br/>
<br/>
I notice my driving buddy who lent me the majority of the cards Im playing with today lost to Nick Glazer and his Watto because of a gameplay mistake. Jim out of commissioned Watto mid-game but because he is out of practice he let Nick drain normally with unflipped objective for the next 6 or 7 turns. I cant interrupt mid-game but when I bring it up in front of Nick after the game he does this hilarious acting job and pretends like he didnt know it was illegal. Come on dude youve played 200 sanctioned games in the last 6 months and are in the top 20 in the world, I KNOW youve read the Watto objective before. <br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+26?)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: light versus Dan Clark(1616) playing dark mains with combat response ties<br/>
<br/>
He started the Ralltiir objective as a fake out or something and then proceeded to put some ties at Sullust while trying to bog down my profit with a choke vader and friends on my sites. His mains fight with my mains and both of us lose several characters. Eventually I win because his support characters are tie pilots and mine are guys like corran horn and lando with axe. Profit damage far overwhelms his drain of 2 in space. Full win by about 20.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(+46?)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: dark versus Nick Glazer(2120) playing WYS<br/>
<br/>
Ok Nicks been playing the same WYS for a long time, heres a rundown of how it goes:<br/>
3 control/tunnel visons<br/>
2 It Can Wait<br/>
2 On the edge<br/>
There is alot of other stuff in the deck, but its really Nicks skilled playing of those cards several times in every game that kills you. <br/>
I manage to flip first turn due to a Palpy in my hand and get some good early damage going. Things get bad though when Jedi Luke with saber backed by some interrupts takes Mos Espa from 2 of the Mauls I play. Things are neck and neck and then he on the edges 3 times for 15 retrieval, and It Can Waits my only ship on 3 consecutive turns. Game over, I am completely destroyed. FL by a huge margin. <br/>
<br/>
FL 6(+16)<br/>
<br/>
I gotta give Nick credit he plays very solid now. James and I however both went 3-1 and have plans for revenge :)<br/>
