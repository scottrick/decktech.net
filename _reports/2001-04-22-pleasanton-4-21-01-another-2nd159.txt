<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament from Pleasanton 4/21<br>
<br>
Prelude:<br>
<br>
The week starts off with crap of SAT testing for 4 hours each day.  So I cant wait for the weekend to get here.  After 3 days of SAT testing Friday finally comes.  Chris comes by wanted to test out his EBO deck that he made but decides that it doesnt work so he puts back together his HB Mains deck.  Over the week I decide to build a WYS deck since Ive never played it before and wanted to make a descent deck for states.  After the deck finishing we go to Carrows and get our brownie for luck and call it a night.  After thinking some that night I wanted to play my ISB deck that Ive been building over a while but needing cards still.  I wake up the next morning make a last deck check and were off.<br>
<br>
We arrive there fill out the cards as Im looking for stupid CORPORAL OBERK but nobody seems to have him so I say screw the ISB idea.  We have to wait a while for Alfred to get there saying hes bringing 2 more.  Shawn Ely gets there and we start with 18 or so.<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
<br>
LS:  WYS what was I smokin when I made this staging, squadron, insurrestion<br>
DS:  BHBM My way or the Highway<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Nick Stefankos CPI D* start<br>
<br>
Well great he destroys anything with a starting system.  I thinking to myself how am I gonna beat this.  So we start.  I go with Luke to Tat dbay for activation and pulling H1 dbay.  He draws up and plays defensive fire to get rid of my chance of flipping next turn.  I pull Mirax with Pulsar Skate to Kessel with Melas to Cantina flipping.  He drops most of his sites getting Emp to Conference moving to Parsec 4.  I drain him for some and set up the Celebration on Tat with Lando to Cantina and Raltiir Capt to Dbay using dash at Tat.  He blows away hoth setting up some more with a day long remembered making my guys deploy + a lot.  He gets to Parsec 6 almost to tat but his decks getting small.  I have Theron Nett and tat playing another Cptn to Pulsar and moving them to D*.  He ends up blowing away Tat but the drains are too much in the end.  FW(+22)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Winning with WYS learning how to play it.<br>
Lows:  Tatooine getting wasted.<br>
<br>
As we sit there waiting for the next game to starts Alfred walks in and along with him Ohmy Fasudhani.  I havent seen Ohmy since about a year ago so I cant wait to see whats up with him.  Alfred calls me over and tells me he needs some crap since hes building his WYS deck right there.  So I give him some stuff and the games start.<br>
<br>
Game 2 <br>
<br>
DS vs Nick Stefankos RTP mains super high destiny<br>
I played against this last week in a fun game and I won because of Force Lightning/Young Fool on leia combo.  So we start off.  I go for Rendilli with Emp and Janus to D* dbay.  Leaving 1 for the Barrier.  He craps 8D8 with his seeking an audience with a lift tube moving him to Detention Block.  I drain then going Vader and a saber to Yavin 4 dbay(WHY ISNT IT A NONBATTLEGROUND) leaving 1 again for the barrier.  He frees leia getting 4 back as I play imbalance.  He drains for 4 then getting Luke against Emp and Janus.  I barrier.  So he moves the lift tube for more forfeit.  And playing Bacta Tank.  I drain and make a strike against them.  I deploy IG-88 and 4-lom for extra destiny.  He on edges leia for 6 and misses.  She goes to the tank as I blank lukes text as he plays lift tube escape on 8D8 for some odd reason.  So I beat up Luke for about 13 more then me moving Vader into Massai War room.  Then by moving Emp and Janus to Yavin 4 dbay wait for leia to come for a force lightning.  He does but I dont lightning along with lando who moves into the War room flipping.  I drain and play sniper on leia killing her and battling long Lando for the game.  FW(+22)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Beating Luke for 13<br/>
Lows:  Wheres Mara during all this??<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 <br/>
DS vs Phillip Greens OHDM <br/>
<br/>
So we start.  I go for Rendilli and dropping Emp to D*2 dbay.  He drops Corulg, Tat out of deck and Tat docking bay for his activation and drawing.  We both spend some turns drawing waiting for something to happen.  I drop Janus and Vader with stick moving to Tat dbay.  I using masterful pulling a monnok but not playing it sinces he keeps his hand under 12.  He drops Dash and ship to Alderran saving more force and playing Luke.  I drain for 3 and drop Jabba since he has lots of force saved.  Home 1 comes down and Dash moves over.  I play Monnok lost cause im thinking about making a strike I get 3!! OHDM and some barriers.  So im set.  I lateral H1 and drop Dengar, Bossk and Dreadnaught.  I kill Dash as he leaves the lateraled H1 there.  He drops Leia to my CC dbay and Ben with a saber to tat against all my guys and moves away.  Forgetting to move H1 away from Zuckuss and Dengar.  Bossk comes down along with Dominator hitting him for 16 more and game.  FW(+20)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Lateral is why I dont play H1<br/>
Lows:  Having Meance fades hit me for 1 turn.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Mike Mendozas Hunt down ties<br/>
<br/>
Well great a tournament isnt good unless I either play people in car or Mike.  He starts off with Emperor to Tat dbay which with my hand I cant do crap about that.  Visage hits me and him for some turns as I draw waiting for something I can do.  I finally make emperor head back to the Endor Dbay with some characters scaring him away.  I have enough now with his 2 ships in space for Lando and Theron Nett with Melas to Cantina Flipping Obj.  I battle with I have a bad feeling about this since his 2 ships in space make him power +2.  I shot Emp with Blaster pro adding 3 to it I also play slight weapons so I get 3 destiny.  I hit Emp for 8 more because of I have bad feeling.  I lose theron and leave lando there.  Back comes Vader against Melas and killing him off Flipping me back.  Visage hits me and space drains are hurting since im afrain of those damn Laser guns.  Landos there alone and I play Luke t kill of vader.  He decides to block my drain of lando with a few ties and 2 scrub pilots.  Down comes chewie with blaster and a few guys to cantina to flip again and battling killing all but 1 tie as he kills chewie.  Vader comes back again which I kill him off once again with Jedi Luke but visage along with space drains kill me off.  FL(-6)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Great game against Mike but I cant believe the space wasnt there for me<br/>
Lows:  Losing to Mike again 1-3 against him now<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
DS vs Paul Mckelveys WYS Artoo Threepio combo<br/>
<br/>
I played this matchup the night before with me winning by at least 20 each time.  I got for Emp and Janus the Cantina for some fast drains.  He gets wedge to Kessel for some even drains against me.  I drain and drop vader to DS2 dbay and move him to tat for Your destiny and more drains.  He hits me for 3 which I projecive he pays but it screws up his whole plan.  He draws some more setting up his hand and giving up Luke.  I drain him for some and play search and destroy.  I play a monnok to check for barriers which I get 2 barriers and 2x artoo threepio which jacks his whole deck.  I go with Zuckuss Dengar and a lateral against wedge.  Battle kill wedge and about 6 with a stack leaving Red Squad 1 me saving 2 for barriers.  He drops Mirax and Pulsar Skate.  Raltiir Cptn to Red Sqaud 1 which I barrier.  Then Talon which I barrier also but he battle anyways and draws destiny which I tell him its 0 but he says no because he has ability 7 there but 5 of its not in battle.  I guess hes right which I lose Dengar and he loses a raltiir cptn.  I drain hitting him with search and destroy damage.  Bossk and a dreadnaught join Zuckuss killing everything for a 3rd stacked.  I move some guys around with search damage and drains end up killing him.  FW(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning with a monnok<br/>
Lows:  Nothing<br/>
<br/>
Since theres nobody in the area we play each other again <br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
LS vs Paul Mckelveys ISB ORS I cant beat it<br/>
<br/>
Great Pauls deck which I dont think I can beat with the deck im playing.  He goes for a Drain the the Cantina with 2 ORS.  I leave that there going for activation.  Jedi Luke to H1 moving to tat.  I suck the drain of 2 as he moves his guys to tat.  I play Wedge in damn Red 10 a with Han with blaster.  Battle he plays stunning leader.  Vader Join along with a walker but he misses trample against hand then battling hitting Han and drawing a 6 but to kill everything but I take a walker and 2 scouts along with me.  He resupplys with Blizzard 2 with ORS to Yavin Dbay and A few guys with vader again.  I set up Mirax to Kessel for drains flipping my Obj.  He hits me for a few and Drops Chall with ORS to Hoth dbay flipping.  I drop Melas into Cantina with Meance fades and Aim high since both First strike and Draw their fire is out.  His drains are limited.  Han Comes down with Luke again me clearing the site.  He plays Death Mark on Han making me lose 1 every control phase.  So im losing it as he kills off luke and moves Blizzard Scout 1 and 2 ORS against Han.  Heres where it gets good.  Lando and Theron Nett go against Chall and chewie comes with han against Vader 2 ORS and Blizzard 1.  I battle with lando first getting 2 back shotting ORS clearing site and about 6 more me losing theron.  I then battle with Han and Chewie play I have bad feeling about this.  I have frozen assest so no surprise trample comes.  I shot a ORS with Han play sligh weapons.  He hits Han.  I shot another ORS with Chewie play Life dept to get 6!! Destiny and power +5 which I forgot to add which couldve been the game winner.  I have 30 he has 19 for 33 more which is the site and about 13 more.  We have some space battles against executor but I drain him out.  FW(+14)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Finally Beating Pauls ISB<br/>
Lows:  Where are the matching pilots??<br/>
<br/>
Well turns out since me going 5-1 and Mike not getting wins by 30 all the way home I finally WIN.  FINALLY.  I get a few crappy packs of R2 and R1 which I get a Yoda foil out of which is cool.  I play Ohmys ds skirrling deck which I lose to horribly then lose to Alfreds LS deck but thats ok.  We head off to In-and-Out burger which we return the stolen tray.  As were eating we decide to steal another different tray.  From then on its a rampage.  We get 1 more from Mcdonalds and from Long John Silvers ending up with 3 trays all together.  So Before states I guess were gonna have to go return them.  Well 2 weeks equals STATE so be ready for that TR to see me hopefully win that.  Thanks for reading.<br/>
