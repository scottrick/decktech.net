<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This was the final tournament before the big Enduro here in <br>
North California.  For those who don’t know, Enduro is 4 <br>
tournaments (3 swiss &amp; 1 sealed event this year) in a row. <br>
Thus, you’re playing SWCCG for almost 24 hours.  Nick <br>
Stefanko was the TD for this event in which 19 people <br>
showed, I think.  It was also a nice change from 2 weeks ago<br>
(where I did *really* badly).<br>
<br>
I had decks made and read to play, and had made plans to<br>
playtest against Kevin Shannon the night before the tourney.<br>
So I head to Kevin’s house on the train and find out midway<br>
there that I don’t have my decks.  I’m worried I’ve lost <br>
them or had them stolen so as I’m looking in my bag I miss <br>
my stop.  So I meet up with Kevin at the train station 25<br>
minutes late, and with no decks.  Turns out I just left them<br>
at home, thankfully.<br>
<br>
Kevin, being the cool guy he is, tells me I can use his<br>
cards to make decks.  But he doesn’t have the cards to make<br>
what I wanted (he had lost his binder with many of his cards<br>
in it).  So I go with 2 of his ready-made decks: his MKOS<br>
that he took to the DPC and his AITC/Sandspeeder deck.  He<br>
said he didn’t want to play those again, so I could use <br>
them.  I swap out his farmboy Luke for my EPP Luke (one of <br>
the few cards I did bring), even though he was telling me<br>
that Farmboy is so good in that deck.  I didn’t buy it.  I <br>
also swap out DODN for Aim High.  I expected to face many<br>
Scum decks, but not much in the way of dark S/A.<br>
<br/>
We talk a little about his DPC experience too.....some crap<br/>
about a dice game and a brownie.....huh?  And I show him how<br/>
to play battle.net using NetZero.  Then we playtest and he<br/>
wins all but 1 game.  I’m just getting used to these new <br/>
decks though.  Anyways, MKOS starts No Bargain, POTH, &amp; the<br/>
OE/TINT combo.  AITC starts Aim High, Insurrection, &amp;<br/>
Staging Areas.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs Stefanie Dittman’s RST<br/>
<br/>
I soooooo expected to see Battle Plan, but thankfully she<br/>
never got it out against me.  She tried once to come to Tat,<br/>
only to have her 2nd character bounced w/None Shall Pass &amp;<br/>
have her other character beat down.  Then she stuck to Endor<br/>
w/Crix, COK, &amp; Wuta at a site, and Scout Luke w/Kensaric at<br/>
another site.  I’ve flipped and am draining w/Gailid’s<br/>
bonus.  She keeps forgetting to drain me, and I’m not really<br/>
paying attention either.  I’m just trying to remember every-<br/>
thing my objective does.  Its weird having played Court for<br/>
so long and then play MKOS.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve got Scum &amp; First Strike, so I deploy Dengar w/gun &amp; an<br/>
Abyssin to Crix’s site, battle.  I expected to clear the <br/>
site by shooting twice and drawing destiny w/Jabba’s through<br/>
with You, but I miss the shot on COK &amp; he lives.  I lose<br/>
both of them, she leaves Chewie alone.  wtf??  Ok, I deploy<br/>
Mara against Luke &amp; Kensaric, deploy Boelo to COK, Bossk in<br/>
ship to Endor (she has no ships there).  Boelo battles, so<br/>
I retrive 3 &amp; she loses 1, I lose Boelo.  Mara battles, Luke<br/>
doesn’t have his stick &amp; draws low, so she’s cleared &amp; Mara<br/>
lives.  Next turn the drains on Tat finish her.  Win by 29.<br/>
2(+29).  I’ve got the highest differential.  <br/>
<br/>
Best:  Bossk draining for 2 at Endor cuz Mara was on Endor!<br/>
Worst: Not having anyone to deploy w/Boelo against COK.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs Alfred Dong’s ISB Scum w/ORS junk<br/>
<br/>
Oh man, this is the worst deck a speeder deck can face.  All<br/>
my drains were -1 on Tat since he had ORS at the Audience<br/>
Chamber &amp; Lower Passages.  To top it off, he got out Gailid<br/>
&amp; POTF on *both* sites!  I deployed CC: Downtown Plaza for<br/>
a drain of 2, but he dropped 5D6-Ra7 there to make my drains<br/>
-1.  He knew better to come outside against a speeder deck,<br/>
until late game that is.  Then he came out to battle some of<br/>
my speeders.  The following turn I unloaded my hand and <br/>
tagged him for his characters plus 17.  It wasn’t enough<br/>
though....he was just that far ahead.  My T-47 Formations<br/>
helped, but I couldn’t match his drains......when he<br/>
retrieved 5 w/Abyssin Ornament and drained me out, that was<br/>
game.  Lose by 8.  2(+21).<br/>
<br/>
Best: The beating for 17 force.<br/>
Worst: I found out I had forgotten my EPP Luke.  So I only<br/>
had 59 cards in the deck.  EPP Luke probably wouldn’t have<br/>
made much difference though.......<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs Paul McKelvey’s HB mains w/OMDH engine<br/>
<br/>
This was a quick game.  I flipped 2nd turn, and got all my<br/>
good charcters in my hand.   So I’m draining in my JP sites<br/>
w/Gailid’s help, he sets his mains up outside at his generic<br/>
DB.  Then Capt Han in Falcon &amp; Mirax in Skate move from his<br/>
Rendezvous Pt to Tatooine.  I can tell he’s getting ready <br/>
for OMDH.  I deploy Secret Plans, and draw my 2 ships (Bossk<br/>
and Zuckuss in ships, the only ones in the deck).  I deploy<br/>
the ships to his generic DB (which is between Desert Heart<br/>
&amp; JP), move EPP Fett &amp; Myo into the ships and they take off <br/>
to greet Han &amp; Mirax.  He drops Dash on the Falcon and <br/>
targets Han w/OMDH.  My turn, I drop 4-LOM in space and draw<br/>
my 4 destinies (each +2).  I clear the system and OMDH goes<br/>
lost.  My big drains add up and quickly finish him off.<br/>
Win by 26.  4(+47).  Now I’m #1 again.<br/>
<br/>
Best: Clearing Tatooine in 1 battle and cancelling his 1<br/>
drain at the generic DB w/an Abyssin or Myo every turn.<br/>
Worst: None<br/>
<br/>
I finish in time to watch Steve Daniel’s AITC speeder deck<br/>
lose to Andrew’s BHBM.  Steve should’ve won, but he kept<br/>
forgetting to deploy Luke and was losing to Your Destiny.<br/>
Before he knew it he didn’t have enough force to even deploy<br/>
Luke (he only had scout Luke in lost pile, but he had <br/>
stacked EPP Luke!  wtf?).  So who do I play next game?<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs Andrew’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Andrew’s pissed he has to play another speeder deck.  Well,<br/>
I deploy speeders everywhere since I figure he won’t be<br/>
dumb enough to let me beat him down seeing as how he just<br/>
played Steve’s speeder deck.  I get some FAT drains w/T-47<br/>
formation.  I deploy CC: Plaza and Back Door.  I deploy Luke<br/>
to his Cantina (where he has Snoova w/Ax &amp; Mara) and battle<br/>
but only kill Mara.  I stack a card, then Luke comes back &amp;<br/>
kills Snoova the next turn.  Xizor and Guri go missing in <br/>
the desert from a Sandwhirl.  He drops Vader to the Back<br/>
Door (Endor DB is not on table).  wtf?  Well, Luke can just<br/>
roam free on Tatooine then.  Plus I drop Boushh to block<br/>
Vader’s drain.  I’m draining for insane amounts, and end the<br/>
game with a speeder beatdown on Vader.  Win by 24.  6(+71).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Big drains, recycling Luke.<br/>
Worst: Stacking 2 cards.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs Dan Mochizuki’s MKOS<br/>
<br/>
I draw a T47 Formation, so I deploy 3 sandspeeders to 3 Tat<br/>
sites, Hoth DB w/Incom, and hope he doesn’t mess w/them.  He <br/>
doesn’t, and I get a 2nd turn drain of 7 w/T47 Formation.<br/>
After that, he draws to try to get his JP sites (I<br/>
converted his JP to start the game).  So I’m ahead of him<br/>
in the drain race, he’s already lost quite a few cards.  He<br/>
deploys to my Entrance Cavern though, so i see my chance to<br/>
strike.  I pile the speeders on (engaging Flaps during my <br/>
control phase) and clear Xizor, Boelo, and someone else <br/>
along with 12 force.  After that, he did some hit and run<br/>
tricks using Projective Telepathy (S&amp;V was out) which <br/>
retreived a nice chunk for him, even though I had Aim High <br/>
out.  But he had lost too much force early on and couldn’t <br/>
even flip his objective until really late in the game.  Win<br/>
by 10.  8(+81).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Big drains, big beats.<br/>
Worst: Having to deploy so much.  Plus I had a rather large<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs Dan Mochizuki’s HB mains w/OMDH engine<br/>
<br/>
Basically a repeat of my game against Paul’s HB deck, except<br/>
this one was on the ground.  I couldn’t draw my 2 ships, so<br/>
I focused on ground beats.  He deployed or started Menace<br/>
Fades, and dropped Tawss to my Palace 1st turn, so I <br/>
couldn’t pull my Lower Passages.  I wait and draw some (I <br/>
want to flip in 1 turn), he drains me.  Later, I flip and <br/>
battle him to make him lose Tawss and 2 more.  He saves &amp;<br/>
drops a bunch of guys to my Lower Passages, and I run out of<br/>
None Shall Passes.  Then he deploys Ackbar &amp; Corran aboard <br/>
the Falcon at Tat.  Great, now Menace Fades is in effect.<br/>
<br/>
But its not in effect for long.  We play around in JP for a <br/>
while....Ben keeps reviving guys and Chewie is blanking<br/>
4-LOMs text but luckiliy I’m drawing high enough to make him<br/>
lose 2-3 guys per battle.  Finally I draw another Fett &amp; IG<br/>
w/guns (they had died earlier), and I beat down the few guys<br/>
he has remaining.  He loses everyone and another 12.  Myo &amp;<br/>
Boelo had been helping in cancelling battle destinies, and I<br/>
was just eating his big drain of 1 at Tatooine.  S&amp;V and <br/>
First Strike really helped me retrieve much of my lost pile.<br/>
Win by 26.  10(+107).  As Dan and I were playing that game,<br/>
I found out that no one had more than 8 victory pts, so if I<br/>
won I would take 1st place.  It felt good especially after<br/>
my 2-4 performance 2 weeks ago.  This was my 1st tourney win<br/>
in the Northern CA scene.<br/>
<br/>
Best: Great battles...and I won most of them.<br/>
Worst: Him retrieving 7 w/OMDH &amp; another 5 w/On the Edge.<br/>
<br/>
Nick provided some really good prizes (Reflections AND <br/>
Reflections 2 packs for almost everyone!), and he gave me<br/>
the choice between a Veers tshirt or Signal foil.  Everyone<br/>
told me to pick the foil cuz I could sell it for $$$$, so I<br/>
picked it but I don’t think I’ll sell it.  Unfortunately, I<br/>
didn’t get any packs though.  Thanks for reading, watch for<br/>
my Enduro TR next week.....we’ll see what 24 hours of SWCCG<br/>
does to the human body!<br/>
