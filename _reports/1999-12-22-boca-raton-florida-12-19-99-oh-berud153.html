<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">If yeah already read Mike Fitzgerald's report then you know I road up with him, Lee Edwards, and long time no-show Chris Shutz (the mans gotten out of the game...guess he thinks real life is more important or somethin). We get their a little early and eat some meat from a tube at taco bell. Then after another short wait for peoples who dont like to be punctual we started the tourney.<br/>
<br/>
DS-HuntDown- Packed doubles of the ECC Droids, started Crush and made the opponent really nervous with Evader/I Have You Now and TRIED* to tick people off with ravaging Womp Rats...those insane killers.<br/>
<br/>
LS-Modified Highway to the Danger Zone- Balanced Hidden Base with not too many surprises, Insurrection, Battle Plan, Bacta Tank, and Mains support filled out the deck with a few counters here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My DS vs. Brian Fein's Mining Colony<br/>
<br/>
Well I laugh a little...knowing that this is going to be a slaughter. I figured I'd see many of both side Objectives but I didnt expect it from him. He can be good when he wants but he likes to have fun the majority of the time and I respect that. I got an early set up with EPP Vader at Audience Chamber and Zuckuss, Djas at Cantina combined with Visage that pretty much killed him. He only got two sites out but 4 cloud sectors went along to drain me almost all game. He flipped his objective for 1 turn..with Chewie and Yoxgit at West Gallery, Tawss and Harc at Core Tunnel. I drop ECC 88, Jabba, and EPP Fett to WG and proceed to capture Chewie. Then like a bonehead I draw two destiny...forgetting to shoot Yoxgit! Gah he still had to lose like 8 after him. After that Bossk in Bus made a sweep of the Bespin system which he left pretty much alone and Visage tapped him all game. His drains in the clouds were all he could manage.<br/>

FW by 16 2(+16)<br/>
High's: Makin Chewie 88's @#$%<br/>
Low's: Drains in the Clouds were untouchable as I couldnt draw Fett or Dengar<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My LS vs. Greg Hodurs? Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
I didnt know how well I could hold up...but I started Goo Nee Tay to combat the early force I give. He started Sec Precautions on the Med Chamber. I draw a couple systems, Battle Plan and Insurrection. Second turn he gets down ChokeDaddy to Downtown Plaza and a bit later ECC 88 graces the Cantina. I pop down Jeroen Webb+Obi to Holo to satisfy Viasge but cant drain because HD's still flipped. Meanwhile Ive got RLR1 at Coruscant and 2 Corvettes, 2 X-Wings at Kessel. I flip and he sets up Zuckuss, ECC Lom at Defensive Perimeter...Im draining steadily for 6 a turn while hes got a drain of 2 now. After drawing a bit I drop EPP Luke, Scrub x3 and battle...I whack off Lom but his 2 destiny draws of 5,6 claim 2 of my three men. Leaving Zuckuss. He drops out a dread to tatooine and probes nailing my Hidden Base on 1st attempt. I lose 9 (1 more than I should have..forgot to count RP) so his drains at DTP and Cantina start to hurt. I toss out a single Gold Sqd Y at Kiffex holding a Reb Barrier in my hand but he never follows. Oh well...towards the end he deploys Miyoom Onith to Zuckus and I noble sac Webb for 6. I drop EPP Han with Luke, hack,slash, draw and forfeit the remaining scrub while he loses an extra 8. Next turn it was over due to drains.<br/>

FW by 13 4(+29)<br/>
High's: Beating visage..HBs nightmare.<br/>
Low's: Again low diff, being probed 1st try<br/>
<br/>
It seems like forever till the next round..we have 1 pair who time out and I catch sight of 2 Harvest Decks both of which I wanted to play badly because 88 and Womp Rats destroy! Anyway after many a tummy grumble the round starts<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-My DS vs. Mike Belfatto's Aliens/Harvest<br/>
<br/>
I knew he was playing Harvests and was quite excited about it. He started MWYHL/Bargaining Table which was a bit odd but what I drew opening hand helped alot. Im staring at Vader, Jabba, ECC Lom, and starting Crush I had another destiny with I Have You Now. Problem is I have no place to put them...he searchs but cant find a Dagobah site so I get to peek at his big deck (which he claims is a conspiracy =P)..after drawing up he finds that his site was still in his card box hehhehheh. Well next turn he gives me the Farm and Entrance Cavern to work with so my 3 card hit sqd punked out at the Farm. Visage damages him for a few turns until he gets EPP Obi out to cavern. I keep draining (he canceled one and only one with a Bothan Spy to BT) but visage is taking a heavy toll on us both. He dropped Beru, Owen to Farm and harvests (I used my first grappler on it could be worse and found my second lost in my deck.) then moves to join Obi. I save force for a turn then drop Womp Rat, Bane Malar, Amanaman, and ECC 88 to EC. Womp Rat goes first and I nail who I want..Beru. He puts her in lost till I remind him (DOH*) that I have to draw destiny for ferocity...I draw a 1. She lives. I battle, grab Beru with 88 (would have been owen) scan Own with Bane and square off against Obi and his Bro Owen. Destiny=3 Owen sucks it up and with Ben hitting 88 Beru goes back to the site.  Note* if Beru HAD died Owen would have been captured and Obi would have been beheaded by Amanaman. That was NOT the case however... well he gets Luke out and knowingly moves his bunch (OBI INLCUDED) to the Farm. I drop EPP Fett and go to battle..brimming at 2 weapons, canceled gametext and 5 destinies. However he simply Yoda Stewed (AGAIN! I NEEDED ANOTHER GRAPPLER) and played Its a Trap. Next turn he SATM's Fett and battles after dropping EPP Han. I missed with Vaders saber but he nailed Jabba and and Lom. I have 12 attrition in store for him but he handles it nicely and I evader Vader to used. Visage has wrecked us by this point and in a meager attempt to thwart him I drop EPP Vader and 88 again..ready to capture some bastard. However it became apparent I activated 1 to little. SATM Iggy, beatdown Vader for the game. It was long and brutle but he pulled out the win by 10.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 10 4(+19)<br/>
<br/>
I was insane after that...after going over every excrutiating detail with Mike and Chris I brought myself to the next round. Eager to get it underway...<br/>
<br/>
Game 4-LS vs Lee Edwards Abyssin Swarm<br/>
Well we knew each others decks because we playtested the same match-up the night before, him winning by 14. Well I play it safe and grapple Abyssin O early which hindered his second best retrieval mechanism. He got scum and villainy out along with first strike and with Myo and Jabba at AC his Abyssins were power 4 forfeit 5. He was spreading and draining..hindered for a bit by TPIFF on Dagobah. I would drop to scrubs erase an Abyssin and shuttle up to a corvette to prevent beatdown. Well when he got EPP Fett, Bossk in Bus, Sec Precautions, and stacked Abyssins up it was everything I could do to hold him off. I couldnt find a bacta tank for my life and Battle Plan was hurting ME!. I was draining for 6 a turn but he was slowly killing me off and retrieving 3 when he battled. I was getting lower and lower till I drew Han and Leia. Dropped against a Lone Abyssin who I slaughtered and he happened to have no ghhk. 8 after the A. That provided a drain of 8 no cost which was nice. Next I dropped Obi to kill another Abyssin he only lost 1 after it and I battled at tatooine just for FS which is such a sweet two card advantage machine (DTF too) it was suicide and I moved the only remaining ship away. He had canceled TPIFF with Dengar and had moved him back...and drained for 2 at Tatooine with the trio of Hunters in their ships. He dropped 4 or 5 Abyssins against Han and Leia I was down to 3 cards and I pinged him for 7 with my last drain then drew up because I knew he had an Abyssin O left in reserve. So he pulls it out by 4 and I realize that I could<br/>
have won if I had dropped Obi to AC and Sent Myo away, beat up on Jabba. That would have been a drain of 2 AND his Abyssins would have been crap against Han,Leia. It was irritating but It was my own mistake<br/>
FL by 4 4(+15)<br/>
<br/>
So it was an average day I took sixth overall and won a Fett in S1 by random drawing which I traded for a glancing blow since I already had two. I was happy with my performance and look foward to the next tourney on the 2nd of 2000...where I WILL take 4th or higher.<br/>
