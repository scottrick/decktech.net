<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This was a RII booster draft held at TJ’s Collectibles.  There’s not much pre tourney stuff, seeing how my last report left us about 12 hours before this one, so I’ll cut to the chase.  I was light and I drafted the best card there.  No, I didn’t pull the 1 URF, I pulled Harc Seff.  I traded the deck away for my 59th WB C-3PO after the tourney, but here’s how I rememer it (roughly):<br/>

Not bad, eh?  Onto the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
Harc Seff King of Combat Vehicles Vs Brian Cieszynski’s Pile<br/>
He starts the 5th marker cause he knew my starting location, and drops the 3rd marker w/ Thrawn.  I just throw down the Flaps and pick up some, so after he drains me Thrawn runs like a little school girl.  I pump flaps and plop down my Rebel Snowspeeder, a Cloud Car and a Talz to the 3rd and draw.  Next he sets his sites on the Trade Route with Gale Yeens and some mofo.  I drop Worrt.  Gobble gobble!  His turn he retaliats with a bunch of guys and kills my creature :(  My turn I drop sandswirl and point it at the Audience chamber.  I also deploy the revolutionary, pops, and some other scrubs, and another wort into the AC where Dr.E and Ponda are chilling w/ 2 scrubs.  Worrt misses but I battle anyway.  He loses the 2 scrubs to my destiny 5 draw.  Next turn I clear the chamber and from there I just drain him out.<br/>
FW +13<br/>
2(+13)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Who needs a SI when you get your one effect in your opening 8?<br/>
Lows: None!<br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
Vs Steve Anderson’s Pile<br/>
I knew Steve had pulled some good stuff cause Kris Earle who was sitting next to him kept ’Oohing’ and ’Aahing’.  He started JP and I started my Trade Route.  I soon found out about the Vader URF, as he lost it off the top to a drain :)  Meanwhile, Harc got out to do his thang, while Scout luke went ripping it up.  We had some huge battles with his Imperial Walker, Bossk w/ gun, Guri and other random guys vs my 3 combat vehicles all pumped by flaps and mofos piloting them.  Power totals reached above 30 several times!  But in the end my mad tracking skills prevailed wiping out his forces leaving mine relatively untouched (old ben!), and in the end I spread and drained.<br/>
FW +12<br/>
4(+25)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: HARC SEFF<br/>
Lows: Him losing Vader off the top<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
Vs Mike Schiemer’s Pile<br/>
Mike starts the D* War Room, and me my faithful desert.  I got a great draw with Luke, a Wookie, and a Disruptor pistol in hand, along with some other scrubs, so I just saved force for like the first 3 turns.  I deployed the snowspeeder, the cards mentioned above, and a droid mechant and battled his Ortugg, Praji, and Lobel.  I shot and made lost his Ortugg, so he didn’t get a draw, but he had to lose both guys and a force to cover it.  He set up Dr.E and Ponda at the 3rd marker, and they stayed there for the game because I could never draw enough and save enough to amass a real force.  We played cat and mouse on Tatooine with me chasing him around all the time, till finally he put a lone Bane Malar to the Forest Clearing on Endor.  I dropped the Klatooine, Pops, and some other guy, battled, and drew a tracked 6 to his 0, so he had to lose 8 to satsify.  From there I just slowly drained him out.<br/>
FW +9<br/>
6(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: HARC SEFF<br/>
Lows: He really did have a pile.  A good # of his characters were power (and ability) 0<br/>
<br/>
Game Four<br/>
Vs Mike Pistone’s Pile<br/>
Mike knew my starting location, and about my imfamous Combat Vehicles, so he opted to start the AC.  I got the best opening hand (i.e. I got Harc Seff).  His turn he dropped Endor, and drew.  I put a Cloud Car to the Route and a sandswirl for protection and drew.  He deploys Arica from the reserve deck, her saber from hand (foil), breaks her cover, and I grin.  I drop harc and some fodder out side the car.  From that turn on Harc saves me at least 2 force per turn.  I just drew and saved and drew and saved, Harc preventing all damage.  Sooner than later we fight, and he has horrible luck with his Saber swings, even when he snipers after the first battle, and I soon clear off his forces.  At the end he attempted to drain me at Endor, but he never had 4 ability, so RL in R1 made short work of his ships.  I drain him out for the win.<br/>
FW +15<br/>
8(+49)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: 4-0 ... and of course HARC SEFF<br/>
Lows: I dunno<br/>
<br/>
I ended up the only undefeated, and since Mike Sciemer (the top dark player) and I were already engrossed in seperate casual games we opted not to do the final.  So I got my pick of prizes and sold the EPP Obi to Steve Anderson for $5.  I play some more fun games with Mike Pistone and I pile my newly aquired L5R cards into my bag and I head off.  It was weird, on the way home I had to stop for gas and there were only Full Serv stations.  I’m so used to pumping my own gas, so I was a little weirded out by it.  The guy offered to give me $7 dollars worth.  I’m like okay.  So I look over and next thing I know he has a perfect $7 pump.  So I tipped him a buck (7/7=1) though I shouldn’t have.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Harc Seff for being GOD<br/>
Brian for dropping Dr.E and Ponda Baba and Dr.E’s gun on some punk’s candy ass<br/>
Steve Anderson for pulling a Lord Vader foil<br/>
Jared for running it<br/>
The 11 of us that showed<br/>
TJ’s for having a decent selection of L5R @#$%<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Me for being to tired to think of any<br/>
<br/>
Thanks once more.<br/>
