<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tourny from Plesanton week before Enduro...  TR is now<br>
<br>
Pre-Tourny<br>
Oh Man this week was horrible.  Over last weekend I got sick and it stuck with me all through the week.  Maybe it was cause of the bad stuff going on with Lodi Crew Member Paul who is hanging out with unibrowed gf.  So hes not going to this one.  Anyway  I missed school on Monday and Tuesday.. after that I really thought my parents wouldnt let me go.   So going to school was horrible being sick and all but the week finally coming to an end and Friday rolled around.  I got a few games in after school on Friday and saw my ds could beat WYS Pods.  So  I was happy with it.  My ls Podprofit was killer like all Podprofits.  I fell asleep for a while then went out to get some food at Carrows and back to my house to talk about the week and so on.   Before everybody left Paul stops by after about 100 times of me telling him to not come by anymore.  I had to yell at him for a while in front of my house with him taking it like a joke.  I went in and tuned the decks a little bit and fell asleep.  I wake up and wait till Chris gets there.  At around 10:30 we call Josh Certo cause hes supposed to come by so we can carpool.  He took the wrong exit off the freeway and gets there in about 5 mins.  Im feeling ok now but I forget my Asprin at home so Iâ€™m gonna feel like crap all day.  The drive was preety uneventful except for gay bay area traffic.  We arrive at the tourny and I see very few people but we end up with around 16.  Off to the games<br>
<br>
Decks:<br>
<br>
DS:  Land This:  Speed Walkers with Were in Attack Position<br>
LS:  Watch Your Profit:  Speed Profit thats HUGE!!<br>
<br>
Game 1<br>
LS vs Chris "Car" Greens Brangus Racing Pornstar<br>
<br>
This is HUGE!  I start the first game off with someone in my car.  Last week we played this game almost everyday and he only beat me once.  The game has only a little bit of interaction with me hitting him for profit damage.  I battle Emperor off of Jabba Palace with Qui to satisfy for Come Here Coward.  I win the Race and he loses it off the top.  FW(+17)<br>
<br>
Highs:  Wining I guess<br>
Lows:  Playing someone in car first game<br>
<br>
Game 2<br>
DS vs Shawn Elys Mind what Learned to Test 3 <br>
<br>
This is the first time I played against Shawn in any tournament.  So this is the first time.  There is very very little interaction in this game.  I set up some walkers on Hoth and start to ping away as he starts up his testing.  I get 5th, 6th and 3rd marker set up with walkers.  Im only hitting him for 3 a turn.  I play the hoth system while he drops Tat City OutSkirts with Qui and Stick+Obi with saber.  I drop Decree and hit him for 3 during control phase.  He finishes test 3 and drops Home 1 with Mirax on it.  and doesnt have any force left.  Ive have 9 saved and activating about 18 or so.  Yes 18.  I come down with Bossk in Hounds with Chimera and Piett on it.  I lateral Home 1 to Dagobah.  We have a problem where he doesnt think that lateral can go to Dagobah but Steve says it can so were good.  He loses both and about 20 where I lose Bossk.  After that its preety much over.  FW(+24) <br>
<br>
Highs:  Playing Shawn<br>
Lows:  I hate this deck already <br>
<br>
I play again against his DS deck and my podprofit was working good but we didnt finish.<br>
<br>
Game 3 <br/>
DS vs Steve Daniels Training to 6 <br/>
<br/>
Once again only a few battles cause this deck sucks.  I set up the walkers everywhere and get going with Were in attack postion later game.  Han and Luke take out a walker and piett.  After that he just tests.  I get up up to about 8 per turn.  After that he cant pay for his test 5 retrieval and I win on the next turn.  FW(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing a fun game with Steve<br/>
Lows:  I hate this deck so so so bad<br/>
<br/>
Im really starting to feel sick now.  My head hurts and I dont think I can think straight.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
LS vs Steve Daniels Mauls Hut Mains<br/>
<br/>
This game was fast and furious.  No Podracer and on his turn converts my sites. He starts some aliens in the Chamber which I beat down for about 10 breakthrough with Master Luke and Lando.  I dont free han yet in case of a backfire.  Which indeed does happen.  Vader comes down and Clashes Luke and the Anti begger guy for more power.  And kills Lando and about 7 more.  I win the race getting some of it back.  We fight all over Tatooine with me Pinging away at him and him the same.  My drains are too much for him in the end but he gets me down to a little after all my retrieval.  FW(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  That was a good game<br/>
Lows:  OH man i feel like crap<br/>
<br/>
The game went fast so I had about 40 mins to rest along with a lunch break.  I went outside and sat there and tried to feel better but it really didnt help much.  I was on the verge of quiting.  Some people made the run to Taco Bell so I got my expected Choco Taco.  Which didnt help much.  Off to game 5.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs Mike Mendozas Sentaor Stuff<br/>
<br/>
After last weeks loss to him I want to beat him by 100.  We start off with him shuffling my deck but I have 60 like it should be.  He starts Jabb/Fett in the AC.  HAHAHA.  I draw a good hand.  He flashes and draws a 4+3=7.  Then drops a few Lotti Doddi and some other senator in the Chamber and draws.  I start off with Master Luke and saber into the AC.  Wheres lando that coulda been game over.  I battle and bounce Jabba.  I then hack Boba and draw a 5.  He takes 7 BATTLE DAMAGE!!!!  We podrace and its 11 to 13.  He Lott Dodds and flips this turn.  Maul moves to Jabbas Palace now with Mighy Jabba from hand.  This coulda been game right here but im stupid.  I drop Qui and a Stick against Maul and Jabba.  I battle and hack Maul but i forget hes defense +2 from Phantom.  The stupid part is I had a TT in hand when I coulda hit him otherwise.  I then Run Luke Run and miss Maul again.  Where i coulda blaster proed him and hit Jabba for about 10000000 damage.  This battle goes horrible my way where I lose Qui and have to move Luke Over.  Im feeling really sick right now but I go on.  He drops reinforcements to JP and drains a while there as he Lotti Doddis for stuff and drains.  I get the Battle Plan+Goo Nee Tay lockdown going.  End up winning the race by 1 as AFA pops and hes taking profit damage.  IG with Riot goes into the AC to try and cap Han but he only has 1 destiny left which is a 2.  He battles but I miss the game ending shot.  I draw my double which he subtracts by 3 and adds 3 but I still have 15 to his 10 so its IG and 3 more and Luke bites it.  Maul moves over so I dont occupy.  I drop Lando with Axe to AC so I still cant battle.  I take a drain of 4 this turn but get it back with I did it.  He puts 2 cards in my hand back which sucks but Luke is still there.  I drop Luke against Maul.  So the AC Battle is Luke, Lando and Han vs Maul.  I battle.  I miss the shot cause I misstracked.  Im sick remember.  I draw my 3 destiny to his 1 which wasnt so good.  He has to lose Maul and 8 more.  After that profit and drains do him in for the Victory.  FW(+27)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Im sick and im still playing descently.  Victory is mine.  <br/>
Lows:  Im really really tried and hurting now.<br/>
<br/>
Last game YES I GET TO GO HOME AFTER THIS ONE.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs Cody Daughertys Sentaor Space<br/>
<br/>
This game should have only taken about 5 mins but he decided that he wanted to take 2 mins to decide what to lose from direct and 5 mins on his turn.  I set up on Hoth preety fast with no trouble from his guys.  I get 3 sites occupied with walkers as hes setting up in the senate.  He leaves Home1 at Kessel and Radiant 7 to Keffix.  I go for the kill.  Executor with Chimera Thrawn and Motti go up against it.  I lateral it and battle.  He houjixes out.  Damn.  I run back to Hoth to set up Were in Attack Position Now.  Hes taking about 8 now from Were in Attack Position and Landing.  After a few turns of this hes down to about 5 and I drain him out a turn later.  FW(+16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Arrest Order is Mine<br/>
