<br/>
Dark side:  the story of my dark side starts when at a previous tournament where Eric Olsen gravity shadowed Dash Rendar, drawing a 3 and killing him.  Gravity shadow allows you to target the highest ability pilot of a ship when it heads into hyperescape, you draw a destiny and if it is higher than the pilots ability then the ship must return and cannot move, if it is equal to the pilots ability the ship dies.  The killing of Dash was crushing and almost lost me the game so I got the idea of building a deck around gravity shadow.  I realized that light sides best pilots are ability 3, dash, han, lando, ds2 wedge and got the idea to play with a bunch of tie vanguards which are destiny 3.  In case you didnt know vanguards allow you to react by deploying cards from hand to same system.  So I had the idea of playing 8 systems and a bunch of vanguards and gravity shadow.  Then I was looking at the DPC images and noticed how clint and steve lost because of grimtaash, so I decided to make my deck my kind of scum(instead of sycfa) which allows you to start well guarded, doesn&amp;#8217;t get choked by WYS, and doesn&amp;#8217;t give throne room a system to move home 1 to wakeelmui.  I don&amp;#8217;t like ties but I was sick of scum and didn&amp;#8217;t have the cards to make huntdown so I ended up taking this deck.  The problem is that I don&amp;#8217;t have a dreaded imperial star fleet, an oe/tint, nor arica, but al schaefer was kind enough to lend me the latter two, and I was mean enough to forget to give them back.  I always start something special planned(which is ass), oe/tint, and mp.<br/>
<br/>
Light side: balanced WYS that hopes to control kessel and do the cantina shuffle to out drain opponent and has 3 on the edges for retrieval.  I don&amp;#8217;t have any palace raiders so I play 7 raltiir captains, and team work.  Every game I start insurrection, staging areas, and squad assignments.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. sorry I can&amp;#8217;t remember playing geoff&amp;#8217;s Bring Him<br/>
<br/>
This guy was really nice but hadn&amp;#8217;t played in a while.  He started Insurrection, secret plans, and something special planned.  We both draw the first couple turns, he deploys emp and emps power, I don&amp;#8217;t think he ever pulled more than 1 db.  I drop dash to kessel, deploy mos eisley and put a captain at H1 docking bay, with a houjix in my hand.  I had a really slow start I didnt get any of my 3 tunnel visions, nor did I get han, which blows, especially against bhbm, which in theory takes luke.  He deploys a star destroyer with some lame dudes, I think I barriered, either that or dash lived.  Next turn I deploy luke to outrider from reserve, theron net and his ship, I&amp;#8217;ll take the leader and attack.  He loses a card off the top with emperors power, a 6, then draws a 1 and 3.  so he gets beat up, and I choose to lose luke even though he didnt get over my immunity.  I feel bad because he deployed not knowing what dashs game text does.  We battle at space a lot but he never beets me but converts my kessel which sucked, as well as control most of my drains there, which also sucked.  He eventually deploys the back door, presence of the force and choke vader with his gay ds2 saber.  Well he hasnt deployed the endor db, so I play luke out of my lost pile to the cantina along with a few mofos to finally flip.  We take each others drains for a while but I eventually take out darth with a tracked six, and I never see him again.  I out drain him, out battle him, and retrieve once or twice.  FW(26)<br/>

DS vs. annoying guys correlia and that freighter effect card <br/>
<br/>
Great swarm space, exactly what I don&amp;#8217;t want to face.  Well I had never seen this freighter effect before and it seems to suck, but I get an @#$% hand with none of my 8 systems, and I won&amp;#8217;t get any system until I draw 25 cards, thankfully he supplied some.  Through out the whole game he&amp;#8217;s talking, which I don&amp;#8217;t mind except that he keeps on saying stupid stuff like &amp;#8220;I bet you don&amp;#8217;t know what I&amp;#8217;m doing,&amp;#8221; so I shut him up with a lost monnak and find out and find the most incoherent hand I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.  he had two freighters and two quad laser cannons and a bunch of jizz.  &amp;#8220;I really hate you now&amp;#8221; he says so I reply by deploying 5 vanguards to various systems.  &amp;#8220;Man, you are really making me mad now.&amp;#8221;  He&amp;#8217;s playing so slow, its unbelievable, I&amp;#8217;m very patient but I just can&amp;#8217;t take it.  I don&amp;#8217;t mind if you play slow and actually do something that might let you win, but he doesn&amp;#8217;t.  I literally just start drawing cards so I can find arica and at least have something pleasant to stare at while he concentrates so hard on sucking.  We battle once or twice, I kick his ass, at one point he grins and deploys kessel and a kessel run, but targets a guy who can&amp;#8217;t make the parsec jump in a turn, so I smack him.

Game 3<br/>
<br/>
DS vs. Al Schaefers !Mega! throne room with lots of retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
Me and Al are of equal ability and this game could go either way depending on the cards I get.  I play like a scrub and activate my four force before realizing not only did I want to twileck, but forgot to get wakkeelmui.  so I twileck any ways and sfs and wakeelmui are both in there.  So we both draw the next couple of turns while I get enough ships and systems, while he doesn&amp;#8217;t know what to expect.  So we both get set up with jedi luke at cc db, and obi at a spaceport db at kessel.  I get my swarms of vanguards at multiple systems, but I forgot to deploy sfs first, scrub!  He gets aim high, and h1 with leia at the war room and hashan come to surprise a lone vanguard at a random system.  I react with a couple of ties and a dread.  he then question how I can do this and we both read the game text and I realize that the reacting text only works at systems and try to avoid looking at my vanguard deployed at bespin: cc.  Anyways I all power, he draws a 4 and I opt to lose the two vanguards, and forget to put one in my used pile, scrub!  Next couple of turns are me out draining, him out retrieving and u3p0 blocking a drain at the desert heart.  A war is waging against super h1 with hasshan, epp leia, epp han, chewie, wedge, tycho, acbar and scrubs, but h1 knocks down a power 21 Death Star Assault Squadron(with all power and a dread), and various other ships, and his three destiny draws lead to the demise of my space dominance.  I finally got arica and deployed her to jedi lukes site.  but she would die a short while later and corran horn would visit u3p0 at the desert heart, so know he&amp;#8217;s out retrieving and out draining.  So late game I&amp;#8217;m sitting with three cards in my hand with a reserve deck and I know that there are at least 2 fours within the top 5 cards just waiting to gravity shadow  h1.  He sees my low hand size and my lone, hyperspeedless vanguards scattered across the galaxy, and decides to move h1 in front of one.  I play gravity shadow, targeting leia, and draw another gravity shadow which is destiny 4.  I will cherish the look on his face forever.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t stop laughing as his ten card h1 dies, which was  by far the coolest thing that I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen done in starwars.  Any ways Steve Kuperman is sitting next to me and calls Al an idiot, but I don&amp;#8217;t think it was that bad of a move, if he had beet up one of my ties, which he would have, it would have been game over, and who the hell plays gravity shadow anyways?  Well thanks to Aim high, on and off the edge, sorry about the mess, and me lacking a dreaded imperial starfleet, Al won anyways, which he deserved.  FL(-9)<br/>

Game 4<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. Als !Mega! Huntdown<br/>
<br/>
My deck normally breezes through huntdown, but all my luck left me with gravity shadow.  He starts iao, mp, and something  special.  First turn he puts choke vader without his saber at the cantina.  hmmm.  I got a pretty good hand but couldn&amp;#8217;t really do much to choke vader with my scrubby freighter capts.  so I put one at h1 db, and let him go.  For the next few turns I&amp;#8217;m drawing and am ready to move.  But to the constant drains and visage I lost mos eisley and goo nee tay off the top.  I love those two cards, especially mos eisley.  On a previous turn I had put 3 capts. at the tant db. I really wanted to tunnel out of my lost pile to make sure gold squad 1 will find wedge in the reserve deck when I reveal it, so I use two force to deploy a capt. to the ds db to flip.  I tunnel and find that wedge is not in my force pile, so I deploy kessel and reveal gs1, wedge was in the two force I had used! so now kessel is just sitting out there, giving him force.  Arrrgggh.  Currently I have 2 epp hans, 2 epp lukes, anh chewie, life debt, and rug hug.  So I&amp;#8217;m all set to beet the crap out of vader at the cantina, but vader now has his lightsaber, and I cannot handle a you are beaten on top and a choked chewie, so I&amp;#8217;m trying to get weapon levitate before I attack.  He masterful moves and reveals that vaders obsession is in his reserve, I almost soil myself because I&amp;#8217;m sittin with 2 hans and 2 lukes, but he doesnt have a monnak.  I have battle plan out , which is giving him woes, but he deploys thrawn chimera to tant.  so my next turn I put some guys at kessel, but don&amp;#8217;t have enough force to beatdown vader yet again.  I finally come down to whoop some @#$% with the three mains and theron net.  My first just action is to gank vaders saber, with weapon levitate out of my lost pile, he then chokes chewie, and don&amp;#8217;t have don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y so I&amp;#8217;m screwed.  I miss vader, then proceed to draw my 2 destinies, which came to a total of 6.  Luke is the only one left.  Next turn he deploys Emp, which he can&amp;#8217;t do, janus and vader.  I hit vader and draw a three, killing janus.  I have to lose a couple of force which I do off the top and off goes don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y!  So I come to lay the smack down against the lone emp. so I attack and miss with the saber and draw four destinies for a grand total of about 8.  Arrrgggh.  My deck is not low destiny, its not great either, but it should be doing better then this.  I had started tracking so I could blow the brains out of vader but he omni boxed.  So emp and han say their good byes.  Mara visits luke clearing all my characters except 4 freighter captains at various dbs.  She sits there and drains for 3 the rest of the game.  Next turn Vader comes down to clean up what he began, and soon my capts are gone.  In space things are going just as bad as he gets thrawn on the chimera with boba in front of poor wedge.  Early game I had lost outrider, and earlier vader had killed theron net, and I don&amp;#8217;t have a mirax.  I tunnel and grab red 10, then tunnel again and grab a captain.  I deploy and attack with my tracked 5 and 4 which kills thrawn and boba, but he draws enough to kill off the rest of my pitiful defense and he still has the chimera.  I tried replacing Ill take the leader with another, but Al said you cant do that and he was right&amp;#8230;I really wanted a tracked six to start retrieving, but I never was really able to.

Game 5<br/>
<br/>
DS vs. sorry cant remembers hb with corvettes and abil 2 starfighters.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I&amp;#8217;m playing swarm space which I thought would slaughter my deck.  He starts civil disorder so first turn I pull wakeelmui and plop a vanguard there to cancel it.  He then deploys falcon with a spy and capt. han, I lose tie and 7 force.  He&amp;#8217;s dropped a few systems, and scramble(?), while I&amp;#8217;m just drawing.  He pulls courscant and puts a corvette and with chewie there and leaves 2 force.  His friend is sitting next to me and all the sudden he starts talking to me about how weird Kirdo III looks, &amp;#8220;I wonder why it looks like that, do you think its because of pollution?&amp;#8221;  I keep on blowing him off but he insists on knowing my opinion on the matter, I think he was trying to distract me or something, but he gave up after I mumbled something and ignored him.  I heard him tell my opponent that he was an idiot for not to playing hyperescape so I lost those rebels cannot escape us.  Anyways I quickly showed him the errors of including coruscant in his deck and after putting a tie at wakeelmui I piled about seven tie vanguards and a dread to coruscant for pitiful amount of force and retrieved all the cards I had lost and lateral damage his ship.  Well low and behold he reacts with the spiral (which I could have canceled with those rebels cannot escape us) which sucked @#$% and he only had to lose a few, then I moved to wakeelmui.  He runs away but gets his 5 systems and flips and starts draining for a ton at kessel and other systems for 1.  He puts premiere obi, without a saber at the desert, who is visited by u3p0.  Now I always play with u3p0 on my side that way it doesn&amp;#8217;t get taken, but he moves it over to his side&amp;#8230;and of course I forgot to get it back, so if you read this could you please d-mail me.  We battle a lot in space, but I convert his kessel and beet up his guys there, while my dreadnaught is slowly killing off his ships, thanks to well timed gravity shadows he doesn&amp;#8217;t get to move where he pleases, and I beet him up a couple of times.  I finally get over to endor and probe which is it, so now I&amp;#8217;m out draining and out retrieving him.  FW(12)<br/>

Game 6<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. Kevin James ds2/its operational/imperial command<br/>
<br/>
Kevin is cool and a good player and I&amp;#8217;ve never played against a operational deck, so I have no idea what to expect.  He plays iao and gets secret plans out early.  I flipped with dash and theron in their respective ships at tantooine and han and chewie, the protecta at mos eisley, while he was pulling his sectors.  Ive got life debt in my hand so things are looking pretty sweet.  He deploys mara her saber, merrijk, and veers.  Right away I cancel merrijks game text with chewie, he battles&amp;#8230;no you are beaten thank god, but he does have imperial command.  So my site is cleared he loses merrijk.  I forget to drain at tant and draw.  He twilecks for lateral damage, drains plays no escape to retrieve merrijk and deploy him to the ds2 db, then pulls kyyshack.   He moves mara and veers over to cantina.  I put han and luke over at mos eisley and put out battle plan and menace fades.  He puts a stardestroyer, we&amp;#8217;re in attack position and a few scrubs aboard it at kyyshack, and moves ds2 over.  I play a few maneuvers, and I know I have another 6 on the bottom of my reserve.  I activate the to the 6 and tunnel and found just what I was looking for: sorry about the mess.  So I shuffled over and blast mara, attack and soon veers joined mara in the dumpster outside the cantina, but he had a ghhhk.  So now Im draining for a lot, he comes over to take tantooine, and hes about to kick me off tantooine, due to a lateral damaged outrider, but I start retrieving a ton with on the edge, while my shuffle ate away all his force.  He played really well, but theres not much you can do to stop a shuffling fool like han.  FW(16)<br/>

So I take my usual 2nd, while Al goes undefeated.  It was a really well run tournament with a good turnout, and I hope to be to the next one. </font></td>
