Pre-Tourney:<br>
So the week before MO states I head over to Brady's so we can test decks and decide on what to play. I was planning on playing TTO and TIGIH with the 12 card hand but I also had a Wookiees deck built for light and a CRv Sidious mains deck for dark. Brady wasn't sure what to play for light; for dark he was pretty set on walkers and has been playing them for a while, but he wants to test it against Wookiees. So we play a game of walkers vs. Wookiees and I come out on top by like 10-15, however Brady gets some experience playing against the wooks and learns that prepare for a surface attack is much better to start than endor shield, so he can give bargaining table the finger with his 3rd marker drain. I play my TIGIH against his walkers and get clownstomped, even though he started the wrong decree and I got a decent bit of damage with my drains. I think I played it pretty badly and my starting hand was crap, but I wasn't confident with the deck at all considering Brady's walkers was the only deck I knew for sure I would be played at the tournament. Brady isn't sure what to do for light, but considers joining the rest of the MN crew playing Wookiees, so I let him play my wookiee deck so he can get a feel for it. I use my TTO to get some practice with it since I am about 90% sure I will play it in Missouri. Brady gets a quick start but I finally build the death star and start getting in a ton of damage. I think he wins by 1 and he was surprised I was able to catch up when he had a big early lead in the damage race. TTO can dish out a ton of damage, but he also made a few mistakes since he was playing the deck for the first time, so I imagine if he had played the deck before he would have won by more. So after the games are all finished Brady is leaning towards Wookiees and walkers, and I decide to fall back on the decks I am most comfortable with: Wookiees for light, and TTO for dark. <br>
<br>
I take Friday off and head over to Brady's early Friday so we can head out that morning. The drive isn't actually that bad from Minny, only like 6 hours, but we want to get into Kansas City late afternoon so we have time to head to a BBQ place for dinner and hang out for a while. Last year the tournament was held at a comic/gaming store in Kansas on the opposite side of KC from where we were staying. It was a nice store, but they did not open until noon, the playing area was too small to fit both a SW tourney and a magic tourney at the same time, and the owner did not want to book us as far in advance as Brady was planning, so instead Brady and Adam Howland worked out booking a VFW hall in the KC area for the day. There were a few other people that were considering heading down with us or coming down on Saturday, but everyone else that had expressed interest before had to back out for various reasons. However in the week before the tourney, upon hearing that we were going to a casino on Friday night and playing at a VFW hall with a bar, Jim Li decides to join us as well. Or maybe it was just about the Star Wars cards, IDK... So we head out Friday morning, roll into KC at about 5:30, meet up with Brian Herold (who drove liek 8 hours from Texas), head to Arthur Bryant's for some BBQ, and then hang out at the casino until about 10:30. We head back to Brady's in-laws' to finalize our decks and get ready for the next day. We help Brady throw together a stock Wookiee deck and talk decks for a while, and everyone else is pretty much set so we hit the sack. <br>
<br>
So the next morning we head out to the VFW hall, stopping at a gas station for some snacks and drinks. Apparently while we were there some guy drove off without paying for gas, and according to the cashier there he had robbed the place before. I for one didn't see anything; I was in the back grabbing a Powerade. So we show up at the VFW hall about 45 minutes before the tourney starts and Adam is already there talking with the local VFW patrons, probably explaining to them just what the hell SWCCG is (I recall one of them going on with something about football cards). I think some of them probably didn't even know what "Star Wars" was. We hang out a while waiting for other players to show up. We get to the start time and only 2 local players are there, so we wait a while longer, but no one else shows up, so we start the tourney with a disappointing 7 players. At least there is cheap beer at the bar in the hall (only liek a dollar for a 12 oz mug), so I can drink away my sorrows if things go badly. <br>

<br>
Game 1: DS (TTO) vs. BYE<br>
I draw the bye first, so I do a few mock draws with my decks to make sure I'm good to go and then I hang out for an hour. No beer yet; I stick with the Powerade. Woot! 2 victory points! <br>
2 (+0)<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS (Wookiees) vs. Adam Howland's Bespin Big Blue<br>
Adam drove all the way from Minot to play, so props to him for that. He starts TDIGWATT and the chasm walkway with weather vane v, KDYv, and dreaded imperial starfleet v I think? I set up my Wookiees quick and start pinging and draining him. He starts pulling systems and puts out a few star destroyers and grabs astromech shortage v with after her v to mess with yarua v's damage. Mid game I have decide between taking over his drain 2 locations and committing to holding a BG system to satisfy battle plan, but I'm activating a ton of force with my jedi council chamber out and a bunch of force from Adam's locations, so I play it conservatively and take over his cloud city with BIPS/Padme to drain for more and not risk getting beat down by his fleet. I get to verify his deck a turn or two later and see about 10 star destroyers in there, so it was a wise decision to not go to space. I get out luke and leia with padme and he lost decree v for some reason, so I am doing a ton of direct damage and drains, even with yaruas game text canceled most of the time. Eventually he sets up with Retwin at the chasm walkway, so he gets free drains and I don't, and his fleet is spread over 3 or 4 systems so he starts catching up in damage. I have yoda and a wookiee in my hand and consider pulling weapons display, battling retwin, and making him lose 2 force when he 'hides' to cancel the battle. But I also have a wookiee strangle v and I decide kicking him of his BG site is more important, so I go down with yoda and a non-unique wookiee and strangle retwin. Now we both have to pay for drains, but I am doing a bunch of direct damage too, so I end up pulling out the win. Full win by 13. <br>
4 (+13)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. Brady Moore's Wookiees<br/>
So I guess we end up driving hundreds of miles to replay the same match that we played in testing a week before. I am pretty sure that jerjerrod is safe since corran is the only spy in his deck (unless he threw in an IL-19 or something at the last minute) so I drop him at the DB first turn, throw out the DSII, and pull a sector. I draw a sector as well and pull thrawn with endor shield. Next turn I pull the final sector, set up TTO, deploy a SD to the DSII, shuttle jerjerrod up, and move everybody to kashyyyk. He is doing wookiee damage and I am doing TTO damage, but I get out we shall double our efforts at some point and pull astromech shortage v to mess with his yarua damage. He is making up for it in drains though, and canceling mine with bargaining table. He sets up his space as well and I chase him back and forth from endor to kashyyyk, keeping thrawn and some forfeit in front of his fleet at all times. I set up veers in a walker at my DB and he comes down with a couple Wookiees. He is counting his Wookiees on table and checks if I have secret plans out, so I surmise he is going to play nar shadda wind chimes and attempt to trample one of his Wookiees to make it a little harder for him to succeed on the draw. He ends up using yoda to cancel it by losing 2 from his force pile. It saves his wookiee and prevents him from getting beat down next turn by veers, but he doesnt have enough force to pay for the chimes retrieval now, so I have the upper hand. We are doing about the same amount of damage and weve both put a lot of cards on table so the game is extremely close. FW by 2 or 3. <br/>
6 (+15 or 16)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs. Bradys walkers<br/>
As I said above we are essentially playing the same match as we did in testing and I beat his walkers fairly easily then, but I am not as confident this time, because Brady knows a little better what to do against them. He starts prepare for a surface attack this time instead of endor shield v. We both set up quick, I get my wookiee damage going with yarua and a wookiee at the 2/1 and Chewbacca of Kashyyyk v and a wookiee at the 2/2, and he sets up vader in blizzard 1 at the 5th marker turn 2. Early on he loses Piett off the top to wookiee damage, I play OOC/TT to put a 5 back in my deck to let me draw another card and I end up putting Piett OOP. I pull DDTA and grab atrocity. He blows the generator turn 3, I play atrocity, and he doesnt have a control, so I only have to lose 5 to the MPGs. I have to top deck some cards and unfortunately I top deck both mechanical failure and meditation v, so cant play my t-47 battle formation from under the shield and no mech failure means I probably wont be going to hoth. He grabs Astromech shortage v with After her v and starts canceling yaruas text during every one of my turns (a common theme on the day), while I get bargaining table out to cancel his drain at the hoth, as prepare for a surface attack only protects drains at hoth sites. I eventually get my fleet set up at kashyyyk, with booster and a few other guys. I also get out capital support v, so I dont have to worry about super cheap star destroyers for the moment. He has trouble finding his admirals order to replace mine to start doing were in attack position now damage, so putting veers OOP was actually pretty huge, as he couldnt grab veers back by deploying an AT-AT and use him to pull his AO. He tries to come down and battle me with a star destroyer or 2 with thrawn at hoth and I barrier and run away. We may have battled once or twice, but mostly it went down about the same as our previous game in testing with this matchup, with Brady chasing me between systems while I cancel his drain at hoth or kashyyyk and keep enough backup and forfeit with Booster to prevent him from knocking me out of space. <br/>
<br/>
He does eventually set up his AO and starts getting in damage with that. He starts setting up for a walker garrison, so I have to make a move. I end up deploying a wookiee to the 3rd marker and Nabruning Chewie and a wookiee there to block his biggest drain with the intention of invading the ice plains and/or the wampa cave to drain for 2. I actually cheated here, as I nabruned for free using yaruas text (Wookiees on kashyyyk move for free), but he had canceled yaruas text that turn with astromech shortage. Brian points it out after the game and I feel like a jerk for doing it. Suck. I also pull ultimatum so he only hits me for 4 when he plays garrison on the next turn (I cancel his drain at hoth). I move my Wookiees out to the wampa cave and drain him for 2 there the rest of the game, since the main power generators are blown away and are now an unnamed marker site. Its another close one, which seems to happen every time I play Brady, and I barely come out on top. FW by 2 or 3 (I beat Brady by 2 in one game and 3 in one but I forget which one was which). <br/>
8 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So at this point I am undefeated, which means I am the top player even though my diff totally sucks. Brian is the 2nd place player at 3-1 (+a lot more than me), so I play him next. <br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS vs. Brian Herolds Wookiees<br/>
TTO vs. Wookiees. Sounds familiar somehow. I have crap luck and goof up big-time this game. My first turn I search for the DSII DB to drop jerjerrod but it isnt in my deck, so I just draw until I get it. Suck. Then Brians second turn he sets up yarua and a wookiee at the 2/1 and hits me for 1 and 1. I lose one from hand and then commit the cardinal sin of a TTO player and top deck a card. Its a sector. frimbazel. And its the 2nd one too, so I lose 2 activation and I lose the good text from the 2nd one. So from this point on its just damage control to keep my differential hit down when I eventually lose. I set up some ships at endor with thrawn and chiraneau, and chase his space between endor to kashyyyk the best I can while trying to drain at the other system. But with bargaining table it is 4 or 5 turns before Brian even has to put a card in his lost pile. With crap activation I cant draw or deploy much, so I have trouble drawing and deploying enough ships and guys to try to kick Brian out of space. I do get somewhat lucky when he cant get Wookiees in his hand for bargaining table for a couple turns, so I get a couple drains of 3 through at kashyyyk and endor. Paying for drains is killing me, so I send veers, igar, and blizzard 1 to the endor db to try and satisfy battle plan. Brian responds by deploying a &lt;&gt; site to kashyyyk (the +3 to battle one) and a wookiee there, and then some Wookiees with a v bowcaster (which shoots at +3 now with his 3 kashyyyk sites). He ends up shooting down blizzard 1 and the game is pretty much lost. He also gets most of his space out, including a tantive IV to the DSII, and I dont have enough ships left to cover all the systems. FL by 16. <br/>
8 (+2)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now both Brian and I are 4-1 and Jim is next at 3-2; he plays Brady while Brian and I switch sides and rematch, whoever wins our game is guaranteed the top spot, while the 2nd spot will depend on what happens with Jim/Bradys game. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS vs. Brians Invasion<br/>
Brian starts the standard fare for invasion. I draw a fair amount of space in my opening hand and consider making a run at the blockade flagship before he flips, but decide against it and setup normally on kashyyyk instead with yarua and a wookiee at the 2/1. Brian pulls death star sentry v and after her v and uses astromech shortage v to block my yarua damage for most of the game. After I decide to leave the blockade flagship alone, he pulls dofine and gunray, backs up the flagship with Guri, and flips early on. I put down luke and leia in the alderaan consular ship to kashyyyk and have Wookiees at both sites, so we are both set up in our respective arenas. Early in our game Jim beats Brady by enough to guarantee that whoever loses our game will drop to 3rd place, especially me with my awful diff. <br/>
<br/>
I guess Brians plan was to use the 2 battle destinies from the 7 side of his objective to clear the Wookiees off kashyyyk, as he makes the first move by deploying maul in ship to kashyyyk and then a bunch of battle droids to the 2/1 site. He cancels Leias text with astromech shortage and battles me. I forget to make him pay +2 to battle with the consular ship, and only remember during the weapons phase. Brian is good people though, and he pays the +2 even though he didnt have to and doing so prevented him from battling my Wookiees or canceling yaruas text next turn. He does get enough attrition to make me forfeit either luke or leia though. I lose Luke, though in hindsight that was the wrong choice, since I could have retrieved with him all game and Leias text could be canceled anyway. Oh well. He doesnt cloak or move maul, so I drop booster, padme and some wookiee forfeit and boot maul out of space. I also fight his battle droids at the 2/1 and the site clears. Luckily I play with 3 Yaruas and a puller, so he is back out with a wookiee buddy pretty quick. Around this time I also get a top decked Chewbacca of kashyyyk v stacked on grrrhgrrrr from my lost pile with wookiee guide v, so all my Wookiees are power and forfeit +1. I set up at the 2/2 site with Chewbacca of Kashyyyk v and a wookiee and get bargaining table out to cancel one of his drains every turn, so his damage potential is rather limited. At this point my Wookiees are cheaper and more powerful that his battle droids, and with Padme and wookiee damage am I pulling ahead. We continue to fight over the kashyyyk sites, but with 2 Wookiees able to generate 15-20 power, his power 2 or 3 battle droids are outclassed, even drawing 2 battle destinies. The game ends up being decided when I come down on his 3 battle droids with COKv, yarua, and 3 Wookiees. I end up with 40 power to his 16; he takes about 15 overflow, and draws up next turn. FW by 16. <br/>
10 (+18)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish the swiss portion of the even in first place at 10 (+18) yeah, 10 (+18), lol. With his victory over Brady, Jim finishes at 4-2 with more differential than Brian, so me and Jim talk about whether we want a final confrontation over a few beers from the bar, and I end up conceding to Jim, who passes down the bye. With Brian, Brady, and myself all playing wookiees, I ended up playing with or against wookiees in every single game on the day. I am done with wookiees for a while, thats all I have to say with regard to that.  <br/>
<br/>
Brady, Jim, Brian, and I bid adieu to Adam and the friendly VFW hall members and head back to Bradys in-laws to drop off our stuff and then head back into town to find a place to watch UFC 100 at. We decide to go to a BW3, but the place is packed when we get there so we have to sit outside. Luckily we can see the TVs inside and they have the audio on outside too. Adam shows up as well and we hang out at watch the fights. Apparently in one of the first fights some guy does a cool move where he jumps off the side of the cage and superman punches the other guy, but I missed it. We watch underdog Dan Henderson knock out Michael Bisping, who apparently is a goldenrodface, so thats cool I guess (can you tell I dont watch the UFC much?).  I dont even remember Fitch vs. Thiago; I was probably eating at drinking at that point, IDK? Georges St-Pierre and Thiago Alves go at it for the welterweight title GSP does a bunch of take downs that look cool, but he doesnt have any kool finishing moves like they do in mortal kombat, so they just wrestle on the ground for 10 minutes, which is kinda boring. But then Brock Lesnar fights Frank Mir for the heavyweight title (Brady has to explain the whole interim title thing to the UFC uninitiated among us), and pretty much jumps all over Mir and pounds his face into the cage until the judges call it. Then Lesnar flips the bird to all the fans, douses one of the ringside cameras in spittle, and proceeds to remind everyone that Mir had a horseshoe up his ass, and how he pulled it out and beat Mir over the head with it. Following that, he announces that hes going to celebrate his victory over a cold coors light, cuz Budweiser wouldnt pay him any money, and that he was going to get on top of his wife that night. Lol, it was liek the best victory speech ever. We say farewell to Adam and head back to Bradys in-laws for the night; the next day Brian heads back to Texas and we head back to Minny. <br/>
<br/>
