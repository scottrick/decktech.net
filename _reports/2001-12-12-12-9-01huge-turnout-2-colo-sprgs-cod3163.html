<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Wow, last tourney had a huge turnout of 22 people. That was great. I*m almost sure, though, that this week there won*t be more then 12. Colorado Sprigs almost never has 2 straight huge turnouts. Well, I was wrong, this time there where 19&amp;#8230; this is awesome. The game is dying you say, hmmm&amp;#8230; Anyway, Hunter, his crew, and the Pueblo crew are all there. My decks are<br/>
<br/>
+DS HDADTJ that has gone 9-1 (not counting today) and is just the normal stuff<br/>
+LS WYS that really is on a one turn beat down with Run, Luke Run/ IGABFAT/ Han w/, Luke w/ and a Ralltir Capn.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My Dark vs. Josh Kennedy*s TIGIH Mains<br/>
<br/>
Well, I see Josh finishing up his deck as I sit down, so that*s not usually how to make a solid deck, but we*ll see. I get Vader starting hand, but only activate 5. I pull a DB, Kuat and draw 1 to get Tarkin. His turn he drops Leia w/ and Tawss Khaa to Endor DB. I drop Tarkin and Choke Vader and wipe out the site. I draw and draw for one of m y 3 Mauls, which I finally get. Josh is not moving Luke and I am fine with that because he*s only activating 4-5 a turn. Josh finally gets out the Jedi Counsel Chamber, some systems, and a site to Endor. I am just making him lose to Visage and draining while Zuckuss flies up to Hoth and I pull out Battle Order. He finally gets an Obi and Mirax to his other Endor site moves Luke, then Nabrun*s them all to CC DB against Maul. I drop Phantom Menace, Maul*s Saber, and initiate. I hit Luke, play I Have You Now and draw a 7, 3, 3 thus wiping out the site. Bad thing is Maul got hit even with Phantom Menace. I continue to drain in space and finally kill him. FW +20<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Fun game<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My LS vs. Thomas Harris*s Watto Objective<br/>
I play Tom a lot and know his deck pretty well.On the other hand he saw my WYS deck only once, and I gave a guy 90 battle damage, so Tom is a bit scareds. He drops Xixor first turn with Watto and makes me lose 2. I just play 3 Tunnel Visions, grab some stuff and do this for a couple of turns, using all 6 of my TVs. I finally get everything and drop Han to Watto*s Yard (he has Xizor and Watto) drop Luke to the adjacent site, initiate with I*ve Got A Bad Feeling About this Run, Luke Run, chop Watto, Sorry About the Mess him, Don*t get @#$%.y, shoot Xizor, Slight Weapons malfunction, play Higher Ground to cancel his battle destiny, draw 5 destiny&amp;#8230;5,5,5,6,5. And that gives him around 115 battle damage. With a Frozen Assets on his force pile and draw Their Fire out, he can*t Ghhk it, either. FW +35<br/>
<br/>
Highs: pulling of the most (to my knowledge) amounts of Battle damage with just 2 guys.<br/>
Lows: beating Tom way too fast (not even 10 minutes into the game)<br/>
<br/>
So now I*m at 4 +55 and pretty close to the top.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS vs. Chris Fanchi*s WYS<br/>
<br/>
I play Chris at almost every tournament we*re both at. As we*re sitting down, I can tell that he*s probably played Hunt Down a million times before and smoked it. I mess up first turn by activating a force and then going through for Kuat. He promptly takes his action right after I activate to pull out Don*t Do That Again to suspend my Mob Points. Yeah! So I set up pretty quick with Vader and Maul on ground and he has Pulsar in space.  He Lost In The Wilderness*s maul and I can*t find him the rest of the game. He drains in space for a lot (4 a turn) and I can*t get any ships up. Luke is running around on ground to satisfy Battle Plan, also.  I am down to about 5 force and I move Vader to Luke*s site and Initiate an Epic Duel. He draws a 6 and a 1 and so do I&amp;#8230;but wait, I have one more ability then he does (we both have sabers) so I get to have Luke for the last turn of the game! FL -26<br/>
<br/>
Highs: getting Luke late<br/>
Lows: losing<br/>
<br/>
4 +29<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My LS vs. Dante Montoya*s BHBM Mains<br/>
Dante is my favorite guy to play. He hasn*t played BHBM for a couple of tourney, but I think I*m ready. He drops Empy to Cantina and builds up his guys there for the next couple of turns. I get all my stuff ready and drop Han and Mirax, and Luke to the adjacent site.  I*ve got Frozen Assets and Draw Their Fire out, too.  But right before I initiate, Dante plays Force Lightning and Kills Han w/!!! That totally screws me over! I decide to go for it, and I do. I Run, Luke Run. Chop Clash new Boba, chop Mara, and shot at Empy (I miss) but play SWM.  Both sides are cleared besides his Empy and Clashed Boba. I try to do the whole thing again and I do. Except I was so caught up in the game that I forgot to initiate with I*ve Got A Bead Feeling About This!!! Instead of giving him 43-battle damage, I give him 3, yeah! Oh well, he finally drains me out. FL -14<br/>
<br/>
Highs: playing Dante and it being sort of close<br/>
Lows: not playing IGABFAT<br/>
<br/>
4 +15<br/>
<br/>
I guess it wasn*t Hummel Time<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My DS vs. unknown player*s (actually, water spilled on my paper) WYS<br/>
So, my 2nd WYS. Maybe I could do a bit better. I can NOT find a Vader for about the first 5 turns, so Visage is killing both of us. I finally drop Vader and Tarkin to the Cantina and wait for him to come to me. I*m not doing outside the Cantina because there are Patrol crafts swarming the place. He deploys to space, and I promptly drop Zuckuss in and Boba in to pulverize his Han in Falcon. I keep control of space and Maul and Xxior are making their trips to get rid of the Patrol Crafts. Visage keeps hitting him hard until he comes in and kills Vader by which we both take the damage. I finally kill him off by ridding a Talon Karde in Outrder. FW +14<br/>
<br/>
So I am at 6 +29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning<br/>
Lows: not the most fun game<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My LS vs. Cody (more water)*s Scum 2k<br/>
I have never played against a SYCFA Scunm deck. He sets up quickly and I start slowly. I finally have my stuff, but Luke and Han together cost a whopping 17!!! (Bad Feeling Have I and No Bargain) I save up the force and deploy, but when I initiate, he plays Projective Telepathy. Well, that sucks. Cody drops IG w/ gun and initiates. So it is my Mirax, Han w/, Luke w/ vs. his Gailid, Jabba, Mosep, and IG. He captures Han w/ Iggy, so no Don*t Get @#$%.y and SWM for me. When all was said and done, I got my Han w/ back since Iggy was chopped, and I got lost Mirax. My turn I dropped Dash and initiated. My power was more than his, so I couldn*t use IGABFAT. I DO use Don*t Get @#$%y and Slight Weapons Malfunction causing 16 overflow. I just drain in space a bit and on ground and finally finish him off. FW +16<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning and beating up on aliens<br/>
Lows: Projective Telepathy<br/>
<br/>
So I end up at 8 +45<br/>
<br/>
I get 5th or 6th out of 19, so that*s not too bad. Of coarse, Hunter wins. I also got a Han, Chewie, and Falcon in my packs so that is even better!<br/>
<br/>
