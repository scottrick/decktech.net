<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Decipher Swiss tournament at Millennium Games and Hobbies, Rochester, NY. Director Richard Buckner. 19 participants, 1 drop.<br>
<br>
My first tourney of the new millennium!! Well, not really since the new millennium doesn't officially start until 2001...<br>
<br>
My DS: TIE/lns with Sienar Fleet Systems, capital ships for cheap deploy, Presences for extra drainage in space.<br>
<br>
My LS: HB Spamwings (see 'I Can't Believe I Play This Cheese' off my member page).<br>
<br>
Gotta love frantic pre-tourney trading, eh? Picked up a TK-422 moments before the tourney started and swapped a Dont Forget the Droids for it.<br>
<br>
Round 1, Game 1.<br>
My DS vs. Darryl's Sloooooow EBO (is there any other kind?)<br>
Darryl wore sunglasses, and I got the feeling he didn't like me very much - probably because I really put the smack down on him. He started the MPGs and North Ridge, Signal for Insurrection; I got my usual Wakeelmui, Twilek for SFS. First turn I drop a TIE to Milwaukee to get my Twilek back, then draw to try and find a system. No such luck. He gets the Hoth DBay first turn and plays Elyhek Rue (heh) there. Second turn I draw again, now I've got Kessel and a couple capital ships. He plays Raithal system next turn (why I'll never know), draws (looking for sites, no doubt). I deploy the Thunderflare to Milwaukee, All Power lost for some TIEs, deploy them there free and get my All Power stuff back, move the T-Flare to Raithal. He gets another Echo site out, a 2/2 chump there, draws. I PotF Raithal and have a comfortable drain of 3 there for rest of game. Also deploy Death Star, Kessel, and Coruscant for activation. He deploys Gold Leader in Gold 1 and a couple Gold Squad Y-Wings to Raithal, I'm thinkin he's gonna try and take me on, but no. He moves em off to the Death Star. I deploy Dreaded Imperial Starfleet so I can cancel that drain and Kuat for activation, draw, and get CHYBC. Nice.<br>
By now I'm draining for 3 @ Raithal, he's draining me for nothin (he's got chumps at Echo sites and Gold Squads at Death Star, which I cancel). He still can't get a third Echo site out, so he converts my Kessel and my Coruscant, deploys Red Leader in Red 1 to Kessel (I can't get there from Raithal of course), then spreads out his Gold ships from the Death Star to Milwaukee, Kuat, and some left at the Death Star. Next turn I deploy CHYBC and he's draining nowhere - the only BG he occupies is Kessel, which I use DIS to cancel. I deploy a bunch of ships (Dreadnaught, Bossk in, TIEs) to Coruscant for cheap-o put a PotF on it, and I'm now draining 5 a turn to his 0. That's how the game ends up. He draws a couple more times, consolidates his Y-Wings at Death Star again, finally gets another Echo site/chump and deploys EBO, but it doesn't matter cuz he can't stop my drainage at Raithal and Coruscant.<br>
Full win by 28<br>
2(28)<br>
<br>
The good: He gave me a nice place to drain at Raithal.<br>
The bad: I was thinking of trying to make an EBO deck, but... not now.<br>
The ugly: Wearing sunglasses during a tourney game is pretty rude :-(<br>
<br>
<br>
Round 1, Game 2.<br>
My LS vs. Jason's DS ???<br>
He starts Hoth system - nothing else. I start HB stuff, Signal for Yarna to protect my junky XWings. He saves his first turn, I get out a system and draw. 2nd turn he drops the Stalker (?) to Hoth - I'm thinkin 'beatdown time.' So I save force next turn (toss Dont Forget Droids to the drain). Then Organized Attack for some X-Wings and bomb on the Stalker (and Piett, who he deployed as a pilot). S-Foils wasn't out yet, but I did Organized Attack, and when all was said and done, he lost Stalker, Piett, and 12 more (ouch). He gets some Hoth sites out (War Room, 5th Marker), some Snowtroops at the War Room, I Projection it, get my systems out, set up to drain @ Kessel and Hoth, flip. He deploys some more ships (Premiere Vader in his TIE, DiPO, Avenger) to an unoccupied Tatooine, but no Security Precautions, so I activate S-Foils and drop a beating on him. Red Leader got a Cannon, and shot down Vader with it (Garvin Dreis resurrected!!), leaving DiPO and Avenger facing like 7 power-6 X-Wings (Organized Attack played). We draw BD, and Dengar adds a bunch, but I'm immune anyway. He loses the ships and a little bit more. He never challenged me in space again. I drained him down to 2 cards in RD and flew my X-Wings off to the Swamp for extra differential.<br>
Full Win by 33.<br>
4 (61)<br>
The good: Hands down - Red Leader taking Vader out (I drew Signal). Rock on Garven!<br/>
The bad: I hate X-Wings so bad. They're just dripping with cheese.<br/>
The ugly: No offense, but... Jason had all his cards in Top-Load holders =/ Tres awkward.<br/>
<br/>
Round 2, Game 1.<br/>
So now I'm in second, playing the kid in first, for first place.<br/>
My LS vs. Charles' DS Hunt Down (ugh).<br/>
I start Yarna as usual, him Security Precs on the RPoint. First turn he draws, I get a system, play TTerminated on Visage, draw. Second turn he drops Cantina, Premiere Vader and Saber there (ick), flips. I activate 3, play Signal, it's Sensed (good thing I played my Terminated first turn), goes to lost cuz I didn't have Wise Advice out yet (it's in my hand). So I finish activating, deploy Advice, get a system - Dagobah - and Planet It's Farthest From on it targetting Tatooine (which I had deployed first turn). Projection the Cantina (good thing he has no Alters in hand) and he's draing for one there. Would've deployed Battle Plan had my Signal gone through. Drop an X-Wing at the RPoint free and move it to Dagobah just in case. His turn, he deploys Lars Farm, Brangus there, draws. I go, Projection Lars Farm too, and now I've got all my systems out (I had drawn two in my hand). I drop some X-Wings at Kessel (which is my base this game, btw), don't flip immediately. We go for two turns exchanging drains 1-for-1 (him at Cantina, me at Kessel), meanwhile I'm trying to draw enough X-Wings to fortify Kiffex also. Finally he breaks the ice by deploying CC: Downtown Plaza and Elising Vader there. I, however, have my brand new TK-422 in hand. Next turn I send him down, and now I'm draining him for 1, he's draining for 0. I'm also about ready to deploy to Kiffex.<br/>
Then he drops the bomb - Bubo to Downtown. I know, you're reading this, thinking 'Bubo can't go to Downtown, it's a mobile site' - but I totally didn't think about this - and I guess he didn't either :-( So that turn I lose TK (sucks), and before he draws, I decide it's best that I flip, and do. Now I drain for 3 @ Kessel, and he - get this - plays Imperial Propaganda on it. Very intelligent play on his part. I lose 2 from it, but leave my X-Wings there, seeing as how it's either that or drain for 1 at Tatooine. Next turn he brings Fett in Slave 1 to Kessel, I Barrier it, he probes - and gets my base. This is good and bad - bad cuz HB is out of play and I have to lose like 8 to Sec Prec. Good cuz I can lay the smiggety-smizzack down on Bubble Boy next turn - and I do. He Alters S-Foils during my activate phase (unfortunately Garven was not on table to prevent this), but I drop the X-Wings I had saved for Kiffex at Kessel instead, play Organized Attack and jack him for like 20-some. Then I All Wings for 8, and I'm thinkin I have a shot. Unfortunately, he's got more Propagandas on the way, and I can't drain anywhere else in space (almost all my X-Wings are at Kessel, and can't get to Kiffex in one turn). So I fly some to Tatooine on their way to Kiffex, but by now he has moved Brangus into the Cantina, and is draining me for 3 a turn @ Downtown :-( I can't drain at Kessel unless I wanna lose like 9999 force (he actually only played Propaganda 3 times, but no way I'd risk it after that). That and his drains finish me.<br/>
Full loss by 11.<br/>
4 (50)<br/>
<br/>
The good: Barriering Fett then crushing him next turn.<br/>
The bad: Propaganda - an underrated card?<br/>
The very, incredibly just-plain-BUTT ugly: Me forgetting that Bubo can't deploy on CC. WTF?<br/>
<br/>
R2, G2.<br/>
So I'm hoping I'm not out of this quite yet.<br/>
My DS vs. Mike's Rescue the Princess/Death Star Plans<br/>
He starts the usual RTP stuff, but it took him forever to rescue Leia thanks to bad destinies and just plain poor luck. Meanwhile I set up drains at Kiffex (with a PotF), a PotF'ed Fondor, and, later on in the game, Endor. He was trying to slow me with Surprise Assaults, but the best he got me was for 2. It took him 8 or 9 turns to eventually get Leia out - and I wasn't even resisting. He had Artoo there, played I'm Here To Rescue You, no good, Artoo got captured. 8D8 was chillin there too, but his destinies were no good, and when he finally did release a captive, we flipped a coin, and he released Artoo =/ By the time he got Leia back to the War Room, I had drained most of his force away (he wasn't resisting in space at all, and I was draining for 7 or 8 a turn, and retrieving with SFS). As I paid 5 (he had Battle Plan, WNMOG, and a flipped objective) for the final drain of the game, he revealed the 2 cards he had held on to most of the game - both Death Star Plans. He had 2 Lift Tubes on the Death Star, too. Looks like I got him just in time...Good game Zander.<br/>
Full win by 29.<br/>
6 (79)<br/>
<br/>
The good: Meeting a fellow UR student and playing my TIEs against RTP for the first time in real life.<br/>
The bad: His awful luck with 8D8 and I'm Here To Rescue You.<br/>
The ugly: I had Secret Plans in my hand at the end of the game, so Death Star Plans wouldn't have helped him much anyways...<br/>
<br/>
Round 3, Game 1.<br/>
Well, that win kicked me back into second, and I was slated to play the same kid I had played two games before, only with different sides. Unfortunately, this game was nowhere near as close as the other one.<br/>
My DS vs. Charles' Tosche Station Revo, heavy SAC<br/>
The title probably gives some idea as to what happened this game. He got Ben and Saber to Tosche first turn (ick). I dropped a TIE at Milwaukee to protect it from Alter and get my Twilek back. He drains me for two - like a moron, I toss my sole Evader and something else. Next turn, here come the Revos, on Milwaukee and Kuat. That's game. I get Rendili out, so I'm activating 4 force a turn, but what good can that do me, especially with my TIEs deploying +2? I eventually get a Dreadnaught to Milwaukee to get the TIE outta there, but he drops the EPP-loaded Falcon to take care of them. Terrible game. I'm starting CtR (which was buried in my deck somewhere) against this kid from now on.<br/>
Full loss by 42.<br/>
6 (37)<br/>
<br/>
Round 3, Game 3.<br/>
Well, that was the tourney for me. This game I spent more of my attention on the Redskin game...<br/>
<br/>
My LS vs. Matt's TIE Scout/Numbers, droids at the DS War Room.<br/>
His Scouts ran around in space while he waited for the inserts to pop. He stacked a bunch of destiny-4 droids at the War Room, and waited. I couldn't draw Dont Forget when I needed it, only ended up using it once, lost to the insert twice. I got my X-Wings set up at Kessel and Kiffex, and he didn't challenge me, but the inserts did me in. His TIE retrieval helped him out (he Short-Ranged for 12), I would've won otherwise.<br/>
Full loss by 15?<br/>
6 (20-something)<br/>
<br/>
So I ended up 6th out of 19. The dude I played twice (with the Revos) won. I got a Mara EJP pack for consolation, drew nothin in the packs, but who cares? ;-) Mara's all I was after. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
