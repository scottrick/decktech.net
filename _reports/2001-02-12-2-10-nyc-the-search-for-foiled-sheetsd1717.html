&lt;p&gt;<br/>
This tourney was on very short notice, and me not having a car at college presented to be a giant problem for attending this event.  I knew I could get a ride with the Albany guys, as I did last year for this same event.  My girlfriend went home this weekend so I was strapped for a ride out to the Modena rest-stop to meet them.  Luckily the little Indian girl that lives below me let me take her 2000 legacy and leave it on the side of the highway for 15 hours.  <br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Event Horizon<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
After about an hour of sleep because this drunk girl stumbled into my apartment at 2am (right after I had gone to bed) and kept me up with my roommate until about 5, I wake at 6am shower, dawn my clothes for the day, pick up my bag and search for this girls car.  I listen to the Gladiator soundtrack on the way there, and then I wait an hour for Albany to show up.  The ride down is pretty uneventful as I just try and complete the decks that Hayes Hunter made for me at 12am the previous night.  My decks for this are Non Dueling Hunt Down, and AITC Mains.  He said I&amp;#8217;d go four and O.  My rating going into this is 1627 with 34 games.  This is without Day 1 of worlds where I beat some 18 and 1900+ players, but also a 1-5 performance where I scrubbed out in Framingham.  Away we go.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Game One &amp;#8211; HDADTJ vs. Mike Dalton (1979) EBO Monkey Xwings<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
I call this monkey Xwings because he puts one at a system and hyper escapes when you engage him.  He sets out slow and I get Mara with her saber at  a docking bay to start draining because I know it is going to be a slow game.  I got Choke Vader to the North Ridge because Commander Luke was their draining me and it pissed me off, so I Chocked him with an untracked 7.  After that Vader must&amp;#8217;ve just drained there although I for the life of me cannot remember what went on.  But once he gets EBO going he puts these Xwings in space and starts draining heavy.  He also gets Orders me to Engage, so I do and he hyper escapes so I still lose the three force.  This and the drains in space kind of kill me, but on the other side I&amp;#8217;ve been hitting him with Search and Destroy since turn three and Visage since turn one.  I only lost to visage once this whole game.  The lack of detail in this game of the report is because the deck lacked action itself.  Either way I win, which is huge for me cause I am known as a scrub all across the land.<br/>
FW by 6 (+6)<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Highs: Beating Mike Dalton &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Lows : Only winning by six, but I cant get greedy cause this deck kicked some ass<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Game Two &amp;#8211; AITC Mains vs. Mike Dalton (1979) MKOS Abyssans.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
So I&amp;#8217;m not too thrilled about playing Dalton again because he is a good player, probably better than me.  Anyways, we start out, both on Tatooine, and get guys down.  I put Obi at the Desert Heart to drain and he puts his Sail Barge with an abyssan and mercenary pilot on it and gets the passenger deck out.  But he doesn&amp;#8217;t put anyone on the passenger deck so I beat the thing down with Luke and some other people.  He&amp;#8217;s got Bib, Jabba and Boelo and the chamber doing some damage, which I can take.  I get Harc Seff down with Luke again at the entrance cavern so I&amp;#8217;m draining and covering his drains until Seff caught a beat down with Han later in the game.  Xizor is deep into the palace on the other side of the Chamber so I get her down with Dash but he none shall passes dash, I battle they stay, he battles they stay.  So I sorry about the mess the bastard and take him out.  Then I&amp;#8217;m draining him there for the rest of that game.  Back to the Desert Heart with obi.  Mad battles going on there all game, but I&amp;#8217;ve been saving my Run Luke runs because Luke is having a good time draining at the Hutt trade route and I don&amp;#8217;t realize I can react to my own battles, so pretty much the last battle of the game&amp;#8230; I forget to use the run Luke run.  Luke&amp;#8217;s 6 power would have saved me the game.  Instead I lose by 8.  I&amp;#8217;m pissed.  FL by 8.  2(-2)<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Highs: Doing what this Deck was supposed to do&amp;#8230; I Guess. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Lows : Saving the Run Luke Run&amp;#8217;s and forgetting to use them.  I&amp;#8217;m a bastard.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Game Three &amp;#8211; HDADTJ vs. Jason Roubinette{sp?} (1616) Sullust Deck?<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
This guy starts Sullust and two effects with Heading to the medical frigate.  Squad @#$% and the one that lets you forfeit weapons.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
He gets out a mad space crew at sullust and I put Zuckuss with 4lom at carida.  I also have Mara and a saber at the downtown plaza and Vader and his saber at the CC Docking bay.  I am draining him like crazy and pinging him with S&amp;D and Visage, which I only lose to once.  He lost good things off the top like Wedge&amp;#8217;s ship and stuff like that.  Then deploys a Nebulon B frigate to Carida and tries to move the Outrider there and I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8220;you cant do that without leebo, you just can&amp;#8217;t make it&amp;#8221; and the guy explodes.  &amp;#8220;WHY ARE THE SITES SET UP LIKE THIS?  CARIDA SHOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE!&amp;#8221;  Here is what it was, Sites on one side on the table, systems on the left.  The order of sites went like this &lt;Med Chamber, Holotheater, Exec Dbay, Dstar Dockbay, Downtown plaza, Sullust, Carida&gt; so I he says it should be between cloud city site and the Dstar site. And I&amp;#8217;m like I just put it next to the system cause it makes sense to me like that.  He yells at me some more and puts his hand out.  I win by 29.  I go and tell the Albany guys about it and they are sympathetic, but I feel bad, not only because the guy is a prick, but because I don&amp;#8217;t want to win like that.  Me and twigg and baroni all turn around and there he is bantering about the game to his boyfriend.. it was pretty sad.<br/>
FW by 29 4(+27)<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Highs: Winning by 29. &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Lows : Doing it against a Schmuck.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Game Four &amp;#8211; AITC Mains vs Chris Packsac? (2059) MKOS Skrilling<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
This game sucked.  He pretty much beat me down Hard core.  I kept putting up fights, but it was to no avail.  I can&amp;#8217;t remember much detail about this game as he just continued to smack me around left and right.  I made some good moves like getting corran horn to the passenger deck to drain, but it was too late.  I only got luke out once and it was when I had 9 cards left so I was able to get him down and battle.  By then it was too late because he was retrieving all of the time and skrillings are just really strong in my opinion.  Again, not a lot of details because there were none, just a lot of smacking down of obi, leia, and han.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t get Lando out with his vibrator either.  So I lose by 23.  <br/>
FL by 23, 4 (+40)<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
Highs: None &lt;br&gt;<br/>
Lows : Losing by a lot, not getting Luke out.<br/>
&lt;p&gt;<br/>
So there is the tourney, for prizes I win a Masterful Move foil instead of getting packs, which sucks cause I thought I would get the packs also.  Brian Twigg won, my boy steve Baroni came in third which is great for a Kashyyyk player to go in and represent all over another region.  All in all it was a good time, I really don&amp;#8217;t want to write about the sealed deck because it just wasn&amp;#8217;t that fun aside from me pulling a jedi Luke and having to give it up, and steve getting an Emporer and Lord vader foil passed to him&amp;#8230; and he didn&amp;#8217;t even win.<br/>
