<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">You know when Vader is about to kill Obi-Wan he says, "You can strike me down, and I’ll become more powerful than you could ever imagine," (or something close to that)?  Well, what he wanted to say was, "You can strike me down, and I’ll just come back to F!ck HDADTJ," but didn’t because George Lucas is a @#$%.  What does that have to do with anything?  Read on and ye shall see.  Anyway, this was a 4 gamer (sucks) and then a final confrontation between the top 2 for a Foil Jap Vader.  Yay.  I really needed to go 4-0 today due to my poor preformance last week.<br/>
So once again it’s friday night and I haven’t touched my decks, so I just start thinking and writing decklists out on paper.  I’m up pretty late, and in the end I just go back to a light deck that has seen some success for me, a variation on Hunter’s Hidden Mains my way, and the same old HDADTJ Imp Command Pile for dark.  Sleep comes, but I can’t remember now if I had any interesting dreams, and I wake up at about 10 the next morning (it’s February vacation).  Shower, eat, watch TV, make decks, and me and my bro hit the road at about 11:30.  We make damned good time, going about 85 mph the whole time, listening to the Transformers The Movie soundtrack, and get to the store in 45 mins (an hour and 15 mins my @#$% mapquest) but we didn’t know we were at the store (stupid mapquest) so we arrived at 12:30.  We did some trades and helped Jared "jetsaredim" Greenwald (the substitue TD) build decks seeing how he forgot his in his haste to get here.  Sooner than later we begin.  There are 15 in attendance.<br/>
<br/>
Rating before the tourney was 2167 with 9-2 (yucky) not in.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
Hidden Mains Vs Ian Ross’ (1500) CCT w/ Scum and Jabba’s Prize<br/>
Ian is a cool guy (he bought 2 Lord Vaders off of me for $10 a piece) but doesn’t play much outside of the group of friends he came with.  JK Luke gets set up with saber at the CC:DB just in time to watch Guri toting Han through.  He flips but then I kick his @#$% repeatedly on Tatooine, Clashing, Messing, excluding, hitting, etc.  Some Edges boost the dif at the end.<br/>
FW +31<br/>
2(+31)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Neh.<br/>
Lows:  Beating up on the guy at the end.  <br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Rich "The Rage" Hinds (1555) TIGIH scouts and 6s<br/>
This is actually the deck I was planning on using for light, but decided against due to it’s inability to handle scum and ties, but whatever.  I start by dropping Chinreau to the Endor Landing Site, screwing his force activation, and I draw.  He moves Luke over.  I get Vader down.  He cancels visage repeatedly, but there are always more :)  The game was really uneventful with Mara raping Crix kinda early on, and then me fortifying my DBs and Downtown Plaza.  S+D came into play late game, but the whole time I just dominated.  At the end though, the best move was when he randomly deployed his one power droid in the deck to where I had Mara and Dr. E.  I still don’t know why he was playing that.<br/>
FW +18<br/>
4(+49)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  The power droid.<br/>
Lows:  Eh?<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
Hidden Mains Vs Michael "MadSkills84" Pistone’s (1532) HDADTJ 7s<br/>
This deck was modeled after Steve Baroni’s HDADTJ with like 10 destiny 7s, only Mike didn’t have all the right components.  Anyway he starts by deploying Tarkin to the D*:DB, and I ditch YISYW for Battle Plan.  I drop Leai w/ Gun, Goo Nee Tay, and battle for free, missing Tarkin, but still killing him with attrit.  Mike decides not to fight, and just drops lord to the Ex:DB.  I activate @#$% loads, drop Obi w/ Saber to the D*:DB and draw tons.  He deploys Mara and Saber then moved Lord over to her on CC.  I deploy OTE, Chewie P, JK luke and Anakins, Clash Vader (he started No Escape), hit Mara, he misses, I draw a 6, he flips a 1.  That’s alot of damage.  His turn he gets hit with OTE, and I start draining him alot.  Sorry about the Mess does it’s job and in the end some Edges help my differential.<br/>
FW +35<br/>
6(+84)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Killer opening hand and draw.<br/>
Lows:  Beating a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Eric "Bounty22" Hunter’s (1981) New Age TRM w/ Goo Nee Tay<br/>
Umm, read my bro’s report.  Basically, Mara cleared out one of his DBs early on despite Goo, and then he couldn’t kill her and she drew really well and he didn’t so I was up early in the force advantage.  Getting Vader to the Downtown Plaza only helped that advantage.  I just drained fast and killed his guys faster.<br/>
FW +26<br/>
8(110)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  4-0 @#$%.<br/>
Lows:  At my bro’s expense.<br/>
<br/>
Steve Baroni finished in second, and my bro got 3rd, so next was the final.  According to Jared I got to decide which deck to use first, but I just let Steve choose.  He picked his light.  He’s using Kyle Craft’s anti-HDADTJ Tech in his TRM deck: Obi Wan’s Apparition.  He starts the DB effects, as do I, and I gamble he doesn’t run Honor (I heard he was playing like 5x OOC/TT) so I start Crush.  Sure enough on his first turn he fetchs Honor with Insight, but I’m lucky as @#$% and get No Escape in my 8.  Anyway, I didn’t get one of my 3 Imp commands or any of my several scrubs to put at the Executor DB, so on his second turn he eliminates 4 of my activation by putting Obi’s Ghost on the Holo Theatre (the middle site) and I’m @#$%ed.  The intro make sense now?  Goo Nee Tay makes it’s way out and that’s that.  I have won this matchup in the past 2 tourneys, but only because i was able to drop someone at the Ex:DB first turn so I was getting at least 5 or 6 force, as opposed to 2 or 3. <br/>
At this point I am tired and everyone is going home so I give Steve the second game so he gets the Vader, and I get $18 store credit which I go throw at L5R which I had already spent around $75 on that day.  Good stuff.  Steve and my bro hop in the car (Jared drove Steve down) and we go to Papa Ginos for din din.  Then I drop Steve off and go home.  That is all.<br/>
<br/>
