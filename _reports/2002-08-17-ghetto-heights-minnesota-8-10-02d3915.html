Not Going to GenCon Tourney<br/>
Twin Cities Comics<br/>
Columbia Heights, MN<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning, up nice and early. I took my 2 decks, my little toy AT-AT (for good luck) and headed out. The location was just a few miles off the Apache Mall plaza, and me being the dummy that I am decided not to take a map with me. Well I got sort of lost and thought somewhere along the lines that I was going to be late by half an hour. Fortunetly I was able to gather my landmarks and make it to the tourney with 10 minutes to spare. <br/>
<br/>
After the initial signing up and forking over my $$$ I noticed that Nick Kolnick (the TD) was giving away a whole unsealed box Enhanced Jabba’s Palace packs to one lucky randomly chosen winner, in which you could get an additional entry for $1 and that money went to prize support (great idea Nick). Since GenCon was just in the neighboring state, Nick decided to use this as incentive to get as many possible players who werent going GenCon to go to his tourney. More on who received and who didnt, hehehe. We had a total of 15 players, somebody receiving a BYE each, Nick was a good sport and I think he played a few games with the BYE players.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Games. I cant remember some of these people but Ill try, if I get somebody wrong hopefully people will correct me in the review section. Sorry If some of this is vague. I was playing EBO and YMSYL/Walker Garrison.<br/>
<br/>
1st Game vs Ryan Rosseau ??? Im not sure<br/>
<br/>
My EBO vs JP indp Hunters/Ships<br/>
<br/>
He started out with a few JP sites and some effects. I deployed Main Generators and North Ridge with ANSB on Generators using The Signal. Next few turns he deployed a couple docking bays with Bounty Hunters who drew a couple battle destinies as well as Maul and his ship to Tatooine. He forgot to force drain me a few times. I saved up force to deploy a manageable beatdown to Tatooine with Han, Chewie, Falcon and a couple scrub X-wings and pilots. I kicked Maul all the way back to the lost pile, but maul and ship covered all battle damage. My opponent thought twice to go back into space after the only battle in the game. So he sat down on his docking bays and drained for what he could. I got EBO working and finished him off. <br/>

<br/>
2nd Game vs Kid ??? He was the youngest in the tourney<br/>
<br/>
YMSYL/Walker Garrison vs Unfreeze Han.<br/>
<br/>
He started out with a General Han as Frozen and Audience Chamber. I put down 5th Marker and YMSYL/PFASA/Decree and Fett w/Rifle and Onith to the AC. In the next few turns Scout Luke and somebody else comes over to Rescue Han, he eventually does and retrieves 5 with general han. I still wonder why he just didnt deploy Han Solo instead for the retrieval of 10. He gets Jar Jar to run into the Wampa Cave and sit there, where my walkers cant get him. I curse myself for not having a Wampa to munch on him. But nevertheless I set up and start using Walker Garrison on him, as well as YMSYL. He tries to get the force drain bonuses with his flipped objective but I got Decree in effect. He plops down and sits tight at Tatooine for the rest of the game. I make Mucho Grande Burrito force drains with Walker Garrison and YMSYL.<br/>

Interlude: Lunch Break<br/>
<br/>
Theres a Dairy Queen across the road, so everybody makes a "Dash" across the street of Traffic. Note: This is not as dangerous as it seems, although dont try it at home. I get into this Ghetto "Dairy Queen" with Dann Albright and we mystifyingly get mesmorized by how slow these two ghetto employees make Blizzards. Anyway I get my Blizzard proceed to "Dash" back across the street having this Blizzard get my hands all sticky. But nevertheless i enjoyed the Ghetto Dairy Queen. Back to the games.<br/>
<br/>
3rd Game vs Rich Jeffery<br/>
<br/>
EBO vs Senate<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh i think to myself, im in trouble now. Rich starts out with Senate and stuff. I try and get my EBO running but am not pulling the right stuff. So he takes advantage and deploys Z in Mist Hunter along with 4 lom for the extra battle destiny. I keep drawing trying to get enough ships to deploy with more than ability 6. Eventually Z/Mist/4LOM move to Hoth, I look and have Haven in my hand. I think its a perfect time for a beat down, I deploy and start battle only to realize I only have 6 ability not 7! Shoot! No battle destiny for me, and Z/Mist/4LOM wreak havoc and I lose stuff. Where are those X-wing Laser Cannons? ARG! After that Rich started taking out 2 random cards from my hand and messing me up. Eventually he deployed R3 Fett to the Z in Mist w/4LOM to draw a total of 4 battle destiny. Not very promising, so i wrapped it up. Nice deck for Rich to play as he threw it together just the night before as he said.<br/>

4th Game vs Neal Graham<br/>
<br/>
YMSYL/Walker Garrison vs WYS<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh not again. Another good player, but how could that be? I just lost... Shoot. So I start out my usual, he starts off with WYS, Cantina, eventually gets Kessel, Tatooine, DB 94, and SpacePort DB. I make the same mistake of going to Tatooine as Lance Hentges who played Neal in an earlier round with his Lightsaber Combat deck. I take the Cantina over with a couple scrubs and Darth Maul. Put Chimaera, ISD, and Z/Mist into space to block some force drains. He had to split up his ships and constantly chase me, so he could draw a battle destiny. Also he used kept moving Talon Karde alone into the Cantina to block my drain and then use Dodge to get out of there. Brought some nostalgic feeling of a Josh Lynch sealed deck tourney  where his friend kept using Dash. LOL. Anyway, for some reason i couldnt draw Walkers even though i have 8 in my deck. So for some time being, Decree wasnt in effect and Neal was draining me for 2 at his DBs via I’ll take the Leader. Finally i get decree in effect, but not the way i wanted. Then all of a sudden he deploys Tatooine Celebration, to start some retrieval. I get desperate and try to battle him, this turns nasty against those damn palace raiders as he stacks SIXES on the Fish. Bad idea. I retreat, try to get my Walkers Going but its too late, Menace Fades are in effect and I cant do much except watch.<br/>

<br/>
5th Game vs Nick Larkins ??? Not sure. <br/>
<br/>
EBO vs Invasion<br/>
<br/>
This is the most fun I had in the tourney as we joked around quite a bit. I got out my usual EBO and he got his whole Invasion with Naboo going. There were plenty of locations and both of us were activating close to 15. He started deploying to Naboo, a couple droid control ships and some droid fighters. As well as some Droids to sites. I got EBO in effect and started spreading out across systems, he came on over to Hoth. Me being the dummy that I am decided to stay and battle, all of a sudden he Lateral Damages my R5w/R2 and Luke. I am left a little uneasy, but nevertheless proceed to shoot down a starfighter and get dealt quite a bit of damage. I cover it and proceed to avoid those damn droid ships. He cant chase me very well as i spread out, and deal some mega damage with EBO. <br/>

<br/>
6th Game vs Jordan Berg ??? Not sure.<br/>
<br/>
YMSYL/Walker Garrison vs EBO<br/>
<br/>
This was no contest and I realized this right away. I checked out his EBO earlier in some round to get some tech ideas for my own EBO. So when he sat down his response was "well, y’know what im playing, so what are you playing?" I gave him a hint as I put my toy AT-AT on table and made it obvious with the Starting Effects. Then it was on and for some reason it was a very slow game, that or everyone finished that much quicker. It was a non-confrontational game, I set up my Walkers did YMSYL got Decree in Effect. Did a couple Walker Garrisons battled his EPP Obi and R3 Lando a few times. He kept trying to retrieve but ended up not having enough force to pay for battle plan. So I whittled him down.<br/>

<br/>
So I got 6th, finished with 8 (+27) a solid score and pretty happily overall. Now for the moment you have all been waiting for. The Enhanced Jabba’s Palace box goes to... <br/>
<br/>
Matthew Clark!<br/>
<br/>
"What!?!" <br/>
<br/>
Rob Jeffery is disappointed no doubt, and mutters that he paid $10 extra for 10 extra entries. Everybody laughs. Matthew comments with glee to Lance Hentges "I only paid 3 more bucks" Everybody chuckles once again.<br/>
