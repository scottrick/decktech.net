<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">My third tournament had arrived. I decided to take a Carbon Chamber Testing deck and yet another revision of my Tosche Mains n Toys deck. I brought along my friend (he's not playing this tourney) to reintroduce him to the game after over a year of inactivity. I got there and bought my first 3 packs of Reflections. Rendezvous Point, Guest Quarters, and Chewbacca were my foils. No EJP yet. 12 players showed up for this one.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My DS Vs. Derek's Hidden Base<br/>
He starts with Yarna and I start Security Precautions over All Wrapped Up. I get EPP Han for my captive. After 2 or 3 turns of drawing up and searching for my Ugnaughts and stuff I get Danz Borin and an Ugnaught out to Carbon Chamber with Han. Then EPP's come down, I think Chewie, Luke, and Obi. I play Prepare the Chamber for a battle destiny but still lose by alot. Next turn I get a Dreadnaught or two out and those are later met by some of his stuff and I lose. I attempt to spread and drain by putting Zuckuss to Audience Chamber, Chall Bekan to Tatooine Docking Bay, and Niado Duegad to Cloud City Docking Bay. He deploys Boussh on one and Projection of a Skywalker on another effectively killing any hopes of decent draining. On his last turn he puts out lots of systems and ships and flips. I then draw up my last card on my turn. I lose by 27. I later realize, after the game, I coludn't have drawn up because of 'use 1 to draw 1'.<br/>
Full loss 0(-27)<br/>
Highlights: None<br/>
Lowlights: Way too many. I never do good against Hidden Base.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My LS Vs. Matt's ISB on Coruscant<br/>
He starts with Sunsdown on Coruscant and I start usual Tosche stuff. We both draw up for awhile. He gets out sites to Coruscant with an ISB agent to each, flips, and gets a Star Destroyer to Coruscant. Somewhere along, I deploy Battle Plan to slow his drains. On my next turn I get my mains out along 3 Tatooine sites and deploy the system, celebration, and two Corellian Corvettes. He deploys undercover spies to two of my 3 sites and gets 2 Dreadnaughts to Tatooine. Then he Lateral Damages one of them and I lose both in a battle there. He cancels celebration and fulfills Battle Plan. I get drained out. I lost by 25.<br/>
Full loss 0(-52)<br/>
Highlights: Still none for the day besides that foil Chewbacca<br/>
Lowlights: Him cancelling my drains and retrieval<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS Vs. Ben's QMC with Sabacc<br/>
He starts with Casino and some effect and I start All Wrapped Up. He gives me a Rebel but I forgot who. I figure I have a shot this game. I get my Ugnaughts with ECC IG-88 to the Carbonite Chamber with the Rebel captive dude. I freeze him. I deploy like 3 or 4 effects. Secret Plans, Reactor Terminal, and I forgot the others. He has lots of guys at the Casino, ECC Lando, 2 gas miners, and a main or two. I move Iggy over to Casino leaving two Ugnaughts at the Carbonite Chamber. On his turn during his draw phase he plays Sabacc, wins my stun rifle, but can't retrieve thanks to Secret Plans. I get U-3PO to Casino on my next turn. Next the scene moves to space as his two YT-1300's are beaten by my Dreadnaughts and Jabba's Space Cruiser with Fett and Danz Borin aboard. I move the Space Cruiser to the next cloud sector. He deploys an ECC Headhunter and Red Leader in Red 1 to another Cloud Sector. He also gets Obi to Carbonite Chamber, battles, moves an Ugnaught away and kills the other. He then moves Obi to same site as the other Ugnaught. On my turn, I Lateral Damage his Red Leader in Red 1 and move to that cloud sector. I also move my Ugnaiught with Obi back to the chamber. His turn he deploys Gold Leader in Gold 1 with Han to the cloud sector where my guys and his are. He battles, I lose Fett, he loses Red Leader in Red 1 and I think Han. On my turn I get a bunch of bounty hunters to Casino (Zuckuss and Djas Puhr I think). I battle, capture a gas miner, and get 3 destinies (1 from ability, 1 from IG-88 text, 1 from Jabba's Through With You). I clear the site but I lose all my dudes to attrition. He beats up my Jabba's Space Cruiser and Sabacc's maybe two or three more times over the rest of the game. He drains me out. Full loss by 11.<br/>
Full loss 0(-63)<br/>
Highlights: Putting up a good fight in space and on the ground. I later realized his drains all should've been one from the objective. I might've won.<br/>
Lowlights: Having my guys beat up from attrition in winning battles.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS Vs. Ben's Carbon Freezing<br/>
Looks like my deck but with more EJP and ECC. He starts All Wrapped Up, I start Tosche and Hut. I give him Wedge. I get EPP Han with ECC Chewie to Carbonite Chamber and they get beat up by Mara with saber, 4-LOM with gun, and IG-88 with Riot Gun. He captures Chewbacca and I lose Han. Han is then captured for All Wrapped Up. I Grimtaash him and he loses 3 Ugnaughts. I get EPP Obi with Lightsaber Proficiency to Tosche Station and Tawss Khaa and Bron Burs to the Cantina. I get a monk to the Hut. On Tatooine system I deploy Lando in Falcon and set up Celebration. His bounty hunters co,me down on my monk and he battles. I draw a 5 or 6 and he loses his guys to attrition. DVDLOTS also comes to Cantina and clears the site. I deploy Uncontrollable Fury on Vader and he's losing from that and my drains of 2 and 1. Battle Plan is out so his drains are 3 force. He freezes Han thanks to a Prepare the Chamber and moves Mara to Incinerator and retrieves a droid. I retrieve with Celebration and have my drains going while he has to pay. I win by 7.<br/>
Full win 2(-56)<br/>
Highlights: Grimtaash'ing his 3 Ugnaughts, setting up Uncontrollable Fury, clearing his site to attrition from a monk, and deploying Celebration.<br/>
Lowlights: Having Han and Chewie captured early. Having most of my guys lost.<br/>
<br/>
In the end I finish 10th out of 12. Bill Power won with his Carbon Freezing deck and his Throne Room deck where he used Jawa Ion Guns to capture IG-88. There were 2 HB decks, 2 Light Sabacc decks, 2 HDADTJ decks, 1 EJP Light objective decks, 1 RallOPs, and 2 EJP Dark objective decks from what I saw. In prizes I got a Punishing One foil, Rogue 3, Hound's Tooth, IG-2000, Mantellian Savrip, Bacta Tank, IT-O, Red 2, Commence Primary Ignition, R3-T6, and Kessel Run. On my way out, I bought another Reflections pack. My foil was DVDLOTS! That made my day. Good learning experience for my friend who will be playing in the next tournament hopefully.     </font></td>
