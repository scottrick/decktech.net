<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the obligitory Tuesday night Mirkwood report.<br/>
<br/>
I went with BHBM w/Trampls and Imp. Commands (Same as last week) and a QMC deck for LS (I figure if I’m gonna get my @#$% kicked, I might as well enjoy it:)<br/>
<br/>
at first we only had 7 people show up, and I got the Bye.  But about 2 minutes after the game started Donavan showed up, so we did all the scoring on paper, and I got to play Donavan.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my Queer Miners Colony (The whole Tibanna Industry has been queer for years you know) vs. Donavan’s RalOps.  WTF??<br/>
<br/>
Okay well I got launching the assault in my opening hand, and on turn 2 I took over Raltiir with Home 1 and Hobbie.  This made it very difficult for him to flip, and I just set up with the rest of my guys on CC, whilee he set up on Raltiir.  we pretty much just ignored each other, he came to space once to flip his objective, so I lost hobbie, he lost ozzel (off a Vic. Class Destroyer) and he ran away to Rendilli.  on my turn I deployed Bron Burs to an empty Raltiir site, and flip his objective back.  I also deploy master Wedge and porkins to Bespin and CC to flip my objective, deploy CC Celebtration, and consolidate my starfighters at Bespin.  From then on it was a drain race, which I was obviously winning (pucmir on CC, my drains all +1 and retrieveing 3 per turn, he’s only draining for 4).  He decides to attack with Mara, sends her plus her saber to take on Leia at the DT plaza.  Han is next door at the west gallery and took a pot shot at mara, missed.  Mara chops at Leia, swing and a miss, draws a 1 for BD,m I play Smoke Screen t5o kill Mara, and leia lives.  I drain him out, after retrieving for the last time.<br/>
<br/>
FW +12 or so<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  LS won, wonders never cease<br/>
Lows: beating Donanvan.  Donavan is a younger guy who really tries to play but just doesn’t have good enough cards (or startagies) to take on the better player.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Justin MoffWicket, and his Hidden mains done Poorly<br/>
<br/>
WTF, if I wanted to play Justin (a very good friend of mine, who is at my house at least once a week) I wopuld have had him over, so I could at least drink Beer while we played (Bud light in a bottle, yummy).  But on to the game.<br/>
<br/>
Okay Justin has faced this deck MANY times and it almost alwyas beats him, this was no different.  I did the usual BHBM start, and got Zuckuss in @#$% hunter plus 4-lom with big stick in my opening hand.  I deployed my DB crap and palpy and said go.  He deploys TAT. system plus Master wedge in ship to RP and moves them to Tat.  Okay here is where it got ugle, on 2nd turn, ZiMH plus 4-lom come to visit, draw 2 deswtinys total 8 goodbye wedge.  From then on I had totla control of the game he never put together enough cards to take down Zuckuss, and I took over the ground really quick.  at the end he had no thing on table, but Lando in Mini-falcoln with Nien Nub, for a drain of 1 at the Tat. System.  My objective did more damage to me than he did, and I forgot at least twice to make him stack a card, or I would have ended it in a duel, the way it should be.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Slaughtering Justin (we hadn’t played in a tourney in a while)<br/>
Lows: Forgetting to make him stack cards<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Jim Li’s Asteroids and droid odds.<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game was gay, i don’t have an answer for odds, although I could stop his asteroid draining with Imp. Decree so I took over the hoth and Yavin DB’s really quick, and then tried to trample Ozzel after he deployed droids (then I would have had 8 with Palpy Vader, Veers, instead of 2 with Ozzel Vader, Veers) and I missed on the trample.  Damn.  At this point he has an insert in my deck and 15 on table with 3 droids, plus and Ast. Sanc. going for 4.  I say I want to activte 7 (another Trample should be in there)On my seventh card the insert comes up I lose 13.  Thenm I say well I’ll finish activating.  So I activate till I only have 1.  Drain, then I do what is the stupidist thing I can.  I draw all of it looking for a trample????? WHY??? WHY must I be so dumb?????  well when I only had 1 card he did the smart thing deploy 4 x-wings to bossks in HT put out battle play and battle, I lose bossk to attrition, and that was the game, I can’t pay to drain, so I just draw up.  Jim wins by 16.<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  well....umm....gee....<br/>
lows: um... see the game report above...there wasn’t anything that wasn’t a low<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs.  Justin Moff Wicket again<br/>
<br/>
THIS SUCKS, I know his Huntdown is a good deck , and my QMC is a pile of crap (no wait I shouldn’t insult crap that way)  but we played fast just to get it over with, I controled space for the entire game with Hoem one and at one time 6 pilots, against his BH ships, and he controled ground, I never found Luke or Obi-with saber to kill his few non vader characters, and the 1 time I thought that I could flip I was wrong (that Objective suck ass) so we just battled for a while, I lost characters he didn’t.  I lost the game he didn’t.<br/>
<br/>
Fl by about 20<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Home one owning space<br/>
Lows: uh..this game sucked.<br/>
<br/>
okay I ent 2-2 with a negative Diff. and finished 5th.  No one went undefeated, and Josh Grace won the thing after beating Jim Li in the last game.<br/>
<br/>
