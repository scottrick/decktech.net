<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">        Sacramento.  The capital of California used to be a haven for great SWCCG players.  That haven has been destroyed over the past year.  There are various reasons for this which include childish behavior, and squadron neglect.  How the heck are you supposed to keep interest alive when there are no tournaments being held?  Thats simple.......you don't.  Thankfully, Carl "Mike" Hardy, a squadron member who gives a crap recently moved to the Sactamento area.  Hopefully, with his enthusiasm, we can help him resurrect SWCCG in that area.  Unless I'm working, or dead, I will support Mike's tourneys no matter where they are.  <br/>
<br/>
	On Thursday I get an email from the Alderaan Listserv that reads, "Any plans this weekend?  CANCEL THEM!!" (yes, we have our own listserv in Northern California) Now thats enthusiasm.....either that or psychotic, not sure which one yet.  A few hours later, I receive an email from Todd Feldman ranting something like "yeah, Sacto would be great.....plenty of people willing to give away rating points..." or something to that effect.  Now I've never been one that has been too stingy about giving away some points, and heck, if it pulls a little more interest to get some of the big names out there....I'm all for it.    <br/>
<br/>
	I call Todd on Saturday morning, and everybody decided to meet at the Gauntlet here in Modesto at 9:30, and we'd all just carpool up.  I get there at 9:25 and everybody is waiting for me.  Present company consists of Peter Nordstrom, Paul Todd Feldman, Eric and Jeff Fields.  I decide to go ahead and drive, so they all pile into my car for the hour + trip.  No near fatalities caused by us, but we did pass a flipped Jeep Cherokee on the way up.  Honestly, it was already flipped by the time we got up to it.  We arive at the Florin Rd Mall with plenty of time to spare.  Once they open the gaming room we get settled in, and wait for Mike to show.  Guess he got caught hard in the traffic caused by the flipped jeep.  The tournament was due to start at 11:00.......so of course, we get started promptly at 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
	Decks:  Same as they have been for a few tournaments now.  Kevin Shannon's TieBo for dark, and my TR Mains deck for light.  Revisions to the light deck consist of adding another Grimtaash, Oola, and another location.  <br/>
<br/>
	Game 1:  TR Mains vs Chris Giles Dark Deal<br/>
	Chris started with the downtown plaza.......and thats all he got.  I threw down Obi and saber first turn and started draining him right off the bat.  Re-enforcements came down when needed, but I never lost that drain the entire game.  Once Civil Disorder hit the table it was over.   Full Win by 38     2 (+38)<br/>
<br/>
	Game 2: TieBo vs Brett Nottingham's MWYHL/Y-Wing/Numbers<br/>
	Brett's starting effect was Rebel Fleet, so I knew right off the bat what was going on.  I look at my opening hand........and its all blue and a ghyyk.  So, I activate for 5 and drop a lone tie to Kashyyyk and pick up.  Got Rebel barrier in that draw.  Brett drops Raltiir, that effect that lets him retreive a y-wing each turn, Kessel, and goes to look for Yoda's hut.  Its not there and I get to verify on his first turn.  Exactly what I expected, except for the numbers.  Good thing I start with Surface Defence for all 3 effects.  I'm playing with no fear since I've got both the ghyyk and the barrier in hand, so I deploy lone ties to both Raltiir and Kessel.  Brett is planning on a beatdown.  He plays Organized Attack lost and gets 3 Y-wings.  He deploys 2 of them to Kashyyk and 2 more to Kessel and battles at both locations.  I just lose the ties plus 1 force at each system and give him an evil grin.  I activate for 7.  Drop a Dreadnaught at Kashyyyk, and deploy 4 ties for free.  Battle, All Power to Weapons.....I smoke him 25 to 4.  That was the beginning of the end.  His inserts only hit me for 2 at a time because Resistance was in full effect.    Full Win by 26     4(+64)<br/>
<br/>
	Game 3:  TieBo vs Peter Nordstrom's Profit<br/>
	I do my usualy lone tie to Kashyyyk on the first turn.  He deploys epp luke to the AC on his first turn.  I drain for 2.......and he loses a Double Agent and an Artoo.  High destinies have me scared for a little bit, but he never saves any force during his draw.  Within only a few turns, I have ties sitting at Kiffex, Kashyyyk, Tatooine, and Kessel.  While he flips his objective and spreads out early.  I get EPP Vader out against a lone EPP Han.  I initiate battle......Run Luke Run!!  I still chop up Han, while Luke and Vader both bite it with attrition.  Since I've gotten rid of Han, I've just cut his drains down to a minimum while I'm hitting him for 6 a turn.  Lando in Falcon make an appearance, but they get barriered.  Next turn, they get beat down.  Full Win by 23     6(+87)<br/>
<br/>
	Game 4:  TR Mains vs Paul Todd Feldman's Vile Gangsters<br/>
	My TR Mains deck has a total record of 17-3 up to this point, but 2 of those losses are to Todds Vile Gangster deck.  The man just has my number.  First turn, I drop EPP luke and Kal Fal to the AC, just to try to take an aggressive approach.  I get a drain there for a couple of turns, and I decide to force his hand by throwing Civil Disorder on his side of the table.  He counters with EPP Vader and 4-Lom.  He battles and we clear eachother out.  For the next 5-6 turns, we battle back and forth over JP locations, with neither of us getting any real advantage.  Were both stacking our destinies and just waiting for the right moment to attack in full force.  I've got Obi and stick, Orimaarko, Jerron Webb, and EPP Han at the Audience Chamber.  He's got 4-Lom, Iggy, Dannik Jericho, Jodo Cost, and Dengar with Blaster sitting accross from them.  I've got Chewie w/blaster in my hand, and my destinies set up to clear the location......except that Chewie got Barriered.  With only 2 saved force I can't move them away........so I decide to stay put.  Dengar proceeds to sniper both Chewie and Han during his control phase.....everybody else who is sitting on my side of the AC is close to following them to the lost pile.  Todd battles and clears me out.  I took over space entirely, but he's got the edge and I can't make up any ground from then on.    Full Loss by 9     6(+78)<br/>
<br/>
	Now my light has lost a total of 4 games, with 3 of them being to the same deck.  Oh well, there's no such thing as a perfect deck.  Todd ends up winning the tournament, while I finish in 2nd.  It was a fun tournemant, and I hope that we were able to help spark some interest back into the local players.  <br/>
