<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I just got back from my latest tournament at Grasshopper's Comics in Williston Park and decided to stop being lazy and write a report about the tourney.  There were 22 people including Scott Lingrell winner of the New Jersey state tournament which was cool.  All the regulars including Derek 'Datasta' Halpern, Matt 'I'M WRONG' Earnhart, Dennis 'LordBurger' Shea, and Chris 'Wedge231' Wo@#$%a were there as well.  I paid my entrance fee and we were off.  I'll apologize beforehand if there any HTML marking in here as this is my 1st Tourney Report, and I'm still getting used to transfderring from Microsoft Word to Decktech so cut me some slack if you see any.<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
<br/>
LS - My own Non-Objective Tatooine Mains deck starting Obi's Hut and the Tosche Station with loads of mains and generous SAC to boot.<br/>
<br/>
DS - A variation and combination of the Tatooine Occupation and Omega Doom deck that Chris 'Kusanagi' Holmes and I have been working on.  It is a typical M+T deck which starts Mos Eisley and Jabba's Palace and goes from there with lots of mains and SAC.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs. Morgan Dunn's (1583) DS Hunt Down Dueling deck.<br/>
<br/>
This turned out to be the best game of the day for me.  He starts with Bad Feeling Have I which slowed me down tremendously throughout the game.  I started out by knocking out Visage on the 1st turn with Transmission Terminated.  He gets down EPP Vader, Tarkin, and Igar on Tempest 1 at Lars Farm and flips.  I get out Ben w/Saber, Harc Seff, Orrimaarko, and Wedge at the Tosche Station to activate more and cancel his drains with Harc.  We avoided each other for a few turns as we were both looking for needed cards.  He holds off on dueling for a while as he proceeds to deploy Kashyyyk and Endor with Dreadnaughts and the Devastator patrolling both.  I get out Savrip and the Tank, and draw for starships and characters.  He gets out U-3PO to shut down my drain at the station, and I keep using Harc Seff to cancel his.  Harc seriously saved me about 15 force this game which helped tremendously.  I eventually take out his fleet with Lando in Falcon, Spiral, and EPP Han and own Kashyyyk with a POTF on it for a drain of 3 for the rest of the game.  He had to do something so he finally duels Ben seeing that I had already lost all my dueling protection off the top if my reserve deck earlier.  I tracked 2 5's, but he played Focused Attack and drew a 1,6, and a 7 to beat me by 3.  Ben is out of the game along with 9 force.  At this point, we both have little force left, and I'm winning the drain race, so he duels EPP Luke when I had no reserve deck due to needed force to deploy and move, so Luke turns to the DS and I lose 5.  He isn't damaging me any other way, and I keep running with Harc and Orrimaarko canceling his drains.  Eventually, the Tank and Savrip wore him out, and I drained him out to win by 4.<br/>
Full Win by 4<br/>
<br/>
Record: 2 (+4)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Playing smart and winning despite losing Ben and Luke to duels.<br/>
Lowlights: Losing both duels.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs. Steven Sferlazza's (1628) LS Harvest deck.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Obi's Hut and careful planning's for Lars Moisture Farm.  This was a pretty boring game as he kept running from me, and we only had 2 battles the entire game.  He harvested early, but I was able to grapple it, so it wasn't too bad.  I took out Owen and Beru with ECC IG-88, and after that, he just kept running from me as I followed with EPP Vader, Mara w/Saber, Mosep, and Dr. Evazan.  I get out U-3PO to block his drain at my Audience Chamber, while he gets out Boushh and Do Or Do Not with Wise Advice to shut down my SAC.  The key point in the game was when I deployed Kashyyyk with Zuckuss in ship, Bossk in ship, and Vader's Shuttle with a POTF for a drain of 3 that went on uncontested for the rest of the game.  I also got out Secret Plans, and the drain of 3 did him in as I put my hand back into my used pile to get a full win by 18. <br/>
Full Win by 18<br/>
<br/>
Record: 4 (+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning I guess...Not much except for keeping the Lars' off the table for most of the game. <br/>
Lowlights: Boushh canceling my drains and me missing a Sniper on her.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs. Bill Power's (1616) HB Suicide Mains deck.<br/>
<br/>
He starts normal HB stuff with Wars Not Make one Great as a starting effect.  This one was over on the 3rd turn.  I was able to quickly deploy Fat Jabba and EPP Boba Fett at the Jundland Wastes with a POTF for a drain of 3 on the 2nd Turn.  On the 3rd, I got greedy, and fetched Mara with the Audience Chamber and deployed Security Precautions and POTF there for a nice drain.  However, I gave him so much force from my location along with his, that he was able to deploy EPP Obi, EPP Leia, EPP Luke, and EPP Han, all against Mara on the 3rd turn.  She was hit and I lost 21 additional force from the battle.  I still didn't give up, as I deployed Bossk in Bus and Dengar in Punishing One to take out Gold Leader in Gold 1 at Coruscant, but due to bad destiny draws on my part, he loses the ship and 7 rather then much more.  I also get out EPP Vader and Dr. Evazan for a drain at the Audience Chamber since he moved away.  He gets out Order to Engage which eventually does me in, as Jabba and Fett have to run from the EPP wrecking crew.  I drain him for a while and he never flips, but I lose 9 to Order to Engage and kill myself by initiating with Fett and Jabba the Hutt when I couldn't run anymore.  He later admitted that he had a great hand with all those EPP's, and I never expected a beatdown like that that early in the game, and the early force loss was too much.  Bill is a great guy, and is always fun to play against.  I lose by a respectable 9.<br/>
Full Loss by 9<br/>
<br/>
Record 4 (+13)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Almost coming back to win after that beatdown on poor Mara.<br/>
Lowlights: That beatdown on poor Mara.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS vs. Benjamin Daria's (1458) Strange High Destiny Dr. Evazan deck with massive weapons and few characters.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit confused as he starts with the Hoth:Ice Plains and The Defensive Perimeter with Combat Readiness.  Locations come out quickly from both of us as we are both activating about 15 by the 3rd Turn.  He's just drawing and saving force, and I have no idea what he's doing, so I deploy Ben w/Saber, EPP Leia, and Wedge to his Cantina to drain.  Next turn, he deploys Mara w/Saber and Dr. E w/his Gun and initiates a battle.  He has tons of force, and just keeps shooting until he hits all of my guys and operates on Ben and Leia leaving Wedge ripe for the beating but his destiny is low, and I only have to lose Wedge and 2.  I'm worried at this point, as he has DLOTS, Mara, and Dr. E at Obi's Hut for a drain of 4, and I realize I have to do something about it.  I didn't want to fight him with Dr. E toting that gun, so I spread out like mad.  Lando in Falcon with Melas and Spiral go to Kessel to drain while Obi-Wan Kenobi w/Saber goes to his Defensive Perimeter.  He just sits there draining me for 4 for 2 more turns, so I spread out more deploying EPP Luke at his Defensive Perimeter and moving to the Ice Plains, while Orrimaarko heads to his Audience Chamber.  I drain him for 10 a turn, and he drains me for 4 a turn for 2 turns, and then he spreads out.  He attempts to Counter Assault me a few times, but ends up losing more force then he would have normally.  I track a 5, and deploy Tawss Khaa to take out Mara, and the game ends soon after that.  I later find out that he has only 4 characters in the deck were Vader, Mara, Dr. Evazan, and Tarkin with multiples of each including 4 Dr. Evazans!  I give him credit for a cool idea, and I think with a little work, his deck could work.  He played much better then his rating showed, but in the end, my drains were too much.  <br/>
Full Win by 12<br/>
<br/>
Record 6 (+25)<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Scott Lingrell - for being a nice guy and helping me find that Mara's Saber when I thought I lost it.<br/>
Bill Power - for being the cool guy he is and using really think polysheets.<br/>
Derek Halpern - for wearing those shorts with the baggy pockets.<br/>
Everyone else who participated - everyone was nice and the sportmanship shown was excellent, and the atmosphere was great as well.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Mini Twix Bars - for melting in my pocket.<br/>
<br/>
I end up in 5th place which wasn't bad and get a Lando in Falcon, Foil Vengeance, and a foil Obsidian 8 in prize support which was pretty cool.  Scott Lingrell won, Derek came in 2nd, Matt came in 3rd, and Chris came in 4th followed by me.  It was a fun tourney and I can't wait for the next one.  Also, I was checking out RamapoCon 2 which looks awesome, and I hope to see everyone there May 5th-7th.  There are uncut sheets, hundreds of foils, T-shirts, and many other numerous cool prizes as well. <br/>
