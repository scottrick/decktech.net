<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok for all you Michigan people out there, there are bi-weekly tournaments at fortress now. They are sanctioned and on Tuesdays, COME!<br/>
<br/>
My decks<br/>
<br/>
LS:WYS with kessel runs, Punch It and Surprise Assault are the main tech choices.<br/>
<br/>
DS:Court of the vile gangster I borrowed from Jim West. I added a Stinger and second Xixor, both of which turned out to be very useful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
<br/>
Light vs. Jeff with the beard and glasses<br/>
<br/>
Jeff’s a nice guy and follows the rules to the letter so it was a smooth relaxed game. He starts no objective and the endor:dark forest and then procceds to fill endor with biker scouts/bikes and the emperor with overseeing it personally. He also plays search and destroy which hurts me for several turns. Eventually I get drains at kessel and the tatooine docking bay and establish menace fades. His drains now reduced and his search and destory ineffective Jeff is stuck in a bind. He can’t develop a plan to fight on tatooine because bikers aren’t very flexible that way and my drains finish him off. The game would have been closer if not for me playing legendary starfighter on the falcon, in the games only battle. Full Win by 15.<br/>
<br/>
Good: I learned my updated version of watch your step can win when your opponent ignores you.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: non-fighting games are boring, but sometimes it turns out that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
Dark vs. Jeremiah Himmelbrand<br/>
<br/>
I was expecting Jeremiahs tried and true hidden base but he begins instead with Watch Your Step. Second turn he puts dash in outrider with a frieghter captain at Tatooine. I respond with Zuckuss in MH and Guri on the Stinger which I searched for with court. They clear him from the system and he wouldn’t have any real space presence the rest of the game. So anyways I’m feeling good when all of a sudden I relize I lost the game. Why you ask? Because he put two friegther captains and jedi luke w/saber in the cantina and inserted odds. Plus I’ve seen lots of signals and effective repairs so I know he can play odds as many times as he wants. I continue winning board control but 26 insert damage(popped three times) kills me. It was still a small differential. Full Loss by 9.<br/>
<br/>
Good: I won all the battles and force drained for more then my opponent.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: Losing to something like odds, since when does such a high rated player play cheese?<br/>
<br/>
2(+6)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
Light versus Chad with glasses, who complained about his headache<br/>
<br/>
Chad is playing Raltiir, which could be tuff since I don’t play the non-unique site killer. Second turn he flips with three premiere stormtroopers on three sites and saves two force for a imperial barrier and a ghhhk in his hand. I decide to stay off the ground against a trooper beatdown deck and start kessel running with Captain Han and Talon Kardde in the Falcon. He attacks with the Devastator with Thrawn and Palleon. I play punch it and draw 22 for battle destiny and I’m immune to attrition. He loses everything and I loose nothing and that would be the only space battle this game. Still he is subtracting one from my drains and draining me for three. About turn 7 he stops saving force and draws it all up. I deploy first strike, jedi knight luke with lightsaber, and start a battle versus a stormtropper at the spaceport preafects office. Hit the trooper and draw a 3 for battle destiny, which makes him loose 10 cards. For some reason he doesn’t seem to care and I have one force left and tell him to go. His eyes light up and he deploys Vader with saber and 7 stormtroopers and then plays tatical support for another 3 troopers. Then he starts a battle, hits luke with two 5’s and plays trooper assault. I would have taken about 30 battle damage except that I spent one force for my houjix I was saving and my opponent nearly broke into tears. So he loses Vader and on my next turn I complete a kessel run and draw my one surprise assault. He force drains at the site with 10 troopers, I play surprise assault, he takes 35 damage, game is over. Full Win by 23<br/>
<br/>
Good: Beating raltiir without the counters. Setting a possible record for surprise assault. Completing a kessel run.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: nothing.<br/>
<br/>
4(+29)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side versus Chris Feher<br/>
<br/>
Chris is playing Quiet Mining Colony. I know the key to beating this is controlling the bespin system which removes celebtraion and keeps the objective on the sucky zero side. First turn I throw Mighty Jabba, and Ephant Mon to the audience chamber for some quick drains while he plays alot of CC sites. When he flips (about turn 4) he has celebration, Dash in the outrider at bespin, Pucmir Thryss, the downtown plaza, and lando playing sabacc at the retrieve three force sabacc site. My following turn I play scum, deploy zuckuss in mist hunter, deploy the virago using my objective and put Xixor on it. They crush dash and later with IG-88 in ship would crush the falcon. With the inability to flip his objective he is screwed. Things got even worse for him when he lost the second outrider off the top of his deck and I won the pulsar skate as stakes in sabacc. He tries some kind of ground fight and some more sabacc but I’m doing 4 times as much damage each control phase and it’s over really fast. Xixor kills the Son of Skywalker at the downtown plaza on the last turn. I did this just for fun. Full Win +22.<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning space. Winning a hand of sabacc and getting something good.<br/>
<br/>
Bad: If he had kept that objective flipped for three or four turns the game would have been over.<br/>
<br/>
6(+51)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So in the end I am the winner by differential. Brett tells me he forgot the prizes and they were crap CC packs anyways so I don’t feel too bad. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Final Standings:<br/>
<br/>
1st: Andrew Ehret (me) 6(+51)<br/>
2nd: Jeremiah Himmelbrand 6(+50)<br/>
3rd: The guy in the hat who likes warhammer alot, he beat Jeremiahs numbers deck. 6(+something near zero)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Ironic that the person playing numbers would loose by one card. I guess its the universes sense of balance.<br/>
