<br/>
me and david a. were picked up by scott and ron and head to the tourney. I brought a syc ties similar to ravelings but teched out with cool stuff like set for stun and I&amp;#8217;d just as soon kiss a wookie. I play a combination of interceptors and defenders to protect from grimtaash.  I always start secret plans, tint/oe, and mp.  light was wys beats with all four of those pilots and their ships along with han, luke, chewie, lando, melas, and talon for the ground.  its really high destiny and has 2 on the edges.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 <br/>
<br/>
ds vs cant remembers x-wing swarm<br/>
<br/>
First turn I put down wakeelmui, sullust, ds wr and draw.  He puts down 5 systems from his hand, he never pulled any!  I draw again and have the tie engine all waiting for him to deploy.  He organized attacked to get some x wings but I monnoked and got 4 wings and nothing else, but he&amp;#8217;s running cannons and pivots so Im kind of scared.  he puts down gen cal in gs1 at sullust and a lone xwing at his coruscant. I&amp;#8217;m activating a bit and had saved a lot so I put death star assault squad in front lando and a dread and a bunch of free ties to coruscant. I lateral damage the xwing. he has two force left but I twileck for first strike any ways. I&amp;#8217;ve got those rebels cannot escape us for hyperescape or the spiral so I attack lando he hyperescapes to kessel, pays two and I grab it. so now he has no force with first strike out with a power and forfeit zero xwing in front of 19 power+destiny&amp;#8230;but I dont have an all power so he only has to lose 22 force. he puts a lone xwing at alderaan then moved it to the ds. I put a dread in front of it and finish off lando with a laser cannon. he has like 5 force in his life force so hes pretty desperate.  he moves the xwing. I play all power lost to get some ties and beat up his last wing but this time he leaves force for a houjix. but he cant do anything so he just picks up. the whole game I was using operational as planned to put my hand in my deck so I ended up winning by 32.<br/>
<br/>
2(32)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
<br/>
ls vs cant remebers bhbm<br/>
<br/>
I start insurrection, staging, and squadass.  He starts iao, mp, and I cant remember.  he puts down emp at db and pulls emps power. I pull h1 db and put jedi luke there.  He draws as do I.  With in a few turns he has bossk with gun, xizor, ig88, and ozzel in the cantina and zuckuss with 4-lom at tantooine.  Ive deployed melas to tant db to flip, moved luke over then transferred melas up to a waiting dash and moved them to kessel.  I really want to beat down zuckuss but I cant get ability of 7 for the life of me so I put down mirax and wedge in there ships and transfer luke up.  He attacks and draws three destiny for a total of less then nine so I just had to lose luke while he lost everything.  he then divides his forces and puts ozzel and xizor at the tant db.  he did this because hes kind of choked thanks to goo neey tay and battle plan.  So my turn I put down draw their fire, frozen assets, han, luke, chewie, play two of the adders, missed ozzel but hit xizor and draw 7 destinies. he loses 21 force and I lose luke. he can&amp;#8217;t do anything now so he just picks up.  vader never hit the table. I won by 24.<br/>
<br/>
4(56)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
ls vs kevin james raveling syc.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of staging areas I start draw their fire.  my game plan is to just draw until I have the beat crew and frozen assets&amp;#8230;then beat the crap out of a lone tie with a gun.  but hes got main course (I knew I should have played beggar) so Im kind of screwed.  so I set up light on the ground, kill arica, my drains are blocked by dreaded starfleet and dark waters.  I grimtassh and get a few ties and some red, it wasnt anything huge, but he wisely grabs it.  He puts some ties with a gun and endor and I am having a really hard time putting my beat crew together despite 3(6) tunnel visions.  But thanks to the grimtaash, it can wait, and steady drains he cant really get my ships off his systems, despite a lateral damage. Ive been holding on to a few maneuvers but he already lost a cannon, had one out, and had only two cards in his hand, so I play it and used it to retrieve only 10 force because he grabbed the first edge.  well a tie interceptor comes down with his last cannon and blasts away both of my piloted ships. so now all my ships are in my lost pile except a pilotless pulsar skate in front of a tie with a gun. I put luke on it and attack he hits me (but not using 3 force) but I clear the site.  I have battle plan and aim high out and he&amp;#8217;s really low on cards so I squeak out a victory of 6 because he ran out of ties to put on dreaded.<br/>
<br/>
6(62)<br/>
<br/>
ds vs paul motz raveling wys<br/>
<br/>
I get some systems out, he doesn&amp;#8217;t flip first turn but second.  so Im getting every thing set up while he has talon with wedge at the cantina and a rfc and palace raider and patrol craft at tant db which is dark watered.  he puts down bacta tank, and cc db followed by some scrubs.  I put down arica. who soon gets blasted by han, but I grab sorry about the mess.  He puts down back door but I put down u3p0. so the only drains I have to take are the cc db and an occasional drain at the ds db, when I didnt have a tie to spare.  so the only ship he runs is the outrider. which comes out mid game.  the problem is he keeps on playing dont get @#$%y to kill any tie whenever I attack, so he just kills the armed ties or kills the powerful squadrons.  the other problem is that wedge &amp;#8220;jesus christ super star&amp;#8221; antilles is not only in the cantina but on the outrider, which neither of us notice.  bloody forfeit 10 wedge and bacta tank make my attempts to destroy the outrider futile, and I had already used the only control/set for stun I had drawn to cancel a drain when I didnt have a tie, and didnt think hed have a prayer in space.  so I keep him busy at a system while my other ties are busy draining him.  since he doesnt have any retrieval and limited drains Im  winning the drain race.  he was going to live another turn by moving  dash in front of one of my drains but a gravity shadow kept him in his place.  I cant remember by how much I won except mid teens.<br/>
<br/>
8(80ish)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
<br/>
ds vs. kevin james wys with lots of freighter captains<br/>
<br/>
I neutralized his drains on the ground but im having trouble getting my space going.  hes got capt han with a freighter captain at kessel. so that means maneuver 7 and 3 destinies and I already have a bunch of my ties and a dread at tant.  he also has the outrider at kiffex.  so I debate who to kill and choose the wrong one and go after dash.  He has bacta tank out so killing dash and a capt. required a lot of my cards including a set for stun and lateral damage, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t inflict any damage and Im running out of ties quick.  He gets back door out with some dudes and I cant find my dark waters.  he has aim high and I hope shes all right out and Ive been eating his drains at kessel because Im out of ties so I move all but one from tant in front of the falcon.  He attacks and wrecks me with some tracked destinies, and I had to lose either all my ties or the dread so I lost the dread.  he then moves his falcon in front of my lone tie.  I dont have anything in my hand and no dreads out so theres nothing I can do and he beats me for a bunch of force and I am never able to recover.  I played this game all wrong and kevin played really well and deserved to win.  I lost by 11.<br/>
<br/>
8(69ish)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
ls vs paul motz lewis-bhbm<br/>
<br/>
I know what hes playing and start aim high and insight.  we both draw a bit and I grimtaash getting 3 dreadnaughts, 3 interceptors, and 2 lord vaders.  he deploys a spuadron to endor to retrieve 3 ties and lets me go. I come down with some ships but he barried the first one so he didnt have to lose much force.  I put luke at tant db and spread in space to flip.  he draws some.  I grimtaash out of my lost pile to get three interceptors, and two of vaders sabers.  even with lateral damages he cant really beat me off, and Im draining at his systems, the one time he would have beat me I hyperescaped or played it can wait.  one time he attacked with a squadron and an interceptor but I played dont get @#$%y and that tie found himself all alone and got beat up.  at one point I moved wedge in front of a lone tie and he couldnt do anything but lose the force when I attacked.  Hes got choke vader in the cantina but han shuffles over and is joined by chewie.  I attack and play life debt, he chokes chewie but I still get the destinies to kill vader.  eventually I got the shuffle going for a nice drain as well as space drains. so hes really feeling the pressure and cant really do anything.  hes got a group of ties with a dread and is slowing my drains.  He also has a vader with a presence at the tant db.  vader takes luke, but he never loses to his objective except once.  But thanks to grimtaash and aim high hes way to far behind, and I retrieved 10 with one edge card, but couldnt find the other.  I won by 22.<br/>
<br/>
10(91) which is good enough for first.<br/>
<br/>
so me and my partner in crime took 1st and 2nd and pulled sht in our r2 packs, and whats up with the foil decree being all off centered? oh well, who cares.  kevin took 3rd.  <br/>
