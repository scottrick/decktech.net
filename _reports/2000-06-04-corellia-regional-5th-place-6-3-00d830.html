<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Obligatory road trip story:<br/>
<br/>
Geoff Snider and Jason Markley make the trip up from Normal, IL to my<br/>
apartment near Chicago, and show up an hour late at 12:30 in the<br/>
afternoon.  Geoff has brought a mini tape recorder to do some interviews<br/>
for an Older Code, http://starwars.cyberianet.com.  Not<br/>
surprisingly, they had already started recording various amusing<br/>
anecdotes on the drive up from Normal.  Apparently, a WB Vine Snake hit<br/>
an Illinois State Trooper on I-55, and they were almost pulled over. <br/>
But Geoff must have canceled the Trooper Assault, and they made it up<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
After resting in my apartment for a few minutes, and reliving some of<br/>
the more humorous memories of the 2 hour journey up here, we embarked<br/>
on our journey to Detroit.  Much humor was had on the trek to Detroit,<br/>
but only Joe Alread, chief computer guy for Older Code, will determine<br/>
what is suitable for publication ;)  Our long journey was extended when<br/>
a key exit was closed for repairs, and I ended up driving all over Ann<br/>
Arbor and its surroundings, including the Univ. of Michigan campus.  But<br/>
we made it to the hotel with a 45 minute delay.<br/>
<br/>
Obligatory night before portion:<br/>
<br/>
By the time we had arrived, I had decided to play Rops for dark side,<br/>
but I still had not figured out what I wanted to play for the Light<br/>
side,<br/>
so we began our playtesting.  Sometime during the process, I had<br/>
determined I was going to play the Snider speed Profit deck since it was<br/>
more straight forward than my alternative deck, Test to 2.  By around<br/>
11, we had wondered if the Indiana crew who was supposed to stay with us<br/>
(Brian Fred, along with an unknown assortment of guys), were going to<br/>
show up, but they eventually did.  By this time, I had just wanted to<br/>
get to sleep, since it was already 2 in the morning, and we needed to<br/>
get up between 7:30 and 8.  But I could not sleep, so Markley, Fred, and<br/>
myself, decided to stay up all night to test decks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime between 5 and 6 in the morning, I decided that the Profit deck<br/>
relied too heavily on the opening hand, and decided to switch to Test<br/>
to 2 deck, despite the Older Code interview 7 hours before.  We left the<br/>
hotel, and arrived at the tournament location at about 9:30.  By this<br/>
time, I could barely stay awake.  We ended up starting the tournament<br/>
around 10:30.  I was hoping for an easy first game to try to wake myself<br/>
up, unfortunately, this did not happen.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. standard Throne Room (Brian Fred, 2128)<br/>
Going into this game, my plan for dealing with Throne Room was to only<br/>
deploy the Desert to Raltiir, and hold off on the other generic sites<br/>
until I could safely flip.  I was able to do this, and have the right<br/>
combination of Barriers/Reacts/Alters/Grabbers to withstand the first<br/>
attack on Raltiir.  I think I was able to keep the objective flipped for<br/>
the entire game, and use his Draw Their Fire more than he was<br/>
giving me an advantage.  The key plays were Iggy w/ Gun capturing Melas<br/>
in the Executor ending his drain there, and Premiere Vader and Obi<br/>
battling with sabers on the Jungle, and Vader hit, and Ben missed,<br/>
giving me a steady drain of 2 for the remainder of the game.  I win by<br/>
6.<br/>
2 (+6)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs. ECC Objective Dark Deal/Occupation deck.<br/>
This is one of my better match ups, and I was able to get my Testing<br/>
done, and use various cheesiness such as Clash, Barrier, Sorry About the Mess,<br/>
Order to Engage, Scramble to win fairly easily.  I win by 23.<br/>
4 (+29)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. standard Profit (Ed Rebman?, 1863)<br/>
I was able to flip and again have the right combination of defensive<br/>
cards to withstand his first attack.  I keep the objective flipped, and<br/>
eventually manage to kill Han eliminating his drain.  Most of the damage<br/>
came from Uncontrollable Fury and EPP Luke camping out in the Audience<br/>
Chamber, and Boussh on Raltiir.  In retrospect, I should have come for<br/>
the beatdown with Vader on EPP Luke when he was on Raltiir because it<br/>
was not necessary to drop that much power to get rid of Luke, and I<br/>
missed with my swing anyway ;)  I win by 14.<br/>
6 (+43)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs. beatdown Court (Casey Galvan?, 1969)<br/>
He starts Bad Feeling, but his objective gives me enough force to pull<br/>
Yoda on the first turn, and Daughter on the 2nd turn, so it does not<br/>
slow me down too much, it just gives me less cards in hand to lose to early<br/>
drains.  I was able to finish Test 1 only missing one draw, and with the<br/>
help of Electrobinoculars, able to guarantee the 2nd test.  I was able<br/>
to Uncontrollable Fury Vader early on, and Weapon Lev his first You are<br/>
Beaten.  And I was able to Effective Repairs soon after his 2nd one, so<br/>
I was getting 2 cards a turn most of the game.  I was keeping keep up<br/>
with his space drains with EPP Luke w/ Proficiency and Barrier/Sorry About<br/>
the Mess to protect him.  I get EPP Obi to the Cantina to start winning<br/>
the damage race, and EPP Han and Orrimaarko with the help of Scramble,<br/>
are able to clear his Audience Chamber stopping his last ground drain. <br/>
Throughout the game, EPP Vader managed to Alter Projection of a<br/>
Skywalker several times, but with Wise Advice, I was able to recycle<br/>
them, and managed to keep one on his drain +1 site eliminating that<br/>
drain.  I win by 8.<br/>
8 (+51)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs. Vader/Tarkin/Jade Hunt Down (Jason Ogden?, 1874)<br/>
I had a Tunnel Vision in my hand on the first turn, but looking through<br/>
my reserve deck every turn, I never had the opportunity to Tunnel Vision<br/>
for either a Wind Chimes or a Bothan Spy, since they were all in my<br/>
reserve deck, and eventually, they were all lost off the top.  The 2nd<br/>
Uncontrollable Fury was able to keep the game reasonably close, but he<br/>
got out his space drains to keep ahead of the damage race.  He got out<br/>
the Hoth War Room/Responsibility of Command combo on EPP Obi to stop my<br/>
drain of 3 at my Cloud City lower corridor, but by that point, the game<br/>
was really over already.  I lose by 15.<br/>
8 (+36)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs. Hidden Base #s/Kessel Run<br/>
This was a relatively easy game, and I manage to flip and get out Navy<br/>
Trooper Vesden before his first insert pops, giving me a 14 total to his<br/>
5.  Search and Destroy was also active most of the game until he landed<br/>
some ships and Freighter Captains on my Raltiir, which I was able to get<br/>
rid of.  I win by 28.<br/>
10 (+64)<br/>
<br/>
I end up tied for 4th, and the first tie breaker after differential was<br/>
head to head, but we never played each other, and the second breaker was<br/>
highest win, but we were tied after that as well.  I would technically lose out<br/>
on the next breaker to second highest win, so I came in 5th place. <br/>
Brian Fred won the final duel by 1 or 2 points after two very good games<br/>
against Jared Lockwood.  Since we would have gotten back late, we<br/>
skipped the usual after tournament festivities, and got on the road for home.<br/>
