Well, I realize that this tourney happened over a month ago but I just haven’t had time to write out a tournament report on it, because of exams and what not.<br/>
<br/>
It all started when I looked on the decipher tournaments page. I saw the advertisement for the tourney, called up my crew and we were off that Sunday. Andrew Pittet’s Mom drove us down (I’m 16, and don’t have my G2 yet). I was anxious to see how successful I could be when I came in with 2 awesome decks. The provincials were a week before that and I went 3-0 with my BHBM but 0-3 with my WYS. Since everybody was playing anti-WYS. And well it just wasn’t my WYS’s day. So I decided to construct a new light side. The Ontario Provincial Winners light deck (I live in Ontario) looked awesome as he went undefeated with it in the Provincials. It’s a force choke deck that plays super luke (a.k.a. luke + saber + saber proficiency + courage of a skywalker + jedi presence = 34 power) and super falcon featuring captain han and epp leia, and I know. So I built a version of it with some of my own tech and what not. <br/>
<br/>
So I get to the tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Force Choke vs. Some guyz MKOS swarm, (the guyz MKOS is good I saw it in action the week before, or at least I heard about it.)<br/>
<br/>
What a game. He starts setting up fast. MYO in the audience chamber, and then Abyssins everywhere. And because he started No Bargain, my revos are useless. I hate that. Anyway he sets all up and my super falcon is useless since he’s playing pure ground. He deploys Mara Jade and her saber + 3 abyssins to my Obi’s Hut. Next turn I come down with, Obi, Luke, Han, Leia. And play super luke except without jedi presence. I hit mara and play blaster prof. To place her in the lost pile. I clear the site and he has to loose like 20. but now I am stuck at the damn hut. While he throws down search and destroy (the hut isn’t a battleground) and spreads out to drain. Luckily I had a saber on luke and reflection on leia. Slowly I won. <br/>
<br/>
FW by 8 - 2/+8<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: Hitting Mara and playing blaster prof. And killing the abyssins badly.<br/>
Low’s: Being stuck at the damn Hut.<br/>
Game 2: My BHBM vs. James Sowden’s cheap imitation of my force choke.<br/>
<br/>
Okay for the long and the short of the game. He has obi, luke, and kalfal down. I deploy vader and his saber capture luke and play the circle is now complete. Thinking that would be the game winner as kalfal was kicked up the ass. But (big scrub move) I didn’t see the damn Lightsaber prof that was hiding on obi. Vader’s placed out of play. What a move by me, but this kid is a scrub and starts dancing around. Anyway, to make a long story short. Imperial Barrier saved me 10000 times. And I ended up winning it by 15 thanks to a late game limited resources. <br/>
<br/>
FW by 15 - 4/+23<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: Winning the game after my Vader was placed out of play since like turn 2 of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Low’s: Getting vader placed out of play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Force Choke vs. some kidz BHBM Royal Guard deck.<br/>
<br/>
Not too much too this game. He was choked like a chicken activating like 3 a turn. While I beatdown left and right.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 28 - 6/+51<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: Beating the crap out of him<br/>
Low’s: Nothin’<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My BHBM vs. This guyz Generals in space with scouts on ground lots of tech deck.<br/>
<br/>
We were both undefeated at this point. I completely dominated him this game on ground and I space. Limited Resources killer once again.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 15 - 8/+66<br/>
<br/>
And that was that. I won the tourney: I got 3 packs of Dagobah (yeh) and a Case Topper Darth Vader FOIL Japanese (sweet).<br/>
Well what a tourney that was. I love being undefeated. <br/>
<br/>
Props out to Andrew Pittet’s mom for driving us down to Hamilton and back home. <br/>
<br/>
Props to Andrew Hill for going +84 but not winning the tourney, because he had 6 points while I had 8. <br/>
<br/>
Props out to James Sowden for scrubing out in Hamilton with - 35. lol. And for losing to my BHBM when I had no vader and my deck revolves around vader.<br/>
<br/>
Props out to Kyle for scrubing out in Hamilton just like always. Keep on playing buddy you’ll get good eventually. Props out to Andrew Pittet for getting a Mara Jade for $10.00 because of my bargaining skills. Also props for sharing a beastly pizza with me after the tourney. <br/>
<br/>
And props to the Hamilton SWCCG crew for getting demolished by me and Andrew Hill who are both not from around there. We’ll see you soon to take over another tourney. And props out to Decipher for taking a month to update my rating! Because of that tourney I went from 1606 to 1655.<br/>
