<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">		I got up at like 9:30 in order to make the 11:45 tournament at Moose&amp;#8217;s. This was going to be my first tournament there in weeks, because my decks were not ready by the time a tournament came around.(If you are wondering why its because I&amp;#8217;ve been spending a month trying to counteract the huge amount of whoopass going into dark side JP after JPSD came out.) My decks were a 5-0 in tournament play Huntdown, and a brand spanking new MWYHL test to four , which as of now is a test to six. <br/>
<br/>
GAME 1 : HUNTDOWN VS. John Torres&amp;#8217;s HIDDEN BASE <br/>
<br/>
	This was a relatively slow game when it comes to Huntdown, considering that we had one ground battle the entire game. He started the usual, Squassin, Insurrection, and Insight. I started IAO, Mob points, and No Escape. He spent most of his time sending his ships to the Rendezvous Point for like &amp;#8211;5 each, and then moving them out. I got a dbay down, and vader w/ stick with tarkin down. He again went to the air , and put dash and outrider at kessel. I sent bossk in bus on a suicide, and forgot that dash subtracts 6 from power, so I got smacked. He sent EPP leia, and chewie down to the dbay. I smack them around, take no damage. He flipped later, after some problems with the hidden base, but I drain him out and won by 25. <br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+25)<br/>
HIGHS: Huntdown is 6-0<br/>
LOWS: Bossk getting smacked. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2 : MWYHL VS. Moose&amp;#8217;s EMPEROR/DSJP SMACK<br/>
<br/>
	Ok, this didn&amp;#8217;t go as well as I would have hoped with a new deck. I started the Wise Advise combo card instead of the regular which was still I my deck. Big mistake. Didn&amp;#8217;t see it didn&amp;#8217;t add to training destiny. So guess what? Second turn , attempt test one, break even at 12. He sets up his JP drain with Emperor , Gailid and Mosep. Luckily, Test 1 stopped that, but still, the drain off top of reserve were killing me. I took to the air, he laterals home one, I&amp;#8217;m screwed. Lost by 12.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(+11)<br/>
HIGHS: NOTIN<br/>
LOWS: LOSIN<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3 : MWYHL VS . Vikram Bali&amp;#8217;s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
	This time I start Wise Advise. I get Rebel Scout Luke and Saber to the docking bay, and he ignores me by putting Lord Vader at Endor Dbay. I drain a few turns, get to test 4 , and he sends in the smack. Dengar, Mara, and Lord Vader move over to the Luke site. Damn, just Obi w/ in my hand. Vader caps , and I&amp;#8217;m in trouble. But wait! I send Vader to the throne room automatically cuz of luke&amp;#8217;s text, and deploy obi. Hit mara , he misses. Lose wedge, he covers, but he loses everything. But still got out drained in the start. Loss by 18.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(-7) <br/>
HIGHS: SMACKDOWN<br/>
LOWS: COULD&amp;#8217;VE WON.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4 : HUNTDOWN VS. Vikram Bali&amp;#8217;s PROFIT<br/>
<br/>
	Revenge! Or is it ? I &amp;#8216;d finally get to see what my Huntdown was made of. I start draining quick, he frees Han 4th turn. Damn! So, he sends leia with wax lando, han, and luke over to battle DVDLOTS w/ saber and dengar w/ and fett w/. I intiate, choke han. He attempts to swing at vader&amp;#8230;. No . force field. I hit leia. He misses dengar. I hit luke. He attepts to exclude dengar, I draw 6 he draws 2.his destiny, 0 . Mine, 5 . He loses everything, I lose nothing. Need I say more?? Win by 30. <br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+23)<br/>
HIGHS: THE SMACKDOWN OF THE TOURNAMENT!<br/>
LOWS: NOTIN<br/>
<br/>
	So, I finished second only to Tom Hernley-Keen. Got 5 CC packs, had a lot of fun. Hope you enjoyed the story.<br/>
