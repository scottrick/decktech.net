<br/>
Pre-tourney stuff<br/>
On Friday our high school has a huge game, we were 6-1 and were unranked against a 7-0, fourth ranked in the state.  So we head down and eat at Denny’s.  After about 10 minutes the waitress comes and we order drinks, but I pass with a water.  20 minutes later she comes back and asked me what I wanted to drink so I said just water.  Then 5 minutes later she comes back with a Coke (we passed for water except a Coke) and gives it to ME...how messed up can a person be?  So I order and stuff and she comes with my stake.  I wanted it medium rare buts its crisp and black.  I like garlic salt on my stake and figure I can get some breath mints after so I ask if they had any.  She comes back and says, "We don’t have garlic salt but we have salt."  So she gives me another salt as if there wasn’t one on the table.  Now how are garlic salt and regular salt that similar and how stupid can a person get?  <br/>
So I go to the game and I really want to watch the game since it’s gonna be good and nobody will sit down till they almost kick them all out.  So our team wins and theres these freshman punk kids who sit on the ground and think they’re great and we have fun throwing stuff at them and laughing and they’re like being @#$%heads and it’s funny as hell.  <br/>
So I get up the next day and haven’t tested my decks in a week, how fun.<br/>
<br/>
End Pre-tourney stuff<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
Light: My 6-0 TIGIH Speeders slightly modified since people are starting to try Monnoking me to death.<br/>
Dark: My new Endor Ops for Rumors and TIEs, works really well.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My dark vs. Steve R.’s (1500) EBO and Hoth Troopers<br/>
He’s new and I dont know who he is, but I doubt my 8 game streak and 12 out of 13 wins is on the line.  He starts the 1st and 4th markers and no A New Secret Base and I doubt he has anything special.  First turn I get Merrejk and pull Kashyyyk, Presence it, and let him go.  He drops the Med Lab and an Echo Base Trooper (wtf?) to the MPG.  I have 2 All Powers so I decide to play a lost one before I activate.  Now I have 4 Interceptors and a cannon.  I drop 3 to Kashyyyk cause I’m pretty sure I can finish him without losing much so I don’t need to slow up to get Seinar.  I have Merry pull me Sullust and let him go.  He drops a trooper to the North Ridge and one to the Med Lab and then thinks he can get EBO out so I’m like really frightened with this and I manage to shake my head and try not to laugh.  He eventually tries to interact after I’ve gotten Sullust held and Dyer at the Docking Bay since I don’t think he has any mains to kill him anyways.  He drops Obi and Dyer Dyes (sad attempt at humor, never mind).  Then he drops some stuff (I think a Corvette and X-Wing) against 3 TIEs at Sullust and battles.  I Play All Power, he’s screwed and loses only the X-Wing so I drop a Dreadnaught next turn and he’s dead.  <br/>
FW 2 (+30)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Knowing the DS deck works good.<br/>
Lows: Not always nice beating up on a deck by a newbie that needs modernazation.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My LS vs. John Rome (1430) ISB<br/>
John’s only played in 2 tourneys and is starting to catch on, if I’d have run into the match-ups hes had I’d be as low rated as him too if I was new to the game.  He drops a Probe Droid and Undercovers it right away so I can’t drain with Jedi Luke, a nice move; I had thought ISB was basically dead now around here so I dropped my R-3PO.  I drop a few effects and draw, hoping for some space since lately ISB Big Blue is popular here.  I hit 2 X-Wings to raise my total to 3 and Kessel, great if it isn’t a Big Blue just to sit and drain.  He then drops a Tempest Scout and 2 Probe Droids to the Landing Platform, goodbye.  Down comes about 30 power in speeders.  He’s losing his stuff and about 10.  I see no space so I drop my Wings at Kessel and a couple drains and he’s dead.<br/>
FW 4 (+60)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning and not even needing Blount to visit Coruscant.<br/>
Lows: He actually played a Fear before I got Honor out.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs. Chris Tiesling (1723) Hidden Base<br/>
I wasn’t sure what I expect, I though Kessel Runs but didn’t see any.  I drop 4 TIEs to his Bothawui and Presence with Merry at the Bunker to drian for 5 early.  Hes been drawing like nuts and on his turn comes Farmboy in R2 In Red 5, Home One, a Ralltiir Captain in Red Squadron 1 (he searched for Wedge with Squassin and he wasn’t there) and Harc Seff in Red Squadron 4.  I play All Power and had saved Force for this.  I use 3 and Harc is dead to my cannons.  I miss by 1 on hitting the Captain.  I end up winning the battle by 1 and am immune to attrition and so is he.  Next I follow with 4 more TIEs and decide to save Force for the cannons instead of playing another 2.  I make The Ralltiir captain go lost with an 8 destiny.  He has to forfeit Home 1 and R2 In Red 5 and lose 4 so I clear his side of Bothawui.  Next turn he gets out a fourth system.  I Signal for Security Precautions cause if he flips my 5 drain could be toast.  He drops Boussh at the Bunker, breaks cover, and battles Merry.  I only have to forfeit him and I strike back with EPP Vader and Dyer, hit Boussh, and make him lose 6 and Dyer Dyes again.  He’s running low on resources so I drop a Dreadnaught and move it and 3 TIEs to Ralltiir.  A couple drains of 6 and he’s screwed.<br/>
FW 6 (+84)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: This deck rocked more.  Using cannons, tons of fun.<br/>
Lows: I used the Dyer Dyes thing again, didn’t I?<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS vs. Matt Upstone (1775) SYCFA Scum (anti-my TIGIH Speeders)<br/>
Matt’s never played my TIGIH in tourney play, he hasn’t gotten to play in a while.  He directed last tourney so he sat me down to play and I whopped his Rallops with it so he made this deck as a present for mine.  First turn CHYBC comes and that’s what screwed me.  Luke can’t drain so I drop a speeder to the Landing Platform and move Luke over, not suspecting capture.  He gets Jabba at the Audience Chamber and Scum, crap.  First Strike is out too, so I want to avoid him battling me.  I have Tantive and 2 X-Wings go to the Death Star and a few Speeders at the Death Star Docking Bay.  Bane Malar comes, he draws a 5 and my speeders are downed at the docking bay, not to mention him retrieving 3 and me losing 1 just cause he battled.  So now I can only drain for 1 and my guys sit at the Death Star.  I get Kessel out and 3 X-Wings there.  Zuckuss and Bossk venture there but I still have my battlegrounds for CHYBC.  So I drain for 4 but he’s battling somewhere on the table everyturn and getting a 4 card swing, Ghhking speeder damage, and I’m screwed.<br/>
FL 6 (+72)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Like nothing, at least I didnt use lame humor.<br/>
Lows: Like everything.<br/>
<br/>
So I really want cards, and Im now owed in the range of 25 packs or so but prize support never comes in and I doubt it ever will.  Oh well I go to Appleton, 20 minutes away, where the Niners were and got a bunch of autographs, including Rice on a mini-helmet and card so I’m happy.<br/>
<br/>
