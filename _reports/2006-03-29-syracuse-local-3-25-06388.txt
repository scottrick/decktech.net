<blockquote><font class="bfont"> sw tr for 3.25.06 <br>
<br>
I head out early enough to get to the store with at least an hour to spare, knowing I have to meet some of the players to give them cards, and I have to choose decks. Speeders are totally built yet and I partied Friday night rather than build HB like I meant to. My choices for LS are combat, TRM, HB-X, Endor mains or WYS palace raiders (just for old kicks). For DS: Endor Ops, CR (v) Tat Mains, AotBS, Walkers or HD non dueling. I go with Combat because I've played Endor Mains too much lately, but I need a solid deck because the competition will be strong. For dark, I want to tinker with my CR (v) before events, and HD and Agents are getting stale. I need more practice with Endor Ops before a tourney, so I go with what I played at Worlds - walkers. <br>
<br>
game 1, my walkers v. Jason Foss LSCombat <br>
My goal is to get the generator blown by weaving around his Jedi that are sure to come down to Hoth to battle me off. I plan to drop forfeit fodder in addition to my pilot, and try to get tracking a Dark Manu or whatever fast, so that I can try to shoot a Jedi at the 3rd Marker if need be. I get Lord Vader and a cannon in my opening hand, so I drop the 3rd Marker and pull Blizzard 1, saving a lot of force after grabbing and dropping Rendili. He drops Yoda and stick to a Naboo site for most of his force. I grab the Epic Event, deploy walker, cannon and Vader, with Lando as fodder and move under the shield. He drops Obi JK (V) and I barrier so he backs him up with Qui and does not fight. I go for the early blow up without being able to garrison. I get it (Vader's 6+1 site+marker's text+Blizzard 1 text is 9 already) and he losses 8 and I ping for 1 after the whole discussion of whether Obi can cancel the Epic draw because Vader is there. I flash Mist Hunter and drop Zuck in space (which I play Dark Manu on to track at the end of teh turn, so it sits on top of my now empty reserve), add Igar as forfeit fodder on B1, and 6th Marker, where I drop an Imp Walker for ping (and grab Prep D with Obj), barrier in hand if he has some Corran stuff. He drops Mace at the other Naboo site and his two Jedi at the 3rd marker battle me. I shoot Qui with the Dark Manu and he has to cancel it. He swings with Quick Draw but misses. Prep D combined with my high destiny and Lando now at a BG means I crack Obi. He losses Qui and I lose Vader (so he can't cancel). <br>
He starts running away as I drop walkers, and I cap his drains, which he pays for. I drain for free and ping (he has HotJ out for a while before I get to No Escape). I get off one Garrison and drain for 3 at the system, four at the 3rd (he drops non-v Imp Atrocity there, and curses Chris Terwilliger for messing with his decks) and two at the 6th marker. That helps, but he is limiting me to two markers controlled (I managed to keep enough alive at Obi's site after a battle to get off the Garrison) and a drain of one in space. His drains outpace me and he wins. <br>
FL (0, -14) <br>
<br>
game 2, my LSC v. Foss HD non-dueling back door <br>
He compliments me on my deck choice and laments the auto-loss potential. He pulls the back door and FS: DB, dropping B4 at the DB with vader and pulls his stick. He gets off the walker and awaits the inability to drain. I search for SKF (V) with Quick Draw and can't find it. D'oh! I have Qui and his stick in hand so I drop them and Wokling for LS proficiency, and drop Nekkid 3P0 to his back door. With a Dodge in hand, I stack a 0/7 artoo and draw a few. He drops Maul with stick + Dr. E combo and I Dodge. He does not grab and does not have out nor play Firepower shield. I draw for another Jedi, getting Luke and Obi but still not weapon grabber card. I stack another combat card, but he pulls the anti-combat shield. I Flash and find a Yoda. I move over and combat. He draws a Visage and I cry, then a 1. I flip an Artoo from under Qui and he plays the hot Albany tech - Blow Parried. I draw the Yoda and subtract 1, then draw a Flash for a total of 7, and start to cry, then add Qui's text and we have a push. He drops Sidious and Super Fett and battles me and I Dodge again. I drop Obi and stick from hand to the site he occupies with a lot of people, and move Qui over to combat. I flip another Artoo and then an Escape Pod (v) off the top. He draws really low and I knock out Sidious and four off the top. He battles. He attempts to hit me, but I Obi the 5 and he draws too low with the other card and he misses, so I chop Dr. E. to his used pile. He swings again, hitting Obi, and I swing and hit Fett to Used. He has Maul unhit and I have two Jedi with Obi to die. Maul covers and Obi dies, but I AJR his back, with his sword going used with Quick Draw. <br>
I soon lock down the board. He drops Janus to the back door, and has transitted Vader to the Endor Landing Platform. He drains for 1 at the FS: DB for a while. I Edge once with an Artoo after dropping Luke to replace Obi. I saved Obi for a strike with Corran at Janus late game. Just before I finish him off I get in some last minute retreival. <br>
FW +22 (2, +8) <br>
<br>
game 3, my LSC v. Zach Tartell's BHBM racing <br>
We both set up fast, with dropping the Emp and starting the race while I set up one huge Jedi and drawing for red cards. He starts AAA(v) so I drop low destinies as combat cards to fake him out, and he spikes them and says he's happy trading one-for-one. He has the podracing so I guess. His first attempt to stack cards is to send Mara after Obi. I kill her off but she kills Obi and stacks. Early on he manages to drop Sidious at a DB and sends a crew to attack a replayed Obi and I get him poop'ed. I do clear Naboo about five times, losing about half the fights. He wins the race, but I have Honor to reduce, then Edge soon after with Flash. I drop Boussh in front of Sid, but he runs to another DB where I can't afford to transit, but it blocks a few ping drains. I get set back up on Naboo and hit him with a few turns of Jedi drains while preventing Sid from draining. When he gets to about 5 cards, he draws up, with me interupting it with one last retreival. <br>
FW +20 (4, +28)<br>
<br>
game 4, my walkers v. Charles Clarkson's Senate <br>
He bashes his Senate deck as being new and not as good. I roll my eyes at how he likes to goof on his decks then beat me with them. Love that! <br>
I start Sando to prevent Mothma tricks. No pilot and no unique walker in opening hand. So I pull Tempest 1 and drop the 3rd for generation, after grabbing and dropping Rendili. He Squables for Mothma (v) on my turn and drops her and Horax for the flip. I pull the Epic Event and he gets scared of the early blow up. I drop Igar on Tempest 1 with cannons, backing him  up with Lando, and move under. He comes down with EPP Qui, but without Quick Draw he only manages to bounce Lando and then he plays AJR. I already grabbed Squabling, so poo. He also dropped Falcon with Chewie (v) via SquadAss and adds Capt. Han from hand so he locks down Hoth. I blow the generator thanks to Sando, he plays Atrocity (v) and loses very little. I ping. <br>
The games goes quickly, with me fortifying the 3rd and keeping one ping walker at a non-BG with a barrier. I also drop Maul in ship first to Rendili. I back it up with Bossk (v) in HT then he comes at me there with Wedge and Dash, forcing me to run over to Hoth and cloak. I don't think I got off a Garrison, and he whittles me down, trapping me when I don't cloak and finishing me off. <br>
FL -12 (4, +16)  <br>
<br>
game 5, my LSC v. Bryan Harris' Bespin Tanks <br>
He starts to outside sites. He pulls the Big E, dowloads some other stuff and giving me cards with Drop!, then grabs the free E drop Effect, and I Recoil and he punches me in the face. I drop Luke straight away and grab LS prof for him. He drops an ATT with commander and gun to the 2/2 site, putting pressure on me big time. I have Obi in hand, but I can't attack a tank without a Dodge to screw with his cannons making me immediately lost. But, at least I'm pretty sure he can't deal with me on Naboo because he doesn't pull DBs so he won't be able to get a Naboo DB and shoot inside at me. I also have Boussh in hand, but he quickly gets that effect that gives a tank Sniper each turn for 3 force, so I drop her at the other site, but he shoots from next door and whacks her right away. bah! After about three or so drains, he drops Admiral Piett at the 2/2 and LukeLuke(V) targeting Luke of course. Ack. I drop another Jedi so I can drain, then drop HCF to Bespin to get in free drains before he gets the Executor again. I drop Savrip, and sense two attempts to cancel it. He eventually gets the E down with Thrawn and a laser battery, and tosses out the commander/direct damage AO. He battles and Imp Commands me, but I savrip Lando and Yoda from hand. I threepio two Artoos in consecutive turns, then battle the E, since he can't get a high enough destiny to shoot the Falcon. I draw my two 7s and clear the system. I Edge and other stuff, recovering some force, and he can't ping with his AO any more. <br/>
He's hitting me for 1 and 3 (Presence) and I'm doing 3 at one site with Mace. I get in the last drain and he can't pay any more. <br/>
FW +3 (6, +19) <br/>
<br/>
game 6, my walkers v. Kirk England's QMC mains <br/>
OK, this could be tough. Walkers=direct damage/QMC=retreival. Who sets up fastest and deeper? Oh, and kirk is tinkering with using Buddy Effects, so he starts Strike Planning to pull Mothma and Gen. Solo, who pull the back door and the effects. <br/>
I get Sando in my opening hand, and when he pulls Mothma (v) with Strike Planning I say it's no biggie, and then I play Sando and he laughs in a not-funny type way. I dig for my parts, plopping down Rendili and the 3rd and gathering pieces. He gets a turn one flip with Beldon's Eye (v) and the two people from SP, then consolidates. I then drop Veers on B1 and cannons, add an Imp Walker at 5 for 3, and drop 6th Marker and an Imp Walker there for 2, and move Veers under the shield. He drains for 1, 1 and 1 and tunnels, dropping buddy effects and stuff. I draw a 1 to put on Sando. I drop a walker at the 5th. He drains for 3 total again. Next I pull the Epic Event and go for it, successfully. I then ping for three and Garrison for 4+2+2, so that's 19 damage. gack. Aaron Kingery wanders by and notes that walkers are unfair because the turn the generators go coupled with a Garrison that turn is like taking overflow but without making a mistake like leaving a guy alone to get hit with overflow. I agree. Kirk seethes, and is right to do so. <br/>
So between the 19 damage and almost 20 cards he has on teh table, I've got him way down. He sets up Celebration for two and drains of 1, 1 and 1 together, but I'm hitting him for three ping and the drain of 2 at the 3rd. At the end, I SFS Dash back to his hand to make him pay to drain at his sites and preventing a drain at teh system. Then I get off the second Garrison ftw. <br/>
FW +8 (8, +27) <br/>
<br/>
So I end up at 8 (+27) and finish second out of 7, with Charles going undefeated. He missed the first game for a funeral, so I'd be the devil for not giving him a bye, but he won the rest too, so he earned it. Aaron donates about 20 rares and foils and I give out cash from entries. Now can I make it to Y4? <br/>
