<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">   Is anybody else out there tired of seeing Huntdown and Raltiir Operations dominate the tournament scene?  Wouldn't you like to see a different dark deck sweep though all the muck of light mains and toys?  If your answer is <br/>
yes to both questions, sit back and relax.  You'll get a kick out of this one.<br/>
    Decks:  For the light side, there was no doubt what I would be playing.  I'd been having some great results with a Throne Room mains and toys deck.  I wouldn't call it force denial, as much as I would call it deprivation.  Only <br/>
1 revolution, with H'nemthe's, Goo Nee Tay, and Civil Disorder.  Basically, I'm activating for 10 more force than my opponent is each turn.  Smack them down wherever they may go.<br/>
    For the dark side, I went totally against the norm.  Carbon Chamber Testing/Skrilling numbers.  Yes, you read that correctly.......Skrilling numbers.  I went with CCT instead of Court of Vile Gangsters because Profit <br/>
can choke out the Court deck.  With CCT, I can actually choke out the Profit. The key to the deck is its total surprise.  Nobody, and I do mean NOBODY expected to see dark numbers.  (So for those of you wanting deck <br/>
lists......IT WONT WORK AGAIN....I ruined it for everyone)  I start with There is no Try against everything except Hidden Base. <br/>
    Approximately 56 people started the tournament, and from what I heard, only a couple of people dropped.  The only disappointment was that nobody that I know south of Bakersfield showed up.  None of the regulars from LA or <br/>
San Diego made the trip. <br/>
    As I'm writing my decklist for the Light Side, I realize that I didn't put in 1 grimtaash as I had planned to do all along.  I ask Kevin Shannon, who's sitting right beside me, and knows my decks as well as I do....' 2 <br/>
revo's, or 1 revo and a grimmy?'  He says 1 and 1, so I go with it.  At the same time, he's torn between which dark deck to play.  So he asks me....'Hey Clay, TieBo or Cloud City?'  I really don't want to pick his deck for him so <br/>
I tell him that the CC deck is the better overall deck, but TieBo would give more people fits.  His TieBo deck would beat my light 8 out of 10, while my light would beat his CC deck 8 out of 10 in my opinion.  So, he fills out <br/>
decklists for both decks, because he can't decide. <br/>
    Kevin walks up to me 5 minutes before we start and hands me a folded deck list and says 'Throw it away, I'm going to play this one.'  So I take it, tear it up, and trash it.  He says, 'I think your right, Cloud City is <br/>
better, but TieBo has a better chance of winning today.'  I agreed, and then we wait as Carl 'Mike' Hardy starts to announce the pairings.................'Clayton, I love Tie Scouts Atkin.......Light (thats an entirely different story all together) Vs Kevin, Leave me alone i'm still <br/>
building my decks Shannon, Dark.'  ARGHHHH!!<br/>
<br/>
    Game 1: My light vs Kevin Shannon's TieBo<br/>
    Kevin starts with Kashyyk, and Surface defence for the 3 effects.  Of course I start Throne room, Careful Planning with the &lt;&gt;Farm and Swamp.  I got the Spiral in my opening hand, but no characters for support.  So I get a <br/>
Nudj, deploy the Yavin War room, and pick up the rest. This is where I got the Grimtaash. Kevin activates for 4, drops Endor, and puts a Tie at each system.  Hard Core. I  dont' have enough in hand to really do much to him, so I deploy Master Luke w/stick to my swamp so I have someone out to sence/alter with if need be.  The drain of 2 doesn't hurt either.  He drains me for 4 for a couple of turns while I'm trying to get something going in my hand.  When Kevin drops Well Guarded, I'm forced to make a move.  I drop Spiral and <br/>
Chewie w/blaster to Kashyyk and battle his lone tie.  He loses the tie and about 5 cards.  I alter Well Guarded, then hit him with the lost grimtaash.  This was the game in my opinion.  I got 2 Tie assault squadrons, 2 all power <br/>
to weapons, and a couple of ties.  I keep deploying pilots and ships whenever I get them and I keep him on the defensive.  A late game Pride of the Empire <br/>
did me about 8 damage, but the outcome was already decided.   Full win by 6.  2(+6)<br/>
    The Good:  This ends my 4 game losing streak against Kevin<br/>
    The Bad: Kevin was my prediction to win the state championship.  I ended <br/>
up being his only loss.  <br/>
    The Ugly: First game tough matchups suck.  Why can't we all just get a <br/>
newbie?<br/>
<br/>
    Game 2: My dark vs Sean Pon's Dagobah Test mains and toys<br/>
    My first turn I go to look for my Audience chamber, but its not there.  The East platform and the AC are both in my force pile.  So he gets to see the deck right off the bat.  Oh well, so much for surprises.  I can see by the look in his eyes though that he's screwed, and he knows it. Inserts hit him hard.  He kicked me out of the AC with Master Luke and Obi, but with IAO and Battle Order out, it was alright.  He'd have to activate to drain.  I put <br/>
3 skrillings at the Security tower and inserted.  He activated for all with no damage.  Then deploys Orrimaarko, Tawws, and Kal fal to the Carbonite Chamber and moves them over.  I put Pote at the AC, deploy scum and villiany, <br/>
and put 3 more skrillings at the Security tower.  Then the nice surprise.....epp Vader.  Battle.....hit Orrimaarko, and draw a 5.  35 total power to his 11ish.  I lose Vader, he loses everything and some cards.  I <br/>
then battle with Pote, because Order to Engage is out.  Retreive 2 with Scum, and ghhhk.  3720 to 1 Pops while he's swinging.  It was pretty much like that the whole game. <br/>
Full win by 17   4(+23)<br/>
    The Good: Dark deck-1  Light mains and toys-0<br/>
    The Bad:  Sean being able to see my whole deck 1st turn.<br/>
    The Ugly: I figure that Inserts hit him for 29 cards. &lt;ouch&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Game 3: My light vs Nick Miller's Hunt Down<br/>
    An early revolution really hampered Nick.  He didn't have Crush in his deck and I took quick advantage of that.  2nd turn Revo of the Med Chamber cut his activation down to 4, where it stayed for most of the game.  I was draining him with a bothan and a h'nmethe at the Holotheatre for the whole game.  He eventually saved up enough to deploy Premier Vader and lightsaber to my Throne room, with the help of a Presence of the Force.  I ate that drain for a few turns while I put Master Luke and stick at his East platform with another H'nmethe, with Civil disorder making an appearance.  I finally got all the anti-dueling cards in hand, and was able to set up my destinies to take out Vader and Tarkin who had just arived the turn before.  Deploy epp <br/>
Obi..&lt;no duel&gt;  Initiate battle....&lt;no duel&gt;  swing at Tarkin....5 &lt;cancel&gt; another 5 &lt;still no duel.......looks good for me&gt; and I draw a battle destiny of 5, clearing the site.  Only activating for 4-6, he never deployed again <br/>
and lost the game due to civil disorder.  Full Win by 10  6(+33)<br/>
    The Good:  I love beating Hunt down<br/>
    The Bad:  Not being able to clear vader out of my Throne room earlier.  <br/>
That drain for 4 really sucks.<br/>
    The Ugly: Only winning by 10 in a game I totally dominated.  <br/>
<br/>
    Game 4: My dark vs Alfred Dong's Profit<br/>
    I've got to give Alfred some credit.  He was the only person who played any numbers defence that I played all day.  I converted his AC first turn in <br/>
hopes of choking him.  5 was still enough for him to deploy Ben Kenobi and stick 2nd or 3rd turn.  He went ahead and free'd Han during his next control phase so he was able to hit me for 4.  He deployed his cantina and I'm thinking 'yay.....more force for me.'  I'm activating for around 10ish, with a few saved, so now its time for a beatdown.  I deploy Pote, Scum and Villiany, 5 skrillings, and epp Vader and initiate battle.  I swing at Ben Kenobi and hit him, while he missed Vader.  With my destiny of 3 I thrashed <br/>
him 31-14.  He had to lose General Solo and 9 cards.  I lost 2 skrillings to satisfy attrition.  His next turn he drew up to refill his hand, while I just threw an insert and waited.  He activated for all he could, which was about <br/>
8, and he came at me with his attempt of beatdown.  Master Luke and Ben Kenobi.  One of them had a stick, I just don't remember which one.  He battles.....Force is Strong, Gift of the Mentor.....5 battle destinies later <br/>
and he clears me out of the AC.  The insert came up, but he was packing Dont Froget the Droids...and I grabbed it with Hell to Pay.  Ghhhk was in hand, but fortunately I had enough on the table to cover all the damage.  From there, I just deployed 3 skrillings to the Security tower and proceeded to insert 3720 to1.  Once Battle Order and IAO are out.......NO FEAR.  There were a few battles here and there, but the inserts did their damage in full.  He picked up on me a couple of turns after I survived a thrashing in the Cantina against epp Han and Leia.  Full win by 18 8(+51)<br/>
    The Good: Dark deck-2   Light mains and toys-0<br/>
    The Bad:  Can't think of anything<br/>
    The Ugly:  Inserts did approximately 24 in damage.<br/>
<br/>
    Game 5: My light vs Dan Mochizuki's ISB power<br/>
    Dan just got choked.  Revo, Yavin war room, and a H'nmethe are in my opening hand.  In my first draw, I get Civil Disorder and Goo Nee Tay.  His first turn he drops Endor: Back door for some force generation.  He started <br/>
IAO, so he does get a couple of docking bays out.  I revo Coruscant, and drop a h'mnethe, Tawws, and Kal Fal to the back door and draw.  LOTS of characters.  He deploys 2 agents to 2 different Yavin sites and flips, deploys Blizzard 1 and brings them all together.  We spend the next few turns fighting over Yavin, but with me activating for about 14 to his 6ish, it was only a matter of time before I powered him out.  I got drains going on at the <br/>
Endor system, 3 at JP with Obi and stick, and 2 at my swamp with Master and stick.  He stopped my drain at the back door with an undercover agent.  With my characters all over the table, and his nowhere to be seen, he breaks cover <br/>
and battles at the back door.......hence, commiting suicide while I still got 10 cards in my hand.   Full Win by 17   10(+68)<br/>
    The Good: Total domination.  Flipping his Objective back<br/>
    The Bad:  Umm, hard pressed to find anything bad about this one.<br/>
    The Ugly: At the end of the game, I had 12 cards with ability on the table to his 1<br/>
<br/>
    Game 6: My dark vs Shawn Ely's Obi's Hut/Toche station mains and toys.<br/>
    Shawn and I are the only unbeatens left out of the field.  Nothing too dramatic about this game.  He had no insert protection at all.  He put epp luke out at the station 2nd turn.  I stay calm and don't show my hand until <br/>
about the 4th turn....after Ben kenobi is on the table.  Activate, deploy IAO, Battle Order, Pote and 3 skrillings to the AC and Insert.  He takes out quite a few skrillings thoughout the game, but he couldn't get rid of the 3 that I always put at the Security Tower.  The only way he could win was to drain me out.  But to do that, he'd have to activate and seemingly every time he did, he got popped.  Shawn is playing heavy Sence/Alter, but he only Altered Scum once.  After I started inserting, he really didn't want to get popped on a SA draw.  There was one huge battle in the AC mid-game, but he had mantillian out and was able to lose Yoda, a Ben, and a ship from hand.  From there on, I just moved away from him.  Full Win by 15.  12 (+83)<br/>
    The Good: Dark deck-3   Light mains and toys-0<br/>
        Revenge against Shawn, he'd beaten me 2 straight<br/>
        umm, Something about winning the State Championship<br/>
    The Bad:  Having to pay for airfair out of my own pocket if I want to play in the North American Championships.<br/>
    The Ugly:  Inserts hit Shawn for 32<br/>
<br/>
    All In all, I'd say I've had one heck of a year in SWCCG.  I won the San Diego ComicCon in 1999.  Placed 13 at worlds, just missing day 2 by 6 differential.  And now winning the State Championship in California which is <br/>
reguarded as one of the tougher regions in the world. (Alderaan)  Now its time for some props:<br/>
<br/>
    Kevin Shannon and Damon Looper: For being my playtesting partners and <br/>
putting up with my crazy deck ideas.<br/>
    Todd Feldman: For just being the Mentor<br/>
    The Frisco crew:  Just for bringing the term 'Hard Core' into our <br/>
vocabulary.<br/>
    Mike Hardy:  Running a great tourny after you scrapped the software. <br/>
    The reason I love California:  Its Gotta Be the Cheese!!!!<br/>
