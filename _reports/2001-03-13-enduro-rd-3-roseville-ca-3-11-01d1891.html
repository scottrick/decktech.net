<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Continued from part 2 of the Enduro tourney.  See the previous <br/>
TRs before you read this one.  Now it is midnight, and some<br/>
people play Swiss while the others play a Reflections 2<br/>
booster draft.  I chose to play in the swiss cuz I liked my<br/>
FlOps and EBO decks so far.  Plus I didn’t feel like spending<br/>
another $15.  By this time about 8 people have left Enduro, <br/>
so there are 32 people.  12 play in the swiss, 20 in the draft.<br/>
During the break, Mike Hardy (the TD) has a little retirement<br/>
ceremony for Paul Feldman (who is retiring as a Squad Member).<br/>
<br/>
Paul and Kevin Shannon are the top 2 right now.  I think they<br/>
are both 7-1 at this point.  Many others (such as myself) are<br/>
6-2.  I consider switching to my dueling Hunt Down (they’ll be<br/>
expecting FlOps and I’ll pull out Vader on them!).  But I saw<br/>
a lot of HB and EBO, and I liked how my FlOps matched up against<br/>
so many different decks.  Plus it was fun playing with those <br/>
decks.  So it was EBO and FlOps again.  My score: 12 (+112).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v Mason’s HDADTJ (IAO, Mob Pts, Crush)<br/>
<br/>
I start Insight, Battle Plan, &amp; Wise Advice.  I fear the Monnok<br/>
combo, so I try to deploy xwings to my Hoth DB until I get <br/>
Yarna.  I lose Insight for HoTJ, and this card saves me yet<br/>
again!  It protects me until turn 8 or so, when he gets No<br/>
Escape out.  The big move by me came when he dropped Vader &amp;<br/>
Mara (both with sabers) to my North Ridge.  Of course, I Ice<br/>
Storm and move Rogue 2 with Zev and Luke aboard to make sure no<br/>
one searches for Vader &amp; Mara.  So Luke is guarding his daddy<br/>
while the storm is going on.  Mason has no answer for me in <br/>
space.  My xwings are spreading, and the drains are piling up.<br/>
<br/>
After the Storm is lost, he drops Thrawn &amp; Jodo in Tempest 1,<br/>
I barrier Tempest 1.  I battle, and kill Thrawn and Jodo.  But<br/>
he tracks a 6 and finds Mara Jade during his turn.  Wedge in <br/>
Rogue 3 has joined the party, and I kill Tempest 1.  The drains<br/>
kill him before he can find Vader.  By the time he got No <br/>
Escape, the game was all but over.  So Visage didn’t do much<br/>
to me.  Win by 33.  2 (+33).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Nick Stefanko’s RTP (Seeking an Audience)<br/>
<br/>
I setup FlOps quickly, and he gets 8D8 quickly.  He moves 8D8<br/>
in a Lift Tube and moves to Leia’s site to try to free her.  <br/>
It takes him a couple turns, but he gets her out.  At this <br/>
point he realizes my Vader isn’t out, and that I’m playing <br/>
FlOps.  He laughs.  And laughs some more.  We just talk smack<br/>
the rest of the game (and into the next 2 games as well).  <br/>
Corran Horn cancels Visage, then Nick Revos my Exec DB and <br/>
drops Wedge there and moves him to the Med Chamber.  He drops<br/>
a Lift Tube to Corran at the Holotheater so he can react.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, he’s flipped his objective and I’m setup in space.<br/>
I’m draining at Rendili, Kiffex, Kashyyk, and Sullust.  He’s<br/>
draining at Y4 War room w/Prisoner 2187, Y4 DB, DS DB, DS <br/>
Detention Block, Holotheater, and Med Chamber.  These were the<br/>
killers though.  He gets 2 Death Star Plans off (each for 17<br/>
force!!), and 2 On The Edges (6 and 7 force each).  So he<br/>
easily outlasts me.  Lose by 38!  2 (-5).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Hmmm......<br/>
Worst: His huge retrieval!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Rufino Sanchez’s TIGIH(Insur,Staging,StrikePlan)<br/>
<br/>
This game was very similar to the game against Paul McKelvey<br/>
waaay back in the 1st quarter.  The only difference is that <br/>
Rufino deployed I Hope She’s Alright and that was the <br/>
difference in the game.  His spies infiltrated the Executor <br/>
while I setup FlOps.  The thing is, FlOps does nothing unless<br/>
they battle you in space.  But how was I to know he didn’t <br/>
play any space?  So once again I deploy Coward to kill the <br/>
drains, but this is when he deploys I Hope She’s Alright and<br/>
the Back Door.  Once again, U-3PO blocks the drain at the <br/>
Back Door, and once again its a drain race.  I have drains at<br/>
Kiffex, Rendili (w/Chiraneau there), Sullust, &amp; Kashyyk, but<br/>
he had *all* my Executor sites and the endor ones.<br/>
<br/>
If I were to block a drain with guys, it would have to be at a<br/>
DB so TIEs could soak some damage.  So I move Merrejk and <br/>
Piett to the Exec DB w/ 2 Interceptors.  I wanted to occupy<br/>
a BG, but his Endor DB was waaay too tough to take on.  So he<br/>
drops EPP Obi and EPP Leia and beats me off the Exec DB, and<br/>
I stack in the process.  That didn’t work.  Blount just goes<br/>
to his Bacta Tank.  So i stay in space and cancel what I can<br/>
with Imperial Fleet, but I Hope SHe’s Alright was the<br/>
difference.  Lose by 3.  2 (-8).<br/>
<br/>
Best: I gave it my best shot, just didn’t have the ground <br/>
power.<br/>
Worst: I Hope She’s Alright!!!!  My FlOps going 0-2.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Stephanie Dittman’s MKOS (No Bargain, First<br/>
Strike, Power of the Hutt)<br/>
<br/>
I start Battle Plan, Menace Fades, &amp; Insight.  I setup EBO by<br/>
turn 3, and the drains begin.  She’s not paying to drain <br/>
since Gailid’s bonuses are being cancelled by Menace Fades.<br/>
She deploys Bossk In Ship, I barrier.  She puts a Merc Pilot<br/>
aboard to soak some damage, but I still beat it up for the <br/>
ship and a few spillover damage.  Towards the end, she just <br/>
pays for her drains of 1 each and I cancel what I can w/<br/>
Rebel Fleet.  She doesn’t come to Hoth to mess with Rogue<br/>
Squadron, so Menace Fades works through the end.  I used 1st<br/>
Strike more than she did!  Not many battles, which isn’t<br/>
good for a Scum deck.  Win by 35.  4 (+27).<br/>
<br/>
Best: My deck working beautifully.  EBO went 2-0!<br/>
Worst: Nick &amp; I were saying all kinds of crap (since we were<br/>
sitting by each other &amp; were sleep deprived) to each other.  <br/>
I don’t think anyone appreciated that.<br/>
<br/>
So now its past 4 AM.  Jeez....did I really play 12 SWCCG <br/>
games in a row?  With 4 more to go?  Well, Paul Feldman went<br/>
4-0 in the swiss and Kevin Shannon went 3-1 in the sealed so<br/>
they were still in front.  My total score now is 16 (+139)<br/>
after going 8-4 so far.  I wanted a strong 4-0 finish to have<br/>
a shot at 2nd or 3rd place.  Paul Feldman was 11-1, and Kevin <br/>
was 10-2, so 1st place was out of the question for me. <br/>
Thanks for reading this far, only 4 more games to go! </font></td>
