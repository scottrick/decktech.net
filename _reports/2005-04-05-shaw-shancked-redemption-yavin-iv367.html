<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Back in January, I had decided to check the Star Wars side of Deck Tech to see what was going on. Apparently, Worlds 2004 had been a semi-success and somebody I never heard of won Worlds. I look into it and I see the World Champ mouthin off on the PC boards. I talk with my good buddy Brad Eier and we think it would be a good idea to start playing Star Wars on a completive level again if randoms can win Worlds. I go to school at the University of Toledo (the Harvard of the Midwest, to all you common folk) and I there is a gaming convention coming up and I talk to Brad and we figure we might as well run a Star Wars event with a PC prize kit and get some uncut sheets. After a weekend of running several disappointing LOTR and Wars TCG events, the Sunday Star Wars tournament get 10 players! A few from Michigan, and a bunch of guys from NE Ohio. The tournament is a success. Nate Meeker and Justin Stratton from Kent come to this tournament and Brad and I ask them if they just want to go to this great tournament in Maryland that had been posted. So, after a few weeks of conversing and trading ideas, I notice Mini-Open in Michigan is coming up. Brad and I go to this thing and we really have no clue how well we will do. Nate Meeker decides to come and does the drive from Kent to Kalamazoo solo and somehow, I manage to go 6-0. I wreck Spencer Ball, the alleged greatest player in Ontario- TWICE, and dominate the swiss portion. I somehow manage to choke in the final and I dont get a bye into Worlds. Piss. <br>
<br>
After doing my impersonation of the 2001 St. Louis Rams, I begin to strategize for Maryland with Brad Eier, Nate Meeker, and Justin Stratton. We trade off decks and ideas and eventually all of this comes into fruition with solid decks for both sides. I work on decks for a few weeks, trying to abuse Ellors Maddak with Hidden Base (an idea given to me by Jamie Abel) and some other decks. The two solid decks I have, a TRM and a version of Pistones Hunt Down, are good. My fear is that people expect those two decks, and I scramble to build something else. There happens to be this outrageously powerful MKOS deck using JQuille as a rep. I build it, and I swear it is one of the better decks ever made. Greg Shaw was the only non-Ohio guy to beat it. It pwned.<br>
<br>
After a whole bunch of planning and strategerization (new word, 10,000 tech points) I leave the great City of Toledo on Thursday. I take the Ohio Turnpike east and I meet up with Jamie Abel and his girlfriend for dinner at a neat restaurant south of Cleveland. Whenever I eat at a place and I want a sandwich, but the sandwiches look suspect, I just utter the word CLUB. Jamies girlfriend is really neat woman. Shes an artist who works for American Greetings and her artwork pwns all modern art. You can see her work here: www.kelleeart.com<br>
<br>
After strolling the mall looking for a certain hat, we decide it is time to go our separate ways. I take the Ohio Turnpike even further east and I head to the beautiful residence of deck building extraordinaire Nate Meeker. We sit down and I play my allegedly broken X-Wing Ellors Maddok Hidden Base pile and Nate WRECKZ it with the MKOS deck. The MKOS is beastly, and it starts to grow on us. A bit later, the other deck building extraordinaire Justin Stratton shows we play test some more. We see that MKOS with JQuille is by far the best because the dude cant have his forfeit reduced, he draws a destiny, and he can break someone for having a lot of characters stacked up. Not to mention the other 57 cards in the deck that lead to the LS players destruction. I really dont feel Im entitled to post the MKOS deck, ask Justin Stratton or Nate Meeker if you want the list. Its their idea, I think. For light side, we think of a good deck. Nothing seems to stand up to the MKOS we have built; even Throne Room played right couldnt keep up. Around 11 or 12, Justin goes home to be with his wife before his long adventure. Nate, Brad, and I play test until the ungodly hour of 6:00 A.M. We assume the light side will not have a good showing Saturday, so we try to think of a deck for light side that can do all right. AITC seems like a popular choice, as does TRM. To be honest, we didnt really have a clue as to what was good for light side. After talking to my girlfriend who was in Disney World of all place, I call it a night. <br>
<br>
The alarm goes of around 10 and Nate, Brad, and I sort of wake up. Since Im lazy, I was the last one to get into the shower. We talk shop and grab some food and wait for Justin to come pick us up for our fantastic journey. He arrives and we begin our long trek to Maryland. We stop at a gas station and buy some pop and what not. Its a fairly uneventful ride on the atrocious ride on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and we all try to figure out how to beat our MKOS because we dont believe were the only ones going to be playing it. Before I left, I had heard the Pope was not doing so well, so I decided that we would use our trip as a campaign for Brad Eier For Pope.  Justin tells me the Pope isnt an elected position like I dont know it, and I tell him we have to spread democracy everywhere, even the Catholic Church. Brad reluctantly agrees to be the Peoples Candidate for Pope and while at a rest area, I just yell out, Brad Eier for Pope. During the ride, I decide to add some essential cards to my TRM like Flash, another GNT, and another Control &amp; Tunnel Vision combo. We then enter the state of Maryland and traffic becomes a frimbazeling joke. Bad drivers in wrong lanes slow us down and we get to the card shop just in time for the warm up tournament. We go to the back of the store and no one is there. Lame. We wait around and Tim Aglets Salmon is there. We are all wookie starved and decided to walk to the Burger King. I act like an wookie and get weird looks from people in the packed BK. We eat and head back to the store where there are actual people now! I meet Kevin Elia and some other peeps and we discover that a warm-up event cant happen. So, we all decide to play some pickup games. I sit down across this older guy from the area who tells me he just got out of prison. So, I play my Walkers, AITC, and Hunt Down against him and we have some good games. We made sure to not reveal out super broken MKOS deck. After a while, we leave and check into the hotel. Nate turns the the tv on to ESPN and the Cavs almost make a remarkable fourth quarter comeback, but since Mike Bibby is a douche the Cavs get throttled. Justin figures a good way to beat MKOS is to play WHAP and builds the version thats on Deck Tech created by some European guy. He tests it out against me, and its a close game, but the MKOS still wins bye 10 or so. So, for light side, Justin decides to play his HB with matching pilots and undercover spies and Nate decides to play AITC. Brad is undecided and I figure I will play AITC as well. Its 2 in the morning, and Im wide-awake and hungry. Brad is, but Justin and Nate arent. Brad and I walk to the Dennys that is right next to the hotel and we both order the sampler. Our waiter is some guy who is overtly obsessed with Superman. He has Superman rings on and is wearing a Superman necklace. So, its 2:00 A.M. and Im staring blankly in one direction and some Neo-Goth waitress chick gets into my plane of view and bends over. The waiter calls me out and accuses me of starting, telling me its ok because shes a hottie. What a weirdo. After eating at a packed Dennys at 3 in the morning, we head back to the hotel. I figure wed be sharing beds and stuff, and when I mention it, Nate and Justin get all homophobe on me and say how theyre not sharing beds. Im comfortable with my sexuality, so it doesnt bother me to sleep with another dude as long as the other dude isnt gay. Nate grabs 4 destiny and we pick. The highest two get their own bed. As fate would have it, I draw a 5 and get a bed. So does Justin. Nate could have rigged the game and got himself a bed, but he and Brad got to sleep on the floor. PWN.<br>
We all wake up around 9:30 and get ready. I think Im the last in the shower again and we grab our crap and check out of the hotel. We go to the lobby and the power is out!!! We hear mention of continental breakfast and we missed it by a few minutes and crazy old lady packing it up gives me some grief. So I go Jerry Seinfeld on her wookie and complain as loud as I can. While waiting in line to check out, there is some woman on the phone and I do my a cappella version of Darudes Sandstorm. This gets on some peoples nerves, but I am a Sandstorm Machine. After we check out of the Tower of Terror, we decide to hit up Dennys for breakfast. The one next to the hotel has no power either. So, we then head to the card shop where a Dennys is right across the street. We eat there, and I get the John Denver Scrambler. Its a damn good breakfast and I cant finish it all. Brand and Nate opt for similar huge breakfast. However, Justin pusses out and gets 2 eggs and a English muffin and he doesnt even finish that. After ragging on him for a few minutes, we leave and go to the store. There I finally get to meet Pistone and some other guys from the net. All are good folk. We have to fill out deck lists and I must choose a LS deck. I have AITC in my hand, and I make a huge move and decide to play TRM with the consultation of Brad. We figure out differential will play a huge consideration into this tournament and TRM will not lose by a lot because it can afford to lose a bunch of cards. There are tons of neat SW figures up for grabs as random prizes in the tournament along with uncut sheets. The PC is stellar and sends yet two more boxes of Cloud City and Tatooine as prize support.  And, without further ado, I present to you:<br>
<br>
THE 2005 YAVIN IV REGIONAL <br>
<br>
TD: Kevin Elia<br>
Players: 26<br>
<br>
GAME 1<br>
<br>
TRM vs. Dudes BHBM<br>
<br>
Sorry brother, I forgot your name. I start the Colo, Civil Disorder, and Insurrection/Aim High. He starts Squando, Locationx3, and maybe IAO/SP. The game starts off pretty uneventfully. We just draw for the first few turns as I wait to deploy stuff. During one of his draw phases, he plays Bantha Fodder and grabs URURURURURURs Bantha. WTF? I play Goo Nee Tay and I draw more cards and I can lay down the beats anytime he deploys something. On his turn, he drops Tatooine: JP and deploys the Emperor, URRURURUR and his bantha, and DVDLOTS with stick. I figure I cant go lay the smackdown there, so I deploy Boushh there and set up Tantive 4 plus Screamin Lando at Kessel. I had been choking him pretty hard and he let the drain of 3 go by once. He missed Boushh with EPP Emperor and on my turn I just reinforced the Tantive with Home One and Phylo. He comes to Kessel with Bossk In Hounds Tooth and an empty Jabbas Space Cruiser. I thought that was illegal, so I ask Kevin and only starfighters may not deploy without pilots. Lame. Well, I have Savrip out and I decide to battle. I figure he may not have Zuckuss and Mist Hunter in his deck, but he does. He draws pretty good, I draw two destinys at -3. I some how manage to win, but I have to forfeit Lando. He gets rid of the Cruiser. I end up deploying more stuff to space and eventually knock him off the system. Throughout the course of the game, he pulls out the Audience Chamber and that warrants me to deploy EPP Qui-Gon and EPP Obi there. I can satisfy Battle Order, and he cant. I eventually win in a close one by 15.<br>
<br>
FW +15<br>
Highs: TRM doing its thing by avoiding the big drain and going to Kessel. My opponent for being a cool guy.<br>
Lows: You can deploy the Cruiser without a pilot! Bro-ken.<br>
<br>
After our game ends, my boy Brad is in a close one with Reid Smith. Brad makes a few mistakes that I think cost him a full win. It goes to time and both of them have 10 cards in their life force, but Brad has fewer cards in lost pile. He gets the times win.<br>
<br>
Nate and Justin both won big with their MKOS decks. I was just really happy that I won with LS.<br>
<br>
Game 2 <br>
<br>
MKOS vs. Mike Pistones Lightsaber Combat.<br/>
<br/>
Now we can finally assess how good the MKOS deck is against a good player. I start the game off activating 9 force. This allow me to set up Scum with Jabba, Bib, Nerf Bat Guy, and someone else. On his first turn he deploys a loaded Jedi Luke with Obis Journal, Bionic Hand, and his lightsaber. He Alters my Hutt Bounty which goes to my used pile via the shield I busted out first turn.. We both make comments on how crazy the game is now because you can set up a zillion things without thought. On my second turn, I deploy the Lower Passage with Dr. E combo, Whippid, and Boelo there and I think I bring out Galid to the AC and deploy some random to JP to flip.. He drains me for 3 and then drops Corran Horn and Wedge, RSL to the Lower Passage and beats me in a battle causing me to loose Boelo and he loses nothing because he cancels my draw. On my turn, I deploy Krayt Dragon Bones from hand and I bust out Bubo from my starting effect. I deploy EJP Dengar and another random alien to the Lower Passage. Bubo is hungry and I randomly select Wedge. I initiate battle and I believe I had AAA out so I use it and retrieve with Scum. He plays Dodge and I say wait. Bubo prevents characters from moving. Mike tries to argue that Corran isnt using his landspeed while moving with Dodge because it says for free, but my argument is that in order to move any character without the use of a vehicle, you must use his landspeed. Kevin rules that Corran is indeed using his landspeed. I dont recall if I hit Corran with Dengar, but I do know I caused around 11 overflow. He drains with Luke and deploys Yoda. The next turn I come to Naboo and battle Luke with Bane Malar, Brangus Glee, and Lando. I retrieve and I draw and he draws high, but I cancel it with a JQuille from my hand. I have power 20 to his 8. He forfeits Luke and loses a few more to overflow. That was the clincher there, as he never fully recovered. I pull out the win by 21 or 29. <br/>
<br/>
FW + 21~29<br/>
Highs: Finally getting to play Mike. Hes a cool guy. The deck working like it is supposed to.<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Im feelin pretty good at this point. Brad wins with his LS, as does Justin and Nate. Justin and Nate have outrageous differential, so they get stuck playing each other. Team Ohio is wrecking as of right now.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
My TRM vs. Steve Yaegers Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Well, I finally get to see how my TRM does against Hunt Down. Steve does an unorthodox thing by starting Bad Feeling Have I. I must admit it slowed me down. I cancel Visage on my first turn with OOC &amp; TT. He plays random BGs and stuff. There are a bunch of fights, but Im activating twice as much as he is and he really cant keep up. I bring Tantive to Kessel with Lando piloting and I think that was the clincher in force swing. I Revo his Med Chamber when he finally gets some force with my Kessel being out. Not a big game battle wise. It was the usual: he deploys Vader, I deploy guys. I swing and battle him off. It was like thins 3-4 times. I finally get the Flash loop working with Threepio and I widdle him down to one force. I figure my win by 29 will be enough and I didnt want to blow this guy out because he was a great guy. So I decide to drain him out. <br/>
<br/>
Highs: TRM for working wonders and Kessel for being huge in yet another game. Steve for being a champ. <br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Brad loses with his TRM to some TTO deck. Justin beats Nates MKOS deck by 3. Over the course of the tournament, the only people to beat our MKOS deck was ourselves because we had been playing with and against it all weekend, and GREG GANGBUSTER SHAW because the guy is a beast. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
My MKOS against Greg Shaws TRM<br/>
<br/>
He starts The Camp, Civil, and Insurrection/Aim High. He Revos my Desert Heart first turn and I go. I want to set up slow because he has a big activation advantage on me and Im worried if I deploy Jabba alone with nerf bat I will get pwned. I get out the AC I take the risk of getting Jabba down, pull Scum, and play Nerf Bat from reserve deck. This game is a mess because he Alters my Hutt Bounty and he plays Goo Nee Tay on me. I know cant win this one because I only activate 6 a turn. I play for differential, and when he just beats me off the sites and gets Kessel and Flash going, I am doomed. I draw up before he can retrieve anymore with Flash.<br/>
I take a beating by 31. <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting to play against Greg, who is a cool guy. After that, there is none.<br/>
Lows: GETTING PWNED AND WRECKED AND DESTROYED.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was a doosey. Greg was the first non-Team Ohio person to beat the deck. My differential took a huge shot with that loss and I knew I had to win out to have any chance of making the final four. Justin Stratton beats Nates MKOS by 20 because we all know how to beat it. Brad wins his game. Team Ohio has the potential to take 3 the spots in the Final 4 if we each win out. <br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
<br/>
My MKOS vs. Steve Yaegers Non-Profit<br/>
<br/>
I think this was a great match up for me. With his objective allowing me to start Jabba and Lando, I can deploy Hutt Bounty directly to the AC and activate like a madman. I st up Scum and Search and Destroy first turn and flip. Amazing. On his turn, he brings out the Naboo battle plains and deploys Yoda there. My drains at the Lower Passage begin to set in and I fortify the JP sites and he really cant do much the entire game. There is a fight for the Naboo battle plains and I retrieve. He brings down a Suicide EPP Luke a few times to the Tat: JP that Im draining at and he gets sank by Search and Destroy the entire game. This was just a bad match up for Steve and my activation put me way over the top on this one. A deck dedicated to bringing the beats cant really bring the beats to fortified JP locations. My drains eventually finish him out. <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting to play Steve again, hes a great guy and a good player. He just had some bad match ups today. <br/>
Lows: My Hutt Bounty gets Altered more than Anna Nicoles face.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Team Ohio starts to get mowed down by the Greg Shaw Machine Gun and he just got finished eating Nates AITC. Justin Stratton wins, as does Bradford. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6 pairings are announced. Right now, if I win, Im in. If I lose, I have to lose by 2 or 3 to get in. As Marvin Lewis says, YOU PLAY THE GAME TO WIN. Unfortunatly, I get paired up against my good buddy Nate and he gets to play Dark Side. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
My TRM against Nate Meekers MKOS.<br/>
<br/>
After Greg Shaw wrecked me, I figured out the fundamental weakness of MKOS and sort of played differently as I did playtesting against it. I was lucky and got a Revo in my opening hand and on my turn I Revod the Desert. After stalling Nates setup, I think realized what I had to do. I had to put everyone and his brother at Kessel and hope the drain rce worked in my favor. Nate did the smart thing by fortifying the AC and the LP to the teeth. He played Bubo to the AC with Krayt Dragon Bones. Also, on my first two active force, he busted out the anti- S/A shields like a champ. After he had 5-6 guys at the AC, I figured it was as good as time as any to throw down Tanus to make him lose some cards. Bubo works to my advantage by eating me. SCORE. We get into drain race and Nate doesnt have enough cards in his life force to throttle me in space. Eventually, the drain wears him down an down and I eek out a win by 10.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Bubo eating my Tanus<br/>
Lows: Unfortunately getting paired against Nate and eliminating him. The poor guy didnt get an easy game the whole day. Mad props to him.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the final 4 is announced and the seeding is like this:<br/>
<br/>
1. Greg Shaw vs 4. Brad Eier<br/>
2. James Booker vs. 3 Drew Scott<br/>
<br/>
Kevin says that the higher seed chooses to play what deck he wants and its just a one game playoff. Without hesitation, I choose my MKOS deck because it is beastly.<br/>
<br/>
My MKOS vs. Drew Scotts AITC. Since I didnt scout, I didnt know what decks he was playing. This matchup sort of worries me, but I stick it through. I decide to start the AC so I can get Scum going, I know he will convert it and there will never be a battle there, so I could essentially set Scum up with my mom and I would be all right. Luckily enough, I pulled one of the 6 cards in my opening hand that allows me to get Scum (Jabba) and I deploy him and and Bib together along with Hutt Influence. Oh his turn he sets up the TBM, Yerka Mig, and Bo Shouda exhaust and deploys Mos Eisely. I know his wienies will not really overpower me, but attrition me to death. I deploy URURURURUR and Xizor to his Mos Eisely and I think deploy Brangus and someone else to his 2/1 desert site. I flip. He deploys some random aliens to some sites and flips as well. We battle at places so I retrieve and he has Elllors up and running, which just negates my +2 with my objective. There are no non-Tatooine sites, so my aliens forfeit for bunches. The more aliens I can make him lose, the less likely he can satisfy Ellors and less force I have to lose due to his spread out aliens. I take some drains of 3 on the chin and I battle with obscure aliens and I cause overflow is some battles. A JQuille to the AC and a battle that causes overflow of 6 sets me up for a win by 14 I believe.<br/>
<br/>
My boy Brad couldnt bring down the Greg Shaw Machine and its him and I for the regional championship. At this point, I know my MKOS will not win and will most likely get dumped by at least 20 under optimal conditions. I had caught wind he was playing HD and if my TRM were to beat his Hunt Down, it would be a lesser margin than his victory against my MKOS. I ask if he wants to give me an extra $30 and he can have the title without a challenge. He agrees. I go hug the guy that brought Team Ohio to their knees and I congratulate him. Im thrilled I got $120 and a bye into Worlds. Brad made $35 and its all good. Poor Justin went 4-2 against a tough slate of players and finished 6th, and Nate Meeker deserved to be in the final four as well, but his tough schedule gave him a 3-3 record. I get a ECC uncut sheet and $120 for finished secrond. So, I break even for the trip.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back, terrible drivers in the rain nearly get us killed. We have quite a haul ahead of us and I have the idea of getting to Breezewood and eating there. If we are wookie tired, we can stay the night there.<br/>
<br/>
Justin bought a new Malibu and it has one of those neat GPS things on it, on the way back home, it gave us some exhaust directions and we eventually pull off to piss and get situated. Were hungry, but we opt to get snackfood to hold us over for the 2 hour adventure back to Breezewood. Nate buys a huge pack of Oreos, and Brad and I each get 2 things of beef jerky. The place we stopped at has the exhausttiest bathrooms of any whole in the ground gas station known to man. Also, the owner is some Mexican dude with gold teeth. The guy is shady as hell and we offer to buy this pizza that looks like it had been sitting there all day. He tries to sell it to us for $5 bucks and then just gives it to us. I take one bite and want to kill myself. Brad also follows suit. In the car, we realize he overcharged us a $1 for the beef jerky we bought. Oh well. We get to Breezewood and the only 2 optimal places to eat are a Dennys and a Perkins. We decide on Dennys, and for those keeping score at home, this is my 3rd trip to Dennys in the last 24 hours. I have no friggin clue what to order and I wanted a salad. The waitress kept trying to offer to toss my salad and I have to tell her no. I just settle for a club minus the fries but with a side salad. Justin pusses out and cant finish his meal and we ridicule him some more. I go put money in the Jukebox there and I pick a Led Zepplin song, the only good Creed song, and 2 Lynard Skynard songs. I thought I was retarded and hit wrong buttons, but when the first two songs came on I was satisfied. I got ripped a buck but thats ok. Nate mentions something I had sort of forgotten, and that is Upper Decking a toilet. For those of you who do not now how to Upper Deck a toilet, I will explain: you take the lid off and exhaust in the top part of a toilet. We get out of Dennys and figure it is best to stay there because it is snowing/raining back near Ohio and it is doing the same in Pennsylvania. We check into the hotel and I try to Jedi Mind Trick Brad from sleeping in the bed by calling my girlfriend and sitting there. Sorry bro. On television, we find out the Pope died. I tell Brad this is the opportunity of his life and we should start push polling when we get back.  He calls me out on trying to steal his bed and I kick to the floor like a princess. I go shower in the midget shower and it takes forever to find the right level of hotness for the water. I get the worst sleep ever on the floor that night. We wake up and I feel like I didnt get enough sleep. Well, thanks to the Nazis or the farmers, daylight savings time took affect that night. For breakfast, we go to Dennys again and we slam down some food. Justin pusses out again and is rightfully ridiculed. We head back to Ohio and the drive back isnt so bad. We stop around Pittsburgh, Brad and I take our chances on the PA lotto and we both win a dollar. We make a big scene and old people give me weird looks. In the car back home, I fall asleep like a champ and we return to Kent. We all say our good byes and I say something like, Lets pay Justin for as and tolls. I guess Nate and Brad already settled up with him and I looked like a cheap douche by just trying to be a nice guy. So, I had Justin a phat 20 for services rendered and I head back home to Willard to see my girlfriend and family. It takes me awhile to get pack to Willard (90 minutes) but the Cavs are playing and the time passes fast because they are pwning the Mavs. I go to Emilys first who gives me some swag from Disney World, like a Stormtrooper Pez Dispenser and a T-shirt. We go out to my house and to see my little 4 year old brothers. These guys are monsters. They try to kick my ass, but I slam them into the couch 25 times and they keep coming back for more. Thomas, the younger one by 9 minutes, figures out the opposite end of a fly-swatter hurts more than the rubber end, and pwns me in the face with it. Emily cant keep up with Tyler who decides to shoot her with his new Shotgun toy. We surrender and give them candy and a Pirate Eye patch Emily picked them up at Disney World. We head to my grandmas crib and kick it with her and then I go back to Emilys for a while. I leave Willard around 12:30 AM and get back to Toledo around 2. After settling in, I pass the frimbazel out and the great weekend ends.<br/>
