<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">You know now R3 is out and that you need to try the new cards right. Well I was up all night trying to build decks with what little R3 I had. The reason I did this was because I was so upset that I didn&amp;#8217;t get my box of R3 yet that was the big decision maker and the only R3 I had was from the pre-release of R3. I tell you it wasn&amp;#8217;t much.<br/>
<br/>
Well I spend all night trying to make decks and talking to friends trying to get ideas and well their Ideas were all around R3 Objectives that I just did not have plan a simple. So with about ten minutes I was able to make a Dark side walker garrison with major planet security and executor always up second turn. Also with imperial commands of course. Well my light I went through so many old and new decks it wasn&amp;#8217;t funny. First I thought Hidden Base mains with some Alderaan retrieval then I said no because I was afraid of maul in ship well I was so wrong this would have killed the @#$% of all the new and old decks. The second was mad x-wing ebo with the new effect again maul in ship for my big drains to be canceled again wrong.<br/>
The thing I picked as a dumbass was Coursant mains with SAC and destiny adders.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First Game <br/>
<br/>
Michael Kissling Dark Solid senators Vs My Coursant Mains LS<br/>
<br/>
Well first of we gave no force Icons to each other the entire game except for my Coursant DB and his senator hut. Well the game starts of with maul to the site of course the second is setting up the second site the chamber. Well I could ask for a more god hand my spy lando w ax and my obi with draw fire and some SAC. First what I do is get my 0-1 db out then get honor out and stop the damage for a little while. I wait <br/>
 Till I have the force to play a beat down on lone maul. About 3rd or 4th turn I go for it and wack maul for all he&amp;#8217;s worth and get two destiny in the process I cause over flow of 10 that was the only big battle of the game. The rest was trying to block my drains with spies and well I have to say I played like a dumb ass. After I ask him how much he has in his life force I pick up.<br/>

Second Game <br/>
<br/>
Some random scrub LS  Vs My Dark Garrison aka the machine<br/>
<br/>
Well first his light side was senotors I sat in my chair and laughed my @#$% off I own I said in my head.<br/>
He also has some podracing in it but I said who cares lets see at it yo. I get exector out second turn and deal him some damage and set up imperal decree. I set up walker garrison and drain the @#$% out of him and also out activate him by 10. I guees the only balls that he had was to db transit to my db with jedi and take my on I said ok keep in mind I have battle deployment on table. He has some random jedi, Yoda, and daughter of Skywalker with the stick. I have Blizzard  1  with the general on board and in the hand I have 4-lom and ig-88 with gun with command. Can we say game over. He chops my Ig 88 and 4 lom to cancel yoda game text I draw mad destiny to his one I draw 15 in destiny with my power its just tech clear the site and walker garrison owned the game.<br/>
