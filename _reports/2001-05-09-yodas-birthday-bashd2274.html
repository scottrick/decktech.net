Here I go again, its Friday night and I’m practicing with my team tournament decks with my roommate and teammate Patrick Hug.  We go through the light deck and dark deck twice just to see how we would be set for Force.  Turned out we could active about 18 on our own for average with the dark second turn, no problems there.  Light deck wasn’t to bad, but everything deployed for pretty cheap until we would need Force later in the game.  Next morning, it’s about 8 O’clock and Pat wakes me up and we get on our way because we think the tournament starts at 10 and I have to stop home for a second.  I piss around about a half hour at home and we make it to The Outer Rim (The Shaner Shack) at 10.  NOBODY is here; guess the tourney starts at 11.<br/>
<br/>
People start showing up and we end up having 6 teams at the tournament once Shaner’s teammate comes late, we give them a bye just to be nice and the other team.  My buddy Dunn comes and whips out this CD looking thing and says go away, I’m like sure, ok.  About 5 minutes later, he gives me the CDs (there were 2) and everybody at the tournament signed the cover for my birthday, that was cool, thanks again John.  I get 2 more Vader’s Obsession, YESS, I have 101 Obsessions now, thanks Andrew.  Now it’s time for the tournament<br/>
<br/>
Our decks are both of our signature decks together:<br/>
Team Name: The short and the Ugly (I’m the short one)<br/>
My decks:<br/>
Set Your Course with TIEs (duh)<br/>
Hidden Base Flip with Our Most Desperate Hour/Squadron Assignments<br/>
<br/>
Pat’s:<br/>
Hunt Down with sick destiny (bout 30+ cards 5+)<br/>
Obi’s Hutt Start with Goo Nee Tay<br/>
<br/>
Note:  Our Light side Decks give the opponent NO Force for 2 turns and we start Goo Nee Tay J<br/>
Game time is 2 hours per game.<br/>
<br/>
First Match-up is against Ernie And Burt (David Teeters &amp; Andy Marcantel)<br/>
They are playing BLOW UP DEATH STAR &amp; EBO<br/>
This is usually not good for Set Your Course<br/>
<br/>
This was a real funny game, many jokes, many laughs and good fun.  This game had its moments, but for the most part, I was just sitting up there in space blocking drains, and killing x-wings with guns, and Pat scared the heck out of them went he looked through his reserve deck and there was like 3 7s, 3 6s, 2 5s, they didn’t drain for 2 turns because they thought he might have had a counter assault, 3 turns later, they found out they were right. (We had to throw one in that deck).  Game lasted about an hour and 15 minutes.  We killed off one of them, and that sucked, because Pat had about 5 guys on Yavin, and when you kill the player, their stuff left the table, so hence Vader died and Hunt Down was flipped back for a turn, we learned a lot from that.  Here’s a funny though, what happens if you have a TIE on Yavin and it goes away while you have Seinar out, that’s right folks, it goes to your used pile J, boy was that funny.  We ended up winning and started down the path to victory.<br/>
<br/>
Pat 38<br/>
Me 25<br/>
Total:	2(+63)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
We play Team Frogurt (Andrew Emmott &amp; Kevin Ray)<br/>
They are playing Set Your Course Heavy Space and Ral/Ops<br/>
<br/>
This was great, before it was our turn 2 it was game.  They put down Merryjk at the Executer Docking Bay.  They also started Bad Feeling, not good for Pat at the beginning.  So we come down with Cracken and Boshek and whoop up on Merryjk our first turn.  Pat picks up one card, ONE card! Fallen Portal, beatings.  What comes down next turn, Lord Vader with stick to commence beatings on us.  Pat goes fallen portal with Your Insights Serve You Well on table, 6, oh look, Lord Vader just took it up the butt, (note to self, never mess with Boshek, he rules) Did I forget to mention Pat’s light deck destiny’s are just as wrong as his dark, my bad.  After that, Pat invaded Raltiir, he wasn’t flipped for more than a half a turn and I kept space going with Our Most Desperate Hour.  Pat also put in 2 Tatooine Celebration so we would both have retrieval, which was so cool.  Menace Fades is a beating and thus we win.<br/>
<br/>
Pat 35<br/>
Me 37<br/>
Total 4(+135)<br/>
<br/>
I think to myself, we are pretty safe for a place now with our differential, this is pretty sick.  The best I had ever done was 8(+133) in 4 games going undefeated.  This already beat me for differnce.  Next round I get to play my pal Shaner and his partner Ryan Hamre.  Pat and I are dark first.<br/>
<br/>
Their decks:<br/>
Turn Vader assist deck and EBO lot of space hate.<br/>
Team Name: The Late And The Unprepared<br/>
<br/>
First thing I see on the table is I Feel the Conflict, I hate this card, this card is very bad for TIEs.  First turn, Pat gets the Force, comes down with Lord Vader with stick and the Emperor to Endor, damn that’s hate.  For the most part Pat took care of the ground without being contested until the very end.  But first to space.  We had about 6 battles or so in space.  The first was the greatest, we had a big pile up and we both Tied at power 52, that was cool and score 1 for Dengar in ship. (I’m playing 2)  I also somehow won 2 other battles in space so I didn’t give them a card.  I only gave them 2 cards, Pat was cool on the ground and Imperial Decree is cool. (note to self, this card rules)  Ryan is all scared that we are about to do something and Shaner goes what else could they come down with, everything is on the table.  Pat comes down to the 4th marker where some dudes are with Xixor and Jade with stick.  He hits one, dark strikes him, thus no destiny and clears the site and moves Jade on in.  Shaner comes down with EPP obi and goes after Xixor, he misses and draws a 3, Pat draws his usual 6, Obi dies.  Then next turn he goes after Mara with 2 guys and the almighty Bantha Droid.  He doesn’t draw a 4, Mara lives and now there are 2 locations for Imperial Decree, guess what, those 4 systems he owned, don’t have force drain bonuses, I cancel the one at the death star, and we end up taking 4 total.  Visage and Pat’s Drains on the ground end up taking care of them while I run around the galaxy with a dreadnaught, 4 TIEs and Dengar.  Very good close game, almost ran the full 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Pat 6<br/>
Me 11<br/>
Total:	6(+152)<br/>
<br/>
Well, we have 2nd place no matter what now, but I want a box of reflections, so whoever we play next game we have to win.  Guess what, we get to play them again.  This time they are playing:<br/>
<br/>
ISB and MKOS, very good combo<br/>
<br/>
This game was timed and consisted of retrieval up the butt for the entire game.  Pat and I didn’t have Aim High in there, but we had other things, let me sum up a few things, since the game was on our side because of tech.  First off, Pat does the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.  They have the Sail Barge fully loaded with Bib and Ephont Mon on Deck.  Pat moves over Jedi Luke with stick, Ben with Stick and Lando and EPP Leia.  Pat ends up losing Ben and Leia from a Wounded Wookie and they lose like 2 guys that were hit.  End of the turn there are 8 people on board and the 2 inside, Pat goes UNDER ATTACK, BOOOOOMMMMMMM Sail Barge just blew up, drain for 3, hehe.  Shaner did not like that and felt the wrath later as a blizzard walker took it up the butt as well.  I had my fun too, I snipered with an Intruder Missile on Tala 1 to kill bossk and 3 Outer Rim Scouts and make shaner use a ghhhk which I caught.  We had so much fun pinging stuff.  Basically after that, Cracken at Tatooine, Blount at Coruscant and me owning space while Menaces fades and Battle Plan is on table is broken and there wasn’t much they could do, even without having aim high on table.  We get the timed win.<br/>
<br/>
Me 20<br/>
Pat 21<br/>
Total for the day:	7(+193) we were so close to 200, ahhhhhhhhhhhh, that would have been broken<br/>
<br/>
The entire day was cool.  I thank Patrick for Fallen Portaling Lord Vader with stick and playing with a Ninja Under Attack that proved its worth.  And to think, we just brought our signature decks, no real combo style.  We split a box of reflections, I get some cool things like Jade’s stick and Luke’s and some other stuff I can use to trade now.<br/>
<br/>
Finals Standings:<br/>
The Short And The Ugly (Jared &amp; Patrick): 7 (+193)	ß That’s us<br/>
Epidemic Ganley (John Dunn &amp; Justin Beal): 4 (+69)<br/>
The Late And The Unprepared (Chris Shaner &amp; Ryan Hamre): 4 (+8)<br/>

<br/>
After tournament festivities, it’s my birthday, I must have fun, I have decreed it so.  After the tourney, Pat, Shaner, John, Ryan, Andrew and I head on over to Arriba’s Mexican Grill.  My birthday is Cinco de Mayo, so where else would we go than a Mexican Restaurant?  From here most of the quotes are told, and here are the rest from earlier.<br/>
<br/>
"I was born done @#$%" - John Dunn (very punny)<br/>
"Wait to you see the dark side objective" - Steve Marshall<br/>
"What are you activating" - Andrew Marcantel<br/>
"Oh no, Somebody died" - Andrew Emmott (I think that came after Vader died)<br/>
"Whose got the grapes now @#$%" - John Dunn (this was hilarious)<br/>
"I don’t remember half the things that come out of my mouth" - John Dunn<br/>
"Does that go on the list" - John Dunn<br/>
"Oh hell no" - Pat<br/>
"All my clothes are in Tucson" - Andrew Emmott<br/>
"@#$% @#$% @#$%" - John Dunn, "Done done done" Ryan Hamre (another funny pun)<br/>
"What the hell is that" - Chris Shaner (in response to Under Attack)<br/>
<br/>
and the favorite from my teammate:<br/>
"Live by the fallen portal, die by the fallen portal" - Patrick Hug<br/>
<br/>
I also just noticed that Dunn liked the word "@#$%" this weekend so I apologize if I have offended anyone.  The guys there were nice enough to pick up my tab and then we proceeded to go to the movies to watch The Mummy Returns.  Dunn updates me on some parts throughout the movie since I didn’t see the first one, and we all crack jokes throughout the movie since it was hilarious.  After the laughs, we part our ways and I get back to the dorm at about 2:30 AM, what a day.<br/>
<br/>
Until next time, this is Don Yoda signing off.<br/>
