<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Seeing as I have missed the last two Tuesday Mirkwood tournaments, as well as last weekend’s St. Cloud competition, you’d think I’m a little rusty.  Hell no.  Garrett Larson and I have been trying to come up with some good deck ideas for that last week or so, and came up with the return of SAC and mondo grabbers.  A couple nights ago I wrote up a heavy SAC light side, but dismissed it as "goat-worthy" before even attempting to build it.  I abandoned SAC and just stuck with the grabbers, building a TIGIH scout deck, but then I realized that scouts are pussies, and I wanted to *win* battles.  So then I just gave up and copied Josh Grace’s TIGIH and slightly tailored it to my style.  It’s basically high recylable interrupts and EPP beats.  For dark I was too lazy to build another deck, so it’s just the same SYCFA pound and drain that I’ve been playing for about two months.  Heavy hitters, PotF, Tramples, and Imperial Commands.  Usually starts with MobPts, IAO, and SSPFT (absolutely necessary with the popularity of On the Edge).<br/>
<br/>
Josh and Garrett came over to my place the night before to play test.  We tried to teach Garrett how to play Save You it Can, but as you shall see when you read his report, he hasn’t learned.  As the three of drove down to Rochester this morning, Garrett says, "Last chance.  We can still go to Hastings and finish guaranteed 1-2-3."  We came damn near doing that in Rochester.<br/>
<br/>
Peter Jacobson ran the tournament with 24 players.  First place would win an foil Jap Vader and a bowling trophy for "special" people aged 68-70.<br/>
<br/>
On to the matches-<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My TIGIH vs. Eric Pearson’s Court<br/>
<br/>
The details are already fuzzy.  All you really need to know is that my deck owns scum.  He sets up the usual crew in the AC: Mighty Jabba, Boelo, and Chall I think.  I was content to let him drain for 1.  Then he put out Gaylid and I wouldn’t tolerate that.  I put out Wise Advice and had a grabber in hand.  The only characters I had were Ben and Kal’fal.  I wanted to grab NSP early, so I deployed Ben w/stick.  No NSP.  Okay...Kal joined him, I battle.  Smear the queer (gaylid) but he cancels my battle destiny.  Oh well, I got rid of the guy I wanted.  I lose KFC and move Obi out.  I wanted to retrieve some cards, but I forgot to count and see where my 6 was, so I used the Larson-style Tracking System (tm).  That is: a turn and a half after the fact, try and remember how much you spent, how many destinies you drew, how much you used, and then figure out where the 6 is.  That method has never, EVER worked.  This time I forgot about +2 for Obi and so Crix went from on the edge into the abyss.  Later I got to verify something, and saw the usual hunter ships, as well as the Viagra.  I got Endor in my hand and Squassin out early, and had my choice of mini falcon or Master Wedge.  I decided to wait and hope he would throw away his space fleet.  Eventually Luke drained Zuckuss off the top, and I knew I would be safe.  I put out Master Wedge at Endor and moved Luke to the Back Door.  I used my tracking technique (count from the bottom right away) and sucessfully got 5 force back.  He never deployed guys to anywhere but the AC.  I eventually sent a hit squad in to clean house. Boelo and Jodo Cast made it hard, but eventually all his guys died. <br/>

<br/>
Highs: Zuckuss’s uneventful death, ensuring my air superiority.  <br/>
Most of the game.<br/>
Lows: Larson-style Tracking System (tm).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My SYCFA beat ’n drain vs. Dion Erbes’ WYS<br/>
<br/>
My deck either dominates WYS or bends over for it.  I grab the Big E as I always do against this deck right away.  Dion gets Dash to Tatooine first turn, but takes a couple more turns to flip.  I’m afraid to pull out my docking bays cuz they’ll just give him more places to drain, and I won’t be able to defend them all.  I get out Battle Plan early.  I save up for like 3 turns and finally deploy Thrawn in the Big E, but it’s barriered.  I Lateral Damage the outrider anyway, so he has to waste 4 turns running to the D* and back.  Meanwhile I put PotF at the system.  Mara w/saber goes to the cantina.  Dion is seriously force-choking me at this point.  I’m only getting about 9.  I have Lord Vader, Tarkin, and Guri in my hand, and he’s moved Jedi Luke over to wine and dine Mara.  I’m not really sure what to do, so I decide to use Vader to battle wedge in patrol craft at the docking bay.  He loses wedge to the tank, and Vader backs up Mara.  He drops Han and a wimp or two and messes me up.  I should have deployed Guri to the cantina and waited an extra turn to deploy Vader/Tarkin together.  I keep losing tramples off the top to drains.  I get Guri and Sir Admiral drains-a-lot to the Big E, so I’m draining for 4 a turn there and he can’t touch me.  Problem is I can’t get enough ground forces to take over the cantina (or any other site for that matter).  I die a slow and frustrating death.<br/>

Highs: Tatooine was MINE most of the game.<br/>
Lows: force choke hurt me<br/>
never got a trample until it was way too late<br/>
<br/>
LUNCH TIME<br/>
<br/>
Boston Market sucks.  The punk that took our order hates his job, and thusly every customer as well.  The food is bland and expensive.  And I’ve never seen so many heifers in one place.  Must have been 8 elephantine women in the place out of a total of like 20 people.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Scott Watson’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Scott is evidentally very new to the game.  I helped him go through the motions of the typical first few BHBM turns.  He deployed Bossk in bus to Redili.  I greeted him with Master Wedge and Blount in Red 6 and said "I’m on the Leader."  He lost a bunch.  Luke drained a lot.  He deployed lots of docking bays and the 3rd marker  with scout 3 and DRE/ponda there.  Obi w/saber and someone battled away DRE, then drained for a few turns.  Han and Leia beat up the walker for a bunch. I had 3 cards in the lost pile, and I wanted them back before it ended.  I hadn’t been tracking anything, but I figured that with the good destiny in this deck, I could draw at least a 4, so I On the Edged Obi for 3 and drew a 1.  Now I have 5 lost cards, so what the hell--On the Edge Leia for 3--draw a 2.  Whatever.  I drained for a lot and won.<br/>

<br/>
Highs: I forgot to say before--he used Weapon of and Ungrateful Bastard Child on Luke.  That was tech.<br/>
Lows: I didn’t hold back just because he was new.  <br/>
I’m 1 for 4 with On the Edge today.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: my DS vs. Timm Halverson’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
Timm has the most unique WYS I’ve ever seen.  Well, actually one of my early tries at WYS was pretty goofy.  Let me rephrase that first statement: Timm has the most unique good WYS I’ve ever seen.  He starts Squassin, Menace Fades, and I think Insurrection.  Grabs Kessel, puts dash there and inserts AFA.  My starting hand consists of all 4 tramples, tarkin, Suck@ss in Mist Hunter and some other useless crap.  I get the Big E into hand.  AFA pops second turn, so I deploy Tarkin to the cantina where he now has 2 RFCs.  He dies plus 2, so I saved 1 force.  I get DRE in scout walker plus PotF to the docking bay.  With 4 tramples I feel pretty safe.  Jedi Luke shows me the folly of my ways.  He puts out Goo Nee Tay (as if I wasn’t being choked enough) and Order to Engage.  Those are probably my two least favorite cards.  He builds up forces in space and uses Effective Repairs to get AFA back into my deck.  I deploy Big E, but it’s barriered.  Oh yeah, my 3rd least favorite card.  I lose 7 to his cheese.  He plays Effective Repairs from the lost pile to insert again.  I could go on, but I think you get the point.  <br/>

Highs: ...I...got some Tramples in my hand this time<br/>
Lows:  Wow that sucked hairy monkey nipples<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My skum killa vs. Justin Fleenor’s MKOS abyssins<br/>
<br/>
He forgot to deploy one of his starting effects, but he twileked first turn to get it.  He took the first 2 or 3 turns to set up, so I took advantage by activating tons and drawing tons.  He had Mighty Jabba, elephant man, xizor, boelo, and chall all on the cruiser outside somewhere.  I had a hit squad in hand, and I was planning on deploying them to that site and moving them all over into the palace (saving 1 force for each character), but I said, "What the heck," and battled.  My battle destiny was cancelled, but my 3 weapons claimed 3 victims: Xizor, elephant man, and I think chall.  I only lost Lando.  Then I invaded the palace.  He tried to take out Luke from the Endor docking bay with some guys, and he just defensive fired away my fallen portal, so I was slightly worried.  Turns out that Insertion Planning and a battle destiny of 6 was all I really needed.  I managed to track right for an On the Edge.  I guess Fleenor got impatient or something, so he deployed Guri, 4-lom, and Gaylid to the AC.  I answered with Gen. Solo and Corran.  He had Jabba’s thru w/u, so he did get a destiny.  I had no force to back up the remaining guy, I just left Han there alone.  He lost Gaylid.  Luckily he had no other characters in his hand, so I just backed up Han.  We played the run around game for several turns until he got sick of me draining him for more than he could drain me.  Then I just killed all his guys.<br/>

<br/>
Highs: Luke is a one-man army.<br/>
Leia/Han/Chewie/Obi/other guy is another army or two<br/>
Lows: ...I guess I lost some cards<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My DS vs. Derek Ho’s EBOX<br/>
<br/>
I learned my lesson after Graham’s EBOX spanked me at Mirkwood a few weeks ago.  I started MobPts, Decree, and Battle Plan instead of the usual stuff.  I grabbed Big E right away again.  I put scout 6 at the D* db for activation and Derek set up EBO very quickly.  He asked how many cards in my hand.  13.  I got a little nervous, but he didn’t do anything, so I deployed SSPFT to get it down to 12.  I saved for a couple turns, waiting to pounce on an x-wing, but he just grabbed a system and picked up.  He grimtashed me lost, but got nothing.  I got sick of waiting, deployed Mighty Jabba and Xizor to the 4th marker.  Fearing ice storm, I moved them in.  He finally deployed four systems and an x-wing to each as well as an Arcona to the 4th marker to keep me from using Decree.  I activated, deployed the Big E and Thrawn to Kiffix.  Barrier.  That’s fine.  I drop DRE and the man of the hour, Lt. Arnet, to the 4th marker.  They really don’t like those skinny little bug-eyed bastards.  He couldn’t run away and I drew a 6 for destiny.  TEE-HEE!  That was the defining point of the game, but Derek kept playing smart.  He spent 9 to drain for 3, and deployed TK-422 to the 4th marker and Lt. Blount undercover to the 1st marker.  The x-wing and the Executor did wind sprints between Kiffix and the Death star for the rest of the game.  I couldn’t drain so I used Death Mark (pure tech) to send han back to the used pile.  Tempest scout 3 and tarkin came down to the 4th marker.  The walker and DRE went and stepped on Blunt, and my two alien badasses went to visit zev and wes at the echo docking bay.  Derek stopped force draining me at that point, as I had about 8 cards in my hand.  We had some one-sided battles under the shield.  Apparently Xizor and Jabba are quite a tag team.  <br/>
<br/>
FW by 26<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Everything went my way.<br/>
I showed Derek how us Minnesotans deal with Arconas.  Sure Trample’s fun, but Arnet is much more effective.  <br/>
Lows: He did manage to Ice Storm a couple of my guys.<br/>
<br/>
So end up at a respectable 4 and 2.  My LS went 3-0, DS went 1-2.  Time for a new DS.  Here’s the standings:<br/>
<br/>
1st-Josh Grace 6-0<br/>
2nd-Dion Erbes 5-1<br/>
3rd-Garrett Larson 4-2<br/>
4th-Timm Halverson 4-2<br/>
5th-Justin Alfs (me) 4-2<br/>
<br/>
Team Mirkwood dominates once again, placing 1-5.  Graham scrubbed out at 7th.  Garrett, despite getting 3rd, lost the first game to the guy who got second-to-last.  It was that guy’s only win.<br/>
<br/>
States are in 2 weeks.  I’ll be going to at least 3 more tournaments before then, so stay tuned.<br/>
