<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK, well, seeing as how this is my first tournament report, I guess Ill do what everybody<br/>
else does.  <br/>
<br/>
Entering Lazy Mode<br/>
<br/>
OK, so the day of the tournament, I wake up and go over to my decks. My light side is an<br/>
updated version of Chus Xwing swarm, and Ds is a bring him mains.  I need lots of cards<br/>
for both decks, so I cant wait for the tournament.  My best friend, John Lilly (AKA. Lost<br/>
Rogue), is over at my house, so I call his parents and they agree that if my dad will drive<br/>
us up, then they will pick us up.  So, we get ready and head to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
We get there and meet Mark Bordenet (tournament director), John Tatta (state champ),<br/>
and Chris Warder (really good player).  SO they go to the Chinese place nearby for lunch<br/>
and we sit down and negotiate some trades with other people there.  Nothing major.  SO,<br/>
we get about 8 people there and then it gets crazy.  Everybody is trading for reflections 2<br/>
cards, the hardest to get being Xizor, and the easiest to get being The New Emperor.  So<br/>
we trade lots and I get all the cards that I need, Including a Xizor and Darth, except a<br/>
trample.  Oh well. so I just toss in a hoth: war room.  <br/>
<br/>
My friend decides to go buy his first reflections 2 packs, and who does he get in his first<br/>
pack??  Jedi Luke.<br/>
<br/>
So, we all fill out our forms and see whos in.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My dark side vs. John Tattas Profit.<br/>
Going in, I am afraid, having played against this deck, but never before with my particular<br/>
deck.  He uses Heading to pull Insurrection, and I use Prepped Defenses to get<br/>
Mobilization Points and You Cant Hide Forever.  First turn, I drop Emperor from hand<br/>
and go to look for Emperors Power.  Is it there??????     <br/>
NNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!  So, first turn, he gets to look at my entire deck. <br/>
WTF????????  So, basically, Im already screwed.  I drop some people down at tatooine,<br/>
and battle a few times, but I keep forgetting to make him lose 1 force for winning a battle. <br/>
He disarms my Lord and makes me lose his saber.  He Fallen Portals my Ponda Baba/Dr.<br/>
Evazan, my Xizor, and my grand Moff Tarkin.  Eventually he drains me out.  <br/>
FL 0(-28)<br/>
Props: Me only losing by 28<br/>
Slops: Me losing by 28<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Im thinking What a great way to start a tournament.  So I walk around for<br/>
a while and then get ready for game 2<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My Swarm vs. Chad Reedys Court<br/>
I look at his objective and think This will be easy! Xwing swarm rules court.  SO, we<br/>
start.  He drops some JPSD effects, to cancel my canceling.  He never comes to space,<br/>
and I still block him with my undercover spies.  I easily out drain him<br/>
<br/>
Props: Me for winning<br/>
Slops: Chad for being mad at himself about losing.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(-2)<br/>
<br/>
After this, I am really happy.  my new Xwing swarm worked really well!!  So I mess<br/>
around, and our tournament director tells me and my new opponent.  that we have the<br/>
pick of sides.  I say light!  and he says OK, I dont care.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- Swarm vs. Clay Swentzels Court<br/>
I see that he has court, and am immediately overjoyed.  This game goes pretty<br/>
nonchalantly, I eventually drop Luke, obi w stick, Boussh, and a bothan to battle Jabba<br/>
and others.  I win the battle, he loses mass force.  He is out pretty quick from my battle<br/>
and my drain of 7 every turn.<br/>
<br/>
Props: Me for winning again<br/>
Slops: Him for not trying to oppose my choosing of light side and for never coming to<br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+19)<br/>
<br/>
I get done with this game, when my friends father comes to the room.  He says that we<br/>
have to leave, because John Lilly has a ball game at 6:00.  DARN!!!  I was a bit mad, but<br/>
he may have saved me from a crushing defeat at the hands of a VERY good player.  So,<br/>
oh well, we leave, and I am pretty happy about getting the cards I need.  So it wasnt a<br/>
waste.<br/>
<br/>
When I left, the standings were:<br/>
1.Andy @#$%^ (no idea what your last name is)<br/>
2. Dean @#$%^ (again, the name thing)<br/>
3. Chris Warder<br/>
4. *Me*<br/>
5. John Tatta<br/>
6. Clay Swentzel<br/>
7. John Lilly<br/>
8. Chad Reedy<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Mark Bordenet for running a great tournament<br/>
Me for only losing by 28 to John Tatta<br/>
Me for winning my last 2 games<br/>
Me for getting a Xizor<br/>
John Lilly for pulling a Jedi Luke<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Me for losing by 28<br/>
Chad for being mad (you have to loosen up, man!)<br/>
John for pulling a Jedi Luke (I was supposed to get it, man!!)<br/>
Me and John for having to leave (oh well)<br/>
<br/>
