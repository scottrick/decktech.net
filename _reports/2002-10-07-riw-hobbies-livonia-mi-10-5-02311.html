<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Tournament Report    10/5/2002<br>
RIW Hobbies, Livonia, MI (near Detroit)<br>
<br>
Pre-game nonsense:   OK, I’m pitted against FCON2<br>
weekend in Philly, but I figure there hasn’t been<br>
a Toledo/Detroit player in the big events for a <br>
while.  A few weeks earlier, I played at the<br>
Science Emporium, a few blocks down from RIW<br>
Hobbies.  I went 4-0 and won the tournament, but<br>
it was all young players and although I didn’t <br>
win big, I did feel bad that I was the only one<br>
playing with updated deck types.  <br>
<br>
I chatted with Greg Shaw from NJ a few days <br>
before the tournament.  He is getting excited<br>
about a new LS deck that he was successful with<br>
on 9/28/02, and he shared it with me to try out<br>
here.  It basically uses BHBM and gets a few <br>
Jedi and rebels out and a surprise "Don’t Under-<br>
estimate our Chances" to basically end it all in<br>
one swift stroke.  There were a few things I <br>
found odd about the deck and made a few changes,<br>
but I decided to give it a try only out of <br>
curiosity.  My DS deck was the SYCFA/Fear deck<br>
with suicide mains that I have been playing<br>
since Origins.  <br>
<br>
I arrived early to the store after getting <br>
Chinese food and a haircut across the street.<br/>
I was supposed to be in Port Huron for work, <br/>
but due to traffic I cancelled my appointment<br/>
so I could get to the tournamant on time.  I <br/>
spent some time talking with a few local kids<br/>
about the new virtual cards and was thumbing <br/>
through the old SWCCG in the $1 bin.  I met<br/>
Joe Lake, the director, and while we were<br/>
talking I hear the booming voice of Joe<br/>
"Jigga" Giannetti.  He is a core member of<br/>
"Team Albany" who happens to be going to <br/>
college in Eastern Michigan.  This was a <br/>
pleasant surprise as we chatted about player<br/>
gossip and other nonsense.  At 4:15 we have <br/>
6 players and we start.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My LS v.  Joe Giannetti’s Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Whatever.  So I move 520 miles and drive <br/>
another 75 miles to play Jigga...  always a<br/>
good time.  I never get a decent enough crew<br/>
of characters out and he pretty much owns me<br/>
between capturing Luke, disarming him, then<br/>
having Dr.E make him go bye-bye.  Visage nips <br/>
away at things for a while.  I eventually get <br/>
a couple of guys out late, pop the tripler on<br/>
him and make him lose 15 cards (his character<br/>
was forfeit 0).  Unfortunately it was only a<br/>
defiant kick in the nads to him before he <br/>
redeploys and drains me out.  Full Loss by 9.<br/>
<br/>
0(-9).<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  <br/>
<br/>
saving my differential with the big surprise<br/>
Playng Jigga is always a good time<br/>
<br/>
Lows:   <br/>
no characters available to set up a bigger<br/>
surprise earler<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  DS v. Joe Giannetti’s Profit Deck<br/>
<br/>
Profit?   PROFIT??!!  This will be interesting.<br/>
I have no aliens to give him to start, but I <br/>
manage to get 3-4 systems out first turn. <br/>
Premiere virtual Motti and Mejjarek go to DS<br/>
Docking Bay, and I manage to get some ISD’s out<br/>
by turn 3.  I Twi’lek for Fear and then the <br/>
hurtin’ begins.  I did manage to get EPP Vader,<br/>
Grand Moff Tarkin, and Maul with double-dildo <br/>
to the Audience Chamber with Ozzel and make <br/>
EPP Han and Grand Masta Luke go away.  I own <br/>
the chamber and space, pull out Battle Order,<br/>
and make him pay to drain.  He puts out another<br/>
Han to flip Profit, but the 2-3 he makes me <br/>
lose are no match to a drain of 7 and a force<br/>
loss of 6.  (Oh yeah, I had Adm. Chiraneau<br/>
out early too).  Full Win by 8.<br/>
<br/>
2(-1)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:<br/>
Always a good game with Jigga!<br/>
No space in Profit.  Alleluia!!!<br/>
<br/>
Lows:<br/>
Not much battling... I couldn’t play Furry Fury<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The two kids I mentioned earlier leave and we <br/>
are down to me, Joe L., Joe G., and Scott (?).<br/>
I pair up with Joe L. for game 3.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  DS v. Joe Lake’s Tosche Station Beats<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm..  I’ve never seen this before (really!). <br/>
I am curious about whatever he has planned, as<br/>
he starts Obi Hut and Tosche Station and no <br/>
effects.  He puts Tawss Ka (or Melas?) there <br/>
figuring I have no ground action for him.  I<br/>
put U-3PO there to block any drain.  It takes <br/>
me longer to set up my space as I have one <br/>
system in hand and no Mejarrek.  He deploys<br/>
Cantina and I save up for the Tarkin/Maul<br/>
Vader set up.  I clear the Cantina and we<br/>
end up running around each other down on <br/>
Tatooine while I try to set stuff up in space.<br/>
He also gets a few ships out (EPP Han in Falcon,<br/>
KFC on Tantive IV, a few other starfighters)<br/>
but he is hesitant to overcommit in space<br/>
since I have "Something Special Planned for<br/>
Them" out.  Midway through the game, I hit him<br/>
with a "Limited Resources" for 4 force just for<br/>
fun.  It gets expensive for him to <br/>
drain and move away from my ISD’s. I soon<br/>
get out "Fear Will Keep them in Line," and <br/>
after 1-2 turns he decides to Alter it, losing <br/>
to the "There is no Try/Oppressive Enforcement"<br/>
combo.  As we are squared up at the Death Star,<br/>
him at 16 power and me at 24, I deploy<br/>
COnquest and play "Overwhelmed."  His ships<br/>
all go to the used pile and I spread out and<br/>
drain him away.  FW by 9.<br/>
<br/>
4(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:<br/>
watching my deck do what it is supposed to do<br/>
playing Overwhelmed is such a treat!<br/>
<br/>
Lows:<br/>
none, really.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  LS v. Joe Lake’s Rallops/Biker Deck<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm...  Ounee Ta makes its debut!  Thanks,<br/>
Joe!  Well, he does the usual Rallops thing:<br/>
gets out sites, puts down biker scouts and <br/>
bikes, etc..  I deploy stuff to Raltiir and<br/>
move Luke over and just pile on the characters<br/>
At one point I have a copy of each of my <br/>
characters out and he is just running away with <br/>
his 5 bikes, an ATST, and a random extra biker.<br/>
I move everyone over, Luke gets captured, he<br/>
tries to Trample someone and fails, he moves<br/>
away, I spread out, he moves back, I move back,<br/>
and he starts the battle.  He Tramples Pissed<br/>
Lando and I grab it, he tries to Trample Han, <br/>
I play the Tripler and he is perplexed, then I<br/>
bomb him with Jedi Presence.  I target Qui<br/>
Gon with stick and make everyone else double <br/>
power and play smoke screen targetting Qui Gon.<br/>
He is speechless.  I hit a few characters and<br/>
add up the power:  My 58 to his 37.  That’s <br/>
21 difference times 3 = 63!!!  He starts to <br/>
sack everything and still doesn’t have <br/>
enough to take care of it.  This pretty much<br/>
depletes his pile and we shake on it.  Full <br/>
win by 20.<br/>
<br/>
Final Score:  6(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Well, Joe L was 1-3, Jigga was 2-1 going into <br/>
his second game with Scott, and Scott was 2-1<br/>
too.  Joe and I watch as Jigga takes the<br/>
game, going 3-1 6(+15).  I’m not sure where <br/>
the kids finished up, but they are excited <br/>
that there are people playing and will be <br/>
ready on 11/2.  <br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
-Winning my second tournament within a month!<br/>
-Going 12-2 since Origins<br/>
-The rude movie lines and jokes throughout <br/>
games 3 and 4.  You HAD to be there..<br/>

Slops:<br/>
-Few people...  we’ll fix that!!<br/>
<br/>
