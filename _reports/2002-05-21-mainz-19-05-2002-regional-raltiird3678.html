<br/>
<br/>
what a amazing weekend/tournament, my 3rd official swccg tournament and also the 3rd place, that i <br/>
shared with martin schuhmacher -&gt;&gt; (thanks for the first choice).two days before i had no really good idea for new decks<br/>
so i tried tons of combos, my first decks were gunguans (light side) and watto with podrace and expand the empire (dark side)<br/>
but after some test-games i decided to play the basic stuff with QMC à la B.Winkelhaus and my nasty gangsters mixed up<br/>
with racing and this was the right decision.<br/>
For my surprise just B.Winkelhaus played his "basic" Watto, the most decks were light side/dark side combat or "all your<br/>
base belong to europe" (biest deck).well lets start to tell you something more about my games and the whole tour.<br/>
<br/>
my decks : <br/>
<br/>
light side	:	QMC à la B.Winkelhaus<br/>
<br/>
dark side	:	Court mixed up with P.Racer<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
1. game (dark side) vs. (sorry but i forgot the name) light side combat<br/>
<br/>
the first game with my favourite dark side deck against light side combat, i’ve never lost a game before against this deck<br/>
but this game was very strange and long. i played "my" basic court style pulled out gailid with mosep to the audience chamber <br/>
and picked up jabbas palace, so the match up was tech. his first action was to pull out naboo system (without a ship for over 5 turns)<br/>
and a Jedi Luke to naboo, well my force generation was over 16 force per turn and this is great for court so i pulled out<br/>
boelo and ephant mon with bane malar (achim this little brave bounty hunter is very powerful)to all my jabbas palace sites <br/>
to drain him for 6 and 4 force directly from the reserve deck, the next turns i tried to kill jedi luke with 4-LOM and Boba<br/>
Fett but he kicked my @ss from naboo.after 3 turns he picked up over 20 hand cards and i just waited for the ships and jedis <br/>
but no ships only 1 MF with Chewie and Han, with the rest of his pilots like wedge,dash and hobbie he tried to hold one tatooine site.<br/>
so i deployed scum in combo with first strike to retrieve 3 force per battle, but then finally he get Qui to naboo and so he also<br/>
started to drain me for 7 on naboo pulled out battle plan, and i had a problem!!! the only fact that helped me,i holded the race<br/>
but after my lost pile began to rise fast i won the race so i had a little bit more force to drain on my jabbas sites, he made always the same mistake to <br/>
pick more and more cards into hand so he had just 10 life force and 15 hand cards but only red cards (he told me later on), so <br/>
after 2 turns he had no force to pay the maintance for the MF and so he lost the space site and his own battle plan killed him<br/>
i had also only 4 force at the end but this was enough to drain him for 2 from r. deck, and finally the strange and long game <br/>
(i think 50 min) ended with the result :<br/>
<br/>
FW +4<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
2. game (light side) vs. Sebastian Lange (dark side combat)<br/>
<br/>
my second game against dark side combat this time,i thought QMC will be able to win but i don’t tought i will win so<br/>
easily.my match up was nice, i pulled out keir to space with a x-cannon,goo nee tay and princess leia to her site, so i was able to flip<br/>
my objective in the second turn, and this is important for QMC to win.his first turn : he activated 8 force and picked all the<br/>
force into hand, i couldn’t believe my luck no jedi at the first round, the game started to get better and better, so i drained him for 2<br/>
and he lost 2 cards from reserve deck  1.Maul 2.His Stick, then i pulled out Pucumir and Luke to Cloud City fliped my objective and <br/>
find a cloud city celebration in the force pile the whole game was amazing for me.so after 3 turns i was able to drain him for 7<br/>
and to retrieve 3 force (i had no lost pile).then he started to deploy some aliens to CC, but he deployed Prince Xizor and <br/>
Ponda Baba &amp; Dr. Evazan to my princess leia and i couldn’t believe this, before he wanted to battle my leia he picked up the card<br/>
read the game text and laughed. so the game began to become easily he wasn’t able to pull out jedis (i don’t know why).<br/>
after i drained him for 9 at CC and to retrieve 4 force each turn (i had just 1 path every turn in my lost pile)the game was finally over<br/>
in his last turn he pulled out mosep with vader to naboo to give me damage but he had no force to drain cause my battle plan blocked him<br/>
so the game ended after (i think after 25 min) with the result :<br/>
<br/>
FW +22 (no lost pile for me!!)<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
3. game (light side) vs. Angelo Consoli (all your base belong to europe)<br/>
<br/>
ok i started with 2:0 in the regional and i hoped not to cross B.Winkelhaus, and i was lucky to play agaisnt angelo but then<br/>
he showed me his starting and i saw the s.ucking "all your base belong to europe".QMC vs. All Your ... is hard, ok i started<br/>
with "don’t do that again" to block his fast game and force activation, my match up wasn’t really bad, after 2 turns i <br/>
fliped my objective and occupied tatooine system with Dash,Hobbie and Keir, his problem was his bad hand, he picked up i think <br/>
over 20 cards, so after he had all that he needed he began to kick my @ass, first in the space with Zuckuss and Saber 1 and a <br/>
cannon, killed all my ships and pulled out Maul in Space to Bespin so i had to hide from zuckuss,saber 1 and Maul with just hobbie<br/>
and later on wedge my outrider was lost so i wasn’t able to kill maul in space this was the main fact, he drained me over 6 each turn<br/>
holded bespin system blocked my drains on CC with Kedar,U-3PO etc. after 30 min the game was over with the result :<br/>
<br/>
FL -16<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
4. game (dark side) vs. Micheal Fritsch  (hidden base)<br/>
<br/>
my 4 game and i the game before was really bad for me, i had no chance against angelo and his "all your ...", so this game<br/>
with my dark deck should be better for me, and hidden base is nice for court, my match up was tech, i pulled out gailid with <br/>
mosep, and picked up some hand cards with jabbas palace. he started with the basic HB sytle endor system with the new premiere luke<br/>
into space with artoo, so i pulled out all my aliens ephant mon and boelo with jade to jabbas palace so my drain was 6 and 4 from <br/>
the reserve deck, i wondered why he don’t drained me in space for one or why he don’t pull out battle plan shield (that he played after 5 turns)<br/>
after he had 5 systems in space with some ships, i pulled out zuckuss tp space in combo with bosk in hounds tooth and probed his hidden base<br/>
with the first turn (it was naboo) so the game was over he had no x-cannons in space and he wasn’t able to get ability of 7 <br/>
to battle my zuckuss and bosk, so he drained some turns for 2 or 4 but after i won the race the damage from me was to high and<br/>
the game ended fast i think after 25 mins with the result of :<br/>
<br/>
FW +25 <br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
5. game (light side) vs. Benjamin Fadda (dark side combat) again!!!<br/>
<br/>
my 5th game and again dark side comabt but this time against benjamin fadda, a player that i never heard and played before,<br/>
one of B.Winkelhaus Padawans. his match up was really good fisrt turn he pulled out maul to naboo, and picked up some nice cards,<br/>
my match up was also tech, like in the whole tournament, i played keir to space with a x-cannon and deployed leia with gun to <br/>
her qaurter, next turn he drained me for 2 and pulled out palpy to naboo so i must play fast to keep the damage low, and i <br/>
fliped my objective again after 2 turns with pucumir and goo nee tay so he had really problems to drain me, cause he just activated <br/>
11 force but to drain me for 4 he had to pay 6 force and with goo nee tay he wasnt able to pull out characters to CC to <br/>
kick my @ss, so he hoped for the bespin system, and i was lucky to get Power Pivot,Organized Attack into hand, and fianlly in the <br/>
next turn he tried to kick my keir with Bossk in ship, but with organized attack and power pivot brave keir protected bespin,<br/>
and so he tried again to kill my pucumir with IG-88 but path, run luke run and help me obi-wan ... gave him the beat down, and <br/>
so the gane enden with the result :<br/>
<br/>
FW +14 (the only thing that s.ucked was that he cancled my CC celebration in teh 3rd turn, like every dark player)<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
6. game (dark side) vs. Sascha Winter aka Warmaster (TIGIH)<br/>
<br/>
the 6 game and this was the most important game for me , cause sascha and i went into this game with 4:1 and the winner will <br/>
qualify for the FINAL FOUR, and sascha is one of my padawans. i knew his TIGIH cause i helped him to build up this deck, and <br/>
sascha knewed my deck, so this "final game" was the highlight. and in this game my hand was more than tech, i pulled out <br/>
jade with stick to chief chirpas hutt to capture luke and to stop his force activation,and i hoped for no characters but then<br/>
he pulled out han with gun (i didn’t hit this s.ucker) kicked my jade from endor and then i concentrate all my ability to tatooine, in the second turn<br/>
i pulled out again mosep and gailid to the chamber like in all the games before (that was just amazing) with scum and my other aliens<br/>
to my jabbas site, and it was to fast for him, i drained him for 4 directly from reserve deck, and he tried to deploy bunker<br/>
and to gave me also damage but it took him to long to pull out han with chewie and some other scouts to endor after he deployed his <br/>
characters i won the race and gave him the rest damage of 6, so i had only 5 or 6 lost cards and he had omly 15 life force, boushh<br/>
wasn’t able to get into jabbas palace (none shall,and ephant mon kept her away), in the last 2 turns he played (lost in the wildness or so)<br/>
kicked my Xizor and deployed Corran Horn to jabbas palace, the only thing that helped me was first strike with scum and snoova <br/>
i battled him retrieved 3 force and captured horn so the game was really over, very fast i couldn’t believe that i won this game just after<br/>
20 mins with the nice result of :<br/>
<br/>
FW +25 (again!!)<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
ok i was qualified for the final four together with martin schuhmacher,bastian winkelhaus and martin wüst.<br/>
i had to play againt martin wüst and had deck choice i chosed my dark deck cause i didn’t lose any tournament game with this<br/>
deck the last 2 years. and then i was shocked cause martin played s.ucking profit.<br/>
<br/>
semi-final :<br/>
<br/>
(dark side) vs. martin wüst (profit)<br/>
<br/>
ok i played court and he profit with all this s.ucking mains with stick, i had no chance to win this game, i just <br/>
activated 6 force!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! after he pulled out goo nee tay i knew the game was over i just try to give him some <br/>
damage with podrace, but then i deployed IG-88 to han after he realeased him kicked him into the used pile and so he had <br/>
ben with stick, qui with stick, luke with stick etc. on tatooine but wasn’t able to give 1 drain or to give me some other damage<br/>
but i wasn’t able to deploy charactesr with only 6 force i lost all my sites and so he tarcked his han wirh 3-PO pulled him back to<br/>
tatooine and gave me a damage of 8 after 3 turns i had no life force end the game ended finally with the result :<br/>
<br/>
FL -11<br/>
