<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">We had planned to go to Wyoming on Friday, but the TR called Travis in the morning and told us that the tourney had been moved to 5:00, so we could not go. Damn! I woke up early, and did it all for nothing. In the evening, Trav and I check out Friday Night Magic. Troy stalemates against a power 9 deck, so he gets prizes on time. Later on, we check out Planet of the Apes. It has a figures from SW, like Tarkin and Vader. The original was better. I find a good deal on Nitro starters, 99 cents each. Damn, basic Nitro is the ugliest card that I have ever seen. Too bad we could not find any Raw Deal. Somewhere along the way, Travis got me a pack of Austin Powers and Boy Crazy at Gen Con. I pull the most naseauting card in CCGdom, Fat Bastard, Dead Sexy. I reconstructed the old school Court deck, but gave it a flippinâ€™ element. The MBO deck got pumped big time with the new cards, and still scares SYCFA away from the metagame. The Court would prove to be a beast. I had planned to Elis around the captives, since I had heard that they were now Elised with the Hunters, but Jeff ruled I could not before the tourney. I can deal with that, since I knew before the tourney, and could still move around piles of guys.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My Court versus Logan RST<br/>
I grab Rendili, and deploy it. I have Jabba in hand, and start Power of the Hutting for his crew. He puts some guys at the platform, and moves them to the Back Door. I Elis over Jabba, Boleo, Ephant Mon, Iggy with Gun, and Fett with Gun. I capture General Solo, shoot Crix, and cancel his destiny, and get my four. He took around sixteen damage on that. I had some guys holding some Tatooine site, and he tried to beatdown, but I ended up clearing his guys. Later on, DOS, Junkin, and Owen with Beru show up in the AC, he has no force, so I deploy S&amp;V. I deploy Bossk with Gun, and Dengar with Gun, had some other guy, use once per game to grab Dr E. and Walrus, put a bounty on DOS. Boosk captures DOS, Junkie throws grenade but misses, Dengar shoots Beru and Dr E. operates, and Junkie gets beat up. I retrieve for Bounty, then go feed DOS to Sarlaac. After I feed, I Sniper the Sarlaac to get it into my lost pile, since I had it in hand, and knew it would not hit. He draws up. Court controlled the game the entire time. FW 31<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My MBO versus Preston Court<br/>
I have two sites in hand. I deploy them first turn. Then, I take the court damage topdeck. I lose Attack Run. That pretty much ends the game. I put Luke in Ship to Yavin, and move it over to his Kashyyyk. He Lateral Damages, and has Zuckuss, Igyy, and Dengar in ship beat it down. This game just sucked for me. Once my hopes were dashed, I knew it was over. I could not deal with his space. FL 33<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My Court versus Peter Republicans<br/>
I put my guys in AC, and deploys docking bay. I ditch Rendili to drains, since I do not want to deal with space. He has Qui Gon, Jar Jar, and Lando with Axe. I Elis over Jabba, Boleo, Mon, and Bossk with Gun, but he barriered Fett with Gun. I capture Lando, rather then Qui Gon. That won me the game. He gets not destiny, and loses Jar-Jar and some battle damage. On his turn, Gui-Gon runs. I put Mara to reinforce Fett. I look for a Starship, since I cannot deploy it. Turns out I would have had to deploy to docking bay, but lack the force for Bossk, and Fett was on table so he could not show up in Jett to Docking Bay. His turn, Amidala shows up, I Barrier Panaka, and Obi try to kill my AC crew. His swing does not hit Mara, Maras swing hits Obi, Fett hits Amidala. I get a good destiny so he loses 2. I capture Obi, and forfeit Mara to attrition. My turn, I put down Jodo, battle, hit Panaka, so he loses Panaka and more. I put down the Sarlaac around now, and move Fetts gang over to Espa. Peter has Qui Gon at the Pit, but the Sarlaac never eats Jesus. I reenforce Fett. He puts Senators at the Cantina, but Bubo eats Valorum one turn, Leia wanabe the next. I spend 8 force to unite the piles at the Pit, eat Obi, he loses 8, I retrieve 7, Qui-Gon runs. My turn, Lando is eaten, he loses 6, I retrieve 7. I move the pile, for eight force, in front of Qui Gon. Qui Gon runs, I Elis over to beat up lone Dash, and Peter gives up before I can see how badly the pile would have smacked around Dash. FW 36<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My MBO versus Prestons Speed Deal<br/>
I start Fades rather then the pumper, and decide that the only way to survive is to play the Arconas for all they are worth. He plays silly amounts of interrupts early, but I get 2 Arconas set up, and do not screw around with flipping. The other Arcona must have been within the bottom 2 cars of my force pile. I deploy General Solo to CC, he is Id Just As Soon Kiss A Wookie. Next turn, I deploy Beezer, and she is Wookied. He beats up Solo for four, and I lose Beezer, so I do not have anyone to get beat up on CC. Zuckuss in Ship shows up for CC Occupation, but I play the combo and cancel it. I put Liberty to Courscant to set up a drain of 3. I put Hobbie in Ship to the Sector, and he dodges Zuckuss in Ship. Later, I put Wedge in Ship to Bespin, but he Wookies, and the TD rules that Wedge goes to lost pile. I accept the ruling, but think that Decipher allowing that to happed is not right. That cancels Deal, so his drains are bad. Xizor tries to beat up Blount at Docking Bay, but I play Houjix. By the time Xizor shows up at Crix War Room, I have suicide Obi make a run, kill Xizor, get some battle damage, and Crix take the attrition. Late game, a Suicide Luke kills lone Trooper. In the end, he lost so much force, and I did such a good job of messing with his drains, that he could not handle my drain of three. FW 8<br/>
<br/>
I end up taking second, and Travis gets first. Jeff gives me a baseball ticket, which is cool if I can get to the park. I get two packs of BB ANH as prize support, and the CC Pack. Lobot is cool, and I give the kid the commons and uncommons. I start a thread that decktech is going to sponsor the Shiny Pants at D-Con guy, which has absolutely no basis in truth.<br/>
