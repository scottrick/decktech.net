<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	Hey well it’s just another tournament, but why write a report about this one?  Cause this was a special Weekend!  My buddy Justin Cachelin from Kamloops, my hometown decided to FINALLY come to Van for some Star Wars action since they stopped hosting tournaments there.  I picked him up Friday at 5 pm at the bus depot, then we hit my house and started playtesting.<br/>
<br/>
	He was playing some EVIL DS BHBM deck chock full of Janus and Operational as Planned, then using ten sevens to make the opponent sit up and wait for you to Goo on them.  He also abused Emperor’s Power, and all the other goodies that would totally wreck lightside, such as Thrawn, Bossk, Xizor+Guri and ship, Ig-88, Choke Vader, Tempest1+Igar.  It’s all about the destinies.  After some testing, i mention "Add another Counter Assualt.  It’s money man."  He decided not to, the schmuck.<br/>
<br/>
Well since this was Justin’s big weekend, I decided to introduce him to the Brownie... I only had it once before, and only since it was Clint’s tradition, and I didn’t have a problem with it then... but this time, it almost KILLED me.  Same with Justin :P<br/>
<br/>
Back to my pad, and some more testing... We both decide my Scum deck is SICK, so i’ll run that tomorrow, and that Al’s super secret teched out lightside for provincials is MONEY, but needs some tuning.  I can’t come up with any other good light decks but the same damn WYS deck i’ve played for five tournaments now, so i add some extra tech in the form of a shocking info/grimtassh (HUGE), Revolution (no hiding in the bunker), grabber (imp command), and darklighter spin (get through imp command/guri).  Finally, at 3:30 am, we finished teching out Justin’s decks, and he goes "ok lez play i need to test!"  so i sit down for another game, almost falling asleep.. I only beat him cause I knew how to fight his deck now, AVOID BATTLES AT ALL COSTS!!!  He played wrong anyways, both of us did since we were tired, But it did teach him some things about his deck.  I taught him the stack a card mentality.. --The idea that you fight them to STACK THE CARD, not to beat them down, cause then you NEVER forget.  My roommate got up for work as we went to bed, so Justin crashed on top of his covers.<br/>
<br/>
Well we hit the tourney and do some pre game trading and smack talkin’, mostly the usual jank about me not winning provincials in a month...  and I get heckled to reveal the secrets of Al’s super secret teched out provinical LS.  Screw that says I :P  Decent competition showed up, Alex, Kevin, David, Ryan, Myself, Justin, and Andrew are all the players to be feared most likely.<br/>
Alex is borrowing cards like mad, mostly a crix madine, strike planning, and things like that, so he’s gotta be playing scouts.  Dave grabs a frozen assets, General Solo, and some destiny adders from people... sounds like Yannicks deck.<br/>
Going into this tourney I’m 1904, still recovering after the Worlds.. i ended something like 4 -10 there, so while I lost most of my games, they were all losses by 2 or 3 and such junk.  Stupid rating system doesn’t take into account differential :)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : Al’s SICK MKOS vs Eric Migicovskr (1484) Rescue the Princess<br/>
<br/>
Well this could be neat..  I get out my gooey jank at jabba’s palace, and get Boelo and Xizor to the Yavin 4 War Room to wait for leia.  The poor guy couldn’t free leia with 8d8 for the life of him.. when he finally did, he deployed some back up at the yavin4 docking with her, but only got her there in one turn.  I deploy some crap on him, but it gets barriered (DOH).  Next turn, he moves over for the flip.  Xizor and Boelo look at the nasty forces sittin’ across from them, and call for back up... namely in the name of IG-88 !  I start the fight, and capture leia... Send her back to the used, since he has Luke+stick and it would suck if she was just freed again.  Thinking back, i shouldve captured her, cause if she was freed, it wouldn’t flip the objective again.  So he smacks Xizor, I cancel his destiny with Boelo, and wreck him.  He at one point somehow got it flipped AND got a battle in, placing my 2nd Xizor out of play... and he did try to come to skirmish at Jabba’s Palace, resulting in me losing MORE characters to the lost, just to retrieve em, upping my Diff.  The game was actually closer than it sounds, but RTP bites when they pile on the warroom and you don’t have a narrow escape, or it’s a trap, or some way to keep leia alive.<br/>
FW + 40.<br/>
2 +40<br/>
<br/>
Well i’m obviously top, so i expect to play one of those guys I mentioned above..  Not so.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
Al’s pile WYS vs James Foy (1462) SYCFA Ties<br/>
<br/>
I’d given him suggestions on his deck at decktech, but i’m not sure if he took him.  I got out Han and Dash in ships real early, plus i’ll take the leader and got them to wakeelmui.  He NEVER found his Sienar Fleet until Really late game, and didn’t always have his All Power to Weapons.  No immunity, and low power due to I’ll Take the Leader meant ties were dropping like MAD.  The drains on the ground, then some Retrieval, and I won.  He did have a scare against me when he whipped out a tie cannon, but my A Few Manuevers would have none of that.<br/>
FW + 39<br/>
4 +79<br/>
<br/>
I looked in the box after the game and found out I was playing too cards short!!!  I forgot a few manuever and a jedi luke... no wonder it was hard to find em.<br/>
<br/>
Now at +79, i have a nice commanding lead... now if i can just stay there :)<br/>
I chat with dave for a bit, and notice Alex and Justin are still playing...  Alex usually comes up with some damn good stuff, so i’m kinda surprised.  I start talking crap about betting on Justin to win with Dave, but it turns out he already did and they were playing a friendly rematch.. which Alex won.  <br/>
During lunch, Dave finally conned me into letting him in on my teched out lightside....  his jaw dropped, it was great :)  <br/>
<br/>
Games 3:<br/>
Al’s Pile WYS vs Kevin Wan’s TDISGWATT Ties (1930)<br/>
Ug Kevin.  Man Kevin and I always have the most screwed up games.  I didn’t know what in heaven’s name he was playing, so i started setting some crap up.  3rd turn, I wanted to get both Han and Dash out, so i tunneled to pair one up and squassin’ for the other.  As i begin the tunnel, I talk some sh!t to Kevin about him playing some junky Troopers and Ties deck that’s gonna wreck me... In the tunnel, I seem my shocking info/grimtassh... if he’s playing ties, he’s got a 20 card hand... Naw no one could be THAT stupid.  Han and dash come out.  His turn, Wakeelmui, sienar fleet, dreadnaught and some Ties.  WTF!  he battle me, and decides to rip into the falcon with the gun.  it’s a 5!  A few manuevers saves the day once again, but it got grabbed.   All Power to weapons blew, but I outpowered him anyways.  Next turn, notice my grimtash is active, tunnel, Lost grim.  Two dreadnaughts, two ties, and i think two all powers bit the  dust.<br/>
 I started to drain for mad amounts on the ground, but he was draining me harsh in space...  I got out order to engage working it’s magic, plus the fact that ties have no hyperspace and he only has one dread out... I used I’ll take the leader to make him hurt more.  I could NEVER find a six to track, which was total bull.  End game, to try to improve my diff, I blind off the edge a stupid palace raider... it’s a ONE!! i lose a card! AG.  Control from the lost pile was big this game too.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 3<br/>
6 +82<br/>
<br/>
Well that’s a more reasonable diff for 3 games... but still in the lead :)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
Al’s SICK MKOS vs Justin Cachelin’s (1769) Even more of a pile WYS<br/>
This game was dumb, we knew each other’s deck and that I would wreck him. I could NEVER find my ships, they kept hitting the lost pile (and retrieved), which lowered my diff.  I started getting my crap out, he gets a nice space presence at tatooine and kessel, then puts Han+gun, Masta luke, and some scrubs at the tat docking, drainging for 2 (i’ll take the leader) and retrieving with celeb.  I move some scrubs and stuff with the sail barge infront of his crew.  Some battling goes by, i come out ahead because of some mega destinies, even with his bounce AND his dumb fallen portal.  Stupid Life Debt made me lose more than I wanted to.  I beat him up next turn, and outdrained him mostly, cause of me cancelling drains with Den of Thieves and MKOS.  <br/>
<br/>
FW + 22<br/>
8 +104<br/>
<br/>
I think i’m the only undefeated up to this point.  Turns out Ryan is also playing Yannicks insta beatdown auto win deck, both Ryan and Dave are doing crap with it.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
Al’s SICK MKOS vs Alexandre Alami’s (1952) TIGIH crap deck<br/>
I call it crap cause TIGIH IS crap, and i don’t know why he was playing it.  I begin my set up in the audience chamber, and he started getting mega force from staging areas and his objective.  He drops EPP obi on my audience chamber - Barrier.  Lando+axe comes to help... damn no barrier.  then Chewie Protector decided to join the crew too (he activated ALOT).  None Shall Pass that punk!  next turn, I REALLY lay out the hurt with things like Snoova and Axe, 4-lom + gun, and some other neat toys.  I cancelled obi’s text, excluded lando (not capture, i want more guys to battle), and then cancel his one destiny.  he lost obi and a bunch more..  Next turn, chewie comes in for some backup, and he made it in.  He runs.  I get some @#$% battles in, where i’d have like crap and he’d have more, but i’d get 3, him lose 1, so it would be worth it.  All this time, he’s draining me and i’m cancelling, and i’m draining.  I really outlasted him, and killed all his guys in jabba’s palace. <br/>
FW + 22<br/>
10 +126<br/>
<br/>
Well i think i’m almost guaranteed 1st after this now, everyone else has lost at least one game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
Al’s Pile WYS vs Andrew Wannop’s (1727) Stupid CCT Ties<br/>
	he starts CCT testing... WTF!!! who plays that stupid objective and frozen han!!  That’s the gayest thing i’ve ever heard of!  Well play commences, and melas moves into the prison first turn.  He drops Sienar, and drops the baron and ship to Tatooine... Dumb.  I free Han and send that pile of frozen crap outta play, so i can get han in space later...  I put some guys down and flip, and start madly drawing for ANY of my 2 falcons, and 2 hans.  well, two turns later after I watch 2 hans and a falcon lost to drains, I just go ’Sh!t’.  I threaten to GOO all over his crap ships, he’s now got the whole saber squad sittin’ up there.  I hit him with a lost grimtash, and see some evil goodies like a talon rool and stuff.  Dash + ship start chasing him around in space.. for all of one turn, then THEY were chased.  He used one dreadnaught to move an indomitable fleet in front of dash, who would then kindly run to his wussy fleet.  Order to Engage started to hit him, and my drains of 2, 1, 1, and 2 really added up.   <br/>
<br/>
FW + 21<br/>
12 +147<br/>
<br/>
So I win, and get the Imperial Decree foil... now i’m just missing Battle Order, Clash of Sabers, and Imperial Barrier.<br/>
<br/>
Justin placed really well, taking down both Alex and Ryan in his games, showing that even with his long absence, he still knows his stuff.  2nd place went 4-2, so everyone after me lost twice.  <br/>
The brownie works!!! Occasionally :)<br/>
I talked to Alex about hittin’ the tournament the next day out in Abbotsford, a 45 minute or so drive away.  I was planning on testing out my super secret teched out provincial deck there, and letting Alex in on it since he was running provincials and can’t play.<br/>
