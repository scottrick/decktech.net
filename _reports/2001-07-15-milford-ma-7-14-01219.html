<br>
      Well I knew that for the tournament I would not have to worry about Hayes Hunter, Steve Baroni, or Justin Desai because they were driving to Connecticut for a tournament. It was the tournament director’s last tournament before moving to California. Eric Hunter would be there and my brother was going as well so I figured they were my biggest competition.  <br>
     I have been struggling lately with my tournament performances and this is reflected in my rating’s loss of over 100 points in the past 3-4 tournaments.This tournament seemed like a good opportunity to get back on track.I arrived at the tournament with my brother and they started the tournament on time  with 10 or 12 people. My decks were hidden mains with OMDH for light and Ties with tallon rolls for dark. My rating going into the tournament was 1908.<br>
<br>
                      GAMES<br>
<br>
Game 1 My light vs. Kris Earle (1600s) Amidala-capturing Maul deck<br>
<br>
He started desert landing site and prepared defenses for I will find them quickly my master, secret plans, and HIs name is Anakin. Not much to this game really. He got out one other twix the whole game so he was force choked despite me giving him 4 icons. I took control of the tatoine system with captain han, GS1, corran horn, Wedge RSL, and RS1. I took control on the tat. db with ben and qui gon. menace fades, honor of the jedi, and harc seff took care of his drains at the desert landing site. so he had to come to me. We battled a lot but my superior activation and my bacta tank kept me in good shape while he kept losing cards. It was finally game when he dueled with sith fury and non epic vader’s obsession and I won the duel. Before the game was over I retrieved some force with OMDH.<br>

Game 2 My dark Vs. James Valeri (mid 1700’s) Bunker blow scout deck.<br>
<br>
Oh @#$%, for some reason I forgot about this deck when i made my tie deck. Very quick game and not in a good way. I didn’t get out sienar fleet system quicly enough and when it was in my hand, he blew up the bunker and i had to put it in my used pile. It took me a while to get it back out but by that time he was draining for 5 a turn had out I Hope She’s All right. my drains of 4 or 5 per turn were getting reduced by yoxgit retrieving devices to hand and him retrieving a scout once per turn. I got out Arica to block his drain of 3 but corran came right down.I had no dreadnaught to shuttle arica up to so I figured I’d go on a suicide mission with her since i had first strike out and he would just put down more scouts next turn to her location. The suicide mission cost me an extra 12 force but it was really unavoidable. I basically lost 7 a turn and he lost 3 from then on. I lose and his lost pile looks very small.<br>

Game 3 my light  vs. Jimmy Schiemer (1792) Old school hunt down without db’s and with plenty of visages.<br>
<br>
This was Jimmy’s first tournamet for a while so he was still getting back into it. Not much to this game either. We both took visage damage and when i set up battle plan and menace fades he had to pay to drain for 1 at his hoth and endor drain sites. He fought me a little but vader was stranded on hoth and I had 2 or 3 jedi at my tatoine db. we drained each other by 2 or 3 each turn but I retrieved a total of 19 force with 2 OMDH’s  and he couldn’t keep paying to drain. <br>

Game 4 my dark vs. ??? and his RTP podracing deck.<br>
<br>
Although i can’t remember his name, this guy is the man. He is just getting back into the game after a 3-4 year break but he is actually pretty decent. I blame the way the game went for him on the @#$%tyness of the RTP objective. Basically, I won the podrace with highd draws and sebulba’s pod and I cancelled most of his drains with dreaded imperial starfleet and U-3po. His space was limited so I had an unchallenged drain of 6-7 every turn. In the end I deployed all my ties and squadrons and retrieved most if not all of my lost pile. He unfortunately never flipped his objective. <br>

Game 5 My light vs. Michael Hawley (mid 1700’s) Old school hunt down.<br/>
<br/>
This deck did much better against me than my brothers.I thought I had the game won with menace fades, battle plan, and plenty of jedi but he played elis helrot and got a large amount of characters to face me at the tatoine db. He was also force choking me with secret plans and bad feeling have I so I couldn’t deploy mains and retrieve with OMDH the same turn. I was desperate for retrieval because visage and his drains of 1 or two had worn away my life force. We fought a lot at the tatoine docking bay but not much resulted from it.He then got mara at the CC downtown plaza and I had no mains in my hand ot fight her with. He also got off a few drains with Janus greejatus adn fett  in slave 1 at yodas hut before wedge in RS1 went down to block the drain for 2 turns. I though battle plan would have won me the game because he never went to challenge me at the tatoine system but i was wrong. the game timed out with Michael Hawley at 9 life force left and me at 7 life force left. <br/>

Game 6 My dark vs. Michael Hawley (mid 1700’s)using Hayes’ Brilliant pile deck.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty sure this was an auto win because at least in my experience of playtesting the pile, it was very weak vs. ties of any type or just space in general. Michael Hawley had  pretty similar if not an exact copy of Hayes’ deck. I got out merrejek to the war room i pulled from reserve deck and got kashyyyk out from reserve. The next turn when he played shocking information/grimtash on the war room I grabbed it making sure he’s never grimtash me and that merrejek would get out my systems. Merrejek got out 3 of the four systems before he was killed. I occupied a battleground system quickly so i pulled wakelimi and twilecked for sienar fleet systems. He sensed and altered my dreaded imperial starfleet and sienar fleet systems a few times but my there is no try/oppressive enforcement made them just go to used pile. I had plenty of twileck advisors so I just got them out again. He couldn’t get out his space so his battle plan hurt him more than me. He had to pay for his drains to be cancelled by dreaded imperial starfleet while i controlled the D* db with 2 ties and drained for 4-6 a turn in space. In the end he got out falcon and tried to drain at the D* but my squadron in hand and my tie on dreaded imperial starfleet took out its pilot.I drain him out.<br/>
