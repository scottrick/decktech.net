<blockquote><font class="bfont"> NJ Open Qualifier  Dark Tower Games <br>
August 14, 2004 <br>
<br>
Directors Report<br>
<br>
So being this is a directors report, I wanted to personally thank everyone from coming to the event.  It was definitely a success with 27 people.  We had players from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and even two guys from Germany (Enno and Chris Menzel).  Players like Frank Walsh and Joe Gagliardi came back and played for the first time in over a year (and had good success later in the event as the rust wore off.)<br>
<br>
I wont go into the details because that is for the players to write in their tournament reports but one of favorite moves of the day was someone playing the Observation Holocam (go read it).  There was definitely a diverse array of decks for the light side with 15 distinct versions of decks.  While the dark side was more limited with only 13 decktypes. (5 were IO(V) and 5 were CCT) but everyone had the chance to play against very different decks.<br>
<br>
The final results after 6 games are posted below but Greg Shaw ended up winning the prizes after the players decided to avoid the final confrontation and Mike awarded Greg with the grand prize of designing a virtual card. <br>
<br>
There were some issues with the prize support (and the USPS) but everything should correct itself in the next week or so.   I also wanted to personally thank Chris Gogolen for donating a box of WB Premiere that he had found in his home.  Every bit helps out Chris!<br>
<br>
One important note:  Someone left their cards in a small white card box at the store.  I picked them up and have them, so if you can name the contents, they will be on their way back to you.<br>
