7/1/2000:  Sea Girt NJ<br/>
<br/>
I drive a little farther than usual for this one, but I am looking forward to seeing the NJ guys and losing miserably to them!!  Some of the details are sketchy due to my lack of sleep and the fact that it was yesterday, so bash away.<br/>
<br/>
My Decks:   	DS:  Set Course variant with manipulation   rather than certain death to planets<br/>
	   	LS:  NSB/EBO with EPP&amp;#8217;s<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  Andrew Roberts &amp;#8220;Rescue the Princess&amp;#8221; deck.  <br/>
<br/>
	This was an interesting game.  With me using the Death Star locations it slowed him down a bit, but he was never able to get Leia back to Yavin.  I took out many of his characters with Scanning Crew and M&amp;#8217;iiyoom and a couple of Monnoks took out DSP and some other interrupts he needed to pull that off.  There were no real decisive battles or actions this game, it was basically a drain race (me in space, him wherever he could do it.  FW by 13.   2(13)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  Thomas Hermley Keene&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Rallops&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	In the 9 months I&amp;#8217;ve known Tom, he has become an excellent player.  Rallops has become a popular and powerful deck, and he worked this one well.  I was able to get EBO up on turn 2, with strong space presence by turn 3.  A few battles ensued in space, but it was that +3 to his attrition that made the difference in the long run.  FL by 10,  2(3)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  Steve Fanning&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;CC Occupation, Trooper Assault, Dark Deal&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	Steve was able to make a strong presence on Cloud City early, and I did not get any EPP&amp;#8217;s out early, but I was able to get a strong space presence by turn 4.  He hit me for Occupation twice for 4 each, but I beat up his ships in an epic battle at Bespin System, forcing him to land Boba in S1 with Vader on Could City and canceling CC Occ..   At this point I was watching trooper assaults leaving his hand for drains and I was reluctant to face him on CC, in a heated drain race for 2 turns, I shuttled EPP Han and NH Chewbacca to a CC site to block a drain of 2 and I also landed 2 x-wings (with incom corp bonus) at a site to block another drain of 2.  HE did not have enough to deploy or fight after that, and I won a close one.  FW by 5,  4(8)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  James Falco&amp;#8217;s Tat. Celebration Mains and Toys deck<br/>
<br/>
	A scanning crew&amp;#8217;s dream.  I kept most of the mains out of his hand  and off the table for most of the game.  There was some token resistance to my Bounty Hunter ships and Mara and Vader on the table, but overall it was my game.  FW (10),  6(18)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  Chris Gogolen&amp;#8217;s Clakdor Speeder Ops deck<br/>
<br/>
	Bah.  I hate ops.  This is a fast deck and without any rebels to scan away and not getting my vader and alter in my opening hand (to kill Yarna) I was screwed.  He got all his stuff out fast and I could not make any headway against the operative/speeder speed.  How many Vader&amp;#8217;s do you need?  FL by 22, 6(-4)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  Chris Gogolen&amp;#8217;s Set Course/Insert deck<br/>
<br/>
	Pure Evil Genius!!!!  I loved this deck!!  When I say Tech M&amp;#8217;or and some stupid astromech go to the DS: War Room, I was stoked!!!  I activated very little to get Toryn Farr and an Incom Engineer out, still working towards a 3rd turn EBO and space presence.  This  slowed the first insert (loss of 3), but when I deployed Jeroen Webb and EPP Han to the War room, Han got Barriered and then he put another astromech and insert in.  I was debating whether or not to Deploy Wioslea somewhere just to boost up my numbers total, but I felt I had to be more aggressive.  Oh well.  He was able to slow my space down with Zuckuss in MH and the rest of the Bounty Hunter&amp;#8217;s space Guild and a few capital starships.  An enjoyable person to play with and he ended up winning the tournament.  FL by 22, 6(-26).<br/>
<br/>
So Chris wins, Steve Brentson (who arrived late and got a 0(0) thanks to &amp;#8220;shore traffic&amp;#8221;) goes 4-1 and comes in second if memory serves, with Mike Daulton coming in 3rd.<br/>
<br/>
7/2/2000:  Mazz Cards, Clarks Summit PA<br/>
<br/>
So I pick up my faithful padawan Bart Robinson on the way home from Sea Girt (what the hell is a Girt anyway) and I tell him what went wrong with my decks and we sit down and play a few games to tweak out the junk.  We watched taped episodes of SG-1 and then played a marathon Austin Powers game(&amp;#8220;yeah. Baby!!&amp;#8221;)  Jared Napolitano arrives at my place at about 8:45am the next day, we pick up newcomer Chris Curcio at 9:15, then we are on our way up the Northeast Extention for 2 hours to Clarks Summit.  We are greeted by the ever-so-popular Joe Gagliardi, Bart and Chris play DBZ for a while, I buy the X-men CCG and check it out and our first games begin at about 12:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
Decks:  Same as yesterday with a handful of cards swapped out. (added a Mara, scanning crew, Secret Plans, torture, took out a dangerous time (s) and 1 alter and the tyrant, changed some systems around so that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t trap myself)  LS added Don&amp;#8217;t forget the droids and Oola, took out R2 in Red 5 (useless in 6 games so far) and one incom engineer.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  Frank Walsh&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Hunt Down&amp;#8221; deck<br/>
<br/>
	I got EBO up on turn 2 and made my presence known in space on turn 3.  He goes to Cloud City and DS docking bay and drains for 2 and 1.  I go to drain him for 3 at hoth and he slaps Imperial Propaganda down there.  I&amp;#8217;m screwed&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;I become tentative about draining anywhere despite having Coruscant, Kiffex, and Kessel in my hand.  He does the slow drain and BH ships to thin my space fleet, and I don&amp;#8217;t get any EPP&amp;#8217;s early enough to attack Mara Jade and Dr. E or Vader and Tarkin.  At the end I go for broke to at least save the differential and put out the other systems, but he ends up popping a 2nd and 3rd Imp Prop on me to end the game.  FL by 17, 0(-17)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  Brian Canady&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Profit&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	He should have schooled me.  I deploy Mara and M&amp;#8217;iiyoom as my &amp;#8220;2 aliens&amp;#8221; hoping to protect my favorite wall decoration.  He is playing all aliens, masta luke, and Ariel Schous.  It took some time to thin out his numbers at the AC, but Mara survived the whole game.  I manipped all of his unique characters away and drained in space with the BH crew.  FW by 17, 2(0).<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  Bart Robinson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Pain in the ASP&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	Been there did that.  We playtested this on Saturday night and we each knew what we needed to do.  Basically this is Jared Napolitano&amp;#8217;s Coruscant Regional Deck.  You start Chirpa&amp;#8217;s Hut and Careful Planning the Swamp and Forest, play ASP&amp;#8217;s and Ewok Catapults to line up 7 destiny&amp;#8217;s during your turn.  He also uses mains and Toys to drain and fight (with the above-mentioned 7 destiny&amp;#8217;s sitting on top of his reserve deck).  I manipulate all of his crucial characters away and he never makes any headway.  He did kill Mara once and Vader 3 times (&amp;#8220;Why don&amp;#8217;t you DIE!!!!!&amp;#8221;), draining in space and not looking back.  FW by 17 (notice the pattern?)  4(17).<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  Bart Robinson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Set Course/manip&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	See above report.  The cool thing here was he got Mara and Vader running around under my shield early, but could not pull them out of there when I bailed from Hoth. (no lie, I had no characters there and I drained at all my space locations.  I was trying to figure out why he didn&amp;#8217;t try to cancel EBO, but it just never panned out for him.  My space drains killed him.  FW by 10, 6(27)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  Jared Napolitano&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Pain in the ASP&amp;#8221; deck.<br/>
<br/>
	He got Pucymir out early his drains hurt and he had &amp;#8220;Do or Do Not out early.  I never got &amp;#8220;Come here you Big Coward out (would have won the game otherwise).  He grabbed my scanning crew&amp;#8217;s and monnoks and he Shocked M&amp;#8217;iiyoom.  I guess I was asking for it!!  FL by 5, 6(22)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  Jared Napolitano&amp;#8217;s Rallops deck<br/>
<br/>
I drive 120 miles and 4 of my 6 games are carmates!!  There was no Imperial Propaganda to worry about, but he got his objective flipped and resistance out the same time I had EBO up and running.  It was basically a drain race until he mustered his BH ships to the skies and was adding 4 to each of his destiny draws.  I did not get any EPP&amp;#8217;s out to attack him despite mondo force generation.  They stayed safely anonymous in my reserve deck and went during the steady drains at Raltiir.  Fl by 14.  6(8).<br/>
<br/>
Frank Walsh beat Joe Gagliardi in games 5 and 6 to win, Jared came in 2nd, Joe 3rd, Bart 5th, Me 6th, Chris 7th.  If we hadn&amp;#8217;t gone it would not have been sanctioned, as there were only 10 participants.  You owe me one Ziagos!!!  Even Matt &amp;#8220;Snoova&amp;#8221; made an appearance and joined us for lunch!!  He is truly the &amp;#8220;Whore of Coruscant&amp;#8221;!!  He donated cards as prizes so that we&amp;#8217;d like him or something even though he doesn&amp;#8217;t play anymore  (just kidding!)  <br/>
<br/>
Once again, Joe Gagliardi entertained the troops with his playful "NC-17" antics and sugar overdose.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks for reading&amp;#8230; Bash away and I&amp;#8217;ll see you at Origins!!<br/>
