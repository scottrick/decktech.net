<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Continued from part 3 of the Enduro tourney.  See the previous<br/>
TRs before you read this one.  Now I had a tough decision to <br/>
make.  Do I change decks before the 4th quarter?  My EBO was <br/>
5-1 and my FlOps was 3-3, giving me a score of 16 (+139). <br/>
Maybe I should use my Court or Hunt Down deck?  Well, I figure<br/>
I’ll probably never again play FlOps after this, so I’ll see if<br/>
I can give it a good finish.  I only saw 1 Scum deck at all, so<br/>
I decided against Profit and stuck with EBO.  I want to go 4-0<br/>
this quarter to have a shot at 2nd or 3rd place.  Paul is in<br/>
1st (he’s 11-1), Kevin is 2nd (10-2).  So its past 4 AM when we<br/>
start the 4th quarter.....the homestretch.  I can hear my bed<br/>
calling me......"go to sleep".....that’s what its saying.  But<br/>
I play on.  Oh yeah, and sorry Mason about that barrier on<br/>
Tempest 1 last TR.  I guess we were too tired to notice that. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v James Weldon’s TIGIH (Squassin,Insurr,StrikePlan)<br/>
<br/>
I get Imperial Fleet to cancel his drain with Luke every turn.<br/>
We both lose to Visage all game.  I retrieve w/SFS though, he<br/>
has no retrieval.  2nd turn he puts Wedge in ship at my <br/>
Kashyyyk.  My 3rd turn I Lateral Damage Wedge, drop 2 TIE<br/>
Interceptors and Emp Sword, battle, and play APTW.  He loses<br/>
them plus 14 more force.  Next turn I get FlOps on a VSD.<br/>
Later, I have 2 Interceptors at Kiffex and he drops Gold Squad<br/>
1 there w/Nien and Gen Lando.  Battle, I react w/Emp Shield &amp;<br/>
play APTW.  He loses 9 rather than forfeit a pilot.  Next turn,<br/>
I drop a SFS cannon and just blast the Falcon away, not wanting<br/>
to risk a Punch It! or whatever else he might have had.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Imperial Fleet is still cancelling all his Endor drains <br/>
since he keeps all his guys at the Endor DB. He’s got DOS,Luke,<br/>
Midge, and Crix there.  I move Piett, Gherent, &amp; Merrejk over<br/>
after deploying 2 Interceptors to the endor DB.  So Piett <br/>
captures Luke, and he battles me.  I send a TIE used, and kill<br/>
Midge.  I’m losing 2 force to TIGIH, but I’ve cards in hand &amp;<br/>
I want to get TIEs to my used pile.  After killing Crix, the <br/>
drains finish him off.  Win by 31.  2 (+31).<br/>
<br/>
Best: FlOps actually winning some ground battles!<br/>
Worst: Losing 2 per turn to I Can Save Him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v Nghia Nguyen’s HDADTJ (IAO, Mob Pts, Crush)<br/>
<br/>
Damn, I hate those Evader/Monnoks!  He gets me early (like 4th<br/>
turn) for 2 xwings and 2 organized Attacks.  I needed the Org<br/>
Attacks.  I started Insight, Wise Advice, &amp; Battle PLan.  I<br/>
pulled HoTJ w/Insight 1st turn, and it protected me until the<br/>
8th turn or so.  He Twi’leked for No Escape, but it was one of<br/>
his 3 active force!  Huge for me.  So EBO gets going by the 4th<br/>
turn, and i setup the big drains.  He deploys DLOTS and Mara<br/>
to his CC DB w/POTF.  Boushh blocks that drain.  I deploy Comm<br/>
Luke in Rogue 1 to my North Ridge, so he’s losing to Visage &amp;<br/>
I’m not.  Comm Wedge backs him up.  Unfortunately for me, he<br/>
drops Responsibilty of Command and Much Anger In Him on Luke,<br/>
then Tempest 1 and Igar aboard.  So I lose 4 force (should’ve<br/>
only lost 2 cuz of HoTJ), and quickly go cancel Responsibility<br/>
while he flips Hunt Down again.<br/>
<br/>
Now No Escape is out, and Visage is hitting me hard.  Luke gets<br/>
back to the ridge though, so we’re both losing.  Zev in Rogue 2<br/>
heads to the Ridge to back up his flight leader.  Nghia drops<br/>
Thrawn &amp; Jodo to the Ridge and battles.  He gets 2 5’s for <br/>
destiny, so Zev in Rogue 2 goes down in flames (good thing Luke<br/>
adds 1 to Zev’s forfeit or I’d have to lose another guy!).  We <br/>
are both getting low on force, and he realizes he needs to get<br/>
rid of my big drains in space.  So he moves Tempest 1 to the<br/>
1st marker.  Next turn, Fett in Slave 1 comes to Hoth &amp; lands.<br/>
I should’ve barriered it cuz I had 5 xwings at Hoth.  Dumb.  <br/>
The guys on Tempest 1 disembark.  Jodo flies into Echo Base, <br/>
cancels Incom.  Thrawn (who was at the DB, now moves into the<br/>
War Room.  Igar disembarks and moves to the DB.  So EBO is<br/>
cancelled.  Tempest 1 then moves over to Fett at the Ridge.  I<br/>
beat them down next turn, and drain for measly amounts now.<br/>
<br/>
But Visage is still hitting us both.  We have the *exact* amount<br/>
of force now.  8 force left.  I have Comm Luke and Rogue 3 at<br/>
the North Ridge (Luke’s not in it though), he has Tempest 1 w/<br/>
Thrawn in it.  I battle, and pray to god he doesn’t draw a 6, <br/>
cuz then I’d have to lose Luke and it’d be game.  He draws a 5,<br/>
I draw a 5, so Thrawn dies and Rogue 3 dies.  Now Tempest 1 gets<br/>
no battle destiny, he has no cards in hand, and I get that drain<br/>
at the North Ridge to lock the game up.  Win by 2 force!<br/>
4 (+33).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Great game against a great player.  I was proud of my EBO<br/>
deck in that one.<br/>
Worst: Could’ve barriered Fett to prevent EBO getting cancelled.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Dan Mochizuki’s WYS (Insur, Staging, Squassin)<br/>
<br/>
My last game w/FlOps for this tourney.  And its against Dan, who<br/>
is a great player.  He cancels Visage early on (3rd turn I <br/>
think) w/ an OOC/TT.  I get Piett, who pulls Gherent, who pulls<br/>
Exec sites for me.  He deploys Capt Han in Falcon, plus Mirax &amp;<br/>
a Palace Raider in the Skate to Tatooine where I have Dominator<br/>
w/FlOps on it along with 2 Interceptors.  I react w/Emp’s<br/>
Sword, play APTW, then send a TIE used.  Next turn, I drop a<br/>
SFS cannon on a TIE, battle, play APTW, blast the Skate away,<br/>
&amp; he loses Falcon plus a few more.  He lost several ships off<br/>
the top.  He never deployed to space after that.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he proceeds to deploy I Hope She’s Alright.  Not <br/>
that card again!  Ok, I *have* to occupy a BG site to win this<br/>
game.  I move Gherent and Piett to his Spaceport DB where he has<br/>
Lando w/gun and a Raider on a Patrol Craft.  I also deploy 2<br/>
TIEs to soak some damage.  Well, he drops OTE and battles, <br/>
leaving me with a TIE and Gherent there.  Well, now I have to<br/>
battle him or lose 3, so I battle, he Fallen Portals Gherent.<br/>
So I’ve got the lone TIE against Lando &amp; a Raider in Craft.  <br/>
But do you really think I battled him if I didn’t have a Ghhk?<br/>
I ain’t no dummy!  So i play Ghhhk, and spread in space.  Next <br/>
turn I deploy some TIEs to retrieve my guys.  His drains are <br/>
virtually for zero.  U-3PO is at the Cantina w/Master Luke w/<br/>
saber.  Imperial Fleet cancels his drain of Owen and Beru at<br/>
the Farm.  He had done 3 Harvests to retrieve his ships, but<br/>
the Harvests went OOP due to my Something Special Planned.  <br/>
Then he’s got the drain at his 2 DBs, one of which gets <br/>
cancelled occasionally by Tarkin’s Orders.  My drains are big.<br/>
<br/>
I’ve got Kashyyyk, Sullust, Tatooine (Chiraneau there), Kiffex,<br/>
and Rendili.  So I’ve got it locked.  But I’ve got a lot on the<br/>
table and I Hope She’s Alright makes it closer than it <br/>
otherwise would have been.  Win by 11.  6 (+44).<br/>
<br/>
Best: FlOps going 2-0!  I can possibly go 4-0 this quarter!<br/>
Worst: I Hope She’s Alright!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Paul McKelvey’s ISB (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)<br/>
<br/>
What a disheartening matchup.  ISB usually tears up EBO, and<br/>
Paul had done *extremely* well w/his ISB deck today.  He told<br/>
me its overall record was like 40-2 (since ISB came out).  I<br/>
start ANSB to get a quick start, and hope for the best.  After<br/>
I get EBO going (on 3rd turn), he gets an ORS and ATST at Yavin <br/>
4 DB and North Ridge.  Then I drain him, but he says Decree is<br/>
in effect.  I tell him to read ANSB, and he says sorry, he <br/>
forgot about that.  No prob, it was almost 8 AM now anyway and<br/>
we had all been up for over 24 hours.  The I draw some speeders<br/>
which I desperately needed to prevent him from overrunning Echo<br/>
Base.  Rogue Squadron mobilizes and Wedge and Luke hop in Rogue 3<br/>
while Zev and Hobbie hop in Rogue 2 (why can’t Rogue 2 react?!).<br/>
<br/>
He’s got Decree going, and his objective is flipped.  I had<br/>
deployed Boushh to Yavin 4 DB (the turn before he lost Nevar<br/>
whatever from hand...the card that makes spies go lost if they<br/>
are with your spy), and she followed wherever they went.  During<br/>
one of his drains I lose HoTJ off the top.  Damn!  Could’ve <br/>
killed the drains under the shield!  He tries adding to his <br/>
drains under the shield, but I remind him they aren’t BG sites.<br/>
So there are some battles under the shield as Rogue Squad is<br/>
defending Hoth.  It was cool....since he was using ATATs and <br/>
ATSTs.  But I had 5 xwings at Hoth (power +5 in Hoth battles)<br/>
&amp; I was immune to whatever attrition he drew.<br/>
<br/>
So slowly his forces on Hoth were dwindling. After I drew Battle<br/>
Plan, I moved Rogue Squad to the North Ridge to drain for free.<br/>
He had DLOTS w/saber in my interior sites, so he cancelled EBO<br/>
and also moved his guys out to the North Ridge.  I deployed <br/>
Rogue 3 and moved Wedge aboard it.  At this point he had 2 ORS, <br/>
Blizzard 1, and Blizzard Scout 1 at the North Ridge.  Plus DLOTS<br/>
w/saber draining at my War Room.  That’s all that was on Hoth.<br/>
He had Tarkin &amp; an ORS at his Endor Forest Clearing.  On my<br/>
turn, TK-422 blocked that drain, Boushh broke cover and battled<br/>
where he had an ORS and ATST (only ability 1 though).  So she<br/>
cleared that site.  Then I battled at the North Ridge.  My power<br/>
was 31 to his 18 or so (I had moved almost all my xwings to Hoth)<br/>
so he lost Blizzard 1 and both ORS.  Rogue Squad was victorious.<br/>
Plus it was funny cuz he had 1st Strike on table and since I<br/>
had battled I retrieved EBO!  I could set it up again!  lol.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, a few drains later and that was game.  Win by 22.  <br/>
8 (+66).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Beating ISB!  I was damn proud of my EBO in that game.<br/>
Worst: Losing HoTJ off the top.<br/>
<br/>
40 people showed to Enduro, but only 32 went through to the end.<br/>
Its past 8 AM, I don’t remember exactly what time though.  Paul<br/>
went 4-0, so he finishes at 15-1.  Kevin lost once, so he <br/>
finishes at 13-3.  I’m 12-4 with a score of 24 (+205).  But <br/>
there are others who are 12-4, and I don’t know how good my <br/>
differential is compared to theirs.  So as the prizes are being<br/>
handed out I listen for my name.....<br/>
<br/>
5th place......Dan Mochizuki<br/>
4th place......Alfred Dong<br/>
3rd place......me!<br/>
Paul takes 1st and Kevin takes 2nd.<br/>
<br/>
The top 3 got a framed Enduro award, the top 2 got tshirts, and <br/>
Paul got a Mara Jade foil and Mara’s Saber foil.  The top 3<br/>
also got other cards.  I don’t remember what they got, but I<br/>
got a RL in R1, GL in G1, Rogue 1 foil, &amp; Bravo 1 card, all <br/>
signed by the respective Decipher employees.  Plus I got an<br/>
EPP Leia foil box topper, and a reflections 2 pack.  Pulled <br/>
Xizor and Dr E./Ponda combo.  And I got a $10 certificate to <br/>
buy stuff, but everything was sold out, so I bought some <br/>
sleeves.  Thanks for reading.  Now for the props/slops.<br/>
