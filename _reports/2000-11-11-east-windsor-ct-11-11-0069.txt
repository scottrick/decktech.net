<blockquote><font class="bfont"> All right, I will start out by telling you that this will not be a long report, as we only played 4 games. My decks are Dark, standard ISB (you can see it, It’s titled Inasanely Stupid Badgers (ISB), please rate it.) And my Light is EBO with Squadron Assignments ( it is also on decktech, called Alle personell: Build EBO Now.)  So I arrive at the Tournament, and My brother and I are the only people that have signed up so far.  So that is bad, but I am used to it by now, because we are 20 minutes early, and no one comes until about start time anyway around here. Eventually 4 more people show up, but that’s it. I didn’t expect too many people, but we ussually get more than 6.  Anyways, I do a little trading, make last minute changes to my decks, and get the first pairings.<br>
<br>
Game 1: ISB vs. Garrett ?’s Hidden Base/Kessel Run<br>
I draw my hand, and see that I have Endor and Executor in it, plus a bunch of agents. First turn, I get endor Docking Bay and then Draw.  He gets Gen.’s Solo and Crix, then activates, deploys endor from deck, and says go.  My turn, I am getting like 4 force total because of strike planning, so I get a docking bay and put 2 ORS’ at the Endor DB, and say go. He deploys raltir from deck, and then puts a bunch of ships at the Rendezvous point. I now activate +2 because of Mob. Points, so I drain and put a few more agents down, flip my obj.  He just keeps getting systems, and putting ships at Rend. point, but doesn’t move them over to drain.  I keep draining him for four a turn, later adding a walker with agents and mara w/lightsaber at hoth, and vader w/lightsaber and an agent at yavin, rasing my drains to ten a turn. He finnally moves his ships over to drain, flips and plays kessel run on a freighter captain, but he can’t keep up with me, so I win.<br>
FW: 28<br>
Record: 2 (+28)<br>
<br>
Highs: Pretty much everything<br>
Lows: Pretty much nothing<br>
<br>
Turns out that everyone Dark side won, so the top players can’t play each other.<br>
<br>
Game 2: EBO vs. Nick Ares’ Court non-flip.<br>
I get The Signal in my starting hand, so I’m happy, because I’ll be able to get Squassi out first turn.  HIs turn, he doesn’t put anyone at tatooine, so he has to lose one. It’s Iggy with gun.  I out of commission, and get Iggy. So i’ve got a good start, with Iggy out of the way, and i activate three, play signal.  After looking through my deck, not only is squadron ass. not there, but no other effects are there but my projections, which are ussless because of Hutt influence! Well, thats bad, but i put down the echo sites and draw.  He puts down Mara with saber and mosep from deck at the audience chamber.  Next turn I put down EBO, but don’t have enough force to do anything else.  He drains, and adds 4-LOM with gun at the chamber.  My turn, I drop EPP luke to the chamber, battle and swing at 4-LOM. I get a 1 and a 1. Just my luck.  I draw a five battle destiny, but that doesn’t matter because of court he can just forfiet 4-LOM, and Mosep stays. I don’t know why I didn’t swing at mosep, I guess i wasn’t thinking.  On his turn, he plays Bossk and Dengar in ships to Kiffex. I put Wedge, RSL and tree other pilots in ships at the system, battle.  I draw a 1, he draws a 1 and a 2, which is cancelled.  I lose a pilot to the bacta tank, he loses dengar in ship.  His turn he plays Fett in ship, and moves bossk to fett’s system.  My turn I deploy a bunch more and move to to the system where he is (sullust).  I then look at bossk’s hyperspeed, and see that he couldn’t have made it there, but oh well, now he can’t escape.  He drops some guys to the Great Pit, and now his drains are 3 from reserve, and 1 from court, and I starting to hurt.  He doesn’t do anything else, and says go. I drop a ton of ships to sullust, and battle.  I hit him for everything, plus 21 more. He now has like 9 life force, so i just spread and drain.<br>
FW: 6<br>
Record: 4 (+34)<br>
<br>
Highs: 21 force battle, OOC his Iggy.<br>
Lows: Missing 4-LOM, not getting Squadron Ass.<br>
<br>
There are 3 undefeated playes now, and I have the lowest diff, so I just have to hop that the dark sid player (my brother) wins, so then I can play him, and not have to rely on winnig by a lot.<br>
<br>
Game 3: EBO vs. MIke ?’s Court non-flip.<br>
I had already had this macthup, so I no I can win.  He sets up fast, with Galid and Jabba at the audience chamber, and Fett and some other people at the Great Pit.  I get EBO out 3rd turn, and Drop Capt. Han/falcon and some other pilot at kiffex, and Independence with a pilot at sullust. I don’t like losing to court, and he doesn’t seem to have too much ground, so I send EPP luke to the tatooine docking bay, and transfer guys from hoth over. He sends chimaera and a pilot at the independence, battles.  I don’t draw high enough so that he needs to lose the pilot, buthe decides to instead oflosing force. I lose the pilot.  On my turn, I send down some ships to deal with chimaera, and hit him for that plus six. Then I move a couple ships to my remainig system, and it’s his turn.  He drains for some, but forgets to drain at the dungeon (he has Galid out). He moves fett and some abysins over to lukes site.  I still drain him for ten, and he doesn’t have much left.  I battle hit an abyssin(a 1 and a 5,I would’ve hit Fett) , and take out another with battle destiny. He drains for 2 (forgetting dungeon again), which i lose from hand, and battles Luke.  I hit Fett (3 and a 4), draw a 5 for destiny, and clear his site.  Next turn I drain him out.<br>
FW: 17<br/>
Record: 6 (+51)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Pretty much everything<br/>
Lows: Petty much nothing<br/>
<br/>
My brother won his game so I will play him. He is the only person there that really had a chance of beating me, but as I had just beat him a few times with my ISB, I wasn’t too scared.<br/>
<br/>
ISB vs. Tom Hollingworth’s Profit<br/>
I start Mara and chall bekan, getting and ORS with Chall. First turn I get Executor, put down 2 ORS’ and some other agent at the audience chamber, flip. I then get Mara’s saber from my deck, and deploy the endor DB.  First thing he does is put R-3PO at audience chamber(I HATE THAT CARD!), then saves up.  So I activate, put Vader w/saber at the chamber, and move mara and my agents out. He just saves force for the next couple of turns, and chases me around with R-3PO, while I drain and add agents at the Mara’s site.  He now has like 40 force, but I am not really scared, because I have Stunnig leader and Ghhhk in my hand, so I drop a walker and some agents at the endor DB. His turn, he plays Ben Kenobi w/saber, Jedi Luke w/saber and Proficiency, Chewbacca, Gen. Solo, and Niem Numb, battles. I play stunning leader, which ends the battle right there.  My turn I Move vader out to JP, move Mara and Crew to the next site ovet (Jundland wastes, I think), and I move one Agent into the JP:AC.  He battles, I ghhhk.  He flips, retrives, and moves a couple of people to Vader’s site. I put Tarkin and an agent at the Hoth DB, and Move all my people on tatooine another site away, and transfer my people at endor to Yavin, so I can fullfill decree.  He can’t drain because of decree and my objective, so i am just losing to profit, which isn’t much, because they were all at one site from when he tried to beat down vader.  I just stay away from him and drain for 7 every turn, and easily win.<br/>
FW: 27<br/>
Record: 8 (+78)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Seeing the look on his face when I played stunning leader, god that was funny.<br/>
Lows: Nothing, everything went my way this game.<br/>
<br/>
So I won The tournament, and I got great Prizes. $24 cash, 4 packs of Reflections, and 5 Packs of CC. All that and there were only 6 people.  My Bother (Tom) got second, so He got $6 cash, 3 Reflections, 4 CC. And here is the part that makes me wish I had lost that last game.  My brother opens his first pack of reflections, and he gets a DARTH VADER FOIL!  If only I had lost that last game, I would have got that. Oh well, you can’t get everything to go your way. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
