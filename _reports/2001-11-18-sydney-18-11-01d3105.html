<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">PRE TOURNEY: Yeah, another tournament Report, but as long as I keep winning them I&amp;#8217;ll keep posting them. oh yeah we got 10 ppl. Not so bad a turn out. Decks? ok for Light I&amp;#8217;m still using my QMC- a place for tech deck. It&amp;#8217;s just that damn good. Seriously. I mean top players like Luke barter and tyng are making changes to their decks just to beat me. For example both these guys dropped captain Bewil on me to prevent my characters using PATH to bounce around Cloud city. They probably got the idea from my No R3 Dark Deal deck. Speaking of which it was no.1 on both the NoR3 list and the top 10 decks until 2 cok sucks came along and gave it a half star for no reason! That pissed me off a fair bit. Oh well. Rate it highly if you haven&amp;#8217;t already. I&amp;#8217;ll return the favor.<br/>
	After posting my Dark deck was posted for you good D/T people to see, I decided to change to another D deck. Senate. Senate is without doubt the most solid dark deck there is at the moment. My version is a good bit different to the random super maul crap that gets thrown around here. As usual I opt for the more &amp;#8216;tech&amp;#8217; variant, rather using one of everything than trying to turn one character into a super main. Once again I must thank Martin Falke for his help and discussions of the finer tuning of this senate deck. He is the man.<br/>
 i love senate cause it has all the good bits of the old JP decks COURT and MKOS. like cancel drains, add to battle destiny, add to drains, weak characters giving your deck all sorts of sweet bonuses(activation, destiny manip., pulling cards, attrition) and an interrupt that retrieves and pulls the characters u need.(was abyssin ornament now squabbling delegates)Unfortunately I had to use a proxy &amp;#8216;This is Outrageous&amp;#8217; all day. I would have been worse had not Luke batter lent me a &amp;#8216;motion supported&amp;#8217;. Thanks dude. Ok on with the games.<br/>
<br/>
GAME1: my QMC plague deck VS Lisa west&amp;#8217;s DS Senate<br/>
 It really isn&amp;#8217;t much fun playing Lisa cause a soon as she starts losing (which was pretty early in this game) she gets kinda sh1tty. Nothing major, I think she just gives up. Any way she set up in the senate flips and drew. I was fairly certain she had none of the cards necessary to really hurt me so decided to just drop and drain real quick and make short game of it. I drew looking for a second ship( I wasn&amp;#8217;t stupid I mean zuckuss could still hurt kier santage or mirax). In her second turn she did nothing note worthy.<br/>
 I think I save for a further turn. She did nothing. So I deploy to bespin and sites and flip. I looked for a path , there was none so moved the weak characters (pucumir, harc seff) to the safety of the upper plaza walkway. From here on end I set up celebration and some drains, which she couldn&amp;#8217;t cancel, which pretty much opened up a force gap that she was unable to close. 	Maul (deploy+3), Lord Vader(deploy+3) and Dre(deploy+1) eventually came but I pathed around and when she spread, Obi Wan EPP cleared a site. I retrieved what I lost with a blind edge. Sorry but that&amp;#8217;s just about all that happened.<br/>
FW +33<br/>
2 +33<br/>
Highs: big win<br/>
Lows: not the best game I&amp;#8217;ve ever played. (don&amp;#8217;t worry that still to come)^_^<br/>
<br/>
GAME2: JP style Senate VS Giseppie Sterelie&amp;#8217;s TRM (card for card hunter&amp;#8217;s deck)<br/>
Well do I know the pain of playing a deck that every man and his dog knows inside out. Back in the Australian continentals I was playing an almost exact copy of Hunter&amp;#8217;s I hate H/D hidden base deck. I also had a Dark deck that made champions(it went undefeated over 2 days by the way). Anyway I had won 3 games and going into round 4 I met Adam Amy and his Black Sun race jizz deck J he&amp;#8217;ll smile when he remembers this one. He knew everything I had and just waited of the right time to layeth the smack down on me (ie. It&amp;#8217;s Worse for 26!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I still have nightmares.(nah good game mate) see my continental TR for full details. <br/>
Ok back to present day events Giseppie is a semi regular player here, I&amp;#8217;ve never played him b4 but I know him and his brother. He started the game casue of his Massassi throne room and set about deploying the jedi council via SWTC and pulled a db. I knew that activation would be tight so I grabbed lott dod with a copy of delegates and depoyed him and yebyeb. Giseppie pulled 3-po and deployed liea to the home one db for more force. He was activating a shyteload. I pulled SE coruscant from force pile used my obj. to pull 2 cards from his hand and deployed a db of me own. My opponent did little in his turn apart from deploying quigon to my db. I thought this was an odd move as the deck should be played very reactively.      <br/>
     Apparently giseppie had missed the point of the deck as through the game he rarely attacked me in force opting instead to try and out drain me. I deployed tat system and then kashyyyk. Captain solo on his falcon came to tatooine but got beat down by zuckuss and slave 1 (within +3 to b/destiny). The game was pretty much over then and there. Later on I drained for 4 in space while epp vader cleared his site and P-59, Rune and 4-lom picked apart a larger force. First strike+rune= retrieve 2 cards each battle. I drained him out soon after.<br/>
FW+27<br/>
4+60<br/>
Highs: first game for my senate was a big win<br/>
Lows: none to speak of really<br/>
<br/>
GAME3: Senate VS Clarrie Brown&amp;#8217;s Duel of the Fates<br/>
Yeah I expected this to see a lot of play around here, what with all the new quigons and obiwans everyone wants to play with. I deploy lott dod and tikkes for the first turnm flip. He drops quigon to the naboo gen. core. Lott pulls my systems. Palpy and janus go to the mos espa db(not that they could drain the whole game). He drains. Drops obi. Now time for the Anti-Super mains strategy. Instead of the load of mauls everyone uses in a senate deck, I use only 1, but 3 vaders. These are for suicide runs on the super mains. Also the tech part is old school EVADER. It can be pulled with cruah and relocates vader to used so lott dod can pull him back next turn, just like a bacta tank. Thanks must go to Martin Falke at this point, cause he thought of this idea.<br/>
I tell you the guys a genius. <br/>
	So suicide vaders kept the mains off the table for long enough for me to set up with ships at the systems so &amp;#8216;motion supported&amp;#8217; could put him away. He did pack &amp;#8216;A Vergeance in the force&amp;#8217; so da kashyyyk drain was neutered. In the end he had more mains than I had vaders, so the yebyeb, rune, p-59 connection had to hold a site for a turn. It could have been ugly but p-59 hit and sent liea to used via the core gen text. Yebyeb allowed rune to predict correctly, so he had no destiny and mine was +3. so quigon was lost to b/damage. <br/>
Apart from that he never really attacked and for the last few turns it was a drain race, but motion supported was just to much to handle.Delegates retrieved only 3 cards but better than nil.<br/>
FW +9<br/>
6 +69<br/>
<br/>
GAME4: QMC VS luke bartter&amp;#8217;s At Last we will have revenge<br/>
Just a drain race really. Menace fades stopped light saber bonuses and he had to pay for b/plan. He cancelled celebration and it got buried. At one point he dropped captain bewil and Boba fettbounty hunter on a lone pucumir and he couldn&amp;#8217;t path to safety. So I pateh liea over for protection. He battled, liea shot bewil. Unbelievably luke drew 2 lord mauls for destiny and I drew a 5. I lost liea and he lost the lot. When my lost pile stacked up I edged back for 9 but he grabbed both edges with the DTHCC shield.<br/>
It went right down to the wire, but EPP luke went on  a suicide mission against palpy and managed to sense both barrier and force field to save a turns worth of drains. In the end it was a long and noninteractive game but basically he had to pay to drai and I didn&amp;#8217;t<br/>
FW +4<br/>
Highs: saving pucumirs @ss from abeat down<br/>
Lows: tight game<br/>
8+73<br/>
<br/>
GAME5: Senate VS Luke Bartter&amp;#8217;s Hidden Mains<br/>
I never plyed a hidden mains deck with senate b4 so I was unsure what to do.in hind sight I should have pulled my locations first paid for the obj to hurt his hand and sat on my systems. Instead what I did was deploy maul for free to the desert site and move him to mos espa db for tikes activation. Next turn angry chewie, han and luke bent maul over their collective knee and gave him agood spanking. The only thing that stoppe dthe game endind there and then was EDCEL bargain preventing multiple destiny. I lost maul+11 cards. he dropped 6 six senators to the senate and got back6 cards with delegates.<br/>
	Then I deployed to my systems and tried to put heavy motion supported drains in but he was plinking me at multiple dbays and my desert landing site. To add in sult to injury he deployed &amp;#8216;I hope shes alright&amp;#8217;. I could only hold a b/g site for one turn with vader n p-59. IHSA chewed me up good. I drained a couple times and used yeb yeb to force a few cards loss but he had to great a lead.<br/>
FL-18<br/>
8+55<br/>
<br/>
GAME6: QMC VS Tyng yan yenn&amp;#8217;s Dark Senate.<br/>
And now for the possibly the best game of my life. I hate losing to tyng at the best of times and I sure didn&amp;#8217;t feel like losing with my favorite deck to his aberration of a senate deck. The thing goes against everything the game should be.<br/>
	Last time  I made the mistake of leaving to few ships at bespin. This time I did nothing else till bespin was secure. BP/DTF kept this senate plink to a minimum.<br/>
I put mirax and corran horn in the outrider, along side kier santage in red7. next turn I put wedge there as well. Then pucumir went to the 1 nil site and obi to the west gallery. In his turn he activated, pulled a card from force like he had done for the previous 4 turns and said go. He was setting up his hand for something. I drained for 4 and he cancelled obi&amp;#8217;s drain.  I put EPP luke at the guest quarters.<br/>
Down comes Maul YA, double stick, dre/ponda and Captain &amp;#8220;I only wanna beat one type of deck&amp;#8221; Bewil. So luke could no longer path away. I pathed obi across and had to hope for the best. In hind site I should have waited to path after the weapon phrase of battle to save obi from the saber.he battled hit obi immediantly lost. I go to hit maul(I had a SATM/BP in hand to make Him immediantly lost). He plays force field. I sense. He alters.i sense.he senses I control. He loses his alter put plays a 2nd to cancel the sense. He than hits luke. I draw a 5 and a draws a 3 or sumin for destiny. I lose luke +11 and he loses bewil. In my turn I&amp;#8217;m sh1tin bricks, drain, the drop harc seff and lando next to maul to reduce his drain (menace fades when off the top.) tyng is activating very little and is uninclined to drain. His yeb yeb catches both celebration and on the edge to lose off the top! He starts setting up his hand for the next couple turns while I plink for 2-4 where I can. Maul chases harcseff and lando around. Dre/pionda split from maul to move onfront of pucumir so I deploy han , battle, in the end he loses dre+2.<br/>
 And now for the greatest sequence of events in a card a game I have ever witnessed.<br/>
Tyng deploys Zuckuss to bespin. Hmm. Next comes TIE interceptor. Next comes TIE laser cannon. IT CAN FUKING WAIT!!!!!!!! The expression on his face was priceless. He had wasted he SAC b4 and had nothing to stop it!!! So he says your turn. I was unsure if I had lost my xwing laser in overflow. I put back a 5 destiny with mirax and activated till I had 2 in reserve deck. I dove through my force and found the mighty laser cannon. Deploy on wedge. Battle. Zap zuckuss. Draw me 5. Lose that Fuking TIE plus 13 please.<br/>
From then on tyng struggled to pay to drain and move maul around. He lost a force to add to his drains a couple times. I continued to keep up a steady drian of 4-5. when I had 3 cards left I landed the pulsar skate, moved mirax and corran horn infront of maul and used the upper plaza walkway tex to move EPP han and meals there aswell.<br/>
He battled hit han and corran but he lost maul to damage. Next tuern I drained him out!<br/>
FW+3 <br/>
Highs: Spanking that Fuking Tie with a card he never ever would have expected.and recovering from certain defeat!<br/>
Lows:nah it was all good<br/>
<br/>
So that&amp;#8217;s about it really I won the tournament and got a sense foil.yeah.<br/>
<br/>
PROPS: *Bastian for winning Freedomcon. <br/>
*me for using it can wait instead of rebel barrier.<br/>
*Luca for beating tyng in the continentals using the same TIE cannon/itcanwait combo<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS:*people who give half star reviews to decks that don&amp;#8217;t deserve em. People should give those weenies a taste of their own medicine.<br/>
