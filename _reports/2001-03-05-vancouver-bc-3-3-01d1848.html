<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Getting back into the groove.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot to say...I think...usually I have literary constapation....<br/>
<br/>
+ It’s all gonna come out in a mess of disorganization but that doesn’t matter. :^P<br/>
<br/>
Well...it’s been so long since I’ve been to a tourney, there hasn’t been any and I’ve been too busy with my university.  Since that Sagan guy left Kamloops, I have nobody nearly as decent to keep my skill to par and no tourneys to play in except this one like 2 weeks ago...Wasn’t really all that great.  I decided I needed to get to a tourney, a big one in Vancouver.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking with my buddy and Goo Trainer Alan and he tells me "if you’re gonna come to a tourney,  come to the one on March 3rd" and I figured since I now have some cash, I should finally go down to Vancouver and play in the tourney there.   So I planned and went.  <br/>
<br/>
A day before I got the bus tickets, he brought up an Abbotsford tourney and that MAYBE we should go to that.  I told my mom that we MIGHT go to Abbotsford.  The next day while I was gone all of like 30+ hours doing hw in comp lab (COBOL and C++ programming) I found out she had gotten my tickets already.  I tell Alan and he’s like "I guess that means we’re going" :^) I’m happy, I wanna play as many games as possible.  <br/>
<br/>
So I get like 12 hrs of sleep in the 4-5 days before the tourney...I’m spent.  I wake up Friday morning for 8 am class, finish at 11, bus comes at 12 15...I barely made it.  I get on this bus...bad trip down there...too much yapping from people behind me...I wanted to sleep, not here a life’s story :^P I get down to Van...Al picks me up...surprisingly I didn’t have to wait that long...Vancouver traffic I guess wasn’t that bad.  We go to his house and start the star wars weekend marathon.  We traded a bit, lowned each other some cards (your lucky I lent you that one card dude, though I am more than grateful for you lending me like $200 worth of cards.)  I have like 6 new decks I have never played before against him.  I had a WYS deck, Agents, ties, BHBM and a dark deal/trooper/ccsabacc deck.  I wasn’t sure what I was gonna play...<br/>
<br/>
After hours of playing I decided to go with a lazy dark deck and a totally not lazy light (that was dumb, hell I’m too damn tired to track for things like on the edge.  Who knows maybe I’ll do ok.  The decks are never the problem if I have any card I want to put in them.  I knew I could make a tourney winning deck but could I play one with like no practice in like 6-8 months?????<br/>
<br/>
I ended up borowing so many cards from Alan to make my dark and like 2 cards for my light + an Outrider from Alex (thanks dude, I would’ve gotten stomped without it).  I was gonna play Agents but I didn’t have enough Kabes!!??? (would you believe it???)WTF?! that’s like a common. (actually a rare i think) So I play WYS and an evil but so fun and 7’s BHBM.  Man...I love that deck :^)<br/>
<br/>
I get like 3-4 hrs of sleep and go to the tourney.  <br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------<br/>
First game:<br/>
<br/>
gimp  (Justin Cachelin, [1769]) vs some guy... newbie... mark???<br/>
WYS vs dark deal/occ <br/>
<br/>
I start MF, dbsh!t and battle plan----- he starts plaza, Splans, AWrap, Any method, tower/ bobba/w gun <br/>
<br/>
turn 1 i get lando in millenium with melas at kessel :^).  He gets vader with gun and some other scrubs out to plaza.<br/>
<br/>
turn 2 i deploy some scrubs to docking bay and draw...he deploys mara and xzior to port town...saves<br/>
<br/>
turn 3 i get like luke in cantina and celebrations going....then i start drawing....  <br/>
he saves force deploys some cloud ships to cc.  <br/>
i draw/retrieve/drain...he drains a few<br/>
i draw<br/>
i draw<br/>
i draw <br/>
...i draw???<br/>
well...I might as well...draw<br/>
!?<br/>
a few turns later he flips...(that’s why I am dumb)<br/>
i’m like ok that’s fine...<br/>
i stomp on him with han + chewie<br/>
i get order to engage out and start fighting him at bespin he runs i follow...<br/>
he’s a newbie...I help him out pointing things like watch out for menace fades...i help him out....<br/>
I notice that i don’t control a system at some point(he doesn’t notice) so i tell him he can drain me for like 10<br/>
as this point he’s almost dead but he gets off 2 turns of really big drains...ouch<br/>
2 (+15) i think...<br/>
<br/>
----------------------<br/>
game 2<br/>
my killer dark bhbm vs someone...who??? I think I have "wtfstml"(wtf short term memory loss)  I think it was this ryan guy that alan sometimes plays with.  He was playing 1 turn beatdown assets crap that I have NEVER SEEN before for lack of experience.  I was scared with so much force saved up...<br/>
<br/>
1rst turn<br/>
i get emperor out/emperors power in hand...janus...it’s all good... i search for db and then hmm...i forgot to search for force lightning...i search...it’s not there.!? phoque...he looks though like 40 something cards in my deck...sees the works....damn...so I am like...I guess I activated...NOPE!!!!!!!!  It’s in my hand!!!!??????  Could I be any stupider????  <br/>
<br/>
he draws and plays yoda stew on my next turn!?? ok...sure...good card...guess that means he’s tracking...<br/>
<br/>
2nd turn...i deploy choke vader and start draining and getting just 7’s in my deck with janus and 3 OAP...<br/>
he draws, saves,  yoda s. on my next turn?? ok...hmmm I grab it...he grabs my OAP...damn...<br/>
<br/>
3 rd turn, i drain, he it could be worse...damn...i deploy ig w gun to vader’s site...<br/>
he saves for like the next 3-4 turns...I AM SCARED...i get mara + saber, choke vader + stick and ig all at cc db.<br/>
next turns i drain he ICBW ’s it then i finally find my other grabber...he deploys falcon to endor db...i am like fewphh...ok...endor system is free now, I deploy zuckess and xizor with matching ship to system...he deploys mains to db next turn. ..he moves up to system....i deploy igar and tempest 1 to endor db and move ships to endor db..i start getting everything up at system...was going to deploy chimaera+thrawn there but he decides to go after emperor...damn....this could suck...i had sim and guri in hand...he had han and chewies and leia all at throne room vs emperor and janus and 4-lom....he has luke at db so i can’t run...but he can...Run Luke Run that is....it was all of mains vs sh!te plus...GURI ahhhh guri...a wonderful card<br/>
<br/>
+2 +22 --&gt; 4 + something<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
next...<br/>
game 3<br/>
Alex i think....I have never been able to beat him...the only way I am going to win is if he plays some dumb objective like TIGIH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my dark vs his ...................THERE IS GOOD IN HIM!!!  I am blessed...give me LUKE!<br/>
<br/>
starting hand for me...emperor...damn...it happened again against some one else too...<br/>
first turn...i can’t deploy emperor...damn...so i search for db...and draw like 2 cards...i have a good starting hand...<br/>
he deploys a couple guys 1 to each of db hoth and home 1...moves luke over...<br/>
<br/>
{yes....}<br/>
next turn<br/>
i don’t deploy emperor, but instead a mara to hoth and battle. I was totally expecting a 7 but no...like a 3 or 2 i think...he loses 2 cards...STACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Alan keeps telling me to play for the stack so I don’t forget.  I am half way there to turn so i thought...at some point i search for a force lightning and because Alan was talking about me or something and distracting it was.  No lightning. damn...i activated it again...no i didn’t.  IT’S FOKIN IN MY HAND!!! alex sees my deck.<br/>
<br/>
so he deploys obi w/saber against mara initiates...he hacks misses...i hack 7 and 7 i think....anyways I definitely hit he pulls destiny...like a 1 or 2 or 3 I am immune...i pull like a 7 ( i think) he loses a bunch of cards...STACK.<br/>
<br/>
in next turns i get luke to the throne room....there are like a few battles elsewhere...i duel...i lose...but can’t turn because i need more jedi lukes subtracts...ok...so he stacks...i battle win duel next turn but shockingly lose again...he stacks...(2 cards for him, 3 for me...) i battle next turn stack....duel...i win...loses 3 ....it’s a pretty fun game...intense for me since i am about to turn luke :^)  he edges for huge amounts...damn...ok...it doesn’t matter i think...I duel and lose...pull a 5 or 7 or something....game... <br/>
<br/>
+2 more and +19 or 22 or 25 or 180 how the hell would I know? I am tired...period.<br/>
<br/>
we played another game for fun and he won pretty easily...dropped a spy against emperor and sim....hacked at emp...i lose end of story.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
game 4<br/>
my light vs alans dark<br/>
auto loss.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-10  (-1563)<br/>
that deck is anti-Justin tech...i kill so much stuff....like hundreds of abyssins...but they come back...like zombies or skeletons or any undead....fiqin annoying  :^) and Myo makes his appearance a billion times in that deck....picture a horde of zebras in a meadow full of ghost and darkness lions... phfuqe oh well...<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
game 5<br/>
my dark vs wys....<br/>
hmm...no problems...i never deployed vader to capture luke...didn’t need him...just battled and won.<br/>
<br/>
game 6 <br/>
my WYS vs alex’s anti-wys <br/>
damn...this is ...  ...  ... going to hurt...picture getting a lightsaber up the @$$!<br/>
<br/>
i couldn’t get things workings...chewie got trampled!!! leaving han about to battle alone!! damn. i had to houjix...actually would’ve liked to a bunch of times....man that deck is good.<br/>
<br/>
got celeb out...didn’t help...executor and chimaera and zuckess dominated....damn...<br/>
i escaped from a gravity shadow thank god.<br/>
<br/>
so I go 8 + 32 or something....6th...not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
So some scrub nobody’s ever heard of wins the tournament 6-0.<br/>
<br/>
I go back to that scrub’s house and playtest for tomorrow, alex is going to come with us to Abbotsford.<br/>
<br/>
props:<br/>
<br/>
- playtesting was good<br/>
- i lost only to alex and alan, both way higher rated than me<br/>
-"goo"<br/>
-I wrecked Alex’s light<br/>
-Alan for picking me up and driving me to tourneys and for accomodations<br/>
-Alex for lending me a very important Outrider<br/>
-I didn’t play court for once I had a really good dark side<br/>
-My dark didn’t lose<br/>
-Fallen Portal...because that cards rules<br/>
-luck brought on by brownie<br/>
-overall damn fun<br/>
<br/>
flops:<br/>
-Alan’s dark deck :P<br/>
-Alan’s light deck :P -change that thing<br/>
-Alex’s dark deck :P man those decks are cruel<br/>
-mara was fallen portalled<br/>
-vader was portalled<br/>
-mara was OOC<br/>
-so was Vader... twice<br/>
-I can’t remember jack about the games<br/>
-me, I can’t play my decks worth salt<br/>
-sickness from brownie night before<br/>
<br/>
So tomorrow is: <br/>
Abbotsford.....another TR...which I won’t bother with...just 4 or 5 comments:<br/>
1)4 games. I played Alan one of those...<br/>
2)I TOTALLY wrecked a huntdown with my wys celebration modified deck<br/>
3)My dark lost for the first time in 2 tourneys to a profit deck.  The kid played really well...(dude, good 	job for portalling choke vader with captured luke) and an elom beatdown...<br/>
4)We couldn’t find the grey hound in abbotsford<br/>
5) Alan and Alex got to play each other ...twice??<br/>
<br/>
So, to conclude, I left Abbotsford and 7:15 waited in Chiliwack for like an hour and then got home in Kamloops at about 11:15...I went right to University to pull all-nighter in lab doing an assignment that was due at 9 in morning.  :^P<br/>
Also, god damn Anna and the King was playing on the bus trip back :^P<br/>
Hey Vancouverites, I’ll be back to do some scrub stompin in provincials...beware the 7, 7, 7!!!<br/>
<br/>
Take the rating easy on me :^)I am tired...spelling and such really bites chunks out of me.<br/>
