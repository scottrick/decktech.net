<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK this isn’t really a tourney report but a rant on how mean people are. Well, I am used to most people who play star wars in my area being nice, but I have found out otherwise. Anyway this is a summary of the games I have played in the last week cuz they have been really fun and super tech (whatever that means). Anyway, my friend Edwin told me to post this so if you think it doesn’t belong just tell him and give me five stars (heehee). Anyway, on Saturday, I went to a tourney in Oxford (Oxford 8/25, We are Hungry!) and I scrubbed out but I like my decks so I decide to keep them. I am sick on Monday so I almost build a EP1 closed environment deck but I don’t like it so I decide not to play in that format for a while. Ne way, on Wednesday after school Edwin calls me up and he’s like wanna go to Game Night at Games Galore? I’m like sure cuz we’ve never been before and we wanted to play some other pepl instead of ourselves and my little bro. So we pack our cards and head on out. We get there and like everyone is playing magic and only 4 SW pepl. So we sit down and eat our dinner and then another guy shows up so I’m like wanna play? He says ya so we sit down.<br/>
Game 1: My LS EB GhettO racing vs. Mean guy’s BHBM crazy stuff<br/>
Well I’m like I’m gonna win cuz BHBM is dead. He’s really mean and is like stop bragging and I’m like I’m not. He deploys Sebulba’s racer and I’m like you can’t win the race and he says he can. So we start the game and I get set up in the base and he deploys Tarkin to Endor DB and Security Control. I deploy EPP Obi to kill him and he loses Tarkin and a couple and security control is cancelled. It goes to used pile but I forgot that it did that so I try to pick it up to read it but he slaps his hand on mine and says DON’T TOUCH MY CARDS WITHOUT ASKING!!! Sorry, but most pepl let you read their cards. He is winning the race, but when he gets over 25 I step his 4 and my 1 so I win. He has had Palpy with his power at the throne room all game, so he’s adding destiny. He deploys Dr. E combo to the Forest at Endor, and it’s my go. I drop Ounee Ta, Qui-Gon and Corran to the forest and battle. He adds with Emporer’s power first, then tries to say the Dr. E combo text about a destiny if you don’t get one otherwise. We ask Brad Hilton who’s there and he says I’m right so he only gets 1 which is a 1 and I draw 4 or sompin. He loses them and some and I’m immune. I get EBO working soon after and Red Squad 1 in space. He deploys Guri to it’s system and battle’s, but I hyper escape. I’m not sure he could but whatever. He moves over but I can drain through Guri. I am draining for lots and he isn’t. He deploys Maul to the forest and tries to Elis to hoth on my turn but he forget’s he started with IAO. He is SOO stupid to have Elis in and start with IAO. Anyway I drain him out soon after and win by 27. <br/>
2 (+37)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning and taking revenge by winning on someone so mean.<br/>
Lows: Playing a REALLY mean person. By the way, this whole game Edwin was watching the game and reading some of the cards and the other guy got REALLY mad at him. Also, I was saying TECH! at random points in the game when I did something cool and he was like SHUTUP!!!!!!!! It was dumb.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
My DS Maul Mains with Space vs. Ryan Page’s HBX<br/>
Well I get a fast start on the ground and the big ship in hand (Executor). He gets X-wings at systems and I deploy the Executor with Vader piloting to his lone X-wing. I battle and he hyper escapes but I sense. He hyper escapes again and I grab it but he still gets away. I keep going around his system beating him up. He started w/Rebel Fleet so I am draining of like 3 and 2. He flips and should be cancelling all of my drains but I do something REALLY cool. He flips and I use Michael Raveling’s trick: Are you sure your hidden base system is out? His eyes flick to Roche, and suddenly I know right where it is. I move there next turn and probe....Got it! That turn I also pick up 2 alters and alter his Rebel Fleet and traffic control. I have beaten him out of space and so he loses to my huge drains on the ground. O ya somewhere in the middle he deploys Obi and Qui-Gon w/sticks to my site and battles. I fire the mortar gun w/Bossk and get Qui-Gon. He is like crap and Obi dies and he loses more. He also tries to Kessel Run run with Dash but when he moves to Kessel, I draw Ozzel for destiny, and his ship is lost! The only 0 of 15 cards in my deck and I draw it. As Ryan says, that is just wrong. I win by 15.<br/>
4 (+42)<br/>
Highs: Lots. Ozzel, Mind Trick. Big drains and winning.<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
Well me and Edwin have to leave now so I go home and go to bed. This week I have also played against my brother and killed him cuz he’s a scrub but has promise, he just doesn’t go to tourneys. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
My LS vs. Edwin’s new Watto Occupation<br/>
Well this game goes really well for me and bad for him. He gets some scrubs first turn to flip. On my turn I tunnel vision for jedi Luke and get aliens in the base. I am getting set up rather quickly, and when I draw my OOC/TT I see a good opportunity. He has Watto and Merrejk at the Junkyard, I deploy Jedi Luke w/stick to the Junkyard and battle. I swing, get Watto, and he draws low, so I am immune. On his turn he does nothing but drain me of 1 at Mos Espa. I OOC and get...Watto!!! He is like crap I lost but I insist that we play on. He deploys P-59 and 4-Lom to my site and battles. He cancels Luke’s text and misses him. I miss P-59 and we draw destiny. I draw low or high it doesn’t matter. He draws a zero and that seals it for me. He forfeits and I count my win as 32.<br/>
6 (+74)<br/>
Highs: Winning in a superly cool way.<br/>
Lows: He got really bad luck this game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: <br/>
My DS vs. Edwin’s Podprofit<br/>
Well this is a really bad matchup and I just crush him. I get pepl to the palace everywhere and he tries to attack me, but dies every time. Really not a fair game. I am draining for a lot and he never unfreezes Han. I just swarm with aliens and he can’t touch me. I end up winning by about 20.<br/>
8 (+94)<br/>
Highs: Winning total board control.<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
That just about sums it up. I wanted to post it so you can see how superly awesome I am. Jk. I am such a scrub, cept I played scrubs. Actually Edwin is rated 1708. It’s weird my rating is 1490, and I beat him all the time in playtesting. <br/>
Anyway, that night (Saturday) we went out to pizza w/Cole and Edwin, and the waitress is like what do you want to drink and Cole asks for a Bloody Mary. She’s like I can give you the mix and Cole’s like ok, then I’ll make one myself. This is funny because he is only 10. Anyway we get pizza and I like almost choke so I don’t eat much. We go outside and mess around a bunch and finally go home. This has been a good week.<br/>
Until next time,<br/>
