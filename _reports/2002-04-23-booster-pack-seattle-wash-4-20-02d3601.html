<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Me, Earl "farScape01" Sessions, and Casey "The Demon" Merry heard about a tournament in Seattle a 2 weeks ago. Earl and Casey were bugging me to go because I had already been to one of their tournaments a month back so I knew what they would be up against. I told them I couldn’t because my senior trip to Washington D.C. was that week. Luckily for them I ended up with a knee injury that destroyed my chance to go to D.C. (flying is stupid anyways, the only place to go after you get 3 miles up is DOWN!) So we all got some new decks ready.<br/>
     We live in Leavenworth WA, so that meant it was a three hour drive to get to Seattle and Booster Pack Games. The tournament stared at noon so we thought that was going to be easy. Unfortunately it turns out we had to drive Earl’s sister and her boyfriend to Tacoma to get their car in order to use our vehicle (A MINI VAN!) So we thought we would just leave earlier. First Earl’s sister and her boyfriend make us late by getting coffee at Starbucks. Then we have to take a different pass to get over the mountains, that puts us on the wrong side of Seattle. Earl’s sister then has to stop ever half hour to go to the bathroom. Me and Casey are getting worried about if we were going make it. We get to Tacoma and find out Earl’s sister and her boyfriend don’t really know how to get to this mechanic place, they only kind of know where it is. But that’s ok cause apparently all you have to do is get off the Interstate and get to one road and that takes you to it. Well we are off the Interstate and going to the street when we see lots of cops and signs DETOUR! Turns out the fourth or fifth largest parades in the country was going on that day and right through the street we needed. DAMN IT! We wait and get over to another street just in time to see the Gay Pride float go by. After searching and searching the downtown of Tacoma, were the streets merge into one with no warning and have old street lines that are about the same fadedness as the new one so you have no idea how many lanes are per street and what one is the real one, we find the stupid place and try to get back on the Interstate. <br/>
     Ok fast forward a bit and there we are. Things are easy now, all we have to do is go north on I-5 until we get to Northgate mall. Oh... we’re out of gas ^$&amp;%! Earl gets off I-5 and we get some gas at a Texaco. We head back onto the Interstate. At the very last second Earl thinks we need to go south (I have no idea where that thought came from) so we end up turning the wrong way! That’s ok we’ll just find another turn off and get back around. We drive and drive and drive... and drive. 10 minutes later we find one. Now back North! We have only 15 minutes to get there before they start. Then Seattle gives us a wonderful present, traffic. We are going a whopping 15 in a 60. Earl to keep his sanity in this moment of defeat softly starts to sing Pearl Jam. Casey find some orange tape and thinks he is Michelangelo and starts yelling MOVIE @#$%! GET OUT THE WAY! Me... I drink my Pepsi and look on in disbelieve. Hey the traffic is clearing up. 20 minute later we are at Northgate and are heading down to Lake City way to get to Booster Pack. Half way there at a stop light Casey knocks on his window and screams to this one girl if she knows what time it is. Of course she can’t hear him so he points to his wrist and just lip syncs is. She just looks ahead and drive on... at the time Casey inability to get the time was very funny (especially since we had a clock in the car)<br/>
     WE GET THERE!!! and only 15 minutes late too. They haven’t started yet so we all collapse and wait to regain our sanity back from the worst drives ever. <br/>
     10 people are there all together. I pay my five bucks in and we start the 6 game tournament.<br/>
<br/>
     Game #1 My Dark against Earl’s Profit<br/>
     Ok I’m playing Endor opps and Earl has his damn Profit. I know I’m going to lose because these two decks have gone at it many of times with me always losing greatly. 1st turn he drops Qui Guan at Endor and kills off any and all of my biker scouts. Screw that. Earl goes on to do nothing but force drain my @#$% and I can’t get any of my powerhouses out. This kills me and I lose my first game by -17<br/>
<br/>
     Game #2 My Light against um... lets call him Bob, yeah Bob’s Dark<br/>
     Sorry bob that I can’t remember your first name but I don’t bother with memories of me getting my @#$% kicked. I got my MBO going and he has a nice Hunt Down. Vader with stick is down right off at Yavin and I don’t dare send my Rebel Tech’s against him. I try to go out to space and just worry about out there. I get a few systems down but his bounty hunters in ships make life really crappy. Then just too add injury to insult. He put Lateral Damage on my Red Leader in Red 1, making my Gold Leader in Gold one open to getting his @#$% kick, hey what do you know. He got his @#$% kick. I move Red 1 over to get that damn Lateral Damage gone but the game is over by now and I lose with a -31<br/>
<br/>
     Game #3 My Dark against Some guys Light<br/>
     Again I forget to remember names. My Endor opps against QMC. I get Vader down right away and I flood Endor with AT-STs and Bikers. I put down Emperors shield and control Endor. I flip my objective and last turn I force drain for a total of 18 at two Endor sites and system. I WIN! Never had my Endor Opps worked so well. I win with a +24<br/>
<br/>
Lunch Break... I forget to go and eat and just hang out. I realize how cool the Wenatchee Tournaments are with Pizza and all being delivered to us.<br/>
<br/>
     Game #4 My Light against Keith’s Dark LSC.<br/>
     Well I thought I was ok with a LSC deck. I mean who stuffs their deck with lots of ships when you got a LSC deck going? Apparently Keith does. I lost to Keith’s LSC last time I was here and remember that ever thought I was going to get my @#$% kick, Keith was one of the cooler guys to play against. He gets his systems controlled fast with Chimera and Executor. I am trying to get Yavin ready for an attack that never comes. He is force draining me like mad and I have to lose from my reserve deck... good bye Death Star. Well my objective is worthless and my force is going fast. When I know I’m down for the count and there is nothing left but to have fun... I do crazy moves. Virtual Luke moves to take out the Executor alone and Red Leader in Red One wants some of Chimera. I get the coolest Red pilot in hand and drop him at the core With Maul and his big old stick. Jek Porkins is a fearless mo fo. Keith kills off Luke and Red one next turn and that ends the game though... but Jek is still at the core!!! Well yeah I lose by over 30 I believe. But the game was very fun none the less ( we played a fun game afterwards with my dark and I had six un piloted speeder bikes at one site they were parked and pissed)<br/>
<br/>
     Game #5 My Dark against Casey’s Light<br/>
     Watch your step is Casey’s first words to me... I knew that, I am one of only two people to ever beat his smuggler deck. I was hoping I would get to go it again but after playing so many times Casey knew what to do to cripple my deck. First He gets to Endor knowing the only thing I have to put there is the Emperors’s Shield and the Death Star Assault Squadron. The only good thing about the game was that I used Endor Occupation to cancel his Tatooine Celebration. I lose to Casey with a - 21.<br/>
<br/>
     Game #6 Last game of the day. My light against Game 3’s guys dark. <br/>
     I want my light to win one game today... That’s all I ask. Not to be. He is using Dark Deal and force drains like crazy at Cloud City while I am building up a space force to take out that damn death star. Near the end of the game I finally kill it and make him lose 11 force. But I was down to nothing by then so he wins... by 7!<br/>
<br/>
Finally<br/>
Casey 4th<br/>
Earl 5th<br/>
Me 8th<br/>
<br/>
    Well I thought as much. I knew Seattle had some tough guys there so I was thinking a last place spot. 8th wasn’t last so I didn’t care. I got three packs of  Coruscant and pulled a Queen’s Royal Starship something stupid and a Master Qui-Gon. We head upstairs to go home but stop to grab some packs first. Jabba’s Enhanced stuff was only 5 bucks each so I got a Master Luke and a Jodo Kast Pack (no Mara Jades damn it) Their Cloud City and Jabba’s Palace pack we 50 cents each so I go 10 bucks worth. Nothing great really but few cards I need. After that We head to Jack in the Box and get some much need food.<br/>
     It’s late and we were going head to Earl’s Grandma’s house for the night. Unfortunately on the way there I hear on the radio that Layne Staley died. Me and Earl were both Alice in Chains fans but Earl was hardcore about them. He almost cried about it. Casey said joke about it then shut up quick when he realized we might kill him. We get to Earl’s Grandma’s house and talk about what we were going to do tomorrow (there was another tournament in Kelso Sunday) We soon dubbed it the Kelso Run. Well after finding out Kelso is another two hours away meaning it will take five hours to get back to Leavenworth and me and Earl had school the next day Earl didn’t want to do the run. I did want to so Casey was the wild card. Did we go? If I post another tournament then that means yes we did. If I don’t then we went home.<br/>
