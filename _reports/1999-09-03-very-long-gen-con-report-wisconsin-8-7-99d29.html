<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after weeks of anticipation, Wednesday afternoon rolled around and I'm  all set for Gen Con. Eric Wetterlind picked me up and we met up with Chris  Perman and Mike Raveling. We all piled into Eric's truck. Eric's truck did  have 4 seats, but the two back ones were extremely small and we took shifts  sitting shotgun. We talk mostly Star Wars on the way to Milwaukee, and I  have no idea what decks to play for the Open. For Dark side I figured I'd  play the same deck I had been playing for months, D* start, lots of sites  good against revo, Dreadnaughts and Star Destroyers for Space,  Vader/Tarkin/EPP Fett for ground. For LS I had a Throne Room Revo, Obi's  Hut Revo, Obi's Hut/Audience chamber start and Eloms deck, Hidden  base/Battle Plans deck, and a Dagobah/Battle Plans deck. We get to  Milwaukee at about 11 pm, we were staying at a friend of Chris' house.  Once we get settled, I play Mike in 2 games, first one I play my Dagobah  against Hoth Biker Scout Inserts and get whooped. Second game I play D*  space and get whooped again by Dantooine Ops/Chada Fan inserts. So I decide  to go to sleep.   <br/>
<br/>
Next day I beat up Mike twice against his Ops decks for both sides, and he  decides Ops isn't the way to go. We get to Gen Con at about 11 AM and we  walk the booths a little until we found the Decipher one, they were mostly  doing YJ demos and we talked with a couple of the Squadron Members from  Minnesota.   The rest of the guys wanted to play in the YJ sealed deck, but I wasn't too  hot on YJ so I just walked to booths and checked in on them every once in a  while, Mike Raveling won and got a cool looking box with some packs and  stuff in them.   <br/>
<br/>
The OTSD booster draft was that afternoon, so I sign up for the tournament.  We also meet up with the guys from Moorhead area, Kurt Schilicting, Sam  Wendt, and Jon Swenson. For my draft I was Dark and went for a mostly space  deck, unfortunately I didn't have that many good systems, couldn't get a  kashyyyk or Kiffex in my ANH pack, I did get a fair number of characters  with Prophetess heading the bunch.   <br/>
<br/>
First Game, I drop early Prophetess at my Tusken Canyon, and the Sealed deck  alien with an Advose at his Mos Eisley. I later got ships out at tatooine  also, and win easily.   <br/>
<br/>
Second Game, I get early Prophetess at my Tusken Canyon again, but he drops  a y-wing with BoShek at my Starting Location, Tatooine. I couldn't get any  ships in my hand, and he deploys that droid effect and starts losing droids  to my force drains. I draw up looking for Ships, and get out various Ties  at Tatooine, I battle, after all the forfeiting, I still had enough guys  there to draw destiny, but he doesn't. He leaves a single Y-wing for me to  beat down because he thought y-wings didn't have pilots, hehe, guess he had  forgotten all about old premier cards. He tries to make a comeback by  deployed Obi at his Jundland Wastes, but I spread out even more and drain  him to death.   <br/>
<br/>
Third Game, I didn't get any stuff early, he tries to invade my Tatooine but  my Ties take care of him. Then he drops about 7 misc. characters at a site  and starts draining, but I played my only counter assault. After he said  'ok', I thought I had the game won right there, but I draw horrible destiny  with 3 ones and ended up making him lose only 7 force. He keeps draining  but I get ships at both Yavin and tatooine, and nabruns Prophetess to his Y4  War Room, and drain him out.   <br/>
<br/>
I go undefeated but didn't have enough differential. Jon Swenson won his  last game by 20 + force and takes first, Chris Perman drafted a space deck  that started with Kashyyyk and took second, I tied with Joe Mornout for  third, and Mike Raveling came right behind us, a pretty good finish for the  Minnesota guys :-).  <br/>
<br/>
I play in the Endor draft that night and drew Light Side, I tried to draft  some kind of space deck and picked 2 endors early, but then for the rest of  the draft I saw only 1 ship and no Battle Plan... Doh! I get the only deck  possible for LS, Ewoks, I tried to get some kind of Karak thing going. My  first game I played against a kid who had just learned how to play that  afternoon and win by 24, which boosted me to the highest LS position :-) I  then played two good players and lost horribly to the tons of biker scouts.  So I went 1-2 in the Endor Draft.   <br/>
<br/>
We get home that night at about 2 am, and fell straight to sleep. On Friday  I didn't play in any tournaments at all, and played a ton of pick-up games  to get ready for the open. I lose to Brian Fred and Steve Brentsen, both  playing the same DS deck, so I think about copying it. I watched Mike  Raveling win the YJ Constructed deck that day, and he got a whole set of YJ  foils! I couldn't find my teammates Mike Fitzgerald, or Steven Turner, and  Giraird was coming in on Saturday morning. So that night Mike raveling and  I got together with the Moorhead guys and playtested. For DS I change over  to what Fred and Brentsen were playing, D* start with Oppressive  Enforcement, pull out Imperial Arrest Order early. Wait for LS to commit  somewhere, and then try to out drain them. It's hard for the LS to move  around. For the ground I had a bunch of Walkers with 2/2 pilots to pilot  them, Igar and Tempest 1 Rules!!! :-) I beat Kurt's LS with it and stowed  it away for the open. I then play against Jon Swenson's Hunt Down deck with  a couple of different decks, first game he failed to draw any evaders and I  revolved his sites and killed him. Second game I played my elom deck and he  had first turn Vader and my eloms/mains couldn't do anything. To counter  Hunt Down, I put in another courage and glancing blow, bringing the total to  2 each. My Elom deck contained 2 Tesseks, 6 Elom, Mains, a few Hnemths, 2  Goo Nee Tays 3 revolutions and 2 Civil Disorders. I decide to go with it  just because I didn't like any of my other decks.   <br/>
<br/>
Open Report   I'm soooo freakin nervous for the open... All I prayed for was to not lose  the first couple of games. I hoped to get top 8, you'd need 5-1 and high  differential to get that. I meet up with even more people from Minnesota  who came in for the open. Talked a lot with Potter and Mike Bergum.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 1, LS vs Nick Kolnik (1640)   Hehe, Nick is one of the Minneapolis players and we've seen each other many  times before. He had 7 cards on the table to start so I obviously thought  he was playing Hunt Down. Turns out he was playing Y4 Occupation starting  Imp. Occupation and the SE Starting interrupt, pulling all 3 effects. My  first turn I drop Goo Nee Tay, and elom+ Hnemth at his mid Y4 site. I  drained there the whole game and then spread out to a couple of sites with  Obi/Luke to back up my guys. He tried to deploy some ships at Yavin, but I  get out my falcon and whopp up. Win by 23.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 2, DS vs Aaron Fojtik (Ryan's brother, 1933)   He starts Hidden Base, so I pull out Security Precautions and he starts  Insurrection. He pulls out Tatooine and the generic Docking Bay site with  Insurrection. He then tries to deploy some mains on Tatooine, but my Vader  with Tarkin in a Blizzard Walker was to strong and he had to run away from  my guys. He deployed Momaw Nadon and some guys at my Coruscant Imp. Square.  I drop Come Here You Big Coward, but he just does the landing claw trick  with one of his ships. So I fly my ships to Coruscant and drops EPP Fett  off along with a walker. I was stupid and didn't make fett pilot the  Blizzard 2 because he only had a couple of guys there and I thought I'd kill  all of them next turn. His turn he drops some more guys and battles, I kill  two of them but he still has enough to draw battle destiny, while all I had  was blizzard 2. Mean while, on Tatooine, he sets up Tat. Celebration and  was retriving 2 a turn, but I had Vader w/ Saber at Cantina and Tarkin on  Tempest 1 at Mos Eisley, so luke couldn't run away. I kill of luke and he  pulls Twass Kaah on board his ship at tatooine because he knows I have more  walkers in my hand. It then turns into a drain race, but I had all of his  tatooine sites to drain at, so I win by 4.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS vs Ray Bordier (2087)   Ray was playing raltiir ops with snow speeders and Incom engineers. I start  Battle Order and get a pretty good hand. I beat down on his early ops, but  my destiny was horrible, Vader would swing at an op and draw 0 and 1. But  he was hardly draining me at all because of Battle Order. However, I  constantly forget to battle for free with battle Order, and it could have  made a difference. In the mid game, Ray drew up to 12 cards, and I knew I  was in trouble because he must have gotten a bunch of ops and misc.  characters to play at sites I wasn't at. That's exactly what he did, and  when I tried to deploy more walkers/characters, he'd use the Incom engineer  to add 2 to battle destiny, and my walkers wouldn't be immune at all. Vader  went after an Income engineer once and drew two 1's... for the finish he  dropped GlinG1 and RlinR1 at Raltiir and satisfied battle plans. I had one  last chance left, so I dropped Avenger and BIHT at Raltiir and Lat. Damaged  his GlinG1, he hojixed and I could do nothing but chase him around. Lost by  19.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 4, LS vs Mike Fitzgerald (1880?)   Hehe, I get to play against my teammate. He starts hunt down... Because I  hadn't played against Hunt Down a lot, I mistakenly start with Audience  Chamber instead of Signal/Goo Nee Tay. It costed me 'cause he started with  PotF at Obi's Hut and got a First turn Vader there. I dropped some mains  and battled him a couple of times. He never wanted to duel me because he  saw the Glancing blow and courage in my deck. I get out a revolution at a  Executor site and got some guys out there to cancel visage before he  evadered next turn. I have my Falcon at Kiffex and guys out at both  executer sites. I dropped hnemth and Tessek at Audience Chamber, but Bubo  munches on them next turn. I also drop Civil Disorder, and he is losing a  lot of force too. But later on he drops some ships at Kiffex and blocks my  falcon drain. Lost by 4.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 5, LS vs. John Sarnecki (mid 1700s)   John starts with the Endor Objective, but never used it to pull out  anything. He did get Imp. Arrest order and got out Yavin + Hoth Docking  Bays and imp. Decree. He set up a drain at Kashyyyk with a few Star  Destroyers, I just landing claw it. I kept saving 2 force in my reserve  deck and check to see what it is (by trying to find bo Shuda with the  Audience Chamber). I keep having a location in there, so I didn't want to  detach the Falcon and battle just yet. I revolved his bunker and put henmth  and elom there. I also had goo nee tay out. He deploys PotF at the bunker,  followed by vader, but he forgot that vader is deploy 10, and so didn't have  enough to battle. Next turn I drop 4 Eloms, but didn't have enough to  battle, so he runs vader away. It was a slow game, with me eventurally  getting out Tessek at Audience Chamber, and getting small drains through.  Win by 9.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 6, DS vs. Mark McAllister (1730)   He started with MWYHL and I forget what effect. I get D* Oppressive  Enforcement. He didn't fish for a site first turn so I'm confused as to  what he is doing, I get a couple of locations going right away. Second turn  he deploys 2 asteroid sectors and a Big One and plops down a YT freighter  along with an Asteroid Sanc. My second turn, I draw up until I get a  Twilek. His third turn, I lose 5 cards from my hand and he drops another  asteroid sector. My third turn, activate 3, twi'lek for a Come Here You Big  Coward, play it. That pretty much ended the game right there. He tried to  occupy Kessel, but I beat him down there. He tries to get ships out at his  asteroid sectors, but I recycle my high destines and kill his ships. I  ended up putting my entire hand back with Reactor Terminal, win by 33.   <br/>
<br/>
Jon Swenson was undefeated in first place at the end of the 5th game, but he  lost his last game with huntdown against hidden base. It ended up being  Nate Reisch and Joe Mornout in the finals. Joe won the first game as LS,  but lost the second one with his CCT manipulator to Nate's Hidden Base.  However, at the end of 2, it was a true tie. So they flipped a coin, Nate  won, and selected to play his hidden base again and won again, so Nate  Reisch is going to worlds.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
team report:<br/>
<br/>
So Bespin totally kicked in the open, finishing first (reisch), third (jon  swenson) and fourth (Frank Morgan, I think). We left right after to open to  go back to Chris' friend(Ben)'s house 'cause we were really tired from 2  nights of going to sleep at 3 am. We get home and play a couple more games  to see if we want to change our decks for the team event tomorrow, Mike  Raveling and Chris Perman were playing with a couple of guys from Iowa,  while I am a member of the absolutly amazing Team Res Luc Raff featuring  Mike Fitzgerald, Steven Turner, Mike Giraird and me. I play against Mike  twice with two different LS decks and lost both times, so I quit and started  watching some movies on Ben's huge screen tv.   <br/>
<br/>
I kept the same DS deck, just added one more location, and took out a  dreadnaught for a DS Star Destroyer.   My LS I changed over to a Dagobah turtle deck with Battle Plan that trains  to test 3 and beats up on the opponent. Interesting note, I made the deck a  week ago and put in only 1 on the edge because I only had 1 black border,  and I forgot to change it before the open. Doh, stupid me.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 1, DS vs Travis Bean. (1818)   Travis is from the duluth area, and I have played him a couple times before.  Its good to start the day off playing someone famailar. I start Death  Star and he get Throne Room/Farm/Swamp. He gets his nudjs out at both  sites, while I get a couple of systems going. He revos one of my 2-0 sites,  I Evader, he sense, I grab his sense and evaders again, he didn't have any  force left so he couldn't sense again. He has Luke at the Farm to power the  sacs, while I get some ships at Kashyyyk and starts draining. He then drops  Tantive with EPP Han, EPP Leia and Chewie piloting. Next turn I play the  Come Here You Big Coward I had been holding in my hand. I then examined the  situation, and I had the Death Star, Coruscant, and Corulag was the closest  system at parsec 4 and he couldn't get there! :-) hahahaha. I trapped 3 of  his big bad guys down at the death star and he couldn't do anything. He  deploys Obi to go along with Luke and kill off his own nudjs so he could  occupy 2 battlegrounds. My Vader was trapped at Kashyyyk with my ships, but  it didn't matter as I got out a couple of walkers with pilots and mop up Obi  and Luke, it was almost too easy, win by 24.  <br/>
<br/>
Turner won his game easily against Joe Alread, I was sitting next to Giraird  and he seemed to be losing early, but he makes a comeback and wins, and  Fitzgerald wins despite losing 10+ to a surprise assault. So our team was  4-0 so far.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 2, LS vs some guy.   Didn't remember his name, he was playing CCT that tries to flip the  objective. I give him Lock Navander and go about my training on Dagobah.  He tries a second turn freeze and came uncomfortably close, he needed a 4.  So on my turn I drop Luke+Jeron Webb, slash Lando and make him forfeit a  ugnaught, freeing my captive. I start to get my training completed and he  puts guys at CC docking Bay, Tatooine Docking Bay and Jabba's Palace. I had  Harc Seff at the Carbonite chamber with the rest of my guys and he canceled  the CC Docking Bay drain, and I Projectioned his Docking Bay, so he was only  doing 1 a turn, and paying 4 to do it :-) After the 3rd test was done, I  drop Kessel with Spiral and Melas, and nabrun my squad on the ground to beat  down his guys, win by 21.   <br/>
<br/>
Some how all my my teammates lost the second game, and all of a sudden the  situation wasn't looking too good for us.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS vs. Kenny Roberts. (1801)   Kenny started with Hidden Base S-Foils and I went for security precautions.  Neither one of us wants to deploy any ships early because he wanted to beat  down anything I played and I wanted to avoid exactly that. He drops an  early Yarna, and a few B-wings at Rpoint. He then gets a few ships going at  Yavin 4. I drop 3 Star Destroyers and lat. Damage one of the ships. He  loses 3 B-wings from the battle and I run away from Yavin because he could  deploy his B-wings there for 1 force because of Haven. He monnoks me and  gets rid of my Vaders and Vader's Sabers. I eventurally monnok him to check  up on his hand and only saw 1 B-Wing, I then verify his reserve for  something or other and only saw a few B-wings, so I wasn't that afarid of  beat down anymore. I get a couple of task forces going, and a drain at  Endor:Back Door with Bubo eating his undercover spies. He didn&amp;#8217;t flip for a very long time, I  only assumed that it was because he didn't want to lose force for the  Security Precations, and he wouldn't drain for more than 1 at a system  anyways after I cover his Kessel and Coruscant. However, on his next to  last turn, he deploys Kiffex from his reserve and flips. It was pretty  obvious what the hidden Base was, but I probe a couple times at other  systems so I could get cards back in my reserve. I then move over to Kiffex  and probes, making him lose 5 force. I drain him out next turn. Win by 15.   Turner beats Joe Mornout, but Girard and Fitzgerald loses again, and Girard  drops.   <br/>
<br/>
Game 4, LS vs. Steven Lewis. (2013)   I'm too tired to go over this game, Steve was playing corulag Ops I messed  up one time when recycling destiny, I put 2 5s at the bottom of my deck  instead of 2 6s. The next turn he deploys executor + some pilots to occupy  space for Battle Plan. I battled and drew the 2 5s, if it was 2 6s, then  the executor would have been gone and things might have been different. I  also lost the Lower Corridor and Kessel from my hand early because I thought  I'd concentrate mostly on Corulag. But after he flipped there was no way for  me to force drain him! The lack of a second on the edge really hurt and I  lost by something in the teens.   <br/>
<br/>
Turner got a timed win against Mike Raveling, but Fitzgerald lost to Clint  Hays. So we finished no where near the top. Individually I finished 12th,  while Nathan Reisch finished first.   I keep telling Nathan Reisch to tell all of his opponents 'you can't spell  Dominate without Nate!!' :-)   Clint Hays beat Brian Fred in the first game, but loses his second one to a  Tractor Beam Deck!!!! Apparently Clint was playing Hidden Base and got all  his ships pulled to the dark side.  Anyways, thanks for listening. I've had a great time at Gen Con and hope to  see all the guys I met there next year. :)    Jim      <br/>
