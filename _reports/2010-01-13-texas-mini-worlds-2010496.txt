<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Welcome to the quesosauce texas mini worlds tourney report! Im posting it here instead of dechteck because well do i really need to explain? Plus I know you were all wanting to read my irrelevant ramblings of the 9th place main event finisher! As most of you know, I really wanted to attend texas mini worlds 2010 due to Mike Richards reputation as a great TD, and for all the stuff I had heard about tmw last year. I was very excited when events unfolded that allowed me to make it! <br>
<br>
I flew from denver to dallas and then a day or two later went over the the Fanchion to meet up with chris fanchi. Chris and I hung out, talked star wars, played madden, watched the unexcitingkindaexcitingmassivelydissappointing BCS national championship game, then drove to Houston the next morning. Chris was pretty determined to not play swccg all weekend, so getting him to play in the teamy tourney and drafting some Winston cube at the place in Houston was just about all I could muster from him. Chris brought his ipod and his ipod tape deck transmitter along, but in a phrase that hasnt been uttered since 1993 awwww your car doesnt have a TAPE DECK? many lols ensued when upon the completion of the tourney and I was dropping chris back off at his house in dallas area, my mom had a ipod car thing all along hidden under the seat!<br>
<br>
<br>
We got to Houston, stopped by the other Fanchion and dropped our stuff off and went down to the team tourney. We got there first because im punctual and virtually everyone else in swccg land isnt<br>
The team tourney this year was held in a mpc style format where the players were seeded according to how good they are (or how good mike Richards thinks they are) I dont think the seedings ever came out, but I ended up with mike Richards as my teammate, so out of 20 people I was probably deemed the 12th or 13th best player there, goooo me! <br>
<br>
<br>
Team tourney<br>
Game 1 My matching weapons trm vs Brian Herolds HDv mains<br>
The game starts out slow, except he got this new DS broken droid that let him put a card under his used pile to draw a card in his opening hand! I didnt get my remarkably similar ls droid until later on, so he was able to get a head start on getting characters out and getting better cards in his hand. I was a dingus and forgot to pull the weapon lev shield and had to burn 3 force to sense his weapon lev on my quigons saber in a battle against new galen. Weapon lev was a card that was played a lot the whole weekend it seemed. We kept battling eachother at his 2/2 site and it wasnt going too well for me as he had was able to win a couple more battles against me than I would of thought, that HDv deck sure can battle! Eventually it just became apparent to me that he was going to be able to win, so I did what I could to do as much damage as possible and get him as low as I could. He won by somewhere around 15. Mike won his game so that was good!<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs taco bills DD invasion<br>
This game just didnt really go well, for tacobills deck. I monnoked him early and got like 3 dds and some battle interrupts. I had corran and il-19 early and was able to invade his bridge. Got luke and qui with sticks to the throne room, mace to this 3/2 site and just drained and won pretty easily. He cleared qui and luke once, but they regurgitated back soon enuf. I won by 23ish and Mike Richards won as well, so I believe we were the second best team after round 2<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs Nick Reishs Eops (similar to say KToD Eops with bigblue and lcbs)<br>
Game started out slowly, but I was able to put out my walkers blowout package of screamin lando and leia with leias gun and satm combo. So I blindly hit blizzard 1 with veers and ozzel on it which was cool, and I was draining at the endor db once I put mace out there with a lightsaber. After that I got all goldenrody and went to space, doh! The home1 got blown out by a shutdown the main reactor beat and I just couldnt recover and his flipped endor ops drains were mean. He won by like 10-12 Mike won again because hes the * man, and we finished 3rd in the teamy tourney which I was excited about, but if I could of made at least the finals I would have felt a lot better. Chris Fanchi and Nick Reish won the team tourney, congrats to them!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After the team event most of us went out to Chillis for some dinner which was a great time. My deck choices were all set before I even flew down to texas, so all that was left was to get some sleep. <br>
<br/>
<br/>
Day 1 started without any great shakes, we had I believe 24 at the start of round 1 which was a good turnout, and at least four more than I was expecting to be there. <br/>
Game 1 my Watch Your Step vs Aaron Nelsons EOPS mains<br/>
So I finally get the priviledge of playing swccg against Aaron, and the team socal Eops was a flipping Eops, so it had good wys protection built in. I honestly had no idea what to do against the deck, so I decided to play aggressively and just kinda see what happened. I went down too early against galen, misplayed the battle due to the flipped objective limiting my destinies, I had the OOC/TT combo in my hand so my hope was to oop galen or his saber, but it didnt go as planned. I went to space and after that just plink drained and made it close, he took over ground fairly easily and I didnt have the kessel run he was anticipating which could have made it closer, but I dont see a scenario where I win this match, aaron is just too good. He wins by 16<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My TTO vs Olaf WYS<br/>
My second game went a little better as I was matched up against a WYS deck with my first ever game with TTO. I was able to get everything set up quick, and got my tatooine out and converted his, as well as got out empires new order v to slow him down. He went up to my endor with boshek and wedge, I went to tatooine with 3 star destroyers and various admirals. TTO was in effect, and I had the +1 to x effect out as well. The key play was when I went down with a star destroyer to endor and set for stunned his wedge (there wasnt a destiny in reserve at the time that would of set for stunned boshek) and beat down the ship he had there forcing him to pay for his cantina drain. I win by 12ish<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- My TTO vs Clayton Atkins HBv<br/>
So this HBv is a silly deck, and honestly it just hasnt got many ways to beat it. I forgot to run the shield (it was in my shields for my ds I would have used in the teamy tourney, doh) but im not sure if it would of mattered much anyway. I got TTO setup decently quick, but my teammates back in Colorado (Tom McGee and to a lesser extent Jan) insisted that I probably dont need the spaceport db in the deck anymore. If I would have been able to put it out and get a walker there it could of made it closer. I pay to drain for 1 just about every time I could, which apparently is my mantra, but it gets the differential down to I think a loss by 10. His mains and toys on the rebel yell sites are just draining too fast. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4- My WYS vs Olaf BHBM with tanks<br/>
This was a matchup that I hadnt anticipated, and he ran the new effect which meant I didnt have luke but since he had no space (at least from what I saw) I was able to go light to space and drain a bunch (he did burecrat the kessel drain grrrr!) So I went and got celebration going and flash retrieval to replace my luke retrieval. I lost a duel once to his objective, but once I got mirax going for stacking destinies, I didnt lose a duel after that. So I stacked the cantina with everyone and open fire couldnt touch my dudes def value with talon karde and melas and I even sabotaged a tank guns! Biggest win of the day for me +32<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5- My TTO vs Tacobill profit<br/>
Kinda a boring game, he did his stuff, I did mine, he got an atrocity to stick, which was annoying. I had him down to probably 15ish but then he was able to find/use his 2x on the edge to pump it up to 22 I think<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6- My Wys vs Todd Saber combat<br/>
Early game I went willy nilly to space, because most combats dont run space, but thekey play was when he actually ran space in combat and came at mirax and dash who were at correilia but he also pulled a justice card when he would have drawn 3 destinies and would of added 2 to each with after her there (was worried about prop bomb, but that wasnt the deck) basically just drained him in space, flash of insighted a ton of force back my space was better than his, then the atst just made it so i could drain on the ground, and ultimatum made it so I was losing only 2 a turn. I win by 27<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7- My TTO vs Chris Shoenthal TRM<br/>
My TTO decided to take a dump on me in this one. I missed pulls for my tto parts on 3 of my first 4 turns, and also never saw command, merrijek, peitt, etc when I needed them to pull a system. Shoenthal got a redic amount of activation in his opening draw, and when i lost decree to a drain padme came down etc, it just wasnt the best game for poor lil sauce in this one which kinda sucked because I needed to win my last two games to get a spot in the top 8. He wins by 18 I think<br/>
<br/>
Game 8- My WYS vs Shoenthal EOPS big blue<br/>
I had a really good start to this one and was able to get to space with my AO first turn, and the AO reduced the power on a lot of his ships during early battles. I played the match agressivley and was able to get into some favorable battles and also kept up the pressure on the ground. Lando pulled a gilbert arenas and brought his gun to the cantina and just sat there all game and drained, chris came at me once at the cantina with veers and evax and blasty door kid ensured that didnt go well for him. He moved out of the cantina and lando stayed there alone all game draining . Overwhelmed was played on me twice which was silly but didnt hurt that much. I win by draining and picking my battles, and got a little bit of overflow once or twice. I win by 24<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put me in 9th with pretty good diff, decently pleased with my performance, the only annoying game was when tto took a dump and I wasnt really able to get that deck going the way it can<br/>
<br/>
We all went out to the texas roadhouse after the long day (texas roadhouse apparently didnt even start in texas!) to explain why such a big group showed up so late (pretty much the whole tourney came) lingrell decided to tell the waitress that I was an artist for Pokemon, and we were celebrating my newest masterpiecies. <br/>
Dinner was fun, chatted up everyone, and ate good food, and then got buzz killingtond by lingrell and investment advice! Oh well fun stuff <br/>
<br/>
Day 3- I spent day 3 playing various non star wars games, watching football, discussing the state and future of the game with lingrell and watching elite swccg games by the top 8 players. It was nice to have a day to still hang with all the fun swccg dudes, yet not have to worry about a consolation event and all that. After the top 8 were done there was poker, and then after clayton snuck in a bad beat on me and I was knocked out, me and matt thornton decided to draft some cube. Apparently kafer has a 6th sense for cube and sniffed us out and we added him and shaw to the draft. Later olson and lingrell wanted in so we decided to actually run a consolation event as secret squirrel cube draft! Fun times for sure<br/>
<br/>
After that we said our teary eyed goodbyes and then me and fanchi went back to crash and left for dallas the next morning.<br/>
