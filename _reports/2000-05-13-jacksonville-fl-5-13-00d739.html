<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">       Well this is probably the 2nd tournament report I&amp;#8217;ve ever written(1st on DT) so be nice.<br/>
This tournament was at Big City CD&amp;#8217;s and Comics in Jacksonville FL which is located about <br/>
2 hours from where I live. I go to these about every other weekend so It was nothing new.<br/>
My brother(Louis) and I had to get up at like 8 a.m. as the start time was 11:00.  We have <br/>
a very uneventful trip and arrive with time to get something to eat at BK.<br/>
	A total of 10 people showed up which is pretty sucky and doesn&amp;#8217;t usually happen but <br/>
oh, well. On a high note like 6 of the people there were 1800+ players and there was 1 other<br/>
player with a 2000+ rating.  I&amp;#8217;m gonna go ahead and skip straight to the games as that&amp;#8217;s what<br/>
you probably want to hear.   <br/>
<br/>
O yeah, my decks: <br/>
LS: Throne Room Mains<br/>
DS: Raltiir Ops<br/>
I had a cool Hunt Down beatdown built but I decided not to use it.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs. Mitch Velasco(1795 or sumthin&amp;#8230;)/Ties <br/>
 He starts Death star which kept his strategy hidden for a few turns but when I saw Tie&amp;#8217;s I knew<br/>
what to do.  I got Obi down to the swamp and some shmoes to the CC:Lower Corrider and started getting the cards I needed to win.  He puts random spies w/Undercover to my sites and shuts down my drains and puts some stuff at Kiffex he also played Kashyyk.  I get out Order to Engage, Savrip, and the tank then deploy Tantive w/EPP Luke to the Milwaukee System and control it for most of the game.  Now he was using Tie scouts instead of the normal ones so he was getting choked w/the deploy bonus to them from the tie system.  I get out the super falcon and proceed to chase him around forcing him to battle and then murdering him w/tracked 5&amp;#8217;s and sensing all his junk.  It was pretty much game after that.<br/>
FW 2(+14) <br/>
<br/>
A good 1st match and he played pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs. Louis Cowart(1706)/Throne Room Mains<br/>
	This sucked.  I never like playin&amp;#8217; my bro but what are you gonna do.  I got a pretty good draw and he didn&amp;#8217;t so it was bad for him. I don&amp;#8217;t want get into this too much cuz&amp;#8217; in this matchup the winner is usually the one w/the better draw.  Plus we play all the time and I know<br/>
what to do.  I wrecked him and drew a lot so he wouldn&amp;#8217;t have an ass diff.<br/>
FW 4(+24)<br/>
<br/>
That stunk but it happens a lot so we&amp;#8217;re used to it and he takes it pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs. Louis Cowart (WTF!!)/Hunt Down Duel<br/>
	This was completely gay and I was pretty pissed but didn&amp;#8217;t show it(of course).  This was actually a much closer game and I was proud of my bro.  It was pretty funny as <br/>
All we did was sit there accumilating cards both wearing away from Visage.  One of us would deploy something and the other would beat it and it came down to my drain at the <br/>
lower corrider and a beat-down on Vader and Tarkin w/Luke and Han.  I came out on top again w/11 cards.<br/>
FW 6(+34)<br/>
<br/>
So by now there is only one other undefeated whom I will play.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs. Blake Senn(1870)/Profit<br/>
	I played against this 2 weeks ago so I wasn&amp;#8217;t scared.  Profit does good against Rops so I had to be careful.  In my opening hand I get 3 Twix locations so I&amp;#8217;m lookin&amp;#8217; good .  He flips 2nd turn uncontested and my turn 2 I activate &amp;#8220;14&amp;#8221; and get a generic then draw some.<br/>
His turn I loose a couple force and he draws.  I flip next turn and draw some more to get stuff to battle with.  His go and he deploys chewie to the AC(w/Ben w/stick and Gen.Han there)and Boushh to my Jungle and is done.  My turn I search my deck and pull trample and deploy Blizzard 2 w/Watts and Bliz.Scout 1 to JP. I move an AT-ST from another site to where Boushh is and before I can trample she jumps on it(a small mistake on my part). He goes and deploys Mos Eisley,Cantina,and Tat.db and puts Master w/stick to the db tthen he moves out of the AC to <br/>
where my stuff is.  I trample Han and go.  I pull trample from my deck and put an at-st pilot on B.S.1. then battle I have a 6 for destiny and hin a 4.  He loses Chewie and I lose at pilot then I move to Mos Eisley , draw some and am done.  He goes and plays han and Chewie to Cantina and draws some and is done.  I get decree runnin&amp;#8217; and it turns to a drain race which I&amp;#8217;m winning.  Late game Ig-88 comes down to where Han and Chewie are battle capture han <br/>
and kill chewie w/attrit and that was that.  Win by 15.<br/>
FW 8(+49)<br/>
<br/>
Well I won and every body got packs and I gave mine to my bro. All in all a fun day besides playin&amp;#8217; my bro twice but we both had fun.<br/>
<br/>
And now something I want to share:  CC packs were given out and some kid pulls a Smoke Screen that I can use so I give him a CC pack for then exit the store.  As we walk to the car the TD comes out and sez:<br/>
&amp;#8220;Hey Walter&amp;#8221;<br/>
Me-&amp;#8220;what&amp;#8221;<br/>
&amp;#8220;that pack you just gave him had a Cpt.Han in it&amp;#8221;<br/>
Crap. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading!<br/>
