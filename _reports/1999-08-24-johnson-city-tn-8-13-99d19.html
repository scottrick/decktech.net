<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, this is my first tournament, and it is a sad one, at least for me. Why? Well our local Squadron Member,<br/>
Clint Prong (Gold 93), is moving from Tennessee to Detroit. (sigh) He's the best TD I've ever been in a<br/>
tournament of, and to be honest, the other directors around here aren't the best at having tournaments alot.<br/>
Clint's the best :( So this was his last tournament before he moves. I have some new decks that I thought I'd try,<br/>
my LS was M&amp;T on Tatooine. I start with Obi's Hut, Careful Planning, and normally get Toshi Station, but if they<br/>
start Audience Chamber or Jabba's Palace I convert it. :) <br/>
<br/>
Dark Side was odd, I had been play testing a few decks online, and I had been destroyed by the new Revolver<br/>
deck. Hm. So I create a deck, start Death Star, Imperial Arrest Order to make my 11 or so ability &lt; 3 Imperials<br/>
+2 forfeit (Evax is 7!). I wasn't thinking at the time that these guys are easily hacked, choked by the wookie, or<br/>
even shot. Drat. Anyhoo onto the games. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - My Dark vs. Joseph using Clint's decks (Gr...)<br/>
Well overall, this game sucked. I was slightly displeased that Clint let a 8-9 year old use his decks, because that<br/>
gives him a card edge over me (lots of mains, EPP's, compared to the kid's real deck, HB with practically no<br/>
mains, I don't mind if he lets him borrow some cards but use his 1800+ rating decks? That's not fair! Gr. Well to<br/>
make a long story short he sensed/altered everything I had (Even with There Is No Try), and drained for 4 @<br/>
Obi's Hut, and other locations.<br/>
Lose by 22. 0(-22). <br/>
Highlights: None.<br/>
Lowlights: I later found out that the kid was rated 1830+, but it's because he uses decks made by other people,<br/>
which annoys me, because this was the only regional qualifer I even had a chance to make, and this<br/>
automatically took me out of contention... <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - My Light vs. Andy's HDADTJ deck with odd characters...<br/>
I was in last place for dark in Round 1, so I play against the lowest Light player. He starts normal HDADTJ stuff,<br/>
and Secret Plans. I start Hut, Station. I got an awesome hand. Leia Organa, Revolution, Bacta Tank, Smoke<br/>
Screen, Goo Nee Tay, and some other stuff. He deploys Cantina, Hoth Defensive Perimeter his first turn,<br/>
nothing else. I deploy Goo Nee Tay, Bacta Tank, Leia to Visage's location (just went blank), cancel it. I had just<br/>
enough force (7) to get Tank and Leia out. Next turn Trooper Davin Felth and the Grand Moff (no Vader yet)<br/>
come down and stomp on her, but she goes to the tank to cover the damage. Next turn I bring her to my hand,<br/>
decide against deploying her alone to the Station, so I draw a few. He deploys Vader next turn with some guys<br/>
to Cantina. I deploy Leia and a H'nemthe to Station, and a few locations, draw a couple. I got EPP Obi, Obi's<br/>
Saber, Speeder Bike, and Harc Seff. I bite the drain of 2, he draws. I deploy EPP Obi, H'nemthe piloting the<br/>
Bike, and Harc Seff to Obi's Hut (next door to Cantina). Obi is made a passenger. I draw, leave 2 force, his<br/>
objective is flipped back. He drains, I reduce, deployed like 1 guy to cantina. Again, long story short I beat him<br/>
out with a revo on the hut, Luke and Anakin's Saber, and just drain him out. Win by 17 2(-1).<br/>
Highlights: I actually won a game! <br/>
Lowlights: None really. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My Dark vs. Chad's Rescue the Princess Elom/Plastoid Armor Deck<br/>
This was probably my greatest moment in SW:CCG for me yet. Read on, eager reader ;-).<br/>
He starts normal RTP stuff, Princess Organa in the D* Dention Block. He deploys Bargaining Table first turn,<br/>
and a Talz and Elom to the D* DB I believe. I look at my hand. 2 characters. DS-61-4 and Admiral Motti. I<br/>
deploy them to the Dention Cell, take Leia into custody, because she was a bad girl :-). Next turn he deploys<br/>
Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, and I think another Talz to the docking bay, and moves over. I am really<br/>
worried at the moment. If I stay, he deploys more stuff, kicks around my guys. I move over, he deploys a bunch of<br/>
Eloms, beats up my guys, gets Leia back. I look at my hand. Ah! Vader's Personnel Shuttle! I am thinking evil<br/>
thoughts, and I am sitting next to Clint, so I poke him and ask if I moved them over if I could fly that out on the<br/>
same turn, with Leia inside, to the Death Star System. He says, go for it, holding back a laugh. I am holding<br/>
back a giggle myself (hehe) deploy the shuttle, move the guys over, move them on the shuttle, and the Rebels<br/>
get a sad look on their faces as the shuttle flies out to the Death Star to hang around. The look on his face,<br/>
perfect. He knows he can't get her back, it's not possible. If he actually got to the Death Star with ships, I'd just<br/>
lose the shuttle to damage, and there goes Leia. :-) So he spreads out to drain. My deck is also a drain deck,<br/>
drain for as much as possible, battle when needed. But I use almost all Imps, so I decide I don't want to take on<br/>
power 4 eloms. I eventually get DLOTS and Jabba the Hutt out to Tusken Canyon, Blizzard Scout 1 with Lt.<br/>
Arnet piloting and Commander Gherant sitting outside. I had U-3P0 at D* Docking Bay, he got out Cloud City<br/>
DB, had some Eloms, Talz with Plastoid Armor draining at my Port Town District. I follow with U-3P0. I also had<br/>
Chief Retwin out at another drain so he couldn't drain, or battle him. I eventually figure that he could actually win<br/>
this drain game, so I spread out. I have 3 Tatooine locations out, Lar's Farm, Tusken Canyon, and Jundland<br/>
Wastes. Vader and Jabba move over to Tat: DB to block that drain, Arnet stays in Blizzard Scout 1, Gherant<br/>
moves to Jundland Wastes, and Lt. Grond goes to Lar's Farm. I also got out DS-61-2 piloting Blizzard 1<br/>
@Endor: Back Door with POTF on it, for a constant drain of 3. In the end, I out drain him. Win by 8. 4(+7).<br/>
Highlights: Doing that thing with Leia. :-) Actually getting into the positive differential column!<br/>
Lowlights: Nothing! <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - My Light vs. Rematch - Chad's FLOPS deck!<br/>
We have a rematch! He starts Executor: Docking Bay, and Dreaded Imperial Starfleet. I start my normal of Hut,<br/>
Station. I got another good start hand. I get Bacta Tank out first turn (again). 2nd turn deploy Orrimarrko to the<br/>
Station (I deployed another site also). He quickly sets up his 5 Executor Sites with Commander Gherant (about<br/>
4th turn I had a Revolution and really wanted to go smack down Gherant, but decided against it for some<br/>
reason, could've probably won the game there too). I get out Ultimatium also, and a bunch of my Tatooine sites.<br/>
I get out the H'nemthe's, Speeder Bike with Harc Seff piloting and Obi-Wan Kenobi with his saber also. I get out<br/>
Figrin D'an, Chewbacca, and something else at a Revolutioned hut. I have Speeder Bike and company, and<br/>
Luke Skywalker w/ Anakin's at Jundland Wastes, draining away. He gets out Executor, FLOPS, some TIE's. I<br/>
altered Dreaded later on. He deploys a 2/1 system and Coruscant, and has a drain of 2 going on (ouch! : ). He<br/>
eventually gets DLOTS and Admiral Motti at the station, but not enough to battle! I had the Speeder Bike there<br/>
with company, Luke, Obi, deployed Han, deployed Leia Organa. I snicker to myself. I battle, play Skywalkers, I<br/>
Know, hack Admiral Motti, miss Vader, and draw 5 destiny. I end up with power 33 with 17 attrition to his 15<br/>
with 6 attrition. That pretty much ends the game, he drains for a few at his now 3 systems, I spread out and drain<br/>
him to death. Win by 11 6(+18).<br/>
Highlights: A lot ;-)<br/>
Lowlights: Not being able to Alter his Dreaded 2nd turn (missed 2 times with Orrimarrko, gr). Heh that's about it!<br/>
<br/>
Overall, not a wonderful tournament, I've had alot better. It still annoys me that I know I could have beaten that 9<br/>
year old... gr. <br/>
<br/>
I got a big whooping 1 pack of prize support, got Help Me Obi-Wan Kenobi... woo hoo, my 3rd. But I did trade a<br/>
Commander Luke for a GMT (finally got him!). <br/>
