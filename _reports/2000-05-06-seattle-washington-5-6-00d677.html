<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I've decided to name this tourney report 'Mystery packs are DAMN cool, and Joe Olson can kiss my ass.'<br/>
I thought I had my decks picked weeks ago, TDIGWATT with At-St pilots and ORS, and Speeder ops. However,<br/>
the week before the tourney I build this pretty solid Occupation DS, and the night before the tourney<br/>
I built this funky HB with OPMDH that flips, a combination of Falke and Lush. (Sorta). I get there and<br/>
everyone is set to go Charles 'Teacher' Hickey (the TD) says some crap that he thinks is important but<br/>
no one really cares. (Such is the level of respect Charles gets;). And here we go.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My HB V.S. Sean Estes Probe Droid ISB.<br/>
Sean starts Coruscant:Imperial square and IAO and I start HB suff with Insurrection.<br/>
Sean drops C:DB and draws. I drop a couple of systems, H:DB and draw. Sean drops Endor:FC, Endor:DB<br/>
and draws. I drop a system, Redemption+Melas to Chandrilla, and draw. Sean drops Tempest Scout 1, AT-ST pilot,<br/>
Piett, fetchs 2 probe droids, and draws. I drop my last system, get Luke set up for OMDH (just in case) and say go.<br/>
Sean drops EPP Vader, a AT-ST, two probe droids to C:DB, transers to Endor:DB, and draws. (Indeed I was confused at the move).<br/>
I drop Boshek to Tantive at Tibrin, and draw. Sean finally flips and moves away his Coruscant crew to Endor, and moves the <br/>
people on Endor to the Forest Clearing, and draws. I drop a Spaceport DB to Coruscant, Orrimaarko there, then I move<br/>
them to the Imperial Square. Sean drains, then drops Igar+Tempest 1 to Corusant along with some probe droids then battles,<br/>
draws low but still clears out Maarko I drop EPP Obi to Tatooine DB, then draw and say go. Sean deploys Security Precautions<br/>
and says go. I drain and flip, Tawss with Obi, then complete a OMDH for 8, say go. Sean drains, puts all his people on Endor and<br/>
says go. I move Luke back to Tatooine, and draw. Sean drops BiHT and FiS1 to Luke, battles. I react with Spiral and he loses Bossk,<br/>
I lose spiral and one more from reserve, Captain Han. My turn I drain, use Tibrin and get back Han, deploy him to Falcon and a OMDH.<br/>
Battle, Fett dies. I retrieve 9 from OMDH and say go. Now here is where a HUGE mistake was made. Sean plays something called 'probe<br/>
telementary, and tells me OMDH is out of play. I examine the card and let him do this, then learn later that he was supposed to grab<br/>
NON-UNIQUES!!! ARRGHH! Oh well. He drains, retreives, my turn. I drain and say go. Sean never probes the whole game, and never spreads<br/>
out. Against Hidden Base that is fatal, and I win by 8. (Although it should have been a HUGE win).<br/>
Full win by 8<br/>
2(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Sticking a docking bay on Coruscant then draining for 3 at the Imperial square.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:Screwing up on Probe Telementary.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS Occupation V.S. some-guy-who-won't-let-me-use-his-name MWYHL ship mains?<br/>
I start Tatooine and Jabba's Palace, he starts MWYHL and Insurrection. I have a awesome<br/>
opening hand. ECC 4-Lom, Djahs, Jundland Wastes, Vader, Sense, it just ruled. Anyway, I drop<br/>
Djahs+4-Lom to Wastes, grab AU and say go. He goes through for a site and pulls...THE JUNGLE??!!<br/>
At this point I feel pretty confident. He draws and says go. I drain, drop Mara and her Saber to the<br/>
AU, draw T Occupation, Evazan, Tarkin, all the hunter ships except Zuckuss and Vade's sabe. Coool. He drop<br/>
Boshek and 2 of thos SE pilots to Jabba's Palace, my turn. I drop Vader, Tarkin, Occupation, Evazan, stick, and<br/>
BiHt and DiPO (I had some force saved). I battle, operate on some guy, Boshek is left with 3 options:Mara beat,<br/>
hunter beat, or Vader Tarking beat:). Instead, he drops some backup, battles, all his guys die. I drain and<br/>
Occupation, hitting hit him for 9 force! I say go. he drop Dantooine and SE Leia there, an Arcona at Jabba's<br/>
Palace, TK to Mara, my turn. I drain for 2, Occupation, drop FiS1 to Tattoine, the Arcona reacts away. He<br/>
does nothing, my turn. I drain and Occupation, FiS1 goes to Dantooine. He drops a Corvetta and GLi1 to Fett,<br/>
but can't battle. I drain, occupation, battle with Fett. I draw high he draws low, Fett and Gold Leader stay.<br/>
He deploys D:Swamp, SOS, and Yoda to the Jungle, and says go. I drain, Occupation, a final battle against GL<br/>
wins it for me.<br/>
Full Win by 36<br/>
4(+44)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:My opening hand rocked.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:His deck confused me, even for a newbie.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:DS Occupation V.S. Steven Harpster's ASP Y4 start.<br/>
I start same as last game (duh) and Steven starts Y4 War room,<br/>
swamp and farm. I get Mara in my opening hand, grab AU, drop <br/>
Mara to the war room and get her Saber, his turn. He drops 2 ASP <br/>
droids, a Nudj, and a arc welder on one of the ASP droids. He <br/>
complements himself (as Steven often does) and Revos the war room,<br/>
good move. My turn, I drop Vader+stick and Evazan to the AU, and say<br/>
go. Steve just draws and says go. I drain and move Vader/Evazan to the<br/>
Lar's Moisture farm, his turn. Steve re-revs the War room, snickers, and<br/>
says go. I drain, then snicker and Elis Mara to the Jundland wastes and<br/>
Steven laments (yells is more like it) about me ruining his plan. I drop<br/>
Exand the Empire on Moistuire farm, Tarkin to Vader and Evazan gets on a<br/>
speeder bike. Occupation goes down (unattended) and it's his turn. He drops<br/>
EPP Leia+Obi to Mara, battles. I react with Dr.E and miss the swing on Kenobi<br/>
(DAMN) then sense his Jedi Presence. EPP Obi is left. my turn I drain, Occupation,<br/>
then Igar in Tempest 1 comes down and whacks Obi. Steve deploys EPP Leia to the War<br/>
room, (after sending the arc welders on top of his reserve deck) and plays On the<br/>
Edge twice, retrieving 10 force. I drain and Occupation, his turn. He deploys another<br/>
Arc welder, and I finally notice that Arc Welders have to deploy on a R-Unit. Steve gets<br/>
a horrified look on his face, swears, then inserts AFA. Well, in short, he never comes to<br/>
Tatooine again, has no ships in his decks, and his inserts don't do enough damage.<br/>
Full Win by 29<br/>
6(+73)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:I am beginning to like Occupation, and Steve is a pretty cool and fun to play.<br/>
<br/>
Lows:Steve getting embarresed and making a mistake like that, I felt sorry for him. (But<br/>
not so sorry that I wasn't going to kick his ass :P).<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS V.S. Nick Jone's Huntdown SAC.<br/>
Nick starts HD stuff and Security Precautions. I start the same.<br/>
Nick's deck is known for huge force drains very quickly. I get a<br/>
crap openining hand with 4, 4 of my 6 systems, in hand. Crap. Nick<br/>
drops Jundland Wastes, my turn. I drop Alderran and Echo docking bay,<br/>
then draw a Trans term.YESS!! Nick swears, then drops Vader+stick and<br/>
flips. I drop my 4 systems, Han at Tatooine, Boussh to Vader, draw. Nick<br/>
drops another Cantina, then draws. I drop a &lt;&gt;DB to Chandrilla, EPP Obi to<br/>
flip his Obj. then draw. Nick drains, draws. I drop Han at Tatooine on Falcon,<br/>
Nick's turn. he attempts to Sniper Leia, I sense, he alters, I sense, he controls.<br/>
Bastard! He succeeds, Leia dies and I get drained. He drops POTF and draws. I don't <br/>
really want to, but I flip and put Tawss+Nadon and E:Holotheatre. Nick doesn't drain,<br/>
draws, my turn. I complete a OMDH for 9, draw. Nick drops Executor and I Hyper escape<br/>
Melas and Tantive away, he goes to Roche. I drain, he probes successfuly, and I lose<br/>
my just retrevied 9. I wedge him down to 12, but a huge drain of 4 and 3 is too hard to<br/>
deal with.<br/>
FL-12<br/>
6(+61)<br/>
<br/>
The highs:Good game with lots of strategy.<br/>
<br/>
The lows:Nothing much.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:My DS Occupation V.S. Joe !!!(SCRUB)!!! Olson's Matt Lush OMDH.<br/>
He stars HB and Insurrection, I start the usual.<br/>
Joe and I always joke about how we never play each other, and it's about<br/>
time. This whole game was just me trying to keep up. Joe's deck had 5 senses,<br/>
3 alters, and 4 controls, my own SA looked pathetic. He was also packing 4<br/>
tunnel visions, so by his 5 turn he had out the Super Falcon, EPP Luke+Ben<br/>
combo, and was retrieving  9 every other turn. I did my best to keep up, but<br/>
Savrip just killed me. Djahs against Orrimaarko at the Cantine: It takes Joe <br/>
about 7 turns to draw a 3, but I draw at least 3 every time, Savrip. I drop<br/>
DiPO and BiHT to Falcon, Savrip again. Ben and Luke took over the palace, and I<br/>
was dumb and didn't draw up when I should have.<br/>
Full loss by 41.<br/>
6(+20)<br/>
<br/>
The Highs:Playing Joe, the WA state champ. I think Joe is not a better player than<br/>
me, but he is ten times the deck builder I am. (Plus a HUGE scrub copycat;)<br/>
<br/>
The Lows: I'd like to tell Joe where to shove his Savrip.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My LS V.S. Michael (Not even going to try spelling last name) Yavin Occupation<br/>
I start my stuff, he starts Yavin 4, jungle and desert.<br/>
Mike and I exchange turns of drawing, until I drop EPP Obi to the Desert. Mara comes down,<br/>
Obi dies. I drop another Obi and Orrimaarko, we tie, and Obi is now in the tank. AT-ST pilot <br/>
at the Jungle, Mara gets a toy, my turn. I get set up for OMDH, then Mike alters it like a punk!!<br/>
I battle Mara, Maarko dies because my destiny has turned against me. Mike drains then drops Occupation<br/>
and ZiMH. I cancel Occpuation with E celebration, then start dropping ability 4 scrubs to Yavin. I get<br/>
battled off, and a laterally damaged transport dies a horrible death, followed by me. (I never got off 1<br/>
OMDH the whole game)!!!!<br/>
Full Loss by 18<br/>
Final Score: 6(+2)<br/>
<br/>
I go 3-3 and come like in 9th or 10th out of 23. Not bad, not great. Now, remeber the title of this report?<br/>
Well, Hickey used the prize money to draft rares out of boxes of SE, along with some donated WB premiere and<br/>
a Mara Jade. Also among the prizes were 3 'mystery packs'. Intresting. By the time I got to the prize table I<br/>
saw all the best stuff was taken (DLOTS, BEN, ORS)...or was it? I grab a mystery pack it is the ultimate Luke<br/>
set. Master Luke, Anakin's Saber, The Force is Strong with This one, I must be allowed to speak, an Lightsaber<br/>
profiency. Cool. very cool. You rock Hickey, and so do your Mystery packs!!<br/>
<br/>
That's it, hope I didn't offend anybody (except Joe) and I will catch you all next tourney!<br/>
