<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The tournament was held in Geelong, about an hour's drive from where I live, and the tournament director was Terry Lyons.  There were 11 people who played.<br/>
<br/>
LS: Super-Falcon deck that drains for 2 or 3 in space, and does lots of direct damage (Uncontrollable Fury, Legendary Starfighter etc.)<br/>
DS: 'No Subtlety' - I'll probably post it in the decks section very soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, LS vs Adam Amy<br/>
He started Hunt Down and Ability, Ability Ability. I cancelled Visage first turn w/ a Transmission Terminated, and on my turn deployed Yoda from reserve to cancel AAA.  I then got my tests done quickly, limiting his drains - He had Vader at the Back Door, but after POAS came down, he was only draining for 1, and 2 at the cantina later on.  I had playtested against his deck, and i knew it was just suicide to send EPP Obi to the Cantina, and since I had Uncontrollable Fury on Vader at the time, I didn't want to flip his objective back (otherwise he could've picked up Vader into hand, eliminating UF).  I got On THe Edge going, and pretty soon retrieved my entire lost pile.  He also got Failure at the Cave going, but that was ineffective (his drains were only at the pub and the back door).  There was an attempt to battle the falcon, but Star Destroyer and Punch It! and Out Of Nowhere eliminated that (5 battle destiny does that :)  My Battle Plan also force him to pay for his drain, and I was using Electrobinocs to draw my one and only ICBW each turn, and play each one.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win +38<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, DS vs David Martin<br/>
He started Bespin, then Careful Planning'ed for the Guest Quarters.  HE had lots of 2/2 guys, KFC, etc., draining for alittle on the ground, but I just drained in space (activating 15-20 force, Battle Plan wasn't a problem).  He tried to set up Celebration, but Lateral Damage and a few star destroyers stopped that, and then i sent Brangus Glee on a suicide run against a lone Lando (draining for 2 at his corridor).  I was also able to use the corrdior which lets me cancel his drains against him with Snuggle Bear at first and an Imperial Helmsman later.  U3PO made an entrance, and made a quick exit too thanks to SATM.  <br/>
<br/>
Full Win +22<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS vs Alastair R.<br/>
He started Hidden Base, and I knew my deck was pretty strong against HB.  Soon, he got out Raltiir, which pleased me no end (Capital Starships deploy -2 here - thank you very much!), followed by the Bespin System and clouds to Bespin.  ABC curtailed his drains, POTF got some of my drains to be a little bigger, and his own Battle Plan hurt himself as he was never able to occupy a battleground system for very long.  He also did Rebel Fleet and Bargaining Table which was annoying, but there wasn't much I could do about it.  Soon, a lone Red Squadron X-Wing arrive at one of the clouds (the others had YT-300 freighters + RFCs who drew destinies), so the Death Star Assault Squadron and a LAteral Damage killed that off plus another 10 force.  Next turn, he threw two freighters at Ralltiir, I Imperial Barriered the second, stopping him from battling the Tyrant with a Helmsman.  That turn he also moved a freighter from Rendezvous Point to Kessel (it had been deployed with a Landing Claw, before TRWEU eliminated the claw).  On my turn, I converted KEssel, deployed the Executor and a Death Squadron Star Destroyer and a Lateral Damage, making him lose 16 force, and the game.  He did also have a CC site out with EPP Luke and a couple of gas miners, but nothing an undercover spy couldn't handle.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win +22<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, LS vs David Martin<br/>
He started Ice Plains (or possibly Wampa Cave, i don't remember) and the third marker with the new starting interrupt.  Zuckuss arrived with Tempest Scout 4 or something, but POAS followed, making the drain only 1 for a turn, before Jedi Test #1 was complete, making it a drain for 0.  He deployed some Tatooine locations (the LMF) and Vader, so i deployed a POAS there too, and Uncontrollable Fury on Vader.  Soon, the cantina arrived, and I was able to track my solitary ICBW, so I was losing no force.  Some ships did come to take on the Falcon, I thought I had him, played I know and Punch It, drew 8 destiny, only to see him play Wounded Wookiee...I had to forfeit Captain Han, while he lost a ship.  On my turn, I activated almost everything, Tunnel Visioned for Captain Han, re-deployed him, played I Know and cleared out the system.  Consequently, the Falcon became Legendary, and he was losing force pretty quickly.  On The Edge retrieved all my force, and it was a whole lot closer than the final scoreline of +28 reflected<br/>
<br/>
Full Win +28<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, DS vs Adam Amy<br/>
He was playing Brentson's Beats (or a variation on that), I deployed 3 star destroyers at the DSAS at the DeathSTar with a total power of 40, draining for 1 with POTF.  I had used ABC to stop his drains of Tatooine in conjunction with Dark Waters (he didn't get a ground drain in all game).  He came along with a loaded falcon, drew 9 battle destiny and cleared out my stuff.  For the rest of the game I was just running away and stuff, battling here and there 'cause of Order To Engage (and losing lots of starships to multiple destiny), before I eventually finished him off with his own Draw Their Fire.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win +7<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, LS vs Keith Lockwood<br/>
He was playing a very good deck, and playing it well.  He got Secret PLans out for my On The Edges, Lateral Damage for the Falcon, IAO to give his pilots forfeit bonuses, TBHTP for It Could Be Worse, AAA, and lots of starships.  I could handle any 1, probably any 2, it'd be close if he had any 3, but he had 'em all.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss - 15<br/>
<br/>
Game 7, DS vs Jared (?)<br/>
He started Chief Chirpas Hut, and Rebel Landing Site.  He deployed some Ewoks to the Hut.  I was deploying some systems, and got a drain of 2 out somewhere.  He moved his ewoks across, to the landing site, so i played Dark Waters.  He deployed another site, moved his Ewoks across, so I played Dark Waters.  He deployed another site, moved his Ewoks across, so I played Dark Waters.  He then got Obi + Saber out at one of the sites, so I deployed ABC.  Soon, he got out the Back Door and General Han/Chewie of Kashyyyk, so U3PO arrived.  Eventually he got a steady drain of 1 at the generic forest site, and since I had enough cards in hand to cover the drain, I didn't worry, since I was draining for 5 in space.  I had a really good draw, and he didn't have any starships, to even contest my space drains.  I had been holding the Executor, an Imperial Barrier, a DSSD and a Lateral Damage from early on, so it was probably a wise move...<br/>
<br/>
Full Win +33<br/>
<br/>
I ended up 12+135, and in first place, and won a WB Premiere Obi, Obi's Saber and some other related rares + a couple of boosters, which was quite nice.<br/>
