<blockquote><font class="bfont"> So I decided to write a TR because I think they are great for the game and they keep people interested in your area and what not. I used to get at least two volunteers from my tournaments to always write reports but those days are long gone. Anyways, I will keep my games short until I get to the Day 2 event because I played 25 games over the weekend and frankly I cant remember all of them.<br>
<br>
<u><font size='"+3"'>Worlds 2000 Format</font></u><br>
<br>
I was a little disappointed in the turnout especially since it was $500 up for grabs but what can you do. Decks: Raltiir Troopers originally designed by Bastian with a couple different card choices by Hayes and some of Hunters suggestions. LS was Clint Hayes Deadbolt with 4 DBs and a Lost In The Wilderness.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 1  James Booker MWYHL</b><br>
This game was the toughest and most fun game of the tournament. Not only because Booker is a hoot but we had some good stuff going on. I spread with goof troopers early and pulled Search and Destroy out turn 2 to apply the pressure. Seems like it worked because Booker didnt know what to do against it. I couldnt find any of my battle evasion but had a lot of troopers and tactical supports for the counter beat. I know he would get me for 5-10 but I could get him for 15-20 if I played my cards right. He took the bait and deployed Melas and Obi. I think I took about 8 overflow or so. I retaliated with a bunch of troopers but I couldnt get the serious hitters together and I went for the game ender and tried swinging Obi instead of Melas. I missed oops. So instead of a lot of overflow I dont do much and I couldnt find a Trooper Assualt. He really doesnt do much after that besides insert a couple, I started Resistance, and drain in space a little. It started looking like he was going to get me but then he had to go to ground and start landing Han and Luke etc. I used my First strike and his Draw their fire to win by 8.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 2  Derek Chngs ISB</b><br>
This game was actually pretty quick and painful. I decided not to start There Is No Try against him because it is ISB, right? Well, that was a giant mistake. He sensed everything I played. I was activating 3 force for a long time and couldnt get A New Secret Base up. I was getting pretty discouraged. After about 10 turns I finally get EBO deployed but he doesnt have a lost pile and an ORS at every location including mine. I deploy Falcon with Calrissian. Next turn comes down Lat damage, DiP1, Zuckuss and ORS. That was fun. I basically do what I can to do to make him to deploy more cards to reduce the diff. The main problem with this deck is its consistency, when it doesnt have its sh!t together it is horrible but when it is rolling and setup it is a Picasso. FL by 19. <br>
<br>
<b>Game 3  Kyle McLins Careful Planning Bespin</b><br>
Once I saw his start I figured I was in pretty good shape. I got troopers spread all over the place. I had a Barrier this time and S&amp;D was going. Shortly after I got Palpatine with Overseeing it Personally and Janus out and I was rolling. He deployed some clouds and cars and I started getting worried, how much did he tech against ROps? Obviously, not much because he had to read my objective He couldnt really do anything and when it was over he had Life Debt and Skywalkers in hand for the beat but I refused to battle like a good little boy. FW by 32<br>
<br>
<b>Game 4  Dave Hanns ROP Troopers</b><br>
I was thinking man, another tough game but I can pull it out as long as I can get ANSB up and running. Luckily I had a god draw against him. EPP obi, Signal, Starship and other goodies. He deploys Tagge by himself and I am thinking this is really hard core troopers and then a little leery of Dark Jedi Presence silliness. I get setup rather quickly and then he decides to deploy an Imperial Commander by himself to a Spaceport site. I come down with Frozen Assets and Luke, JK. He had nothing and I overflowed him of around 8 or so. He draws. I deploy Obi on Tagge and 8 more overflow coming his way. He draws and Orrimarko comes down with a Calrissian in Falcon and Wedge in ship. Drain for 9 next turn and thats game. FW by 29.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 5  Geoff Dearings Profit</b><br>
Once I saw his objective I knew this was getting to be a long battle, he was going to retrieve a lot and most importantly I couldnt get greedy and play smart. For some reason it seemed like I got the exact same draw against everyone that day. Bursk to the Precinct Office and DS-614 to the DB and another random to a &lt;&gt; site. I really cant remember what exactly I had but I know I put the pressure on extremely fast since he didnt start Battle Plan and I started There I No Try because I didnt want to get blown out by SAC again. Wise choice since he started ditching it right away to soak up force drain damage. He attacked me with Obi and Melas but I had the barrier. I battled after I played all of the silly biker scouts. Unlike against Booker I had the trooper Assualt this time. He had a power of about 5 to my 20 something. Cause a little overflow. He plays two projections and gets out his Battle Plan. I drain where I can, and search for Overseeing it Personally. When Hunter first mentioned that card I dismissed it but it is actually huge in this deck. He flips and just has Luke and Han. I do various EPP Vader hit and runs and clear out anything on Tatooine. He tries to fight me on Raltiir with Melas and Obi again but this time I had Main Course and his power is 3 to my 20 something. I then drain him out and win by 19.<br>
<br>
<b>Game 6  Chris Fanchis ROP Troopers</b><br>
I must say Chris is one the unluckiest persons that I know. I think Thomas Whaley has more bad luck in swccg cards but Chris has more bad luck in general. This game I get the complete God draw and setup basically my 2nd turn, meanwhile he cant find any evasion and we know each others deck inside out. He deploys several guys and stock piled and deploys a bike and a retard aboard it. My turn I deploy a starship at three systems for a total of 1 force, Frozen Assets and Obi and battle 10 go off the top. He tries to fight back but missed his swing with Vader. I drain for 6 and deploy Jedi Luke and Assets again, courtesy of Ketwol and he loses control of the Office and flip him back. He tries to battle in space but my tricks are too great for him and I loop On The Edge for about 3 turns and he then just draws up. FW by 22.<br/>
<br/>
Since Booker defeated Eric Hunter in the last game, that has me tied with him in victory points but I am not too sure for differential. I check to see what the score is and for some reason Chris Gogolen decided to check the tally. Eric has me but upon further review from the booth, Chris reverses the call as there is a 10 yard penalty so I eeck it out in a close one that shouldve had a final and score $300.<br/>
<br/>
<u><font size='"+3"'>2009 Worlds Team Tournament</font></u><br/>
<br/>
My teammate is James Barnes and we decide to play some stuff that is good but at the same time something really annoying. Decks: We decide to play Senate for both sides. The senates arent really anything special but his is basically my list from Dantooine Regionals and my DS is kind of silly with a bunch of IHYNs to blow out Luke Skywalker V for WYS. Our team name is Thomas Whaley Drunk Before Noon.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 1  Jan Westergards WYS</b><br/>
So I hear Jan is an excellent Step player and I know this matchup is pretty tough even with all the correct tools Senate has. He doesnt start Scrambled so I can breathe a sigh of relief. He goes pretty quick with Luke to the system but I dont have any starships to contest him plus I need to set up the senate. For several turns I have Mara Jade in the Cantina draining for 4 and eating up most of my resources. While I am cancelling his Tatooine or DB drain, he had Boshek and the +1 at DBs AO out. Luckily I had the old smuggler shield or he would be way ahead in this matchup. He cant play anything he wanted to twice for a couple of force. He was having trouble getting matching ships together and was Miraxing every turn. I eventually go hard to Naboo with Baron/gun, Dengar and Bossk. He really cant do anything to me. I shoot and he only gets a destiny while I get 3 and I have at least 20 attrition, thanks to toonbuck, dengar and the senate effect. Alas, he thinks he can do something against me and time was getting thin. I was catching up draining for 6 and he was only draining for 2. He moves half of his fleet in front of mine. I shoot Luke with a tracked 5, good thing because he had the retort. I cause 20+ attrition, I think it was 26 or something silly and I lose nothing. My turn I basically take the two ships and leave Baron behind. Time was called shortly after. He had 18 to my 16 I think. We both agree he thinks I win in the long run since he couldnt find his Falcon.  TL by 18. James gets a TW over Booker while they were both playing Senate.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 2  John Veezs LSC</b><br/>
I played against Veez in East Nationals and he beat my Wookiee pile so I was ready for redemption. I saw LSC and I immediately thought I had the game in the bag, due to Baskol and draining at Naboo. So I go with Baron/Gun to Naboo like 2nd turn to start the damage fast and furious. This goes on a couple of turns and I read Aks Moe gametext and I can drain for +1 where I have a capital. So I thought I didnt read close enough and it said I have to occupy a related site and I knew that wasnt going to happen for a while until I could track some destinies. Well, Veez has Bravo Fighter and Landing Claw and I basically sink in my chair. My drain of 4 is completely gone and now all I have is the drain at the Senate (for some reason he never played simple tricks), Baskol damage and Yeb Yeb which essentially is killing me as well. While he drains for 4 at the sites and doesnt have to pay. This goes on for a long time until I start getting all of my Jedi and IHYNs. I clear stuff away and retrieve with First Strike when I can. The game is getting extremely close and I do the math if I drain and then I can do Yeb Yeb to kill him off while I survive or he would kill me off with a drain of 2 and 2. I pay to drain and kill him with Yeb Yeb. I forgot how awesome that card is. FW by 4. James won his game against Mark Peterson.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 3  Greg Shaws RST</b><br/>
I see his objective and I am like, I have only played against this jank once ever and I am not sure what to do. I quickly figured out that I cant allow him to blow the bunker, no matter what. I set up the senate while he just draws a bunch. I grab his Throw Me Another Charge for no reason, besides I figured it was important for some reason or another. I actually was scared of about 10 OCCs. I went down with Maul w saber first turn and cleared out a bunch of jabronies. Actually Greg is really cool because I had no idea what any of the cards did. He said, I cant let you make all of the charges go used. I realize this and say I am not going to kill Maul yet and lost a force because of power. He loses one guy, I lose another force, he loses another guy that was hit, I lost another force and loses his last guy due to Toonbuck being a champ and all of the charges go used and I kill Maul. He plays OCC and gets him. Yikes! This goes on for quite a while. Gemmeperor, Darth Vader thrice, Mara and even Zuckuss V. He simply was losing too many guys compared to my stuff. IHYN is absolutely huge. I took out Obi with saber, Screaming Han, Luke with Stick and Boush and took no battle damage. I finally run out of characters but the drain for 4 at Naboo is too much the entire time. FW by 17. James won his game against Tacobill and things are looking great for us.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 4  Garrett Larsons WYS</b><br/>
Great another WYS. I was expecting a lot of it today and tomorrow, so I knew it was going to be another grind and I couldnt make any mistakes. Garrett always plays a little offbeat stuff so I wasnt too sure what to expect. I set up the senate and go with a free Maul first turn and move to his DB to apply the quick pressure. He comes down with Luke and saber, WTF??? Earlier in the day he was talking about destroying HDV with his WYS by Han, Chewie and life debt so I quickly realize his space is insufficient against this matchup. I go Tat system with ship after ship and he cant do anything about it. I get Gemmeperor to the cantina for some fryage. He really cant do anything as he tries to put stuff together. I miss my zapping against Boshek and Melas but he draws a zero and didnt play HFTMF out of lost. We both agree that is a huge mistake and cost him the game. I counter beat on Melas and he looses about 8 overflow. After that he really cant do anything as I have a 5 tracked for Palpy and zaps Melas as soon as he is deployed. The drain for 4 at the system is too much to handle. FW by 13. James won his game against Brian Herold and we make it into the finals as the first place team!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Bonus Game  Kevin Shannons HB</b><br/>
I had no clue what his deck was trying to do but I know the only way I could do damage is at systems as I dont have a BG site in my deck. I get some stuff step up and play Baron/gun and start to drain but he is just running around consolidating ships until he eventually flies to Kirdo III and starts grabbing Kitonaks, sandwhirls and Deserts out of his deck. I know where this is going extremely fast as I see Uh Oh on the table. I think for a while and decide I cant touch his 5 ships of 40+ power and not to mention a Heroic guy and I cant do anything against the sandwhirls. I force him to draw more cards before he realizes I am going to draw up. I played about 2 minutes and Kevin played about 10 minutes and I drew about 30 cards to end the misery. James also lost his game against Aarons Mystril which might be unwinnable as well. We got crapped on and basically get no prize support because the last place guys got all of the good stuff while James and I got TC-14 x2.<br/>
<br/>
So I went 8-3 and would have actually won one of them if time wasnt called. If I can perform like this tomorrow I will be on cloud nine<br/>
<br/>
<u><font size='"+3"'>2009 Worlds Day 2</font></u><br/>
<br/>
Decks: I decided to run with the same Senate I have been running because I think TRM and WYS will be heavily teched against and Senate will fall under the radar. But minutes before the tournament I want to switch to WYS. I dont have all of the slips cut out and I decide it is too much to ask for my buddies to cut out and find slips so I revert back to the Senate and take out Endor and put in Kiffiex, thanks to BFreds advice. For dark I had a princess of a time trying to figure out what to play but everyone was saying the same thing. I just thought the joke was on me and was going to get clownstomped by everyone. I was going to play the same senate at the last minute but James didnt bring it with him. I dont have anything else built besides a TTO I built as backup with no slips. John Anderson, Brian Herold, Garrett Larson and James Barnes find everything and helps me assemble my deck. Thanks guys, you rock! <br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 1  Justin Desais HD</b><br/>
First game and I am in knee deep already. This is going to be a fun day especially since I have never played a single game with my DS deck. So to my chagrin I see Tarkins Bounty off the bat. Wonderful, maybe I can get it back by retrieving it easily or something. That isnt true and I never really do anything. I didnt have any starships in my hand and when I drew a bunch never found any so in order to do damage I decided to go to the 3/2 since he already stacked up Vader, Palpatine and P-59 at the Back Door. His draining, Visage, and Emp Power damage were too much to handle. I have Corran but at this point I think I can do absolutely nothing to him so I just let Visage take its course and minimize diff. I keep on deploying EPPs and he keeps battling with Maul and retrieving force. It was a frustrating and short game. He informs me that I basically have zero percent chance of winning this matchup with Tarkins Bounty in play. I agree. FL -24<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 2  Wyatt Foxs Well Handle This V</b><br/>
Wyatt is pretty young and I had no idea what to expect from his deck so I just played it safe especially since he said he had the best opening draw ever and was really excited. I just pull all of the sectors and stuff and set up my hand. He deploys some jedi merchants and I think wow those are really good, but then he points out that his objective sucks and his FDs are minus 1. Oh well. He deploys Obi in a Jedi Starfighter and Ric in his ship. I am now thinking he must have tons of space in his deck and begin to worry as I only have 1 starship in my hand along with the ship already on the table staring down at the Republic. I do have an Accelerate so I grab Lateral Damage. I deploy a ship, pilots and the damage and battle. He points out that he forgot to move and I said no I am sorry I cant let you do that. I mean I feel bad but that is a giant takeback. If this was a local I would have definitely let you take it back. Sorry bud. He has a power of 5 or 6 after destiny to my 25+ with a tracked Masterful Move. Wyatt loses all of his ships and I think 10 more at least. At that point, I do TTO and drain damage while cant assemble anything else. FW by 25.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 3  Scott Lingrells Invasion Double Ds</b><br/>
So I see he is playing the dreaded Destroyer droids and I think this is going to be a rough game. I have to attack his space and get mine up there fast. Dropping 2 cards is absolutely money against this deck as he has to save 4+ force each turn to shoot and play interrupts and he cant draw easily. This game starts out pretty bad for Scott and doesnt have the right interrupts to mess with me. He cant flip and I am rolling. He basically has 15 force loss to my zero, but he decided to lose Search and Destroy at the beginning of the game for whatever reason. Maybe he felt he couldnt take ground back over or something I dont know. He spreads with 2 DDs all over Naboo with a big hand and I try to do something and actually take a little overflow in one battle while doing nothing to him. All this time he curses himself for ditching S&amp;D, the key to winning this matchup. I finally found Tantive and Han Chewie Falcon and he has to relinquish Naboo to me and I move over to Kiffex to drain for 4 since he was shield busted. This pursues for a really long time while I drain for 5 and put back 2 and he pays to drain for 2 and 2 while I cancel one and saves and draws what he can when he can. Eventually he gets low in cards and I do some more successful EPP strikes, sending his dismantled droids to the racks. I retrieve a lot more after satisfying coward and what almost looked like a close game was actually quite comfortable in the end. FW by 22.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 4  Justin Desais Profit</b><br/>
I have no idea how I get the pleasure of playing Justin again but the deed is mine. I see Profit and I am thinking I should win this matchup pretty easily. I start Arica in the Audience Chamber. I dont think she did anything honestly because I forgot to move her over to stop Obis drain. I activated the D*II DB so the Moff has to go to the bunker. Dumb I always get bad luck against good players. I am terrified of spies coming in and causing the game ending beat-down but if I dont deploy him and get going immediately I know I cant win anyway. Plus he is a little choked and he cant find anything and I luck out and get the TTO up and running with a walker at the Endor DB while moving Jerjerrod over thinking his 9 forfeit should be good for a turn. He doesnt really do stuff for a while and draws a lot. I on the other hand desperately need to find Naboo or 1 of my 4 set for stuns/ control cards for Han or to cancel his retarded Atrocities or Vergence. I have like 20 cards in my hand and nothing to help me. His turn he deploys uber Luke and battles against my Blizzard 1/Veers/Moff. Important note: I try to add Moffs power but he only adds to capitals so I only cause 2 points of overflow against him. His attrition was 8 and I forfeit the moff just to be No Escaped next turned and re-deployed. I am doing steady damage but all of his limiting crap is really annoying, so basically I drain for 2 and 1 (courtesy of Vergence) and TTO for 1 while he does Profit for a couple and draining for 2. He deploys Bouush with Rifle and Luke crap again but mis-tracked and didnt deploy his saber and I say play your stupid Blaster Proficiency. Sure enough and everything assplodes from a lucky shot to a rather large walker. I am desperately searching for Controls and Naboo but they happen to be the bottom three in my force pile and I couldnt afford to draw them by not having enough lifeforce to drain myself. I deploy Blizzard 2 with Ozzel aboard. I couldnt find anything else that forfeits for a bunch to the Endor DB to avoid the heinous stuff on Tatooine. He doesnt have anyone else besides Qui Gon with stick. He has been threepioing so I know his destinies are high. He couldnt activate down far enough to his tracked 6-7 so he shuffles the four cards left. 6-7-6-4. So he has to draw the 6 and 7 together for quick draw to hit it. Sure enough, being the master cutter that I am a 6-7 magically appeared and hit my walker for the second time today, in the same game no doubt. We go to count power he drew the 6 (of course) and I draw a 1. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. We go to count power and I see Ozzel V and he adds to power. But what I really see is: While piloting a capital starship blah blah and think he doesnt add power to vehicles ignoring the bright yellow circle with the 2 in the middle. I say I have a power of 7 to his 12. Ozzel doesnt cover it and I get overflowed by 1. Hmmmm that is pretty silly but at the same time my fault I suppose. A little tilted, I think I can still pull this game out. Finally, I get a couple more controls but decide to cancel a drain instead playing it on the 2 Atrocities on the board. Then realize a little later after seeing Vergence I should have cancelled it. He deploys Corran to try to blow me out but I have my final walker and move Arica over to safety. It dies shortly after with a Run Luke Run attrition. So my last ditch effort was to deploy space Vader to ground but he uses the effect to get Qui Gon back into hand and he dies with me losing 2 overflow. We are both extremely low in lifeforce and I know we are both sweating it. I think about my options and cant pay to drain, play a control for 3 and deploy a schmo for Battle Plan and resistance. He has 7 life force to my 5. I will get drained for 2 and damage of 3 next turn. I will cause do damage of 4. I cant squeeze anything else out and I lose by 1 force for a FL by 3. If I find Naboo I easily win this game.   <br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 5  Mike Frenchs Hunt Down</b><br/>
Another HD, the deck I despise more than anything. I am feeling like I cant win this game but for some reason Mike has a decklist error. No Tarkins Bounty! Ok game face back on, I have a shot. He decides to start Justice and I say wouldnt it be sweet if you have the Back Door on that bad boy? I cut and sure enough Back Door! He says I am good at star wars. I have no idea if this was really a good thing but I think he is going to try to attack the senate as fast as possible to get that card. Sure enough he deploys Palpatine to the Senate first turn. My activation isnt that swift either so instead of going down fast I need to save up a bit and go in head strong. He doesnt really do anything besides move Palpy over to my JCC and I deploy my senate stuff. His turn he deploys Vader but couldnt find his lightsaber and say Geez Michael Richards is really good at star wars. I try to battle but I do not have an EPP in my hand which is convenient. I do however have a starship and pull Kiffiez with Mothma and Bravo Fighter makes the scene. His turn he deploys Maul with stick and puts down Quite a Mercenary. That means I dont autowin now and have to actually think. That card is pretty dumb but darkside needs good cards right now I suppose. I check my deck for Ultimatum but guess what? Garrett Larson tells me to take it out at the last minute. Thanks! So I drain for 5 and he drains for 5 (Janus) and we are losing a lot to Visage every turn. I cant do anything and he cant do anything so we basically take pot shots at each other for 3-4 turns and he only has one card in hand and just lost a P-59 off the top. I decide it is time to lock this game up and deploy Corran to can cancel Visage and drain for 2 more. Sure enough he has enough to drain and fight with another  P-59. So that move ended up costing me a lot more due to my Draw their Fire and damage from the gun. He decides he wants to lose 1 to drain with Maul and has 6 forces left. I drain for 4 and he is only left with 2, not enough to drain me next turn, otherwise he wins this game. He moves some dudes over to my Senate because I cant drain myself from stacking a senator last turn. We both have 2 forces! I activate 1 and battle, he is still at 2 force because he took a card from Justice and I still have 2. This game is crazy and he is playing for a true tie while I am playing for the win. He moves a character in front of Palpatine. I have one last trick up my sleeve and activate 2 and put back the senator on my effect and he groans. I then battle him for the win with DTF. This game comes down to one turn again but this time I am on the winning side. FW by 4.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 6  Chris Fanchis LTWW TRM</b><br/>
Chris was not having a good time. He was just saying the meta is horrible and what not. I was kind of bummed to be playing a teammate. I went through his deck with him the night before because he was asking what one card to cut and I told him Grimtaash. Come to find out I drew a very large hand against him knowing this little tidbit of information. I knew his damage is pretty slow while setting up. He couldnt find any of his twixes or pullers but he revoed my Bunker so no Endor Shield for me. Ehhh, whatever. I had Veers and Chiraneau in my hand anyway after drawing a bigillion. I set it up fairly quickly and he cant seem to find any starships while I pile up the damage and he plinks me here and there. He just draws and drains while I assemble everything. Pretty soon I have Endor and Tatooine systems with SDs and the DB covered with Imperials. He cant touch anything in fear of a Lateral Damage beat. He cant find his Savrips or Alters. He decides to take a chance and come after me with Tantive. Not a good idea, I did have the Lateral Damage and he had to sack a lot of stuff and some to battle damage to stay alive in space. He finally gets either Corran or Luke up to my Death Star and starts to march into it. One turn he decides to activate everything and we ask the judge what happens if the draw fails the ship blows up without adding any modifiers. That costs him an additional turn that he didnt have. Pretty soon the game is over and I win by 21.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I have scratched and clawed my back up a respectable 4-2 but have to win out to be guaranteed. My diff is actually pretty good because of all of the close games. 8(+45)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 7  Joe Pintos TTO</b><br/>
This was the worst game I played the entire weekend. I wouldnt say this had anything to do with being nervous or anything like that, just I made one giant mistake. I know exactly what I have to do and I will have to do it as fast as possible. I figured Joes deck was exactly like Jans or very similar, so I deploy the 3/2 as fast as possible with Senator Palpatine there because I couldnt find any of my EPPs. Joe is building a little slower than he likes and he has to draw a lot of cards, but that is what TTO does I guess. I basically try to find my space and an EPP Luke to blow the Death Star II up but I cant seem to find em but all while I pay to drain for 4 every turn. Joe cant seem to find many starships or something and doesnt really deploy much. His Controls are eluding him so eating the drain of 4 is really putting the pressure on him. I come down with an early HCF to his ship with Ozzel V and didnt even realize what he did even though I have him in my deck. I battle and try to get rid of his ship with my tricks but I draw a 1 and he is immune even if I add +3. He draws a 5 and I cant reduce. Oops. So basically, I did nothing and lost my ship I desperately needed. Basically, he is drawing and force draining and doing TTO damage. I am cancelling his drains and still draining for 4 and still searching for ships/pilots. I drew into Leias gun early so I know I can blow up his walkers if I draw into my Mess combo. I finally get everything assembled by searching my deck with my Objective. I have a Might and a Desperate Reach combo I can track in case he grabs one to shoot down his stacked Blizzard 1. If I take all of this down I cant lose because he will not be able to satisfy Resistance and will have to pay to drain and will even do less TTO damage. I play Might (he didnt save a force) and grab a random senator. Activate, drain and all of that jazz and go to deploy Leia with Gun and low and behold Leia isnt in my hand! I soon realized that I put her on a political effect and put her back with my objective. So yea, when I played Might I thought she was in my hand already and didnt grab her. This mistake was giant and costly. I finally got Corran and Red 5 together and started moving them in slowly. Corran on Red 5 is Maneuver of 8 and is pretty unstoppable. I got Leias gun on EPP Luke and shot down the walker about 4 turns too late and it wasnt lost so I had to lose all of the stuff while using precious senators to avoid overflow. I still have about 15 more lifeforce than he does but he is catching up drastically with TTO damage and drains because I didnt drain for a turn so I could 76 the walker stuff. I have a great hand with Sense, Tantive and Bravo Fighter and a Desperate Reach combo still to track with Corran to blow the Death Star II. I have been putting cards back with my objective so he cant use his controls or No Escape. He does his damage of about 6 so I lose all of my ships and sense out of my hand thinking I win next turn and he draws a card or two and plays Set for Stun combo on Corran. He says he has no idea what is in his reserve deck and neither do I. He draws a blind 6, his Admiralss Order, and I find out that I cant re-deploy Corran to the sector. I threw away Tantive IV which was the biggest mistake of the entire tournament. I could have deployed that to the Death Star II and he wouldnt have had an answer for it and I would have sailed away with the victory. Instead he bests me by about 3 cards after shuttling schmoes down from his SDs left and right and me spending time trying to get rid of them. I was defeated after this game and I really was down on myself. FL by 3.<br/>
<br/>
So even though I am 4-3, I still have great differential and I am currently the highest 4-3 but a lot of things still have to happen if I make 7th or 8th place. 8(+42)<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 8  Brian Herolds Sonn V Yodas Hut</b><br/>
This game was for all the marbles. Brian agrees. I figured that only one or two 5-3s would make it in and I knew my diff was one of the highest since I had to play someone with a higher record than me last turn. I try to go first but for some reason he wouldnt let me. I really dont have a clue what he is playing but Brian knows my deck inside and out from helping me cut out V slips and assembling my deck at the beginning. So he goes first and he has an opening Stone Pile! WTF?!? I start to see this game is going to suck if he gets something I need. If he gets the Death Star II or a sector it is pretty much over. If he gets Jerjerrod I am almost doomed. Sure enough he gets Darth Vader V and Moff Jerjerrod. My heart sinks and for some reason Schoenthal wants to see what he grabbed. I am non compliant because I dont want to give any extra information away to Brian that he can use against me. Chris gets a little upset but this was for all the marbles as we kept saying throughout the game. My several turns consist of searching my deck and seeing what was activated and drawing until I have all of the sectors. He was just setting up guys with lightsabers and draining my wookie off at his locations and mine. Brian doesnt seem to need any cards and he basically never draws and just deploys more good stuff and pays to drain. I on the other hand have a 30+ card hand and finally assembled the stupid Death Star II. I deploy a ship and Admiral Chiraneau as quickly as possible and try to claw my way back into this game. I luckily have Arica and she goes down to the 3/2 but Brian drew 1 card last turn and it happened to be his only Mess combo in the deck. I have to spread thin to maximize damage all while losing unnecessary cards. I finally get a Blizzard walker with Veers at my DB. He comes down with Tantive IV and Luke SITF and clears me off for a turn. He only had 3 cards in hand. Now he has 1. I Deploy more stuff, Lateral Damage, suspend Savrip and actually cause about 7-9 overflow and I am back in this thing as long as he doesnt have another Tantive IV. Sure enough his last card was Tantive and he pulls Luke with Padme and with that the game is inevitably his. He quickly disposes of me and has about 14 life force left but he finds a couple On The Edges to actually beat me by 29 in the end. A frustrating game at which I had about a 5% chance at winning at best. Brian only drew 5 cards, excluding his opening 8, in this game. FL by 29<br/>
<br/>
So I go 4-4, 8(+13) at 26th place with another year where it comes down to winning the last game. I am pretty upset that I get so, so close but cant seal the deal. Time to win the consolation tournament!<br/>
<br/>
<u><font size='"+3"'>Consolation Tournament</font></u><br/>
<br/>
Decks: I decided not to play the same decks again and was going to go with DS Senate and WYS this go around but James didnt bring any extra cards with him so I am stuck with TTO again. Luckily I grabbed his WYS the night before and changed a couple of cards including a Grimtaash combo to fight against TTO.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 1  Steve Harpsters DS Senate</b><br/>
This is Déjà Vu from last years consolation tournament. I am a little worried about this game because Senate is tough for WYS. I notice he started the weapon puller and I figure his space is weak. He just draws first turn if I can remember right. I go to Tatooine as fast as possible and search for Chewies AT-ST to keep my guys alive from lightsabers. He is having trouble finding senators but he finally flips. I get another ship to Tatooine and Luke pulls all of my ships! All too easy. He comes down to the Cantina but I am not playing the Professor shield and I am worried about a free Maul. I get another ship up and spread to Kessel and put the pressure on fast. I have stupid Boshek at Tatooine so I can really drain for 2 all game. He drains but I play Its a Hit! and he doesnt grab. He is playing the virtual version of Allegations and I tell him in Senate you need the non V version against it, but he doesnt agree. I get Chewies stuff out with pilots and go to my Farm. I dont know why this over the DB, I guess because I feel sorry for Owen and Beru after they died and I wanted to pay homage to them. He comes down with Sidious against them without Edcel and tries to play IHYN but Chewie is just a big furry oaf and is only ability = 2. I kill Sidious and cause a point or two of overflow damage. I Old Ben. I drain for some and replenish my hand. He comes down with his second Sidious, Edcel and Toonbuck this time. The attrition race is not in my favor anymore. He battles and I thankfully only lose 1 guy. I move over to the DB for safety. He deploys Vader and does the same stuff all over again. I deploy Han with Gun and IL to go to the empty Landing Site. He is paying to drain this whole time and not for much since I started Menace Fades. He plays restraining bolt on IL and I say well I guess I cant do anything about that and he says you can play Sabotage. Oh yea! I say thanks and play it. It is auto hit with IL out so it is a BG again and he moves Vader over. I am draining for a substantial amount and he is running out of senator tricks. He eventually plays his free Maul but he cant battle and he just runs around blocking my stupid IL droid. I get a lot more guys out for fodder and eventually start playing all of my cards from lost pile for the second time for a couple force and get back most of my lost pile. FW by 21.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 2  Brian Herolds Sonn V Yoda</b> <br/>
Great. The exact same matchup as yesterday. I am sure this is going to be fun if he gets another first turn stone pile. He doesnt have the God draw he did last time but most importantly he doesnt have the retarded Stone Pile. I get my D* set up and start trying to do some damage control. He has the 3/2 with a saber and this game he deployed the Naboo Battle Plains with Mace and saber. I spread in space but he is having trouble finding his own space and most importantly stupid Luke SITF. We just exchange damage for a while and he does play Stone Pile and gets Vader again along with Naboo system. I should have played it with a SD but wasnt sure how to approach it. If I did I think the outcome would have been the same. I have to come down against Mace with Veers and Walker and more forfeit. They stick around for a while until he blows them up with some tracked destinies with Quick Draw which was the third time this weekend that a walker was hit with a non Power Harpoon weapon. Dumbest idea ever; courtesy of Lee Edwards.  Eventually he gets Tantive up and gives me headaches at Death Star system and then he gets to drain for free I cant and I am eventually bled out. FL by 9   <br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 3  Tom McGees Rebel Senate</b><br/>
Tom was pretty frustrated with Star Wars at this point in time and he seemed a little out of it. This is actually our first time playing each other so I was somewhat delighted. I had no idea what Rebel Senate does so I had to read everything and ask lots of questions. I really dont remember what my hand was or anything but I know nothing went drastically wrong while setting up the Death Star II. I recall he went fast to the senate and pulled Night club and put Chewie alone. He drained me for 3 once, retrieved 1 and I got really tired of that fast. I put down Arica to block the drain. I am scared of Corran but the drain of three every turn is balls, so I took the chance. This is where Tom gets really upset and shoots beard hair my way. He wasnt upset with me but about his draw I suppose. He couldnt find a Jedi to absolutely kill Arica and win the game or something. I never figured it out. I fight against Corran and Chewie and his Political Effects do something I dont even remember but I know I didnt have to lose overflow and that is all that mattered. I was getting setup in space and I verified his deck and it was pretty light on starships. I spreaded with Chiraneau up and now really pouring on the damage. He comes after me with Tantive loaded up with some guys. I lateral damage but cant get rid of the damn thing. He is still steaming and thinks I got really lucky and stuff. I am still not sure why. TTO plays out about the same way every time. He sees me throw away a walker and I am not really sure if he thought I was abandoning ground but he gets impatient and throws down General Crix Madine by himself to my Endor DB. I play Stop Motion to grab Cold Feet and play it and play Walker and Veers to Crix and he quits right there. FW by 14<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 4  Brian Herolds HD V</b><br/>
Brian shows HD V and I begin to worry because James said in playtesting that it completely shuts down WYS because of the Force Unleashed stuff and it cancels FD bonuses. I go to Kessel first turn and try to get a quick drain of 3 off or at least drain for 2 regularly while I find, Boshek and Melas to flip him with. He deploys the card that kills vehicles and now I know I cant keep my retards alive easily with sabers running amuck. Brian deploys Vader pretty quickly but cant seem to find Galen which is decent for me I suppose. I run away from him every chance I have and to make sure I have Doallyn there because he likes to takes sabers up the arse. I am a little force choked and cant draw many and have little space presence. Meanwhile, Brian assembles Black Leader, Galens ship and Boba Fett BH V against Luke. He also got out Imperial Justice which hinders me on the ground greatly. He plays some card where attrition against Black Leader and some random male = 0 so Luke dies. I get another back next turn and deploy some smugglers to kill stuff in space. I get rid of Boba but didnt have enough to kill Black Leader. I am trying to stay alive on the ground trying to loop Sergeant Doallyns over and over while retrieving them with Luke. He plays one of the tossing vehicle interrupts and I grab because I saw a couple Tarkins Orders go into the lost already and finally deploy Chewies at-st. He doesnt have an answer so I put BoShek and another clown in it. But he flips because I have to have someone present. The vehicle is pointless and just I leave everyone outside. He has lightsabers at all three Tatooine locations, so I stay in front of Vader in hope of drawing a 4 or 5 to kill him in attrition. He has to battle me and Sergeant is really annoying to him and he does this silly goofy look where he rolls his eyes and goldenrods his head up at the same time and the sole reason why I &lt;3 Brian Herold. I kill Vader with a 5 and didnt have to burn my HFTMF yet and Black Leader is really annoying me and I finally get something together to kill her but time is getting close. Time is called during his turn. He plays Elis to move some stuff around but draws a 5 and only has 5 force active. So not to lose anymore lifeforce he pays for it and cant battle me. That would have flipped him and swung the game a little towards his favor. I had another Boshek in hand though. My turn I cant do anything to do a game ending beatdown. I had the 5 tracked but couldnt activate down to it or I would have went Han with gun and another alien in Cantina to kill Mara with Saber and do some overflow. So in my last action I killed that hot Black Leader whore and scored redemption against the raping of Brian against me this weekend. He had less than 10 left in his lifeforce but I have 18 and I ask for the full win and he obliges. FW by 18. I win a tough a game where he got pretty unlucky on many destiny draws. He missed a saber swing once on a Boshek which helped.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 5  Kevin Shannons EBO</b><br/>
I knew this was coming sooner or later so I better put my game face on. I knew this game was going to be tight and I couldnt make any mistakes. I was just hoping I wouldnt see the same sandwhirl jank as before. I get off to a roaring start and have zero starships in my opening hand. That seems pretty good against an all space deck like EBO. I deploy Moff to the Bunker because I figured I would need his forfeit later and I wasnt expecting any spies with EPP beats. I dont have any trouble building the ball but he doesnt have any trouble setting up the Garrison either. Thinking about it, it is virtually impossible not getting EBO out because you can pull all of your characters and sites. Anyways next turn I deploy Veers and Walker since I dont have any starships and I have all of this force. He draws and gets lots of cards. My turn I am scared of a beatdown on my loan starship I am about to deploy, so I deploy a walker to Endor DB, move over Jerjerrod and shuttle them up to the Accuser at Endor. He asks how much power I have and stuff and he figures he cant do much over flow with tons of forfeit. So he just deploys a ship to every other system on the table. I think there were 5: Endor, Tatooine, Death Star II, Hoth and Kiffex and deploys Yoda MOFO at the 4th marker. I know I have to get rid of him in order to survive this game. I deploy Ozzel and a walker and battle but draw low and dont do anything. I draw about 5 more cards and still dont get any starships. His next turn deploys Dash in Speeder and the new T47 trio and destroys me with power 30 to my 8 and I have to lose some overflow. I wasnt expecting that much strength on the ground but his deck had lots of EPP ships/vehicles if you will. Like Obi in Radiant 7 and Wedge in ship etc. So it isnt looking so good and he just drained me for a bunch but at least I had Resistance going. My turn I just go to another DB because I have to keep Resistance in order and fly my ship and Death * around to his weakest planet to block drains. I literally draw 15 cards and didnt get a single starship. I drew a Voyeur V and play it. Kevin thinks for a really long time about cancelling it with Yoda but decides not to. He was muttering something along the lines, what is this jank, just a card to beat EBO or something. It was humorous. I knew the last 10 cards consisted of 6 starships so if got it through I can draw them, right right? I get one additional starship. So I play the other Voyeur. Kevin knew what I was up to, I suppose, and used Yoda this time after muttering some expletives under his voice. So he is doing plenty of damage to me and I cant do anything about it. I deploy my last starship but running low on forces due to so much drawing and I think I can eliminate and X-wing at the D* and move over to block another drain. I deploy a ship and Thrawn and he reacts with Spiral and actually out powers me. I lose Thrawn and he loses something insignificant. I have to stay there and block the drain. He deploys another X-wing and kills my ship. That went well. I got another Accusser somehow and tried a beat against the X-wing at D* with a Lateral Damage but he had another Spiral in hand and I lost everything. This point in time, I no longer have Resistance in play and he announces his first drain of 4, I say I quit. FL by 15 I really feel like this game should have been awesome to the max but I simply couldnt get any of my starships. I must not have shuffled good enough. Games like these upset you the most.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Game 6  Kevin Shannons Mystril</b><br/>
I have to get paired up with Kevin again because the sides are really lopsided. So I see Mystril and I know this game isnt going to be fun by any means. I dont have any double agents in my deck. I know realize why Aaron plays Chewie Protector and Double Agents in his WYS. I have a really great opening draw actually of tons of characters and a OOC/TT but I am a little force choked and he is going to be piling on the damage fast because he moved Shada to a DB first turn and drew a lot. I decide to go for the early pressure and go with Dash to Kessel first turn and save to deploy more smugglers. The only way I think I can win this is by putting Shada out of play. He deploys Prophetess to Cantina and Zuckuss with 4-LOM to Kessel and battle. I lose Dash and ship and all seems lost already. My turn I deploy Doallyn and Mirax to Shada and Wedge and Talon to Cantina against Prophetess which prolly wasnt the smartest play. Actually, nothing I did seemed to matter anyway. I battled Shada and he drew two 5s. Luckily I drew high enough to get past attrition and actually put her out of play! I have a chance. On his turn he deploys Kitik, Aurra and someone else to cantina and battles. Draws a 5 and I have to lose 9 overflow. I say I dont want to play anymore and quit. Kevin is a little upset and asks for a rematch but my deck doesnt have the right tools to beat his and say no. FL by 25<br/>
<br/>
So, I ended up going 3-3 and another mediocre performance and most importantly not preserving my consolation throne. Somehow, I ended up 6th out of 16. For the entire worlds event I go 15-10. Not very good but at least it isnt a losing record. <br/>
