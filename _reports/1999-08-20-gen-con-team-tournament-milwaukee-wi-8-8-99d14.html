<br/>
LS - 'Hope You Learned Something ' -- Same as yesterday.<br/>
DS- HDADTJ same as day before - I still didn't like this deck but was too lazy to use <br/>
	something else. I did make a few changes to this ; another PotF for the Clash<br/>
	That cost me my loss and a Twi'lek to go get the PotF :)<br/>
<br/>
Today isn't as bad as yesterday. Yesterday I'm wet , cold , and 1400 miles from home. Today I'm only 1400 miles from home ;)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : 'Hope You Learned Something' v. Mark DeMarko's ( sp ) ROps...<br/>
<br/>
	He starts ROps and Bad Feeling Have I so that makes the game slow. He deploys Biker Scouts and Flip. I train ASAP and get nailed by the verification rule again ( GRRR ). I set up 1 and two. He has lone Biker scouts out at about 5 sites or so and then my landing crew comes down. I deploy Tantive 4 and Wedge to Ralltiir system and drop EPP Luke ( for 9 )  , Bothan Spy , and Tawss Khaa to a site to whack a lone biker. He has no force to react but tries to play High Speed Tactics and Lone Warrior. Uh uh. A Jedi's Strength deep sixes that idea and I hit him for a Ghhhk. Next turn he deploys a Biker Scout , Bike , and Oldschool Vader to a site on the other side of the planet.  I drop Obi ( for 9 ) to another site and battle another lone biker scout.He reacts Vader and the other Biker Scout. I Clash Vader and get rid of the other biker scouts. Next turn he runs away and hits me for a Counter Assault of like 10 , 3 of which is It Could be worses all in a row. I drop Orrimarko ( 'mini-main' as he called it ), put up Bacta Tank , and battled at the Forest to a tie. On his turn he puts Relentless Tracking or something on Orrimarko so I rotate Obi and others around to wherever the scouts are while Orrimarko gets invovled in the battle , hits him for an extra 2 , and then moves to another site to avoid persecution. Win by 13 <br/>
Record : 2 ( +13 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Stopping his bonuses.<br/>
Lowlights : Paying so much for Rebels. Why is Orrimarko a Rebel ? <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : HDADTJ v. Joshua Smith's HBase<br/>
<br/>
	I was quite surprised and relieved to not play against a HBase deck yesterday but figured I'd see one today after Nick Raisch's HBase deck won yesterday. His name reminds me of an X-File Episode . He starts Haven and puts down like 4 Corvettes for free first turn. He goes and gets Endor and moves them all there for free. I drop Bus and Dreadnaughts and start chipping off about 2 a turn. He deploys Do or Do Not and the Bacta Tank for St'ships which saved him. He cancels my Visage with Leia O and puts her undercover. Later TK-422 comes down to block my Vader drain at MedChamber ( I put HDADTJ OOP). I put out Sec Precautions so he never flipped HBase. I Counter Assaulted one of his 4 Correllian Corvette drains and hit him for 4 damage ( stacked destinies ). I play really really stupid and put out Visage again ( YES THE OLD WAY ) , so I can damage him somehow to death-- I was up in him in cards but he had more damage ways. I also move Choke Vader with stick to Med Chamber to protect the Visage.He drains for 1-2 and brakes TK422's cover . I move Vader over and Visage and Bus damage does its thing. He drains , breaks Leia's cover , and moves Leia to the MedChamber where Vader and Tk422 are. I contemplate the situation after draining and time out. I expected to be able to battle Han and Leia and inflict extra damage but that wouldn't happen. True tie at 2. I apologized for the tie since he would've won next turn but told him that I thought I saw a way to win.Record : 3 ( +13 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Starving off a loss<br/>
Lowlights : Playing a horribly boring game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 'Hope You Learned Something' v. Joshua Smith's HDADTJ<br/>
<br/>
		He has no starter. Visage damage randomly hits my 2 Glancing Blows. Testing works ASAP. I Lockup Vader and Tarkin at CC w/ Insurrection. I have Tawss and a Bothan Spy draining at Executor site. He wipes out Tawss and friend and duels EPP Obi ( my courage drew a dagobah site I forgot to get rid of ) and I when I drew up looking for my Grimtaash to play used I drew up the Force I had for It Could Be Worse to cancel the damage from Epic Duel. I played stupid and gave this game to him. I did however manage to use DTFire to chip off a lot more life then I should've been able to. Loss by 13. Record : 3 ( 0 )<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : My HDADTJ v. Clint Hays HB Greymatter<br/>
<br/>
	Ah big lister number 3 I think it is. Here's here because of a Tractor Beam deck ; WTF ?? Tractor Beam ? Ah well , I like to play big names but I also suck it up this game. I get Vader and Visage rolling early. I twi'lek while he keeps deploying grey matter. I drop Bus and Dreadnaught and start knocking off his grey matter. With HDADTJ flipped and Vader subtracting 2 from his battle destinies he is barely inflicting any damage of attrition. I get Sec Precautions out for some safety. He cancels Visage like 3 times with a spy ( I see that coming but have to keep visage at MedChamber for my space to have a chance ). Visage hits a nice amount off of him and he It Could Be Worses a drain . I thought I had Twi'leked for my Hell2Pay but I couldn't find it. That won helped him win  the game. I move Endor and keep probing when I should've moved to Tatooine so I could keep It Could Be Worse away from him. I probe Tatooine finally which is correct but can't get to Coruscant or Kiffex so the drains there go basically uncontested except for a few Counter Assaults. I should've put in those Tarkin's Orders I was thinking about but didn't . I gave this game to him. Loss by 3. Record : 3 ( -3 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Playing someone good.<br/>
Lowlights : Playing stupid , wanting to drop kick my dark deck because it sucks , <br/>
			Not helping my team.<br/>
<br/>
Well Team Res Luck Rauf comes in 8 of 20 , which is better then I expected after our performance but worse then I expected based on skill. Notable things were Steven Turner crushing Joe Alread by 25 in game one and Jim Li carrying the team. <br/>
I took pics of Ryan Fojtik , Steven Turner , Jim Li , Clint Hays , Jim Sells ( I still can't believe he is 27 ) , Gabe Alonso , Steven Lewis , and the Milwaukee Express Center in general. I go up to the Dealer area and don't see anything special but get a pic of the Tomb Raider chick. Later I meet up with Gabe again and he says he needs ORScouts so I sell 3 of them to him for $21. He also hooks up Steven Lewis , Jim Sells , and Clint Hays with some Middle Earth for super cheap prices before they take off. I walk and talk some strat with Gabe while going to there destination.   I go back to the Con to watch a bit as the Con is closing up , and I'm grabbing little things off the bulletin board including a notice about a RPG called Maelstrom :) To quote from the bulletin : ' The Maelstrom is a whole world , and it's also a great storm so strong it changes the shape of the world as it passes over '. I thought that was kinda funny. I come back to the hotel , eat some pizza , and playtest v. Steven Turner again but this time with more of a fundeck theme. I use Musicians for DS and he uses a Harvest deck. I grapple the Harvest and Elis 7-8 Musicians to Ben Kenobi. I then proceed to pummel Ben Kenobi in power 46 to 0 for the game. Funny concept was that at one point he didn't have enough force to deploy Jereon Webb undercover to the AChamber because of one of the muscians. Next game he uses a Walker Garrison deck and I get Tessek Rolling. I've got a billion aliens out and turn after turn my Eloms are wrecking ATATs. I elis Ben Kenobi over with 4 Eloms to put the hurt on Vader at 3rd Marker. Win just about every battle and make up for the poundings I took on Friday night ;) ... then I watch Mars Attacks and Spaceballs before I see Spaceball one transform to Megamaid and I fall asleep. Next day I fly home and just think about how to work on the Dark Side ; somehow Musicians were looking good ;)<br/>
