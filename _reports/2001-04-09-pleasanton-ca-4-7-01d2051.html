<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I finally get to go to tournament since Enduro so im preety happy.  Well the Friday night starts off with Brandon and Chris coming over and testing decks for a while.  Then we decided to head down to the local shop and see whats going on before when all go home and hit get so sleep.  Well we play some games there and finally decide to call it a night and we all go home..  As Chris comes by around 10 telling me he needs a Sail Barge which I dont have 1 so he decides to leave his decks the same like I do... We head down to Brandons house and pick him up then were off..<br/>
<br/>
Decks:<br/>
<br/>
LS:  TIGIH scouts, super power and drains<br/>
DS:  BHBM like Machine with Imbalance for stupid retrieval<br/>
<br/>
Well off to the games<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  DS vs Tim Green TRM new age<br/>
<br/>
Well first game I play a TRM deck that looks preety descent.  So we start i pull Rendilli and activate.. So he starts the game off by pulling H1 dbay and dropping Hassh’. Pull the Dbay and drop Emp there and Rendilli.  He goes by deploying Hoth dbay and a few Twix Madine goes to Hoth and he pulls Blount.  Well I activate drop Janus and Mara and saber to H1 and battle Hassh’.  Chop and destiny for hassh and 10.  Finally move Janus and Emp to D* dbay.  He deploys Leia and Chewie for the rest of his force and battles so I play Projective to cancel.  Next turn i deploy Lord Vader and Saber to H1 and battle chop chewie and play Dark strike chop leia and draw a 4 for her and 14..  Thats alot of force I end up draining him out.  FW(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Fast Game<br/>
Lows:  Beating a Little Kid<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  LS vs Mike Mendonza Hunt Down Ties<br/>
<br/>
I finally get to play Mike after seeing him playing at Enduro.  Well he starts off with Wakamui and Mara to Endor Dbay.  Loses off the top= VADER.  So i activate get H1 dbay and see 3 of my 4 OOC theres so i move luke and get the OOC and play it and get VADER!!.  So im preety happy then but its not over.  We take visage for a while as he deploys (*) ties and retrievs with SFS and Loses 3 per turn.  I deploy Han and Blount against Mara and kill her with a stack.  Well I cant draw my Back door we battle here and there but the space is too big for me.. FL(-19)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  OOC VADER!!!<br/>
Lows:  Just not playing right or something<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  DS vs Cody ???’s I play every retreival card.<br/>
<br/>
Well I see hidden base and either think mains or retrieval so I set up with Rendilli and Emp to D* dbay for the fast drain.  He pulls tatooine on his turn and draws up..  So i drain deploy Janus and draw some..  Mirax comes down in pulsar skate to Rend Point and Alderran comes out..  So now i expect the OMDM.  My turn Vader goes to the Endor Dbay with a saber.  His turn Gen cal in Pulsar Skate for more forfeit i guess and he gives up Luke.  I deploy Boba Fett and he plays Noble Sac on Gen Cal "HHAHAHAHA" I thought but i play imbalance so he loses 4.  I deploy Jabba and 4-Lom and move emp and vader with a battle plan to lock him out.  I duel and drain he completes a OMDH but everything is too much... FW(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  IMBALANCE!!!<br/>
Lows: No cards stacked which means no interaction<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  LS vs Tim Green’s SKUM drains<br/>
<br/>
Well I get to play Tim again which I really dont want to do since I already played him..  Im expecting a no interaction game again but thats ok..  I set up on the Dbay with a drain of 4!!!(ithorian, midge, Luke)  So i hit him with that as he gets set up on JP.  I draw my back door play that and start spreading with scouts.  He goes for his flip with Ephant to Lower Passageways and lone Abyssan to JP.  I come down with Obi wiht saber battle for the AByssan and about 11 more.  The drains are up to about 9 a turn now.  I lose some off the top from mosep but in the end the drains are too much.  FW(+25)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Huge Drains early game<br/>
Lows: Playing Tim AGAIN<br/>
Well we end the game early so i play a fun game against him which i win but help him out with his decks a little..  <br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  DS vs Alex Stefanko HB flip<br/>
<br/>
Well I play Alex for the first time in a while so Im ready for the wierdest things..  Well I set up the Emp/Rendilli for huge force as he plays aquaris and Hobbie/Ship for activation..  I go the D* dbay to even out the drain.  Well we set up and drain each other for a while as I deploy Vader and saber.  He gives me Luke and i deploy a few aliens for the drain at D* and Mara to Endor with saber.  I move over as he sets up somemore and gets ready to flip.  He flips on my turn.  I deploy Security precautions with Zuckuss to Keffix probe no.  Bossk to Aquaris YES!!! So he loses 9 force and i move bossk to Keffix to get Max drains.  I move them to Throne Room and duel to make him lose 3.  A few battles happen at Keffix and the drains end it.  FW(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Probing Hidden Base<br/>
Lows:  Not much<br/>
<br/>
Well into the final game and Im ready to go home already and am ready for the In-and-Out burger.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Ls vs Brandon Bales BHBM hardcore battle<br/>
<br/>
GREAT!! I play Brandon.  We shuffle cut and draw our once per game.  He looks at his hand and tells me SH(T because he drew both EMPS.  I set up the drain of 4 again as he still trys to get he engine going.  I try to go for Blout to DS2 dbay and he plays lightning and kills him..  I kill Emp a turn later with Corran, Wedge and Obi with saber for 11 more.  He tells me its over so he goes IG-88 and DVDLOTS and battles against my 4 scouts i fallen portal and kill ig me misses choke and misses hak and draws a 1.  while we come out even and i just lose 1 scout.  Next turns comes COK, Gen Solo, Leia Blaster and Crack, page who are already there.  Battle and make him lose Vader and like 15 more he ends up drawing up.. FW(+27)<br/>
<br/>
Well Im in first at the moment so I go watch the final game to see if the guy I need to win will so I can get my MASTERFUL MOVE FOIL!!!  Well the game goes to time so I await the countings..  Mike counts his 15 John Monroe counts his 15!!!!!!  So its a tie.  NICK STEFANKO says that you count lost piles now so they do.  Monroe=15 Mendonza=13.  Well he won the game by 2 in the @$$ lost pile which I dunno what thats about..  Well I get 2 packs of DS2, 1 CC and 2 JP.  Pull the SAIL BARGE that Chris needs!!  I get a Dengar in P1 from the Enhanced stack going around.  Final Standings:<br/>
