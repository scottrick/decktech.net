<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hoth North Ridge Regional, August 5th<br/>
<br/>
This tournament took me allot of effort to get to.  It was on August 5th, in Calgary.  I live<br/>
in Kamloops, which is a good 8 hour drive from Calgary.  This isnt so bad, EXCEPT that<br/>
on August 4th, I was going to be at a Concert in Vancouver, which is a 12 hour drive from<br/>
Calgary.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to fly to Calgary from Kamloops, the morning of the tournament.  It would be a<br/>
quick flight, and getting a stand by ticket would only be about $15 Canadian more than a<br/>
bus, so it should work.<br/>
<br/>
So Thursday night, I go to sleep at 6 am.  6 friggin am, and then drive to van at 10am to<br/>
go to the festival.  This wasnt just any concert, this was summersault, with 10 bands<br/>
performing, including eve 6, treble charger, our lady peace, foo fighters, and smashing<br/>
pumpkins.<br/>
<br/>
The concert was great.  It ended about 11:30, and so starts the long drive home.  My<br/>
driving pal Justin Cachelin slept for about an hour, then we stopped in a Tim Hortons. <br/>
Much coffee and a half hour later, we set out for Kamloops again.  The next 3 hours of the<br/>
drive consisted of Justin and I talking tech about his decks, and me debating whether to<br/>
play my tried and true rops deck that won my provincials, or the new tie deck that I had<br/>
been wrecking people with.<br/>
<br/>
Got home, slept for one hour.  Got up, pick up Matt Green and Justin Cachelin, and got<br/>
on the airplane.  Adjusted my decks a bit.  Got to the Sentry Box, where the tournament<br/>
was being held about an hour before the tournament.  Nicholas Burke and AJ Delisle were<br/>
already there, and the three of us talked some tech and about our trip to Milwaukee in a<br/>
week.  After a bit of borrowing, the tournament started.  And Me with only 3 hours of<br/>
sleep in the last two days, 8 hours of driving in those days, and a loooong concert too!<br/>
<br/>
I decided to play a turbo profit smacker and my tie interceptor smacker.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My SYCFA Ties vs Rick Jeans hidden base.<br/>
<br/>
Game started out uneventful.  I start draining a bit at Endor, he gets Haven at Hoth there. <br/>
Independence, Major Haashn, Thaneespi,  Wedge+ship, Tycho+ship, Luke+ship, and one<br/>
or two other matchings make an appearance at hoth.  I lose one a turn to his drain, and<br/>
retrieve.  He loads up the independence with wedge, tycho, and luke, and moves to my<br/>
location.  Gravity Shadow!  I pull a 3, equaling thaneespis ability, so the whole shebang is<br/>
LOST!  boom!  A little later I hit a ship with a lateral damage and beat it down.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 35    2 (35)<br/>
<br/>
I am soooo tired after this game.  Everyone is commenting that I look like Im ready to fall<br/>
asleep.  Somehow, I also have plenty of energy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Turbo Profit Smacker vs AJ delisle BHBM.<br/>
<br/>
Man, I really dont want to play him.  Hes looking for revenge after I smoked him in our<br/>
regional.<br/>
So we start.  I wait till he has vader out to go fetch luke, cause I dont want him captured. <br/>
We have a little bit of Sense wars I think.  At one point, he drops vader and some guys<br/>
against Han and Ben.  I have two force saved, he drops first strike.  I clash vader before<br/>
the battle, and he doesnt battle.  Im causing profit damage.  We battle a bit, with nothing<br/>
really happening.  Hes losing all his 6s to Emperors Power, like I predicted he would :)<br/>
I have Han and regular Obi sitting pretty, he searches his 2 card reserve.  Its a 5 and a 2. <br/>
Out comes choke vader...  this is my last han.  If he gets him, its game.  50/50 chance.  I<br/>
decide not to risk it and Clash vader before the battle.  I drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +19  4(54)<br/>
<br/>
Im kinda stoked after this game, Im still one of the top players.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My light vs Derek Blais ties.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the highest rated player in our region.  He starts Kuat, pulls wakeelmui with Mob.<br/>
Points.  I spread and drain real early on ground, him in space.  Boring Game.  Game was<br/>
decided when I drop Draw there fire, lando in falcon and chewie vs a couple of ties.  I<br/>
figured Id do my draw there fire damage, make him lose a bit, and sack the falcon. Turns<br/>
out I fought him at dark side dantooine, which lets him react.  Over comes a dreadnaught<br/>
and some more ties.  Game over.<br/>
<br/>
FL -9  4(45)<br/>
<br/>
Now my sleep is hitting me.  I find a corner and pretty much sleep until next game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Dark vs Alex Alamis dagobah.<br/>
<br/>
I begin to drain in space.  I put out the Chimaera by itself to endor, he plays star destroyer!<br/>
I save some force to react with one of the new squadrons, and whip out ability ability<br/>
ability.  His turn, he choses to deploy.  Wedge+ship, red 6 + romas lock.  No reacting for<br/>
me.  He had saved force last turn, so didnt have to activate, putting his 7 on top.  Down<br/>
goes the chimaera.  He moves his guys to where I have some ties.  I lateral damage wedges<br/>
ship, drop a dreadnaught, lost all power to weapons, drop about 5 ties, battle, all power to<br/>
weapons used, he loses it all plus about 25 more cards.  He has one card in reserve,<br/>
finishes Test 5.  We have an interesting discussion whether he dies before he retrieves 10. <br/>
We call over the TD, then decide he lives.  Ian (the TD) says no he dies.  We both<br/>
convince him that he gets his 10 first, the objective says retrieve 10 force, THEN place<br/>
destiny on test 5.  so he lives with 10 cards :P I drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 34  6 (79)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  My light vs John Shwydiuks Dark Rops.<br/>
<br/>
Man.  This is one my friends from Kamloops, not someone I wanted to have to play.  He<br/>
kept saying let me win, let me win.  I could never just let someone win unless it was the<br/>
finals of a big tourney and I already had the trip I was going to win.<br/>
<br/>
First turn, I drop master luke, free han, move outside, and nabrun to raltir.  He never got to<br/>
flip raltir, and I sensed his reacts, and his alters.  more mains came to raltir.  Game over.<br/>
<br/>
FW +20  8(99)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Dark Ties vs Matin Paquettes Dagobah Direct Damage.<br/>
<br/>
Matin said he was really tired going into this game, so I gave him some leeway.  after 35<br/>
minutes had passed and we had only played 4 TURNS, I called the TD over to watch for<br/>
stalling.  Boom, game sped up.  He I had a timed win, I wouldnt make finals, and Matin<br/>
would make finals for sure.  <br/>
Anyways, I saw him played a Visored Vision, so I twileked for a grabber.  Lost a grabber<br/>
off the top, and didnt see any more Visions, so a couple turns later I grabbed It could be<br/>
worse.  Out come the visions, two every turn.  He whipped out a lando in falcon and<br/>
legendary starfighter, ran to alderaan.  Eventually, I killed his falcon, and neither of us<br/>
could drain cause of battle plan and wars not make one great.  Ability Ability Ability killed<br/>
him, since I had 3 systems for Honor of the Jedi.  <br/>
<br/>
FW + 2  10(101)<br/>
<br/>
So Im the top player!  I made to the finals.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Ties vs Greg Bonds DBO.<br/>
<br/>
he starts, and pulls out... Dantooine Base Operations??  So he flips second turn using<br/>
correllian ops, (rebels), a rebel trooper recruit, and han.  3rd turn, he deploys an xwing<br/>
squad, an xwing laser cannon, moves to death start and saves 3.  I lateral damage his<br/>
squadron, drop a dreadnaught, 3 tie ins.  Start the fight, he blasts one of my fighters.  I all<br/>
power to weapons, giving each tie 7 power, a power 5 dread, and a destiny of 5 to his<br/>
destiny... 0!  he loses the squad and 24.  I play like crap for the rest of the game, forgetting<br/>
to retrieve, and win.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 26<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: my Profit vs his Ties.<br/>
<br/>
Yawn.  Drain fight.  I win.  I also played this game like @#$% though.  I was just too tired<br/>
and didnt care, and knew he wasnt gonna beat me by 27.<br/>
<br/>
FW + 6<br/>
<br/>
So I win a trip to Florida!  and a Card carrying bag with regional champ on in, and a shirt<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
We bussed back, all 6 kamloopsians took the same bus.  While waiting for a transfer, two<br/>
of us were playing a game in Dennys.  The waiter comes back, looks, says magics<br/>
better.  <br/>
me: Have you ever won a trip to florida with magic?  I just did with this.<br/>
<br/>
He shut up :P </font></td>
