What you are about to read is an account of the most fun I've had playing cards since I went to RamapoCon 3 back <br>

(note: Prior to the trip to Chicago, I listened to the new Kanye West CD a lot, so the lyrics shown in this TR <br/>
<br/>
reflect my feelings on what I write here with Chicago's hottest star, kanyeezy.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The return of the KToD to the SWCCG tournament scene has been previously documented in my MPC report, but I'll <br/>
<br/>
briefly go over it here for new readers.<br/>
<br/>
When I returned from New Orleans last winter it was because of a pretty awful breakup. To help get over that, I <br/>
<br/>
told Justin that I wanted to get back into Wars. He looked at me like I was crazy. "It'll be fun, and that's what <br/>
<br/>
I need right now." I said.<br/>
<br/>
Our preparation for worlds spanned the entire summer. We made the trip out to East nationals, which Justin won, <br/>
<br/>
qualifying for worlds. My qualification came on that trip as well.<br/>
<br/>
I started out Ohio States 0-2 and won four in a row to get into the top 2. When I handed in my card to Reid Smith <br/>
<br/>
at the end of the last round he said "What'd you lowball to get in?" I didn't know what that meant but it only <br/>
<br/>
took me a few seconds to figure it out. And those words stuck with me the rest of the summer.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't play particularly well the rest of the season, though I didn't play two top teir decks at any event (and <br/>
<br/>
you could argue I didn't even play one top teir deck at any event). Tom Hollingworth pretty much ran the table at <br/>
<br/>
three mass locals in Waltham, not losing once until the v14 sneak peak event that I ran. In any event, I was <br/>
<br/>
resolved to not choke at worlds, I wanted to play well, and I wanted to hang with my teammates, Justin and Steve <br/>
<br/>
Baroni, who were piling up glass while I was ordering battle droids online.<br/>
<br/>
Serious testing kicked into gear prior to PA states when Johnny Chu made his first of two trips up to Boston to <br/>
<br/>
visit and playtest. At this point, justin was resolved to play light senate and was just starting to think about <br/>
<br/>
dark senate. Steve and I were pretty sure we were going to play endor tanks and we were both leaning towards <br/>
<br/>
profit for light. On this trip is where I first saw Chu's WYS Nightfall deck and really started to like it.<br/>
<br/>
PA States came and went, and chu got qualified. By Chu's second trip up, two weeks before worlds, I had my WYS <br/>
<br/>
pretty much finalized and was still leaning towards Endor Tanks. Chu absolutely mopped the floor with his agents <br/>
<br/>
and we were pretty sure that it was unbeatable (which it turned out to be). Justin was set on senate and senate. <br/>
<br/>
At this point steve is sure he can't make the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Just days before the trip I decided to switch to dark senate, just never feeling comfortable with the level of <br/>
<br/>
control the Endor tanks needed, though we put in some really good cards and thought it was a very solid deck.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[Friday]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Good morning<br/>
On this day we become legendary"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Justin, Lee and I got up at like 4am on Friday to hit the airport for our 6am flight. Justin and Lee stayed up til <br/>
<br/>
about 230 playing cards whereas I went to sleep at 11:30 to get some rest. The flight was pretty uneventful except <br/>
<br/>
for the fact that there were two ridiculous BEASTS on the plane.<br/>
<br/>
These two dudes were head to toe in camoflage and H2o and I felt pretty safe that no terrorists would be taking <br/>
<br/>
over this plane. However, about halfway through the flight Justin realized that those two guys COULD be the <br/>
<br/>
terrorists in which case we were dunzo. These guys were both about 6'4, 265lbs, shaved heads, one of them had a <br/>
<br/>
handlebar mustache and their rock-solid chiseled arms were pushing out into the aisle of the plane. <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of plane aisles, when we were booking the trip I had hte best idea ever: instead of sitting next to each <br/>
<br/>
other, Justin and I booked seats in the same row, both on the aisle opposite each other. This created a natural <br/>
<br/>
heterosexual buffer zone and also made conversation easy and fun! <br/>
<br/>
This really kind of scraggly brunette chick in front of Justin was eavesdropping on our convos like craaaaaazy and <br/>
<br/>
kept turning around and making comments to me! I had seen her kind of check me out earlier and made some decent <br/>
<br/>
conversation early on, but then she turned on her ipod and played Nintendo DS almost the whole flight and that <br/>
<br/>
chemistry kind of got squashed. She had a cuteness to her and I really like those wicked plain, pale girls who <br/>
<br/>
arent that pretty because when I hook up with a girl like that I really get the sense I made her feel good about <br/>
<br/>
her self, and that's another level of woman pleasing that you can't get with cunnilingus alone. Also on the <br/>
<br/>
flight, a stewardess through a cup at me, and then poured water on me when I told her she threw it at me, and was <br/>
<br/>
thusly a .<br/>
<br/>
When we landed we had to wait about an hour for Chu to land and in the meantime we saw this older African couple <br/>
<br/>
with CRAZY flourescent colored robes on just walking around the airport on a stroll. <br/>
<br/>
We take a way too expensive taxi out to the hotel we're staying at: Courtyard by Marriot, official sponsors of the <br/>
<br/>
KTOD and the hotel we've stayed at for every card event we've ever gone to save Pro Circuit LA when Ryan French <br/>
<br/>
hooked us up with Best Western Anaheim rooms. We were expecting to drop our stuff off at the hotel and hang out at <br/>
<br/>
the store all day but fear not, the beautiful babies at the CbM front desk had a room for us at 11 am! <br/>
<br/>
So we went to the room to chill, watch seinfeld, nap, play cards and finalize our team tournament decks. Justin <br/>
<br/>
and I were set to team together, Chu was going to team with Fred and Lee was undecided on whether or not he was <br/>
<br/>
going to play at this point. Eventually it's afternoon time and we call to catch a cab to the store. But wait! The <br/>
<br/>
front desk babes hook it up AGAIN and take us in the Marriot Van to the store for Freezy!!!<br/>
<br/>
There was a long wait to get to the team tournament because they wanted to wait until Day 1 was over. In the <br/>
<br/>
meantime I played some connect 4 with Hunter ON PAPER. Says Hunter: "It works. On paper... It works." NOICE. <br/>
<br/>
ALthough Hunter beat me when I went to a space I specifically told Hunter and the crowd watching the match, that I <br/>
<br/>
could not go to, for if I did, I would lose. We played with colored sharpies on yellow paper and the dots from our <br/>
<br/>
game seeped through onto the table and stayed there all weekend, very noticable, and Justin and I always commented <br/>
<br/>
when we were around those parts.<br/>
<br/>
TEAM TOURNAMENT TIME!<br/>
<br/>
So justin and I are paired up for the team tournament, he's playing dark: KTOD Huntdown with me playing light, <br/>
<br/>
Lightsaber Combat with Uh-Oh, Figrin D'an and Joh Yowza for retreival tech in non interactive matches.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LSC Music vs. Joe "Max Beedo" Graham's MKOS <br/>
<br/>
I'd never met joe and I didn't recognize him, but he was teamed with Thomas Whaley so I was expecting something a <br/>
<br/>
little surprising but definitely not mainstream, when he revealed MKOS I wasn't sure what to expect. I havent' <br/>
<br/>
seen MKOS since returnign to the game, and I've heard Brian Fred say it was good, and I know it was like broken at <br/>
<br/>
one point during my absence from the game. Knowing what aliens could do due to chu's agents, I decided not to <br/>
<br/>
start Uh-Oh V in case the mkos player came at me hard. Once I saw him really start to stack up, I drew up for Uh <br/>
<br/>
Oh and my musicians. And stack up he did. I'm talking like 5/6 aliens at each site doing Galid Drains. <br/>
<br/>
He left Jabba's Palace open with jabba/galid/ephant crew at the AC and some other guys at another interior JP <br/>
<br/>
site. He moved the sail barge with a merc pilot and some other aliens to the desert, so I dropped mace and v8 Obi <br/>
<br/>
Wan (who thus forth shall be known as Juice Obi) to JP. He moved his beatsquad over in front of me on his turn <br/>
<br/>
leaving the desert open. LUCKILY I had a flashback to my early years, moving into the desert and not being able to <br/>
<br/>
move out and getting the tar knocked out of me, so instead of moving out, I moved into the palace in front of <br/>
<br/>
jabba and crew figuring I could at least take out galid. He decided not to battle me, like, ever. And I moved to <br/>
<br/>
the entrance cavern or whatever it's called and he bulked up there, so I moved back in to the AC and battled <br/>
<br/>
killing Galid. Eventually the Jedi both died and i didnt take much damage but with Galid gone I projectioned 2 <br/>
<br/>
sites. Couple with the fact I'd finally gotten my retreival going along with a steady drain at naboo i won pretty <br/>
<br/>
handily.  FW by X<br/>
<br/>
Justin won his game against Whaley and we move on to face Chu and Lee.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: my LSC Music vs. Lee Edwards' FWKTIL<br/>
<br/>
Lee is playing Chu's fear which is Lewis' Fear. I know this is a tough matchup. We've talked about it being <br/>
<br/>
winnable for light, but I never thought it was. WIthout any space, the retrieval just isnt enough. It is pretty <br/>
<br/>
much a damage race with me retreiving just a little bit. I did some Okay damage but when he's doing 8 fear damage <br/>
<br/>
and draining for 6 what can retreiving for 3 really do? Nada.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily justin beat down Chu for 22 overflow when Chu forgot to save a force to play panic when justin started <br/>
<br/>
first strike and won by forty. So we move on to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LSC Music vs. PMJ's Bespin Tanks<br/>
<br/>
Unlike when I test against Chu's Bespin tanks, PMJ actually got out the free executor turn one, which is scary. I <br/>
<br/>
started Uh Oh knowing I'd have to start retreiving very early. It was an early drain race with him setting up and <br/>
<br/>
then coming at me with Sidious and Arica. I was able to combat Sidious off and then I had a decision to make, do I <br/>
<br/>
beat down arica, or do I take the fight to bespin and go kill some tanks. I decided to zap and kill some tanks. <br/>
<br/>
This game I went 3/3 on swinging at tanks and hitting them, which is pretty bad ass. I ended up taking out his <br/>
<br/>
ground forces pretty handily. At some point he made a slight noob move but it was in depseration as the game <br/>
<br/>
continued to swing my way, but he put thrawn on naboo and didnt fight so i just fry sizzled him. Mainly it was me <br/>
<br/>
swinging and killing tanks that really won the match, but equally important was finding Evacuation control so that <br/>
<br/>
I could go to Bespin with little fear of getting my wookie handed to me.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile justin beat his third straight watch your step, no easy task with huntdown and we think we're supposed <br/>
<br/>
to be playing hunter and reid, but since they had so many timed wins, we acutally ended up playing Angelo and his <br/>
<br/>
girlfriend, which some people snickered at, but truth be told, they were that high up because they hadn't lost a <br/>
<br/>
match all day and I'm pretty sure they were both 3-0 at that point.<br/>
<br/>
We broke down all the scenarios and we knew if we won one of our games, we would win. We were worried about having <br/>
<br/>
to play Hunter/Reid because even though they had three timed wins between the two of them, if they beat us both it <br/>
<br/>
meant that they would win beacuse 4 vPs would swing it just in their favor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LSC Music vs. Angelo "Escusi!" Conselo's Dbay HD<br/>
<br/>
I started evac control but honestly never needed it. Angelo didn't battle me at all. He did nothing but sit and <br/>
<br/>
track destinies for the longest time so that when he finally came down and I combatted him, he won with two <br/>
<br/>
sevens. I wen't and initiated battle off planet so that I could get my bith Shuffle off of Evac Control V and <br/>
<br/>
shuffled his decksizzle. So for whatever reason he never battled, I won a few combats, he won 2 all game. There <br/>
<br/>
was some minor interaction off planet but once Justin beat Sybil (Sp?) I knew we had the tournament locked up and <br/>
<br/>
didn't really pay attention. It was a fun game though and I joked around with Angelo alot. He has one of the all <br/>
<br/>
time greatest laughs and for whatever reason I just felt comfortable joking and having a fun time with him, maybe <br/>
<br/>
it was because he was european, but either way, we had some fun games this weekend. I ended up winning this game <br/>
<br/>
by about 9.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Justin Desai and Mike Gemme the KTOD are the 2007 World Team Champions!!! We win 150 dollars total and two <br/>
<br/>
trophies, which we knew were cups but we thought were just metal chalices. Turns out that when we showed up the <br/>
<br/>
next day they were 23 oz Glazz Beer Mugs with the SWCCG Logo and 2007 World Team Champions on it! They are easily <br/>
<br/>
the coolest trophies since Matt Sokol won the giant plate in '99. Some people hate on the plate but Justin and I <br/>
<br/>
have always had the utmost respect for it. A. Raph won one and B. you can serve sandwiches on it. Too good.<br/>
<br/>
We also receive byes for day two of the 2008 World Championship tournament so we literally don't have to play <br/>
<br/>
another sanctioned game for exactly one year, which is awesome and a relief at the same time. Even more funny, is <br/>
<br/>
that if justin or I were to win Worlds, the bye would be passed down to second place. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament got out pretty late. We caught a cab back to the hotel and for the life of me I can't think of what <br/>
<br/>
we did for dinner that night. it's possible that we went to the TGIFriday's but for some reason I thought we went <br/>
<br/>
there for lunch. Either way, with our decks already set, we were ready for bed.<br/>
<br/>
BUT NO. Justin started feeling panicked about the dark senate, thinking it needed vote nows and/or more space. I <br/>
<br/>
didn't really want to think about it and said I'd go with whatever he decided anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[SATURDAY]<br/>
<br/>
"damn, here we go again.<br/>
people talk exhaust, but when exhaust hits the fan<br/>
everything I'm not, made me everything I am<br/>
<br/>
and I'm back to tear it up<br/>
haters, start your engines<br/>
I hear 'em gearin' up"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wake up to Chu talking on the phone, justin isn't far behind me and he's going through cards almost if not <br/>
<br/>
immediately. I've talked about this on my Dark Senate blog, and when we go down to the breakfast buffet justin <br/>
<br/>
wants to play Thrawn/Chimera/Imp Command in the senate. I am on board, like I said, but I'm thinking about it all <br/>
<br/>
through breakfast and finally I decide that I can't play that 13 cost monster in a senate deck that would require <br/>
<br/>
two full turns of saving force to pull off and decide on Zuckuss/Mist Hunter V/V. I do a pretty good job of <br/>
<br/>
convincing him to do the same and I think we made the right choice. <br/>
<br/>
We get back to the shop and do our decklists, shoot the exhaust with people and wait for the pairings. Chu did his <br/>
<br/>
decklists mad fast so as to not have his command card anywhere near ours. Justin submitted ours together which Chu <br/>
<br/>
thought was wicked bad karma. With 40-something people there I wasn't that worried. <br/>
<br/>
So pairings get called and I'm one of the last people called and of course I get paired up with Hunter, my light <br/>
<br/>
vs. his dark. I really didn't want to face fear, but I was pretty sure I was going to have to.<br/>
<br/>
A little history on Hunter and I: Back at Origins in '03 Hunter and I played each other twice. In the first game, <br/>
<br/>
I played Vergance of the Force on my own location and it pretty much won me the game, when he came over to tell me <br/>
<br/>
about it afterwards he was pretty pissed and made it clear that he did not believe I did that inadvertantly. So we <br/>
<br/>
played later on, my senate vs his speeders. At some point he flipped my objective back and when I went to go <br/>
<br/>
battle him I had fulfilled the requirement on flipping my objective but had not physically flipped the objective <br/>
<br/>
back. Hunter was bitter about my misplay, and when I drew a senator for destiny in a key battle, he refused to <br/>
<br/>
forfeit for 6 and stuck with the 3 that was drawin in Edcel Bar Gane. I was pissed but there wasn't much I could <br/>
<br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
Let's see how bitter I was when Hunter sat down and satisfied his starting interrupt with three on table effects, <br/>
<br/>
none of which were endor shield...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Wys Spies vs. Hunter's SYCFA w/ FWKTIL<br/>
<br/>
So hunter sits down, we do our revealing, and hunter plays three effects. then i play three effects. we shuffle. <br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden he's like "Wait just a second" and goes through his deck like three times and looks panic <br/>
<br/>
stricken. He gets up from the table and goes to the judges and gets his decklist. I go over to see what the deal i <br/>
<br/>
s and apparently Hunter doesn't have endor shield V in his fear deck, which i hear is a pretty key card in his <br/>
<br/>
particular deckbuild. So hunter finally gets his exhaust straighetened out, but instead of the three janky effects <br/>
<br/>
that were played with Prepared Defenses earlier, and Endor Shield V was there! In my head I was like OH C'MON, <br/>
<br/>
but, and justin reiterated this later after the game when I relayed the story, that if I'm going to beat hunter, <br/>
<br/>
that's not the way I'm going to beat him. Instead, I made a sly underhanded comment about his 'misplay' during the <br/>
<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
I decided I had to go fast so I just dropped whatever I had to space to start draining. I got luke/cannon out asap <br/>
<br/>
and started drawing for han and the falcon. I went to the cantina to satisfy early battle plan but Sidious came <br/>
<br/>
down pretty much immediately. We trade small amounts of damage while we set up. Eventually he gets his fear going <br/>
<br/>
and spreads out, I'm doing the kessel drain for 2 while i get some space together. In my hand I have dash, <br/>
<br/>
outfider, mirax, pulsar skate and melas. He has two forces saved. To do everything I want I cannot grab barrier. <br/>
<br/>
Dash goes down against an ISD and gets barriered. I so want to grab but I don't. Here's where i make my mistake, I <br/>
<br/>
drop mirax to the SAME system. Barrier. I drop Melas on outrider.<br/>
<br/>
Next turn Hunter goes lat damage, overwhelmed, good game. I've got fear blocked with the toolkit and am taking his <br/>
<br/>
serious damage out of the game. But then, when his deck is sort of depleted and he can activate it all, he tracks <br/>
<br/>
a 5 ,and after searching out his second control/sfs with bewill, set for stuns han. Sure enough he does this for <br/>
<br/>
the next three turns, negating toolkit, thus winning him the game by 17.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Not being a goldenrod about endor shield V<br/>
Lows: making a classic bad decision on the first game of day 2.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: my DS KTOD Senate vs. LS Speeders vs. Raveling's boy.<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember this dude's name, but I tried talking to him the day before when I was having a conversation <br/>
<br/>
about tee shirts with Mike Raveling. Raveling had a pokemon trainer tshirt that i have, only his is in PRISTINE <br/>
<br/>
condition and mine is faded and looks less opaque than urine (it's bright yellow, or was). I had on my favorite <br/>
<br/>
tee, my avengers dissasembled tee shirt. Raveling's boy was like 'is that when scarlett witch killed everyone' and <br/>
<br/>
when I replied and started to try and talk comics with him, he basically ignored me. Raveling doesnt read comics <br/>
<br/>
really, so it was like I was talking to myself. Then I'd stop talking and this dude would start talking comics <br/>
<br/>
again, but he wouldn't really look at me. So there was some social ineptitude there, and that's all I had as an <br/>
<br/>
impression of this guy, until he laid down speeders, at which point i was like "speeders is bad."<br/>
<br/>
Right off the bat this guy Leia V's my lott dodd and next turn when I verify his deck and see x-wings am like Good <br/>
<br/>
game. It takes me a while, and a little too much drawing (no lott dodd sucks) but I get passel argente out, and by <br/>
<br/>
starting imperial decree V i really had him locked down. I set up drains at hoth and naboo and just drained while <br/>
<br/>
he did 2-1 damage a turn. Passel meant that he really couldn't come down to the system and fight me, all he could <br/>
<br/>
really do was cancel drains with Rebel Fleet, and even that wasn't enough as I won by 26 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: gettin a win with a dark I played about 4 games with this year, Diff<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS KTOD Senate vs. Rippetoe's old school Throne Room Start<br/>
<br/>
When Rip goes Throne ROom, old school careful planning for Farm and Outpost I'm like okay guy. and don't think <br/>
<br/>
much of it. First turn he drops bacta tank and I really don't even care so I'm like Lott dodd, toonbuck, go. On <br/>
<br/>
his turn he's like padme, battle, put her on the tank. I'm a little freaked but i take care of it, and reinforce <br/>
<br/>
at the senate. My turn I drop a few senators and Ability Ability Ability and give it back to him.<br/>
<br/>
Now. I have to tell you, this is the craziest sanctioned game I've ever played. We literally battled on every <br/>
<br/>
single turn for the next 20 some odd turns. I could never go into so much detail about that many battles, but I <br/>
<br/>
will give you some highlights: Oh wait, one more thing... re read that last sentence, and then read this one-- I <br/>
<br/>
for some reason started first strike.<br/>
<br/>
the next time he came to the senate he had an epp qui gon, jar jar, padme, senator palpatine, and that republic <br/>
<br/>
guy who is a built in houjix. <br/>
<br/>
During the course of the game he killed every single one of my senators at least once (though Baskol was on a <br/>
<br/>
political effect when he got killed [yes he started Scrambled transmission V and he used it 5 times]).<br/>
<br/>
He killed Aks Moe three times. So in total he killed 13 senators, one of EACH UNIQUE SENATOR CHARACTER IN THE <br/>
<br/>
GAME. <br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty sure he altered my senate cam. He might've done it twice.<br/>
<br/>
i set up a space drain pretty early to put the pressure on him. Plus considering he had a huge deck only starting <br/>
<br/>
4 cards, I had to do a lot more damage to him, as Senate puts a lot on table. Late game he comes up to space with <br/>
<br/>
some Han Chewie Falcons and kills me, and I keep going there. On the ground I have maul w/ saber and bliz 4 with <br/>
<br/>
Leia RP moving in front of maul to block a drain, and me draining w/ bliz 4 and moving it in front of leia, and <br/>
<br/>
maul to the other site. Thsi goes on for a little too long and I'm able to activate exactly enough to grab vader <br/>
<br/>
with lott dodd, drop him for 8 (goo came out very early) battle, retreive, cut leia, overflow for 10 and pretty <br/>
<br/>
much win the game right there.<br/>
<br/>
It was a mentally gruelling game however, and I was shocked and glad to pull it out. Justin had watched some of it <br/>
<br/>
and was shocked that I won. That would seem to be a running theme.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating a deck I felt was specifically built to beat my deck.<br/>
Lows: Starting first strike.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My WYS Spies vs. Greg Shaw's DS Combat.<br/>
<br/>
Now all day at day 1, Justin and I were trying to convince Shaw to show us his girlfriends tittyballs. In this <br/>
<br/>
attempt, I showed Greg numerous pictures of titty balls and cleevage and even a wicked hot chick naked, in just <br/>
<br/>
body paint. Justin offered to play a video clip of himself moaning, which shaw declined. In round 2 of day 2, <br/>
<br/>
everyone had to repair. Justin and Greg were paired and they were going to bet a picture of shaw's girl's <br/>
<br/>
tittyballs to the winner, then the repair quashed that. So I made the dealio with greg that if I beat him, he had <br/>
<br/>
to show me some cleevage. He took the deal and we laid it out.<br/>
<br/>
Now my light has no autowins, but ds combat I felt was it's best matchup. He went down turn 1 with maul and the <br/>
<br/>
sideways saber. I got a lot of force so I went Luke to Tatooine and drew some. he drained me for 4. i didn't want <br/>
<br/>
that to happen so my turn 2 I sent another ship to kessel and dropped chewie's atst and two smugglers to the <br/>
<br/>
docking bay and played ultimatum. At that point he put down another jedi to resume the drain for four. I put mirax <br/>
<br/>
in the cantina with lando w/ axe, but i didnt' have any more characters so I left them alone. <br/>
<br/>
Next turn I it could be worsed his drain of two, knowing that he had at least one omni box combo in his deck. I <br/>
<br/>
had no characters to back up the cantina and hoped that he'd burn serious force on an it's worse. Of course he <br/>
<br/>
thought and thought and counted and counted and the whole time i'm flipping my hand pretending to pretend to act <br/>
<br/>
cool when in fact I was cool as a cucumber with my it's a hit in my hand. He used 11 and i cancelled it. he spent <br/>
<br/>
his last 3 forces to drain some more. <br/>
<br/>
So he's got to do SOMETHING to win this game and he comes down to the docking bay with vader and someone. maybe <br/>
<br/>
boba fett. Either way I had luke with I'm With you Too at tat holding it down and in the end I let him draw 10 <br/>
<br/>
battle destiny that took the guys off the walker but left the ATST itself. I cleared his site. Next turn I drop <br/>
<br/>
two more smugglers in the atst and his drains of 4 aren't competing with my drains of 8 plus 1 retreival. And I <br/>
<br/>
win the game, and see some big titty cleavage pretty handily.<br/>
<br/>
highs: Setting up ultimatum turn 2 with WYS which didnt' happen once in playtesting.<br/>
lows: knowing i got lucky he did not go down to the cantina. And he almost did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My WYS Spies vs. Angelo "'Scuzi!" Conselo's BHBM<br/>
<br/>
So I get paired up, once again, with Angelo and again I'm playing light against his dark. We didn't test BHBM at <br/>
<br/>
all, but I got a taste of Drew Scott's at PA states, but not with WYS. Playing without luke wasn't something I was <br/>
<br/>
excited about. Even if he didnt' play vader, I couldn't very well deploy luke to tatooine and have him play vader <br/>
<br/>
somewhere like endor and get screwed for 3 forces a turn. So I go to space with everyone else, and anywhere he <br/>
<br/>
goes on the ground, I put an undercover spy. I think he frysizzled one spy, and I just redeployed a new one next <br/>
<br/>
turn. I know at one point I miraxed at the start of my deploy thinking "as long as this isn't boushhh I'm set" and <br/>
<br/>
of course it was bousshhh who I was just about to deploy with Chewbacca Protector V's game text. So I was limiting <br/>
<br/>
damage to him and liek a good BHBM player he didn't put vader out.<br/>
<br/>
It got to the point where I was just doing more damage than him because of my space drains and undercover spies, <br/>
<br/>
so he puts down vader. I do some space deploying and at the last second realize i have to give him luke, luckily i <br/>
<br/>
have three forces saved and send luke to vader via the lost pile. And I also play an uncontrollable fury on his <br/>
<br/>
epp vader.<br/>
<br/>
On his turn he puts vader in the bliz 4 (which, can you even do with a captive?) then moves him to the dstar <br/>
<br/>
docking bay, then into the throne room and duels. He draws a 7 and a 7. Luckily, I just happened to be tracking 2 <br/>
<br/>
sevens through  my deck. Now they weren't on top, but I knew where they were, and one of em was i'm with you too <br/>
<br/>
V, which is perfect in this matcup. SO i activate to the IWYT and grab it with mirax, then activate to the other <br/>
<br/>
7. do my draining and drop the effect on luke. Out of the 5 duels Angelo ran, i won three of them, which is pretty <br/>
<br/>
badass. In the end it was the damage of uncontrollable fury that truly won me the game, and that will be a key <br/>
<br/>
factor as the tournament unfolds.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating a former world champ at world champs<br/>
lows: miraxing for boushh!<br/>
<br/>
So at this point Justin is 5-0, I'm 4-1. We're in first and second. Which is pretty frimbazeling badass considering <br/>
<br/>
that we won the team tournament the day before. We take a walk around the building and discuss options to getting <br/>
<br/>
into the top 8. In the end we decide that it really doesn't matter if I'm playing dark I have the advantage and <br/>
<br/>
should be able to make it so that I'm 5-1 and he's 5-1.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My DS KTOD Senate vs. Justin Desai's LS KTOD Senate<br/>
<br/>
So we know this matchup and how it goes. For more details see my Blog on the players committee site. I get control <br/>
<br/>
of the senate after 3 or 4 turns mostly because of toonbuck toora and baron and he draws up. He puts down the <br/>
<br/>
threed palace generator core and 4-5 guys there cancelling my ability ability ability. I've got a solid space <br/>
<br/>
drain set up, but am never able to back it up and he comes down and clears it twice with Han Chewie and the <br/>
<br/>
falcon. I'm cancelling his drain mostly, and putting his hand back when he can, but It's hard for me to cancel his <br/>
<br/>
drain, set up space, add to my drain in space and manipluate his hand all at once. I also chase his remnant <br/>
<br/>
senators down, who were chilling in the jedi council chamber. It was a pretty uneventful game but justin made it a <br/>
<br/>
ton closer than it had been in testing. Going into that matchup, it seemed that whatever side won, won by about <br/>
<br/>
20-25. I'm pretty sure I won this game by less than 10 because he was able to handle me in space so well with the <br/>
<br/>
han chewie falcon.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Ending justin's 30 game winning streak in the state of chicago<br/>
Lows: Beating my friend and teammate at worlds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: My WYS Spies vs. Tom Hollingworth's KTOD Huntdown<br/>
<br/>
I've played against tom a lot this year. We've gotten some games online. He knew this deck. When I saw HD w/ <br/>
<br/>
Conduct Your Search, I was pretty sure I knew his deck too. Tom is also very good, as evidenced by what I'm sure <br/>
<br/>
you all know was a top 4 finish at worlds this year. But Tom continually claeaned our clocks all year and I've <br/>
<br/>
been playing against him since he was about 11 years old. We knew each other well and decided that no matter what <br/>
<br/>
happened in the game, neither of us would blow the other out. <br/>
<br/>
it started out like a normal game, I go down with luke to tatooine early and don't drop kessel. I've got a hyper <br/>
<br/>
escape in my hand. Luckily too because he comes down with maul, ship and grabs I have you now with crush the <br/>
<br/>
rebellion. I hyper escape to the luckily drawn rendevous point (Note: When i draw rendevous point in my opening <br/>
<br/>
hand with this deck, i don't lose). I move luke into kessel, but stupidly because I can't drain. So i get an xwing <br/>
<br/>
cannon on luke and move him in front of maul and I save three force every turn from here on out.<br/>
<br/>
Here's where it gets pretty dicey. He's got choke vader with palps and after zuckuss 4 lom came down and took out <br/>
<br/>
my dash/outrider I had to burn my wokling, I couldn't grab nightfall and couldnt block his drains. we had some big <br/>
<br/>
battles and I had some classic old school moves, cancelling and redrawing with captain han when he only had <br/>
<br/>
exactly enough cards in his reserve to draw what he deserved, meaning han was just straight up cancelling <br/>
<br/>
destinies in space, I so wish I'd saved more forces!! I also have fury on vader and he isn't doing anything about <br/>
<br/>
it but losing 2 force a turn. He's got a steady drain in space by moving maul away from luke, and at the cantina. <br/>
<br/>
The onyl damage i'm doing to him is with fury, since he's moving away from luke, who i can't drain with. exhaust is <br/>
<br/>
getting really tight now and time is running out. I've got an empty falcon floating around in space and I've got <br/>
<br/>
to set up coward so i can retreive with an on the edge. <br/>
<br/>
I had a sweet play all set up, I was going to drop chewie against vader and emperor, edge, battle (he had first <br/>
<br/>
strike out) and lose chewie to cover all the damage. I thought I had some exhaust tracked but wasn't sure, so when I <br/>
<br/>
had one card in my reserve, I used rycar to check what it was, and it was han's toolkit. And i'm like okay, i <br/>
<br/>
retreive 3, and tom's like uhhh you have to take that into hand. frimbazel. not only do i not do my play and retreive, <br/>
<br/>
but now my life force is one less. that's butt. So ihave to do it NEXT turn, and since my life force is less, I <br/>
<br/>
can only retreive 3 (and not at all with first strike) though I had a 5 tracked. In any event the play was sick, <br/>
<br/>
and I was able to find a melas right after to get him on the floating falcon and do some extra help to luke in <br/>
<br/>
space. <br/>
<br/>
In the end time gets called and if we let the game progress it will be a timed game by 10, but tom sees no <br/>
<br/>
advantage to a timed loss and draws up on his turn to get me the full win.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning a game with 1 card, and a game everyone thought I was going to lose. 3-1 with light!!!<br/>
Lows: getting handled in space. I didn't see that coming.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm in first place now. Chu thought he was playing hunter for the tournament, but If i had won my last game I <br/>
<br/>
would've won the tournament. <br/>
<br/>
Of course I get paired with Tom Hollingworth again who just hooked me up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: My DS KTOD Senate vs. Tom Hollingworth's LS Senate<br/>
<br/>
Now tom's senate is a lot different than jutin's. He plays the real falcon with captain or epp han, CC leia V, etc <br/>
<br/>
to totally blow out dark space. I was only running 1 tie cannon but an added ship. <br/>
<br/>
I told tom we were going to have a real battle for the senate, but two things were majorly different in this game. <br/>
<br/>
1 I didn't drop toonbuck and instead dropped the gemmeperor who did absolutely nothing and lost me the game. <br/>
<br/>
Again, if you want more details into this matchup and that caustic play in general, read my blog on the PC site. <br/>
<br/>
Dropping the gemmeperor effectively cost me the game. While I really wanted to hook up tom, I also really wanted <br/>
<br/>
to win day 2 of worlds, which would've been huge for me. Unfortunately, with him controlling the senate there <br/>
<br/>
wasn't much I could do, especially against his super falcon. Eventually he went to the forest with qui gon and <br/>
<br/>
that made it really tough. I went with one more surprise attack to the senate and the game was actually really <br/>
<br/>
close. Tom Drew a few too many cards (about 5) late in the game, and only beat me by about five forces.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: None really. <br/>
Lows: Coming in fourth instead of first =(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that was it for day 2. Chu came in first, justin second, and me fourth, meaning we put three people in the top <br/>
<br/>
half of the bracket, which is all too good for our reputation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now. Here comes the good stuff. When Justin and I won the team tourament and were told we were getting glasses, we <br/>
<br/>
thought that they were metal chalices, which were okay, old school trophy, etc. But when we got to day 2 we found <br/>
<br/>
that what we had actually won were 23 oz GIANT GLASS MUGS that say 2007 team tournament champions!!! <br/>
<br/>
We went to TGIFriday's across from the hotel we stayed at and saw hunter and raveling and a crew go in as well. We <br/>
<br/>
sit not so near them and get this pretty cute waitress with really nice breasts. I ask her if she's willing to <br/>
<br/>
fill up my mug in the car. She's REALLY standoffish at this point and even goes so far as to call me a fag when <br/>
<br/>
I'm outside in the car getting the mug. Of course when I get back she COMPLETELY 180s when she sees that it's a <br/>
<br/>
starwars mug claiming to looooove starwars and harry potter WELL MEE TOOO LADY!!!<br/>
<br/>
So she fills up the mug with sam oktoberfest and i continue to flirt a bit. We actually have a pretty fun dinner, <br/>
<br/>
I bring my beer mug over to hunter and them and they aren't impressed. We joke with the waitress and her insanely <br/>
<br/>
hot 17 year old sister who is also a waitress. Justin orders pasta with maple syrup and it looks hella, hella <br/>
<br/>
gross. Then the moneyexhaust happens. Her and her sister come over with a little hop step, arm in arm, and go, in <br/>
<br/>
unison "How old are you?!" and I pretty much know, even though I'm 26 and old as exhaust, I got this. Of course the <br/>
<br/>
downside is that I'm leaving sunday night and have to play cards all day sunday. I ask her to hang out tonight, <br/>
<br/>
her friends, my friends, but she's got plans with a girl from work and doesn't wanna blow up her friend by <br/>
<br/>
bringing a dude she met at fridays over on the very night she met him, which i completely understnad, but i hit <br/>
<br/>
her with my number and when I'm back at the hotel she texts me to come over and hang with her in the parking lot <br/>
<br/>
until her friend is all set. So I do and we have a pretty good talk just chilling until her friend calls and she <br/>
<br/>
has to bounce. Which sucks but I'm already seeing a couple girls, both of which are hot and I'm not really <br/>
<br/>
sweating it. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone is sleeping when I get back at like 130. The only thing in my head about day 3 is i have no idea what to <br/>
<br/>
play and i'll figure it out in the morning. I had it stuck in my head that I was pissed i didn't switch to light <br/>
<br/>
combat on day 3 in 2003 when my light senate really exhaust the bed over day 1 and 2 even though I advanced on both <br/>
<br/>
days (mainly due to the inception of KTOD Huntdown and it's ensuing dominance). What I really should've been <br/>
<br/>
thinking is that I had a solid light deck. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, I think even moreso than Tom Hollingworth, who was everyone's longshot when we all got on the planes <br/>
<br/>
earlier in the week, I was the "I'm just happy to be here" guy, because I never really gave myself a shot at day <br/>
<br/>
three, and I'd really not felt like a top level player all year. But I went to bed that night with a smile on my <br/>
<br/>
face, and a half eaten quesadilla on my nightstand that I was saving for breakfast in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Day 3<br/>
<br/>
"It ain't happen yet<br/>
And that's what the intuition is<br/>
When you hop back in the car<br/>
Drive back to the crib<br/>
Run back to their arms<br/>
The *smokescreens*<br/>
The chokes and the screams<br/>
You ever wonder what it all really means?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we get up and head down to the breakfast buffet to start eating. I pass on eating because I ate the leftover <br/>
<br/>
quesadilla right when I woke up when we were deciding what to play. I've basically decided to play a solid <br/>
<br/>
lightsaber combat for a number of reasons. A. If I got past tom, it's the only deck that we think can stand up to <br/>
<br/>
Chu's Agents, and even that is a long shot. B. I really regret never switching to light combat on day 3 of 2003 <br/>
<br/>
and thought that it would be a good move to do it now. Also, I specifically didn't play light combat all season <br/>
<br/>
(after the MPil the Team Tournament because Justin and I are for some reason known as being Light Combat <br/>
<br/>
players, and I wanted to shake that stigma for this very reason.<br/>
<br/>
This ends up being a pretty substantial mistake for a number of reasons. One being that in 03 my light senate was <br/>
<br/>
not doing very well, whereas my WYS really kicked some wookie yesterday, even against my day 3 opponent, and I <br/>
<br/>
thought I could play better than I did on day 2 in that matchup. I didn't know what Tom was going to play for <br/>
<br/>
dark, but it was between the Huntdown, Watto and CCT. I thought he'd switch to CCT, but he didn't. He stuck with <br/>
<br/>
Huntdown. <br/>
<br/>
Before the tournament justin and I went next door to the asian bakery to strategize. Now me and justin are avid <br/>
<br/>
seinfeld fans, and try to watch 3-4 episodes a day on TBS and our local Fox affiliate. One of our favorite Mr. <br/>
<br/>
Pitt moments is when Elaine names the old ragtime tune "Next stop pottersville" and earns mr. pitt a spot holding <br/>
<br/>
the woody woodpecker float at the thanksgiving day parade. Mr. Pitt does this dance and sings "next stop <br/>
<br/>
pottersville! next stop pottersville!!" well the bakery next door is called bakersville, so for the rest of the <br/>
<br/>
weekend me and justin just went around singing "next stop bakersville!" and doing the mr pitt dance.<br/>
<br/>
For Dark I decided to swtich to senate, but I wish I'd considered playing KTOD Huntdown, especially when I showed <br/>
<br/>
up to the tournament and heard Tom asking the judge a question about jedi luke, and I was farily certain tom was <br/>
<br/>
playing Combat. <br/>
<br/>
With all our belongings at the shop (our flight was later that evening) we started the matches. I elected to play <br/>
<br/>
dark first against Tom's light, because you want to play what you consider the better matchup first, and I was <br/>
<br/>
curious to see if Tom was really playing combat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: my KTOD DS Senate vs. Tom's Super-Luke Lightsaber Combat<br/>
<br/>
A funny moment happened to start the game. Tom put down 2 effects and then was deciding between two other effects <br/>
<br/>
to start as his third. They were unseen to me, but after about 2 minutes of deciding Tom decided to go with Civil <br/>
<br/>
Disorder V. I said to him "Gonna hope to draw into that scrambled transmission huh?" and his jaw dropped as his <br/>
<br/>
face when blank. I had a feeling tom would put that in his deck, and to be honest, I was hoping he'd play it. It <br/>
<br/>
wouldve done another 6-8 more damage against him which couldve been a major difference in the game.<br/>
<br/>
So Tom was playing combat, and my gameplan was to go to space and get that drain of four going early while he sets <br/>
<br/>
up on the ground. So that's basically what I did. He put down a super luke, with bionic hand, i'm with you too and <br/>
<br/>
a saber down on like turn 1. I was draining in space and dropping his hand and he was draining on the ground. I <br/>
<br/>
don't have any notes from day 3, but I know eventually he dropped kessel and ships, but I don't remember what. It <br/>
<br/>
may have been super falcon, I'm not really sure. <br/>
<br/>
Honestly nothing too eventful happened this game and he pretty much just generally beat me by the mid teens.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: my LS Combat vs Tom's KTOD Huntdown<br/>
<br/>
Now I knew I had to win, and this is a stupid tough matchup, so I decided that instead of playing crazy <br/>
<br/>
conservative, I was just going to go for it and try to do fast damage and hope he got a exhaustty hand.<br/>
<br/>
My hand had almost all guys so I felt pretty okay. I started evac control, quick draw and wokling, he started <br/>
<br/>
ability ability abilty V which seems to be the most broken card ever in huntdown, especialyl in his matchup. <br/>
<br/>
Apparently tom packed it because he thought i'd go to light senate on day three. So much for shaking that stigma.<br/>
<br/>
So turn 1 I go down with Juice Obi wan and a stick and he comes down with maul, kills him. Second turn I go down <br/>
<br/>
with another jedi, he kills him. Third turn I go down with Lando, he comes down and killsh im. I go down with <br/>
<br/>
ANOTHER jedi, and he comes down and kills him. at this point, all i've done was spend forces tog et guys out, i <br/>
<br/>
had no guys left in my hand, and I hadn't drawn any cards. I've been taking steady visage damage, and he's waxed <br/>
<br/>
everything I've thrown out, it's pretty much over. My plan failed and i'm out of day 3.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To be honest I'm pretty okay with this. I had a good showing, I got handed 150 bucks and some dope packs of <br/>
<br/>
coruscant (though my pulls sucked). I also pulled a black border dark side disarmed, which i don't even own a WB <br/>
<br/>
of. And Eier pulled a BB Light Disarmed. He wanted to trade, and I said i'll trade if you throw in a WB DIsarmed <br/>
<br/>
for dark, so I got a 2-1 and he thinks he robbed me but who the hell plays dark side disarmed? not me.<br/>
<br/>
So I've been trying to meet up with my friend chrstine for years, and she lives in chicago going to school there, <br/>
<br/>
so i hightail it from the tournament to go to loyola and meet her. the mapquest said this is a 14 mile drive, it <br/>
<br/>
turned into a 40 dollar cab ride. We spent an hour together getting dinner and hanging out (chicago deep dish ftw) <br/>
<br/>
and it was an amazing hour but I had to rush to the airport in a cab with a cabby who refused to break 50 miles an <br/>
<br/>
hour even though I told him I was in a rush, and it was also a 30 dollar ride. SO i basically went on a 115 <br/>
<br/>
dollar, 1 hour date during which I didn't get any. Boner city man.<br/>
<br/>
Now I meet chu and lee and justin at the airport and they eat the rest of my deepdish since we can't get through <br/>
<br/>
security. In the security line Chu sees one of his third cousins, this other violinist named Rachel who goes to <br/>
<br/>
harvard and has no respect for chu's music playing ability. We talked to her for a bit and then by the time we got <br/>
<br/>
to the gate, they were boarding and it was time to go.<br/>
<br/>
Me and justin had the dope hetero sexual buffer zone going again, but when we got to our aisle, the hottest <br/>
<br/>
frimbazeling most beautiful girl i've ever seen on a plane was in justin's row on the window, with a seat in between. <br/>
<br/>
Her seat was 27F, the middle one was 27E and justin's was 27D. First he offered me his seat so I could get to <br/>
<br/>
macking, but I declined, as my airplane game is never very good. But justin, in one of hte funnier moves I've seen <br/>
<br/>
him make, is he crossed out the D on his ticket, and wrote E in, so that he could sit in the middle seat. I dunno, <br/>
<br/>
it made us laugh.<br/>
<br/>
The pilot of this flight was a madman. You know when you're taxing in an airplane and the plane takes that final <br/>
<br/>
turn, then pauses a second before it guns it's engines to go on the straightaway? Not our pilot. This guy gunned <br/>
<br/>
the engine while taxiing, and we took that 90 degree turn at about 85 miles per hour AT LEAST, and everyone on the <br/>
<br/>
plane was talking about how crazy that turn was and how drunk the pilot must be. Not to mention there were tons of <br/>
<br/>
chicago marathoners on the plane, all fresh off of a marathon that killed like 902342 people from heat exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
So we get in pretty late, and then I have to drive Lee home and of course instead of writing down directions, he <br/>
<br/>
claims he knows the way to the place he's living, but gets us lost all the same when we try and head there. I am <br/>
<br/>
pretty pissed because I'm pretty tired from a harrowing weekend. I get home around 2-230 and hit the sac, and <br/>
<br/>
worlds is over.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as a special bonus to those of you who actually read this whole thing, before the props and slops, which <br/>
<br/>
people generally will skip down to, I'll tell you the origins of taco bill. Because I asked taco bill, why the <br/>
<br/>
hell do they call you taco bill? And he said, when he was little, he used to be able to eat a exhaustton of tacos for <br/>
<br/>
some reason. not anything else, just mad tacos and that everyone in his grade school called him taco bill. And I <br/>
<br/>
asked him if people still call him thatk or if they bumped into him on the street after all this time, would eople <br/>
<br/>
call him taco bill? and he said no, they wouldn't. bummer. Also it didnt occur to me (and i've known taco bill for <br/>
<br/>
at least four years) that taco bill is like taco bell, except with the e changed to an i. wow. I feel really dumb <br/>
<br/>
for not realizing that until right now.<br/>

Henry: glad you got the yelling down<br/>
Mark: thanks for the wendys! and the rides!<br/>

Honestly, I could keep going for hours and hours but It's taken me two weeks to write this TR, and I'm pretty sure <br/>

last minute ammendment: Some dude Luhkin just reviewed my WYS deck at less stars because he thought I played the all wings NON COMBO. what a n00b. that pisses me off. I never had a 5* deck before.<br/>
