<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Sunday morning, just got home from a tournament this past Saturday the 14th at The Gauntlet at Modesto, CA, and this isnt much to tell, but enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<br>
During the week I was trying figure out what to study for finals, which is creeping ever closer. Kevin Shannon talks to me online once in awhile and tells me about a tourney at Pleasonton, starting at 11, on Saturday. He expects good players to show, and I talk to Grand Slam winner Ohmy Fasudhani about it. He says he might go and thats all I did for tournaments that week. <br>
<br>
Saturday morning, I wake up with a headache after studying the night before, I look at the clock and its 11 a.m........so much for Pleasonton. I log online and see Paul Feldman and ask him about Pleasonton and he tells me theres one in Modesto, so I call up Ohmy and we rush there. No time to waste, so I grab some cards to mod my LS and do it in the car. We get there late, after making the rest of the 14 players wait 50 minutes for us. First games gone and done, and we start off the 2nd playing each other.....thats not even anything since I coulnt even mod my decks in the car too much since I had to help navigate. Luckily the TD allowed me to....thanks again for that.<br>
<br>
LS: Speed Profit........modified with Senses and other goods for the meta<br>
DS: Hunt Down HARDCORE Dueling.......self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS Speed Profit vs. Ohmy Fasudhani's DS Raltiir Ops<br>
<br>
Great...why cant I ever play his LS? I might have a chance against that.....Anyways, I didnt get a chance to mod my decks cause we were already about 15 minutes into the 2nd game, so I had to play with the older version, no Senses and such. I get the junkiest draw in the world....my 2 characters in hand both being Han. I draw and find Ani's stick, Luke and Ben so Im okay. He tries to set up and I drop Luke and Ben on my turn. He flips, drops Kashyyyk,  I free Han.....we both do our damage. I drop Cantina, and start migrating towards it. So Im sufficiently spread out, Luke at the AC, Leia and Lando at JP, and Ben and Han at the Cantina. I have It's A Trap!, so I dont fear beatdown......until I decide to draw 1 and find my other one. Great....so at the end of that same turn he Masterfuls and Monnoks me on his turn, killing both of them. He proceeds to drop Tarkin, Tempest Scout 3, and DLOTS to JP and smack on my guys.....AFTER he Tramples Lando of course. Leia gets worked, and I draw a 1 to boot. She dies out plus about 9 more. I still have Han so Im doing damage, and I drop Boussh to JP to nullify his drains there. Eventually, his drains at Raltiir and Kashyyyk are too much for me, and I die out. Loss by 18.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 0(-18)<br>
Highs: Nothing much<br>
Lows: Im starved, Didnt get a chance to mod my decks, and Im now in a ditch with 2 losses.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: DS Hunt Down HARDCORE vs. Jack's LS HB Corvettes<br>
<br>
I think the guys name is Jack....sorry if thats wrong. I start Security Precations, he starts Haven. I draw a hand full of characters and spend my next few turns looking for a site. He sets up drops Coruscant and Kessel to help my activation. I drop Death Star, and keep drawing. He looks for systems and drop Corvettes for free to the RPoint. Im getting sick of not drawing squat for sites, so I make my own BGround with the Wampa Cave and Presence....drop Vader and saber there with Tarkin and flip. He loses to Visage the rest of game. He tries to spread out, and waits to flip. I drain, drop Mara for more drains and Reactor....wait for him to flip. He flips on my turn before I draw, but forgets to drain next turn.  He drops Luke on a Corvette.....great.....thanks again, Hunt Down. Anyways, I drop ships and Probe, found it on the second try. I drop Battle Order, and the rest of the game is spent with me running from him and him chasing me with luke not draining. Win by 26.<br>
<br>
Cumalative Score: 2(+8)<br>
Highs: Coming back strong<br>
Lows: Playing a kid<br>
<br>
<br/>
Game 4: LS Speed Profit vs. Mark's DS Characters Galore Junk<br/>
<br/>
I dont know what the guy was doing, he didnt know what Profit did. He starts off the Holotable, what a nice thing now that Ive taken out my Transmission Terminateds. Oh well....I EPP Leia and Mos Eisley first turn and free Han on the second. He drops Chall Bekan to Mos Esiley with Wuher(that is correct) on his. I Nabrun over, drop Ben and stick and beat meatballs outta Chall. I spread on Tatooine, drain. He drops Davin Felth and Wallace to the AC since Im so far away, and I migrate back there, only to have him run away. I over draw like mad, but Sense every interrupt he dishes out. In the end, Profit damage and drains are too much, and hes not draining or battling, so Im okay. Win by 28.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+36)<br/>
Highs: Im looking at going 4-2.<br/>
Lows: Another scrub<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We take a break for food and finally Im getting some eats. Me and Ohmy head down to Taco Bell and grab some Chicken Burritos and Chalupas and talk about our games. Ohmy is undefeated minus the bye he took(with me due to our lateness, 0(+0) ), and is looking to play Feldman in the final round. He also played this jabroni ass kid who tried to cheat during his game with him following the bye. Im just trying to grab second if thats even possible. Chalupas, by the way, are the biggest pieve of monkeycrap you can buy at Taco Bell.....its nothing but a taco that costs more...shell tastes like burnt sofa.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS Hunt Down HARDCORE vs. Some Jabroni's LS Tatooine Mains<br/>
<br/>
His names Thomas, dont think I forgot him. This is the same guy who cheated on Ohmy's game, and you'd better believe I kept a close eye on him. He started Obi's Hut and Goo Nee Tay and I start Crush the Rebellion, we both spend our time drawing the first few turns.....He drops Cantina and Mos Eisley first turn, and Jabba's Palace second, and activations aplenty. I drop Vader to Mos Eisley with Blizzard 2, flip, and move over to the Hut. He drops Obi and stick over to Cantina with EPP Luke and Chewie to make me flip back. I have Circle in hand, and destinies are in the deck, so I drop Tarkin to Mos Eisley and move Vader over. His turn he drains, shuffles over and battle....cool. I Weapon Lev Obi's stick, he plays Gift of the Mentor. I epic duel Obi.....I draw.....7,6.....he draws......0, 1(its BEN!)....so Obi's gone plus 9 more. I play I Have You Now and choke out Luke, with a 6(lucked out), and draw 3 destinies of 1, so Chewies not takin BDamage. I lose Tarkin because he GOMentored and hit a 4 total. He proceeds to stay away from Vader now, drops Wedge and KalFal to JP(does he know they cant draw destiny?) and Luke(YAY!) to a newly deployed Tosche Station. I drop Mara, look at my tracked destinies which I THINK are there, drop First Strike, battle, retrieve one, he loses one, and Obsession. I draw the same 7 and 6, he draws a 4 and 5, Lukes gone, and he loses 15 to end the game.<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 6(+66)<br/>
Highs: Might actually go 4-2<br/>
Lows: Nothing much....the kid was jittery all game long cause I was eyeing every movement he made so closely.....pretty funny, actually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS Speed Profit vs. Garretts DS TDIGWATT DDeal Objective<br/>
<br/>
Well, gotta finish strong. He starts off with the Upper Walkway and Any Methods for the CC Prison and the Zuckuss twins, in addition to Dr. E and Mara to the AC. First turn he forgets Maras saber, but drops the Prison, Lobot and Lando from Reserve thanks to the Tower. I drop Master Luke, battle, pop up Dr. E, and Smoke Screen to off Mara and Mara draws below Luke's immunity. He drains, drops Zuckuss to Bespin. I flip, drain one lose one and drop Boushh to the Walkway with Lando and Lobot. He drops IG-88 with Needa and Ozzel and battles, captures Han and kills Luke through BDamage.  Needa dies so can still try to free Han thanks to Ozzel. I drop Luke and Orrimaarko, but draw a 1 so only Ozzel dies.....I move Luke and Orri out and Strangle IG to get the job done. He drops Vader with stick and the Carbonite Chamber, Dengar at the Prison and a TIE to B:CCity, and flips, sets up Occupation. I drop Ben to Han and Orri, Nabrun to CC during my move phase due to IAO. I run Dengar out of the prison(wasnt draining there anyways due to Someone Who Loves You) and proceed to the CChamber. Every turn I would lose to space damage and Occupation, he loses to drains and Profit. I move over to block his drain at the CChamber, he battles, I Narrow Escape and do that for the next few turns......its a close call, but I edge it out by 5.<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 8(+71)<br/>
Highs: Finished 4-2<br/>
Lows: Nothing much...had fun<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Final standings are done, Ohmy and I take the tourney. Here are the top 3:<br/>
<br/>
Winner: Ohmy Fasudhani<br/>
2nd: Alfred Dong <br/>
3rd: Paul Todd Feldman<br/>
<br/>
I take 2nd and finished strong, much to the surprise of alot of scrubs there. I pull junk in prize support and thats that. Ohmy played Feldman not once but TWICE in the final round, Ohmy beating him twice BECAUSE HE GOT GREEDY.....Hahahahaha. Decent tournament that wouldve been better if 4 of the players hadnt dropped to go to work. I see the new powers of Profit now, its great....best LS deck out there now.<br/>
