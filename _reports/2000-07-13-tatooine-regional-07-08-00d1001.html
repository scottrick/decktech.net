Hello All!!<br/>
<br/>
   Well, its Regional time. Time to see how I fair outside of my little pond. This years Regional is being held in Las Vegas. So Thursday I quit my job and head off to Phoenix to catch a ride with some players from there. Its also my birthday to have dinner with some friends Thursday night. Friday morning I head on over to Mike Sinclairs place and we get ready to get going. Just sitting around surrounded by all the Star Wars, I could tell this was going to be a good weekend.<br/>
<br/>
   The ride up to Las Vegas a uneventful. At least compared to some of the storied Don and Josh were telling me from previous road trips. There were 6 of us in 2 cars. Don Anzalone, Josh Martin and myself in one car. Mike Sinclair, Brett Kitani, and Brandon Allen in the other. After travelling all over Las Vegas looking for the hotel, we finally found ours. (Actually, I was going to stay with Derek Conklin at Arizona Charlies, but we never met up so I stayed with Don, Josh and Mike.) It was really good to stay with them. I learned more about Star Wars in 36 hours that I ever had since I learned to play the game. (Thanks guys for all the advice and insight.)<br/>
<br/>
   The tournament was the biggest Id ever been to, but smaller than the other Regionals Id been reading about on the Net. Turns out that the Colorado crew decided not to make it this year. But there were still 50 other hopefuls willing to represent Tatooine in Orlando. I wanted to play in the YJ tournament, but staying up until 3:00 AM isnt conducive to good playing. After we filled out our command cards and went through the announcements, Chris Hines (Gold 8) started reading off the names.<br/>
<br/>
LS  Playing Sabacc for a Profit<br/>
   (Tessek at the Audience Chamber with drains and sabacc at Cloud City.)<br/>
DS  Max of Tats Rumors<br/>
   (Endor Operations with the focus on Rumors, but with the ability to flip if needed.)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
DS vs. Chris Shaners 3A EBO<br/>
<br/>
   Chris is from Phoenix and I dont think Ive ever beating him. (0-4) Its a shame to travel all this way only to face someone from my state. Oh well, EBO is always a good game against my deck, so hopefully Ill pull out a victory. He started Main Power Generators, North Ridge and A new Secret Base. I started Endor Operations and Resistance. (No the only trick is occupying the 3 battlegrounds.)<br/>
<br/>
   I started with a good hand, Mara Jade, Boba Fett in Slave I, a Dreadnaught, Blizzard Scout 1, a couple of Biker Scouts and Trample. But I really wasnt sure what I wanted to do. Maybe it was the butterflies of being at the Regional that made me indecisive for my first game. (Sorry about that Chris.) But I decided to drop Mara Jader with her lightsaber to the 4th Marker and invade Echo Base. He of course is able to pull out sites and Echo Base Operations on the first turn. He deploys, the War Room, Docking Bay, and Med Lab. I was able to set up my Omnious Rumors with BFinSI at Kessel. Mara was draining for 2 at the Main Power generators, but then he deployed Incom Corporation, and an Incom Engineer to the Med Lab. Twas Khaa to the War Room. And an X-wing to the Docking Bay and then EBO was set. Twas Khaa moved over to the Docking Bay to stop my MJ invasion. After that I had to move MJ back to the North Ridge in order to keep my 3 battlegrounds. He was pulling systems and battling me in space. I was never really able to pull my other starships to help Boba Fett in space. I was able to hold my 3 battle grounds, but Obi-Wan beat up on Blizzard Scout 1 and Sgt. Barich to end the game. Full loss by 14.   0(-14)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
LS vs. Ben Cavins Ralltiir Operations<br/>
<br/>
   Ben is from Henderson, NV so I knew nothing of what to expect from him. All I can do is hope its a good game and I can flip his objective with my Elom hit squads. He started with Ralltiir Operations and Bad Feeling Have I. I started with You Can Either Profit By This and Uh Oh!.<br/>
<br/>
   He most have had a great hand, because first turn he deploys Hoth: Ice Plains and Wampa Cave. Admiral Ozzel goes to the Swamp and he drew up his Force. My First Turn I was able to deploy Tessek and Bo Shuda to the Audience Chamber, and deploy Bargaining Table. I had a couple of Eloms in my hand, but couldnt really hit him on Ralltiir because of his reacting AT-STs. I was able to get some aliens to Cloud City sites and start draing him. But Vader w/, 4-LOM w/ and DS-61-2 beat up on 2 Eloms. Mara Jade with her lightsaber beat up on a Devaronian and Elom. I was able to win a few hands of Sabacc, but not at the Casino so I wasnt retrieving any Force with it. I deployed a Bothan Spy and Elom to Hoth, but the drains were too little too late. Full loss by 17.   0 (-31)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
LS vs. Ben Taylors Hunt Down and Destroy the Jedi<br/>
<br/>
   I think Ben was a little more nervous about this game than I was. I think his friends comments about reading my reports (Which I appreciated, by the way.) gave him the impression I was a good player. =) Oh well, Im sorry to have disappointed. He started with HDADTJ and Secret Plans. I started with Profit and Uh Oh! He deployed Mara Jade and Zuckuss to the Audience Chamber via Profit.<br/>
<br/>
   I didnt get nearly as good a hand as I did in my last game. He was able to deploy DV,DLOTS and his Lightsaber to the tusken Canyon first turn. Because I didnt have Tessek, Rennek or any sites I was forced to draw up.  He then moved Vader to the Cantina, MJ to Jabbas Palace to increase his drains. I was able to get my Bargaining Table but he was still draining.  He was loading up people at his Tatooine drain sites. When I finally got Lando w/ and a Devanorian to the Downtown Plaze he deployed U-3PO to stop my drain. I played sabacc twice and lost both times. =( I never found a Tessek, but I freed Han with a lone Elom. I deployed Master Luke to the Cloud City Lower Corridor. And thats when he won. Vader and friends (Grand Moff Tarkin, IG-88 w/, 4-LOM w/, Admiral Motti, and DS-61-2) Elis Helrot over to the Lower Corridor. First Strike, I Have You Know, Dark Jedi Presence, and Force Attack was the last thing Luke saw. I had the Houjix in my hand but made the mistake of not leaving Force in my Force Pile. Full loss by 18.   0(-49)<br/>
<br/>
   Well, this isnt exactly how I wanted to remember my Regional Experience.  As a whole, the AZ group is doing well, but Im bringing up the rear. All I can do is Bear Down (Go Cats!) and hope to pull off an even score.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
DS vs. Eric Myra's Cloud City Mains<br/>
<br/>
   Eric is from Provo, UT and at this point, he's having about as bad a tournament as I am. Well, on the bright side, one of us is going to start moving in the right direction. Fortunately, I prefer to be playing my Dark Side deck in this situation. He started with Mind What You Have Learned and Scrambled Transmission. I started with Endor Operations and Oppressive Enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
   First Turn I was able to search for Ominous Rumors, and deploy a Dreadnaught and DS-61-2 to Kessel. During his first turn, he deployed Yoda to Yoda's Hut and drew up. At that point, I start setting up my space drains with Bossk in Hound's Tooth with Officer Evax at Endor and Sgt. Elsek and Sgt. Irol at the Bunker. Meanwhile, he must be looking for something because he's still drawing up.<br/>
<br/>
   He finally starts putting down Cloud City sites and deploys from characters. Han w/ @ CC: Carbonite Chamber, Luke w/ and a Lift Tube at CC: North Corridor, and Pucumir Thryss @ CC: Upper Plaza Corridor. I deployed DV, DLOTS and MJ with her lightsaber to battle Pucumir. Luke reacts in the Lift Tube. Vader chokes Pucumir and Luke and Mara Jade miss with their lightsaber. My destiny kills Luke, and I was immune to his. So I move Vader over to the North Corridor. Next turn, Chewie w/, Liea w/, an Arcona and Obi-Wan beat up on Mara Jade, then move over to Vader's site. I put down some destinies to track (6,5,6,5), flip my objective, and move Vader to the Carbonite Chamber. Then he deploys Order to Engage, Luke w/ an on of my Endor sites to beat up on a lone AT-ST. Leia moves to Vader, and Luke moves to another AT-ST. So I activate to my destinies in initiate a battle with my AT-ST. Before destinies, I trample Luke to end the first battle. Then I initiate with Vader. He reacts in the Lift Tube again, but I choke Leia and draw the 6 for destiny. Full win by 25.   2 (-24)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
LS vs. Scott Watson's Ralltiir Operations<br/>
<br/>
   I lose to this deck-type earlier today, I hoped no to have the same result for this game. He started with Ralltiir Operations, but no Effect. I started Profit and Uh Oh!, but he didn't deploy any aliens to the Audience Chamber.<br/>
<br/>
   I got a great hand this game, with Tessek, Rennek, Lando and Bargaining Table all at the start. He deployed a site and played Scanning Crew. I hit him with Shocking Information and had no Rebels in my hand.  I deployed Tessek and Rennek to the Audience Chamber with Bo Shuda. We take a couple of turns to set up and draw some cards. He flips his objective, but then converges to one site. I have Chewbacca with 2 Eloms @ CC: Guest Quarters and Lando Calrissian with 2 Eloms @ CC: Casino. I would play Trooper and Cloud City Sabacc, then hit him with a Visored Vision. The Bargaining Table and Goo Ney Tay were beginning to annoy his plans. I finally deploy to Ralltiir and flip back his objective. Full win by 25.   4 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
DS vs. Ben Taylor's Hidden Base<br/>
<br/>
   Well, this is the rematch from my Game 3. I would really like to save this tournament with a win here, and maybe even pull out a respectable differential. He starts Hidden Base and Rebel Fleet. I start Endor Operations and Security Precautions.<br/>
<br/>
   I deploy Ominous Rumors and start to draw up. He deploys a bunch of systems and Koensayr Manufacturing to Ralltiir. I deploy Mara Jade with her lightsaber to the Landing Platform. He deploys a GlinG1 and some y-wings to his Kessel. I deploy Bossk in Hound's Tooth with DS-61-2 at Ralltiir. Next turn he deploys Lando in Falcon. But I play Imperial Barrier to prevent him from fighting or moving. But he makes the mistake of drawing up and not protecting Lando. So next turn I deploy First Strike, Lateral Damage and Boba Fett in Slave I to battle him. He loses 20 Force. At that point I'm clearly in command of this game, but I have a bunch of cards in my hand. I spend a few turns searching for my Reactor Terminal, but by the time I find it, he just draws up. Full win by 14.   6 (+15)<br/>
<br/>
   I was able to finish the day 3-3 with a positive differential. I was happy about that and had a great time. Josh Martin beat Brett Kitani in the final confrontation. (I'll have a Final Confrontation Turn by Turn Report tomorrow!) For the last round I ask everyone to sign a Cloud City banner for me, and I gave it to Josh for winning the tournament. (A neat little addition to 1st Place that Mike Girard and Brian Garrison started in Phoenix.)<br/>
<br/>
   It was great experience and I look forward to doing it again next year. I was really cool to meet all the other 'Net personalities that I've known from the listserv and Decipher Message Boards. (Hi Guys!) Thank you to Chris Hines (Gold 8) and Tim Guzman (Gold 117) for running the tournament and being patient with me when I wanted to get people to sign the poster and getting results for this report. Thank you to Don, Mike, Josh, Brett and Brandon for making the trip to Las Vegas a great one. Thank you to all my opponents for great games and to everyone else there for a great tournament.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
