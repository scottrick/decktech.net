<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Delaware State Championships<br>
4/22/01<br>
Days of Knights<br>
Newark, Delaware<br>
<br>
Director:  Ted Panczyszyn, Rogue 15<br>
<br>
Thanks to some diligent PR by the owner, there are 4 participants ready to play at 12PM today.  Only 4, you may ask? Considering there were none last year, this is a major success for the people of Delaware!!<br>
<br>
Despite these guys’ love of the game, they were not up on some of the major rulings and gameplay that has evolved over the last 2 years.  In fact, one player just learned how to play earlier this week!!  Although they didn’t read the cards and a few actions were missed  here and there, there was great sportsmanship and humor throughout the day.  If anyone decides to "take charge" in Delaware they will have a good base to work with.<br>
<br>
With only 4 players, I elected to modify the tournament to 4 games plus the final duel.  This worked out well time-wise since the store closed at 5PM.  We started at 12:15 and the last force was lost at about 4:30, including the final duel.  The decks were not very complex, and none of the participants used objectives with the exception of the<br>
EBO/Operational As Planned themes.<br>
<br>
Final Standings (after 4 games)<br>
<br>
1.  Travis Hunter 8(+82)   EBO/Operational as Planned<br>
2.  John LaRosche 4((+26)  Tattooine Mains &amp; Toys/Old JP <br>
3.  Kevin Cook    4(-18)   Cloud City EPP/Endor Ground Pound<br>
4.  Conrad Warren 0(-90)   Tattooine Mains &amp; Monks/ISD Tractor Beams<br>
<br>
Travis Elected to play LS first in the duel. Early in the game, John left one of the unique Tusken Raiders at the Palace entrance. Along comes Master Luke and Biggs for a beatdown.  Later, John left Salacious Crumb and Ree-Yees at the Shield Generator and Obi and crew "moved along" Salacious and beat up Ree-Yees but good.  Drain out win by 20 for Travis.<br>
<br>
The second game set up much better for John until he left EPP Han alone.  Along comes Admiral Piett, Fel, Phennir, and DS 161-3 to beat him down.  Despite a Solo Han, John gets a good creaming and it is hard for him to recover despite Obi and LS prof. chasing these renegade pilots all over Tattooine.   In both of their games with these allegiances, John Demoted Moff Jerjerrod, thus negating his<br>
ability to get out DS2 sectors.  John is able to hold down his Tattooine sites and the game ends in a drain race with Travis winning by 1.  <br>
<br>
Travis Hunter is the Delaware State Champion for 2001 and John La Rosche is the runner-up.  Nice job, Guys!!<br>
