<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It*s 3 A.M. here and I*m bored, so I think I*ll write a TR of this thing we did.  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
Well it starts off the Wednesday before when I ask Mike Merletto why the upcoming tourney isn*t on Decipher.  He says he doesn*t know, so I*m not sure there even is one.  He assures me there is one; he heard Don (a local TD) say it at Games Galore (a local store) last week.  So I say OK.  We have plans for me to go over to his house midday Friday, test like hell Friday cuz I*m such a scrub.  I decide we should at least call up Don and make sure there*s actually a tourney there.  Mike gets Adam (Don*s son and NC State Champ) and finds out the tourney is JK.  Nice job Mike.  So we talk to Rob (who thinks there*s still a tourney tomorrow), who makes plans w/ his neighbor Kimo to get to the tourney.  We *forget* to tell Rob there isn*t actually a tourney there.  Haha.  We end up playing like 4 games, but getting cards for two decks (I didn*t bring commons with me)and he*s so damn anal about organization that every card he owns is in ABC order.  Blah.<br/>
<br/>
I put together Lingrell*s RST and ressurect my Rallops.  Good ol* Rallops.  Too bad I only play one game with it (took us an hour to get the cards for it) and it gets beaten on by Mike*s HB Flip.  Rallops is dead.<br/>
<br/>
I go to sleep.  Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Wake up, head off to tourney.  We arrive to see Rob and Kimo talking to Pat.  So they know there*s no tourney, and drove 45 minutes out here and are stuck here till 6 PM.  Sucks for them.  We tell Pat we all heard Don say there was SW today (I thought I did, but I wasn*t sure, so I told him I was sure because it presented a stronger arguement, always a good way to keep yourself from looking like a dumb@$$).  So he tells us about some tourney he went to (I wasn*t paying attention at the beginning, so I don*t know where it was.  Some Open somewhere.  It*s pretty funny.  He tells us about Chase The Squirrel tourneys, where you open some packs and make 40 card decks with both sides.  We (Me, Mike, Rob, Kimo, and Edwin (NOT a member of Team C0ckbomb&amp;#8482;, but cool))buy the packs(2x R2, 2x BB Hoth, 1 Dagobah) and scatter to open them and put decks together.  I got some pretty good stuff, a ton of ability, 1 each of It Can Wait and Wookiee Kiss (huge card in Sealed), Mercenary Armor (again, huge)Captain Pallaeon(hey, 3/3, can*t go wrong there)and two twixes.  Nothing huge like everyone else(Kimo pulled a foil Jedi Luke, Mike got a Scout Luke, and Edwin got Commander).  Since we have an odd number of players, and Pat is playing JK with the only JK player to show up, Pat offers us to play 3-way SW.  Looking back on this, it is strongly not recommended that you try this.  I get the bye, so I have to play the screwed-up part of the 3-way game.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1: My Jank vs Edwin vs Kimo<br/>
<br/>
I start Ice Plains, Edwin starts I think North Ridge, Kimo starts AC.  None of us understood the rules for 3P, and I didn*t know I couldn*t activate off of their icons.  So I get beasty amounts of force (10 second turn) and lay a huge beat on that cracker Nemet alone at the AC.  Kimo loses him and like 15 force, but Old Bens him back there.  Um, OK.  I proceed to stack another guy there and beat.  Included in this beatdown is Pallaeon and some Hoth dude w/ Mercenary Armor.  In case you didn*t know, anyone in Sealed deck w/ Mercenary Armor is a tank.  So I beat on Nemet for a ton, Kimo is almost dead, so I proceed to drain Kimo for two there and Edwins huge drains of like 6.  Kimo drops, so I move over, but I*m running low on force and Edwin is draining for 8 because he is putting lone guys at sites because my crew is stuck on Tat.  Edwin wins.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(?)<br/>
2(?)<br/>
<br/>
In 3P SW, you get 1 point for 3rd, 2 for 2nd, and 1 for 1st.  So now you know why I got 2 victory points for losing.<br/>
<br/>
Next game I get matched against Mike.<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2: My Jank vs Mike Merletto*s Throne Room Start<br/>
<br/>
He starts Throne Room, but out of instinct I go first and he never notices.  Haha.  Or maybe he did go first, and I*m just misremembering.  Either way.  He puts out Cantina with Rebel Scout Luke there and some scrub to soak attrition.  Again, with the beasty number of characters in my deck, I have a huge beats crew in my hand, which I then proceed to deploy to the Cantina.  I drew high enough to make Luke go lost.  Mike realizes that he should have put out the Cantina the other way (you can choose which side of a location you want), so that way his scrub guy was forfeit +1, and Luke would have stayed.  So my guys occupy the Cantina steadily eating away at Mike*s Reserve Deck.  He puts out Ord Mantell with a lone Medium Transport there for an uncontested drain of 1.  We fight over the Cantina the whole game, but Tank Pallaeon + Tank Rebel guy w/ Armor are too much for Mike*s sorry @$$.  I win.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(?)<br/>
4(?)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: My Jank vs Rob*s Jank<br/>
<br/>
He keeps talking about how jank his deck is.  Yeah.  I get Pallaeon and the Armor in my opening hand again(he*s my @#$% already).  I stack at whatever his starting location was, hitting him for two while he activates 2 a turn.  So I*m good for a couple turns while he saves force to drop a c0ckbomb.  Ah yes, now I remember, he started Jabba*s Palace LS.  Anyway, he drops some durshkins (props to Rob on that one, funny @#$% word man) there but I kick their sorry @$$es with my Tanks.  I spread to his sites and some more stuff happens.  Nothing significant I don*t think.  I win.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(?)<br/>
6(?)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: My Jank vs Edwin*s Defensive Perimeter start.<br/>
<br/>
I again get a huge beats crew (I love this deck now)and occupy his site for a drain of 2.  He*s only activating 2 a turn, so plenty of time to get a Force advantage before the fun begins.  Too bad it wasn*t fun for me :(.  After saving force, he puts down som guys + EJP Bossk.  D*oh.  But it turns out he was just running away to my twix of Ice Plains.  I started it because I saw the -1 of the LS part, put didn*t bother to read the rest of it which said "if MPGs on table", which they weren*t.  I*m such a scrub.  So we traded drains of 2 for a while until evidently got some more characters, which he deployed to 3rd marker and moved the Ice Plains stuff over.  I think I deployed one character and battled.  I had characters of destiny 1, 2, and 3, so it was likely that he was going to take one of my guys.  He shot, but drew a 4.  Sweet.  We both lost some to attrition, but after a few battles my crew was wearing thin to Bossk*s beasty power of 4.  So I pussied away to the Ice Plains and drew for a location to drain at.  Got the Echo Med Lab, cool.  He had now spread his crew to both of the drain two sites, so I knew is was over then.  I dropped the site and moved my two characters left in for a two drain, but it was too late.  In the last turn I made a last-ditch effort to slow his drains by moving the the Ice Plains, but he battled and I had to forfeit the dude to attrition.  He drained me out next turn.<br/>
<br/>
FL 0(?)<br/>
6(?)<br/>
<br/>
I just remembered that the scoring for this was 3 points for a win, but I don*t feel like going back and changing those numbers.  They*re close enough.<br/>
<br/>
Rob wanted to go another round, but we voted against his sorry @$$ and he lost.  So Edwin won the tourney, so Pat bought a pack of R2 for the winner.  That was cool.<br/>
<br/>
After I played Rob w/ the RST, some stuff happened, I don*t remember, Rob was playing the crazy-@$$ BHBM 7s, so that sucked.  I don*t remember who won.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
So I went to watch Mike*s game against Pat, who was using Henry Jicha*s BHBM Beats.  Me and Edwin started to play, but I was tired, so I was messing around with my HD, so he decided to take his Qui-Gon and stuff to beat on my Vader and dude.  He clashed Vader and beat on the guy for like 20 force.  Yeah this is fun alright.  I drew up so I could watch the end of Pat*s game, but then my Mom got there.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
-Mad props to Pat for his willingness to help us out for kiling time the whole day, and taking time out of his JK Games to "TD" for us.  Thanks man.<br/>
-Mike, for letting me borrow cards for the decks, and for turning the Cantina the wrong way so you lost.  Scrub :D.<br/>
-Rob, for thinking up *durshkins* and thinking up BHBM 7s.<br/>
-Kimo, for putting Nemet alone at a site so I could beat on him for 30 force.<br/>
-Edwin, for showing up even though he knew there wasn*t a tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
-Ummm... me I guess, for not checking with Don before going to Mike*s to make sure there was a SW tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about it, only slopping myself in the Slops section really sucks, so I*ll slop everyone mentioned in this TR (except Pat) for no particular reason.  Haha!<br/>
