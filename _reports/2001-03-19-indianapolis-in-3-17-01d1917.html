<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I just had to write a report for this tourney, it was just so fun. Directed by Alex Hinkley at In Your Face Comix. 10 people showed up, not really any newbies, but there were a couple people I hadn’t seen before. My DS I’m playing My Kind Of Machine 4.0 with an adjustment or 2, for LS I’m playing a speeder/numbers deck that I had barely gotten to playtest. So I’m kind of doubtful of my LS, but whatever, I’ll still have fun. I arrived early, borrowed some cards from Rich Dailey, played around a little, then it starts. It was 50 degrees out, I’m just wearing a t-shirt, so I’m shivering throughout the whole thing, I’m just cold, but everyone thinks I’m shivering because I’m hyper. I’m as ready as I’ll get.<br/>
<br/>
1st game: My LS Speeder/Numbers vs. Craig Spaid’s DS TIEs<br/>
<br/>
     First game and I have to play Mr. Spaid with my stupid LS deck. Fine. I start Endor, Rebel Landing Site (2 icons for me, 1 for opponent, my droids deploy -1 here), Insurrection, and Staging Areas. Yes, only 2 Effects. He starts Kashyyyk, Mobilization Points, There Is No Try &amp; Oppressive Enforcement and Crush The Rebellion. My starting hand has no Odds or How Did We Get Into This Mess?s. That’s bad. Really bad. First turn he deploys a couple systems, my turn I deploy Hoth: Echo Docking Bay, deploy 2 droids to Rebel Landing Site. He starts to realize I’m plating numbers... so he activates 3, Twi’leks, gets Resistance. Crap. He deploys a couple TIEs to Kashyyk. My turn I just deploy Endor: Docking Bay, another droid, insert odds. Here’s where a problem is noticed. My sleeves are a bit longer than his, so he insists I change the sleeve to one of his. Fine. We do that, he sticks the insert somewhere in the bottom ("only fair" he says) we go on. It goes downhill from there... from each of my inserts he only loses 2, he controls 3 different systems, I have no space in this deck, I control 3 sites but Arica’s at one of them, he’s retrieving like mad. I have no chance whatsoever. Loss by 23.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-23)<br/>
<br/>
Good: I get to win my next game.<br/>
Bad: My LS sucks.<br/>
Ugly: Just my luck I have to play a space deck, Mr. Spaid’s nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
     I know my LS sucks now, but it’s too late.<br/>
<br/>
2nd game: My DS My Kind Of Machine 4.0 vs. Daniel Davis’ LS EBO<br/>
<br/>
     He starts Signal, A New Secret Base, no surprise. I start Power Of The Hutt, Secret Plans, and Resistance. My turn I quickly deploy Audience Chamber, Sail Barge, and the Barge site from reserve. His turn he puts out some sites. My turn I deploy Chall Bekan, Lower Passages, Mercenary Pilot, and Abyssin, all from Reserve except the Merc Pilot. His turn he deploys a few more sites. He has 5 sites out... including the Med Lab. Weird. He deploys some scrubs, EBO is out now. My turn I deploy Scum And Villainy, Search And Destroy, and control the Chamber. Cool. He hates S&amp;D... his turn he deploys Hobbie and Toryn Farr to the North Ridge, and 2 X-Wings to Kiffex. My turn I drain, then deploy First Strike. Deploy ZiMH (with ECC 4-LOM aboard) and DiP1 to Kiffex, deploy Mighty Jabba and Bib to Lower Passages, Objective flips. I battle at Kiffex, he gets no destiny, I get 2, they’re each +2, then add 2 because of Dengar. He loses the X-Wings and plenty more. His turn he deploys a couple more X-Wings to Hoth. My turn I deploy Jodo Kast and IG-88 w/Gun to North Ridge, battle. I capture Hobbie, he loses Farr and some. He quits...? I win by 24.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+1)<br/>
<br/>
Good: I won, I guess.<br/>
Bad: He quit. That’s no fun.<br/>
Ugly: The Echo Med Lab?<br/>
<br/>
     We got done quick, so I just watched some other games. Saw some TIGIH, RallOps, WYS, couple TIE decks, couple EBO decks, D*II, CCT, AITC, a few MKOSs, decent variety. Pairings announced, I’m up against someone I’ve never heard of.<br/>
<br/>
3rd game: My DS MKOs vs. Shannon Huecker’s (s? Pronounced "Hecker) RTP<br/>
<br/>
     The name is Shannon, but he’s a guy. Okay... he says it’s Irish. Whatever. He starts Insurrection, Staging Areas, SAC killer, I start Secret Plans, Power Of The Hutt, and First Strike. He brings out Mr. Peanut. It’s a foot and a half tall statue of the Planter’s peanut guy, you know, the one with the hat and cane. He starts kissing it and using the word "love" way too much ("c’mon Mr. Peanut, feel the love!" *smooches Mr. Peanut*). He freaks out at my MKOS Abyssin start, he just played the same deck and lost ("it’s okay Mr. Peanut, don’t be scared, you just weren’t feelin’ enough love last game!" *smooch*). Before we draw our starting hands, I remember something! My secret weapon! I pull it out of my pocket... it’s a miniature rubber ducky that squeaks when you squeeze it named Mr. Ducky. Everyone watching busts a gut laughing at the site of Mr. Peanut staring down Mr. Ducky. ("Haha! Don’t you just feel the love in here, Mr. Peanut?" *smooch*) I ask Mr. Ducky how many 8D8s he has in his deck (did I mention that Mr. Ducky is psychic?). Mr. Ducky says 2. Mr. Ducky’s right, of course. No big feat, though... a lot of RTP decks have 2 8D8s. My opponent isn’t impressed yet. I then ask Mr. Ducky if I’m gonna win. Mr. Ducky says yes. We’ll see. We draw starting hands. I get Look Sir, Droids. Yes! I do my usual starting turn stuff. His turn he deploy Home 1:DB, Signals for Echo Base Garrison, gets 8D8, deploys 8D8 to the Y4:DB, moves him to the D*:DB ("8D8’s feelin’ the love now!" *smooch*) My turn I kill 8D8. ("ow! 8D8 sure wasn’t feelin’ the love there!" *smooch*). Then activate, do my second turn junk, draw up, get 3 ships, his turn. He gets and deploys his second 8D8 ("now he can feel the love again!" *smooch*) and gets him to the prison with a Lift Tube. My turn I wish I had a Twi’lek so I could get No Escape so I could get Look Sir, Droids so I could kill 8D8. But no luck. I drain, deploy Gailid and a backup guy to Chamber, flip my Objective. Looking good. (look, Mr. Peanut! He’s feelin’ the love! *smooch*) Draw up, no No Escape or Twi’lek. Dang. His turn he releases Prisoner 2187, deploys some guys to the docking bays, gets Leia to the Y4:DB ("Can’t you just feel the love at the docking bays? *smooch*). My turn I get out S&amp;V, draw U-3PO, a plan starts to form. I ask Mr. Ducky if he uses Death Star Plans. Mr. Ducky says yes. But I say that Mr. Ducky said no. His turn he drains for 4... not sure what to lose, I ask Mr. Ducky if he has any ships or systems in his deck. Mr. Ducky says no. So I lose 3 ships and a Twi’lek. My opponent is stunned, ’cuz Mr. Ducky’s right, of course. He gets D* Plans out (Mr. Ducky was right!) He moves Leia to the War Room, flips his Objective, starts D* Plans stuff. My turn I drain for 6 ("hey! Where’s the love?" *smooch*), deploy U-3PO to the War Room. I deploy an Abyssin to his D*:DB, battle, retrieve 3, he loses 1, Projective Telepathy cancels the battle, I move him to the prison. His turn he drains for only 2. Deloys Jedi Luke to smack the Abyssin, I just Ghhhk ("no love loss there!" *smooch*). Moves Leia to the Y4:DB (I can’t move U-3PO over ’cuz I forgot to save any Force ’cuz I’m an idiot) and completes D* Plans. He thinks he’s so cool, ’cuz he thinks Mr. Ducky was wrong. So he draws his destinies, starts to retrieve, I say nope. I point at Secret Plans and explain that Mr. Ducky actually said yes, but I said no, to lure him into a trap. D* Plans is canceled. ("hey! What happened to the love?" *smooch*) The next few turns we’re smacking eachother back and forth, I get to play Projective Telepathy 4 times this game, but he places 5 characters out of play. ("tough love!" *smooch*) Another interesting thing is that he had Goo Nee Tay out. Since I had stuff like the Barge, Chall, and S&amp;V out, calculating my aliens deploy costs was fun. I’d be like "well it’s 5 -1 + 2 -1 = 5". He’s like "what?" I’m like geez, it’s basic math. He says he hates math, and insists I do it slower. Whatever. Even without the battles, my drains are bigger than his, so I eventually win by 7. Mr. Ducky was right again.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+8)<br/>
<br/>
Good: That was definitely the most fun, hilarious, and silly game I’ve ever played.<br/>
Bad: Not much, actually. Using Force to drain did get annoying though...<br/>
Ugly: He likes to kiss "Mr. Peanut", his name is Shannon, and he likes to "feel the love"... hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
     After the game he was consoling Mr. Peanut... "it’s okay *smooch* we’ll do better next time! Don’t worry! *smooch* I’ll always love you!" I shake off all the bad vibes, and groan when the next pairings are announced.<br/>
<br/>
4th game: My LS vs. Valerie Bailey’s DS Carbon Chamber Testing<br/>
<br/>
     I have to play my sister. I know I’m going to win, I know I’m going to win by a lot, but I feel bad beating my sister like that. I get a quick start, she doesn’t, Odds keeps popping for major damage, especially considering she has 2 destiny 0 characters out. I’m draining for a lot, even more with T-47 Battle Formation. She didn’t have a chance. Win by 32.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning... sort of...<br/>
Bad: Having to play my sister.<br/>
Ugly: Destiny 0 characters against a Numbers deck is just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
     I beat her so quick (about 5 minutes) we need to find something to do. She gets out her rares, fixed, and premium cards, and start dealing them out. Looks like we’ll be playing a game, Secret Squirrel style.<br/>
<br/>
Fun game that doesn’t count but was fun: My "DS" vs. her "LS"<br/>
<br/>
     I start D*: Docking Control Room, she starts some fixed Tatooine site. I managed to "pull" J’Quille in the "draft" and get him in my starting hand. Cool. First turn I deploy Ten Numb to the DCR, deploy a Spaceport: DB. Next turn I get out Location, Location, Location. Here’s where it gets fun. She deploys Corulag, and we each have like 12 fixed sites in our decks. So we’d deploy one every turn to Corulag to prevent LLL damage. The Forest got converted 3 times. We had one space battle, it consisted of my Motti piloting a Corellian Corvette with a Sentinel-Class Landing Craft battling a TIE Defender and another Landing Craft. I gained control of the system for remainder of game. I won the ground battles too, because of Blizzard 2 and J-Quille. Oola was cool too. Another funny thing was her deploying E-3PO, then we realized I already had him on table. Weird stuff. It was a fun game with many laughs, I won by 24, but it doesn’t matter, it was just to pass the time. Back to a real game. I groan again as the pairings are announced.<br/>
<br/>
5th game: My LS vs. Daniel Spaid’s Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
     Ugh. I have to play Craig Spaid’s son, the better of the two. I get off to a quick start, getting Incom Corporation out second turn, Odds inserted 2nd turn with 3 droids out. Luckily he doesn’t play any numbers defense whatsoever, so he’s losing chunks to that. But Mara cancels my Incom Corp, so he’s battling the speeders on my planet, choking my droids with DVDLOTs. I can’t really do anything... I would’ve done a lot better, but I made a huge late game mistake. At the beginning of my turn I had 6 speeders at a site, he just had DVDLOTs there. I only activated 1, because for some reason I thought I had Battle Plan out so I could battle for free. The one Force was for Maneuvering Flaps, and I had Attack Pattern Delta in hand. Even though I only activated one, I used it for Flaps, but I could’ve battled with it. When I tried to battle for free, he pointed out that Battle Plan wasn’t out. So I was screwed. If I would’ve activated 2 Force, used Flaps, battled, used APD, it would’ve been my power of like 35 + destiny to his lone Vader. But instead I lost by 13.<br/>
<br/>
Good: I lost to him by less than anyone else that day.<br/>
Bad: I had absolutely no reason to only activate one Force, I had plenty of Life Force, it’s not like I was low. I just thought Battle Plan was out. But I still should’ve activated more. But I’m an idiot.<br/>
Ugly: After this game I realized I forgot to use Mr. Ducky. Dang.<br/>
<br/>
     I feel really bad... then I groan yet again as the pairings are announced.<br/>
<br/>
6th game (final): My DS vs. Rich Dailey’s LS EBO<br/>
<br/>
     It’s a rule that at every single tournament I have to play Rich’s EBO. It’s also a rule that I always lose, he knows my deck card by card, I know his deck pretty well but it doesn’t matter. I don’t bother to bring out Mr. Ducky, I already know I’m gonna lose. We both set up ultra-fast, but on his first drain I lose Gailid off the top. I now have no chance whatsoever of winning. Resistance is helping a lot, but Search And Destroy is satisfied by Leia at the North Ridge, which I kept forgetting. I battled him as much as I could, but it didn’t matter. Without Gailid his drains were overwhelming mine. I lose by 13.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+14)<br/>
<br/>
Good: I only lost by 13, normally it’s twenty-something.<br/>
Bad: Having to do this every tourney.<br/>
Ugly: After the game he pointed out every single little mistake I made. It’s cool that he does that, it just makes me feel really stupid.<br/>
<br/>
     I get 5th out of 10, going 3-3. Could’ve done better if I would’ve played smart. For prize support I get a Dagobah pack, got Failure At The Cave inside, nothing else really. Rich won. I bought a couple Reflections II packs, got crap inside, just some stuff my friends would want. I do a big trade with Frank Quillen, he gave me a bunch of Jap cards, Aim High, Jap foil Rebel Snowspeeder, and a bunch of other stuff, so that was cool. Except that I saw some cardboard card-looking-thing in a clear case... I flip it over... it’s a picture of his girlfriend. My eyes start to sting, and the hand that touched it starts convulsing like crazy. I scream and run to the bathroom, wash my eyes out, wash my hand off. I recovered momentarily. A good time was had by all, great tournament.<br/>
