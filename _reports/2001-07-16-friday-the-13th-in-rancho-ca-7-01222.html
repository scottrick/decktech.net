<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Uh-oh, its Friday the 13th and I need to make decks and try and finally win a tourney.  So I make a Profit deck (in addition to my RST already made) and then get lazy and forget the dark side.  I plan a nice 3 tournament weekend with John Patchell (fri, sat &amp; sun).  So I get to M&amp;W Cards in Rancho Cucamonga and decide to play RST and SYCFA.  A good 20 people showed up, but not many of the people I know show up, so I’m not sure what to expect (except from the 5-6 people I know there).<br>
<br>
My RST starts Strike Plan, Shield is Down, &amp; usually Squassin.  Its 8-0 in tourney play, and 10-2 in fun games.  My SYCFA starts Million Voices, Secret Plans, and usually Oppressive Enforcement (or IAO).  Its 5-3 in tourney play, and is 0-3 in fun games (keeping in mind all my fun games are against 1900+ rated players).  So I pay my $5 and we start the 1st of 4 games.<br>
<br>
Game 1: DS v John ?’s space deck<br>
<br>
His last name was a long one, and I don’t remember it.  He starts Mon Calamari and no starting interrupt.  I setup the DS w/sites &amp; gunners, and blow away Alderaan while he deploys Yavin, Sullust, Aquaris and the Yavin DB.  He’s playing just straight-up ships and some characters, no effects or interrupts (or none that I saw anyway).  So he’s draining me, but I’m not worried since I don’t anticipate Aim High coming out so I can retrieve all day.  Plus his drains are only 1 each.  Once I flip, I drop SSPFT and build up at 1 system (retrieving practically my whole lost pile) and proceed to clear each system off.  He’s got to pay more than he has to move his ships away, so I’m slowly clearing space.  Imperial Command and Zuckuss really hurt him since I get 2 destiny and he gets none (all his ships only had permanent pilots like awings, xwings, and nebulon frigates).<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, he’s draining on Yavin DB with Gen Solo, EPP Leia, Orrimaarko, and EPP Obi, while I’ve got a squad of Maul, Xizor, and Jabba at the DS DB.  I blow away Yavin (he didn’t see it coming when I moved the DS to yavin) and he loses 9 force.  He keeps a space presence though by running away so I just drain him out.  Win by 39.  2 (+39).<br>
<br>
Best: Using that part on my objective that says opponent loses 3 force for each yavin site blown away.<br>
Worst: Not remembering his last name, sorry.<br>
<br>
Game 2: LS v Stanley ?’s podracing CCT deck (Power of Hutt)<br>
<br>
Stanley had won his last game by 42!  I don’t know Stanley, and I’m sorry I forgot his last name, but something told me to count his deck, and it had 62 cards in it.  So I pick 2 at random to take out (neither of us looking at them).  He started Jabba’s Prize, then drops Guri and picks Han up, but when he looks for the CC DB, its not there, and neither is the Tat DB.  Next turn, neither of them are there, &amp; it turns out I picked BOTH his DBays as the 2 cards removed from his deck.  So he only has the Aud Chamber and Cantina to work with now (plus his starting locations).  Of course, he can’t flip now.  I flip RST 3rd turn (I drew almost all characters) with Dense Forset, Back Door, &amp; Landing Site.  He fortfies the Chamber with Scum and spreads to drain at the Cantina.  My drains (Midge is out) are hurting him, but he only deploys on Tat (not even on CC, except Guri).<br>
<br>
So I get the Bunker out, and he finally starts the podrace (I dunno why he waited so long, maybe he wanted to get Watto’s Box out, but I certainly wasn’t gonna start the race when I had no racer).  After draining in the bunker for a while, I blow the bunker and that takes him to 5 force.  He can’t retrieve now (Aim High out), and Scum has been doing nothing for him since he hasn’t battled me.  So next turn, before the race finishes (his race total was 22) I drain him out and win by 31.  4 (+70).<br>
<br>
Best: Not losing the podrace.<br>
Worst: Removing his 2 DBs from the game.  I felt bad, but it was his fault, not mine.<br>
<br>
Game 3: LS v John Patchell’s mains &amp; toys<br>
<br>
Its a given that we always play at tournies, and usually we play twice.  He starts Maul’s site and Jabba’s Palace, so i know we’ll both be having tons of force.  Now I’m glad I didn’t play Profit (how bad would it be only activating 3 force?).  He pulls Dungeon, Lower Passages, and Rancor pit.  He draws, while saving a lot of force each turn, so I don’t deploy ANYTHING.  I’m looking for a barrier like mad, but not getting it.  I deploy Chirpa’s Hut and Back Door, then Liberty and Ackbar to Endor.  He kills Ackbar with Executor, Mara, and Bossk in ship (he drew low though), losing Mara.  THAT’S why I didn’t deploy anything on the ground, I would’ve been beat even worse.  So I drop Gen Lando in Gold Squad 1 and Cracken in Tala 1, battle, and kill Bossk, losing Liberty.  Luckily, he’s got no Maul yet (its like the 5-6th turn), but on the next turn Maul goes to his site to drain me for 2.  So I drop Honor to keep it at a drain of 1 (he had a saber).<br>
<br>
Then I drop a squad of scouts all over Endor to flip (neither of us wanted to deploy for fear of getting smacked), then move them to the Dense Forest (which was between the Back Door and Landing Site).  Well, DLOTS w/saber, Dr.E/Ponda, Tarkin, and Snoova w/Ax all came to the Forest to play and he sensed all my interrupts (like barrier and Insertion) and I lost 4 scrub scouts and Luke was captured by Snoova.  Only Lt Page and Orrimaarko lived (no damage though).  Luckily i had Insurrection out or he would have Elised Maul into the battle.  Meanwhile, in space he’s deployed Xizor in ship and Guri in ship while i deployed Nien Numb and Tycho with Wedge in ships.  Sadly, i lost Ackbar long ago and had 2 Rebel Leaderships in hand which would’ve let me keep him at 1 destiny instead of 4 (Fett &amp; IG88 on executor).<br>
<br>
Luckily he’s drawing low so I’m still holding Endor (getting to retrieve a forfeit 6 scout is HUGE), but I can’t break his immunity and when i do he loses a pilot and deploys another AND he’s draining on the ground.  He’s got 21 left (and a good-sized hand), I’ve got a small hand and 15 left, when time is called.  Timed loss by 21.  4 (+49).<br>
<br>
Best: None.<br>
Worst: Deploying Liberty and Ackbar too early.  Losing Ackbar was a bad thing, especially if i had known I would need the Rebel Leaderships in space.  Too bad Lando couldn’t use them.<br/>
<br/>
So Patchell and John Moore are undefeated but played the same side, so I get to play Moore who has more victory pts.  Patchell wants me to win so he has a shot at 1st.  If Moore wins, Moore gets 1st guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v John Moore’s TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
OMG!  I’ve never played TIGIH with this deck before.  Plus Moore is a good player and I can tell from his setup he wants to drain and blow the bunker.  He starts Shield is Down, Strike Plan, and another effect.  So while I’m setting up the DS sites &amp; gunners, he’s draining, gets Crix, Beezer, Obi’s Journal on Luke, Back Door, then Midge.  He moves Luke to the Back Door to drain for 4.  I have no characters!  Then Gen Solo and COK go to the endor DB and I draw and get Xizor, Jabba, and Dengar w/gun.  Excellent!  But he backs Luke up with Corran and a Dresselian Commando.  I deploy my squad and battle Luke anyway (no Fallen Portal, thankfully), hit Corran and draw 2 4’s for destiny, killing Luke while i lose Dengar and Xizor.  Luke would never hit the table again (though he had another in his deck).<br/>
<br/>
So now things are better, but Jabba gets beatdown by Orrimaarko and i stack a card.  He also grabs Wuta, pulls the bunker, and deploys Blount, JarJar, and Kensaric in there with 2 charges and the epic event.  I blow away Alderaan, then deploy Yavin and Hoth and setup drains at those 2 systems (retrieving all the while, he had no Aim High).  He blows the bunker, retrieves, I lose 8 and my hand, but i draw more ships and a POTF, so i put that on the DS so i drain for 10 now (3 systems and Vader, Tarkin, &amp; Emp at the DS DB).  He’s draining for 5 at the Door and DB, but I get to retrieve while he has no more retrieval.  Apparently he gave up on space since I saw him lose his ships to drains early in the game.  Win by 21.  6 (+70).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Going 2-0 with dark, normally its 2-0 with light and<br/>
1-1 with dark.  Killing Luke so early was cool too.<br/>
Worst: None, I drew what I needed when I needed it.<br/>
<br/>
Patchell plays against Stanley’s CCT deck (now modified to 60 cards) and wins so he gets 1st while I get 3rd.  My friend Paul tartaglio (also a SM) gets 2nd so that’s cool.  I get 4 packs Tatooine and get Maul, Qui-gon, Million Voices, and Obi-Wan.  I needed those (except a Million Voices, of course).  My friend Andy Chen hates Tatooine (he hasn’t bought any and refuses to) and he pulled crap like Boonta Eve podrace, so he gave them to me.  He uses the good cards from Tatooine only, he says.  That’s all for Friday the 13th, thanks for reading.<br/>
<br/>
Props to:<br/>
Doug for a cool tourney.<br/>
Patchell for the ride and the win.<br/>
Everyone who read this, and liked it.<br/>
Andy for playing, especially since he hates SWCCG now, with podracing (and politics soon to come).  He just likes mains and toys and battling and draining.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to:<br/>
Dan Lujan for not showing up (he LIVES in Rancho).<br/>
Chris Kroutil for being a real punk in one of his games against a newbie.  He was yelling and telling the guy he was stalling and taking back actions.  Of COURSE he is, he’s a newbie, he HAS to think and then take things back when he sees its a dumb move! <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
