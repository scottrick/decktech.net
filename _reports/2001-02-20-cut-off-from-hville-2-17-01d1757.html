<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">not that much to report pre-tourney, just tested a Hidden Mains deck pre-tourney. For some reason I decided to go with --UNTESTED-- Imperial Outpost (forgot a couple things from the version on page) and the tremendous RTP I have been using for a couple of weeks now. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1 DS vs Chris Bentley How Did We Get Into This Mess Twix crazy deck. <br/>
<br/>
ALL he had was twix sites so I just set up my own little thing there on endor and accomplished a quick flip(turn 2). He started the JPOTSD effect to pull droids, then used R2-D2 to draw an extra card every time he used Mess. His sites were all out by the second turn so he was slaughtering me on generation. I was expecting a little beatdown squad at any time so I pulled together my speeders and dropped Chimera with Thrawn to Endor. The flip of Endor Ops saved me several times as he battled my unique scouts and I would lose Elsek while killing off a character or two a turn. Irol and friends did some major damage with High Speed Tactics, where they drew about 3 destinies per battle to one. Eventually he managed to hit most of the scouts and get well ahead in the drain race on the ground while I killed off his space forces with Imperial Command to draw a 3rd destiny in most battles. Eventually I came back with a biker scout squad on the ground(retrieving one a turn is cool) and Emperor Palpatine to back them up. I lost this game beause I was hesitant to move the space forces... I could have moved them three or four turns earlier and drained for more at Sullust(+3 from Effect and Cheraneau) as opposed to +2 at Endor. I was just a little too far behind loss by 4. Great game though, it is good to see the weakness of this deck and how to fix it... too bad I have to use it agian today. <br/>
<br/>
FL 0 (-4) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Returning to Endor and kicking some @#$% after being chased off <br/>
Lows: Being chased off Endor <br/>
<br/>
Why the hell didn&amp;#8217;t I play Hunt Down or The Gods of Death Reborn? <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 RTP vs Mitch SYCFA <br/>
<br/>
This was a murder. I am kinda known around Huntsville for off the wall decks(see HEBO) that do well for some strange reasons. This RTP is pretty striaght forward though. He Drops out a couple systems and draws for the first turns(one of them is Fondor, I am thinking I get to kill Executor this game) I get set up as usual and proceede with rescue as planned. He gets off a couple drains, paying 3 per and I retrieve it all when Leia comes out of the prison... I also use her to drain for 4 since I free her during control phase. She scampers to the war room and I flip and draw for some forefit fodder to board Home One. His next turn he drains, paying 4 per drain and getting rather shaken by the speed of the RTP deck. I drop Death Star Plans to the DBlock Corridor and start the run with 8D8, he says I will never retrieve with it... he proved to be correct as he drew up next turn. Win by 26 <br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+22) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: RTP is a monster <br/>
Lows: I wanted to kill the Executor <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs Clay TIGIH <br/>
<br/>
See Andy&amp;#8217;s report for a better description of Clay&amp;#8217;s deck... all I know is I forgot to add either a grabber or Secret Plans(or both). Not much to say about this one, he basically tracked his Fall o Legend and On the Edged his whole lost pile. I did well fighting him on the ground, but you can&amp;#8217;t win when your oponent doesn&amp;#8217;t lose cards. Sorry for the lack of detail, but there really is not any more to say about this. He converted Vader rather easily at the end of the game. Loss by 34. <br/>
<br/>
FL 2 (-12) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: My scouts with blasters kicked MAJOR @#$% this game, they kept on killing off Clay&amp;#8217;s strike teams and not dying. <br/>
Lows: The little bastards wouldn&amp;#8217;t DIE, they just stayed there losing battles. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Matt CCT Jabba&amp;#8217;s Prize <br/>
<br/>
I have played this matchup before and it is (almost) an auto win. I delayed freeing the princess for a while and concentrated on getting up a strike team. Mara and Snoova came down to escort the prize and quickly got to Tatooine... but that is where my deck is designed to fight best and I am just drawing characters and saving force to set the trap. Mara attempts to drain, but becomes lost in the wilderness, Snoova meets some friends at Tat:JP. On about my 4th turn I drop a strike team (LSJK + Saber, Lando w/Vibro, Comm Wedge Chewbacca, Protector) in front of the forces (Guri, Xizor Jabba the Hutt and I think) I battle, hitting Guri and drawing a 6 for destiny... he drew a 7 but wedge forefits for 8. The same turn I free Leia and march her to the War Room (unfortunate I didn&amp;#8217;t do it a turn sooner, but I really did not have the strike force totaly ready). Anyway...things have taken a turn for the worse for him as he now has no characters on table, and Jabba&amp;#8217;s Prize is repaced by Han w/Heavy.... I move on into the AC and cancel Scum board Leia into Rogue 2 with Zev and head out against the people he deployed to find Mara. I get attacked, Fallen portal a guy away and draw two 5 destinies... 8D8 gets prepped to make a run agian and Matt drew up (I had no cards in lost at the time though). Win by 34. <br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+22) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: RTP is a MONSTER... Jim seemed to like it, he laughed the whole way through the game and a couple times commented "that is mean" when the deck just did it*s job. <br/>
Lows: None really... just wish I had played HDADTJ today. <br/>
<br/>
THIS section was cut out of the first posting...  I have no idea why.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
* RTP speeders version for being dominant yet agian.<br/>
    Everyone seems to be playing on Tatooine with a fair amount of WYS counters, and since Tatooine is the strongest point in my RTP...<br/>
* Andy for winning the tournament<br/>
* Elsek for saving my @ss so many times<br/>
* Endor Ops for having a cool 7 side<br/>
* Clay for beating me with a mass retrieval deck (as Matt put it, giving me a taste of my own medicine)<br/>
* Clay for converting Vader<br/>
* me for apparently being the king of retrieval since that is after all my own medicine<br/>
* Ben for helping me playtest my new hidden mains deck<br/>
* Matt for a smoothly run tourney<br/>
* Jim for the trades<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
* ME for not playtesting Endor Ops beforehand<br/>
* ME for not playing HDADTJ like I had intended to<br/>
* Ben for not staying for the tournament...  I know he had reasons<br/>
* This part of the report, for being cut off the first time<br/>
* The fact that I can’t find tournaments in the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham area more often<br/>
* CCT Jabba’s Prize for being dominated by RTP...  in two games against it I have come out ahead by 70<br/>
<br/>
that is about it...  I hope all of the report posts this time.  <br/>
