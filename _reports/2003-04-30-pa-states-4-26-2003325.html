<blockquote><font class="bfont"> PRE-TOURNEY<br>
<br>
gonna make this real quick, just some highlights:<br>
<br>
friday the 25th i wake up at 4 am, work 5-2, bust out a few minutes early, travel an hour and a half into putzburgh. my transpo is a beat-up 1985 jeep cherokee with extensive body cancer and no exhaust. im just glad it made the trip. meet up with drew ferguson cuz im stayin at his place for the night and we shoot some hoops. start up a game and 3 shots in he trips over my lugz (left my dmn sneakers at home) and f's himself up real bad so we go home. on the way back his car screws up so he cant use it. brian hunter is over, he flew in from colorado, and so is drew's friend gary, and we gotta go get dinner and we cant use drew's car and gary's truck is full of drug paraphernalia or something so we cant use that...guess what we're takin the Heep to dinner. we take hunter to primanti bros which is pure putzburgh eatin but unfortunately drew gives me directions to this trendy suburbian one so really all it is is an applebee's with primanti bros sandwiches. and then hunter gets the dmn pizza so he doesnt even get to try the putzburgh tech primanti bros sandwich. motherfcker. so then we go back to drew's and we're playin some random games and hunter beats on drew with a dark side hoth deck. and im like "yo bri can i look through that?" and hes like "hell no its my secret tech for worlds....just kidding, of course you can look at it" so i rummage through it. then we play some mo' games and 1 am rolls around and i am f'in dragging from being up since 4 so im like "yo im crashin" and brian's like "play some stratego!" but i fall to the floor.<br>
<br>
9 am and i wake on my own, stagger to drew's room to ask for a towel and hes sittin at his computer in tighty-whities....just tell me where the towels are please.....we hit the road in drew's car which oddly enough is running just fine and swing by this dmn mcdonalds where i buy a small coke for $1.06. and i listen to old dirty bustard in the car and scream out the lyrics to brooklyn zoo.<br>
<br>
so here's the morning melodrama: the tourney was being held at pittsburgh comicon, in a meeting room in the radisson hotel adjacent to the monroeville expomart convention center. we are told that to play in the tournament, we must pay a 17 dolla con admission fee IN ADDITION TO the 10 dolla tournament entry fee. just to play in ONE stinkin event. and there's some monkey in a tie watching the door so we cant even sneak in. so brian and i are all like "lets play it somewhere freakin else" im like "drewcon 2003, hold states at his house" hunter's like "how many cons have i been to? ive never seen anything like this" but already by the time we show up 12 guys have paid their 27 dolla to get in the door. wtf. so i take a 20 outta my pocket, lick my hand and rub saliva all over it, reach it down my pants and rub it on my balls, and give it to the monkey in exchange for a cheap-ass paper bracelet that says i am allowed to enter the door. JEEEZ this is a ccg tournament not an elite nightclub you c0cksuckaz.<br>
<br>
so we're in, turnout is 18, which is hmmmm FOUR more than the lotr psq that was going on in the same room. you can conclude whatever you want to conclude from that. i make some last-minute emergency trades and we fill out decklists and i realize afterwards that im allowed to use " " quotation marks for doubles in my list. well F that.<br>
<br>
rating going in: 1978<br>
decks going in:<br>
LS - "BIG CL0CK'S REVENGE" - throne room mains that i posted, view it at http://www.decktech.net/starwarsccg/decks/decks.php?deck=28658<br>
DS - "Kingpin" - MKOS mains deck that beats the snot outta things like the kingpin's club in daredevil - but does have some bad matchups<br>
<br>
ROUND ONE<br>
im hoping for an easy first game matchup. but no. i get paired against "da numba one playa in da world!!" brian hunter<br>
<br>
BIG-CL0CK'S REVENGE vs hunter's....dark side hoth deck?<br>
so i see this deck and i instantly realize that brian hunter is not afraid to lose to ANYone at the tournament except me, or drew. because he had a pretty good idea that i would be playing throne room mains, and he KNEW that drew would also be playing throne room mains. and imperial occupation (v) is supposed to be a bad matchup for throne room mains decks. i also instantly realize that, the night before when i had been half asleep and asked to look through his deck, i had actually seen what he was playing right now (plus or minus a few cards). he starts everything the objective allows him to start, and prepared defenses for iao combo, mob points combo, and something else i dont even remember.<br>
so i go first and pull ddta shield to suspend mob points. then he plays imperial command and i totally forget who he got. then i play were you looking for me? to get nekkid 3po out of my deck. then i pull my grabber and activate. i drew the hoth docking bay and i fully intend on holding it until he deploys his. i also drew my grimtaash so im watching his hand like a hawk. i pull the homo one docking bay and throw 3po down there. im thinkin i also got a twix either opening hand or soon after. so he goes and pulls garrison and the 3rd marker, pulls at-at cannon with his objective, deploys 3rd marker, and draws up to 12. i go and do some setting up, i got jcc/yoda out fairly early this game. he goes and pulls target the main generator, which takes him up to 13 cards. i grimtaash immediately and he does nothing for his turn but draw up his entire force pile basically...which takes him to 16 or 17 in hand. he had not played his grabber yet, but he does so then.<br/>
i go and drop quigon with saber to the third marker where he will sit and drain for probly the next five or six turns. escape pod for the grimtaash again. at this point i look at him and say "i dont know what to do with this grimtaash. i could grim you lost and potentially get like 4 imperial commands. i could wait for next turn when you pull something during control phase and then use it used. or i could wait for you to deploy your virtual molator and use it to cancel that so my goo nee tay keeps working." the obvious choice of course, was to wait and use it used. which is what i did. next turn he went to get the at-at cannon again and i put it back with grimtaash. he grabbed the grimtaash and drew up another huge (and i mean HUGE) hand.<br/>
i go and drain with quigon and threepio some cards and drop another twix or whatever... i get a sense combo in hand and use it on him to further disrupt his plans (i hope)....meantime im setting up a beatdown in hand for when he finally DOES deploy something.<br/>
then one turn he does. he goes searching through his reserve deck (which had 5 cards in it) and i got to verify. two 4s and three 1s. one of the 1s is a ghhhk. then he puts epp vader down to the ice plains (why ill never know) all by himself and draws some more (looking for his cannon i believe). by now his hand is up to probly 20 cards, and between the cards that are on table and the force drains ive been doing, his life force is down to 11 or 12.<br/>
here is where i see an opportunity. he just put vader down at the ice plains. i have qui-gon at the 3rd marker draining away, and a hand STOCKED with beats as ive been 3po'ing incessantly. PLUS i just saw his ghhhk in his deck when i verified. so i look at him and im like "no way youre playin TWO ghhhks?" and he just smiles. so i go and activate a shtload, then deploy corran horn. nothing. obiwan next. nothing. fini up with lando. still nothing. great. stack a 6 on the fish and initiate. swing and hit vader. vader swings and hits lando, brian wants to play sniper/dark strike. i was so pumped on the beatdown i dont remember if he lost one force for it before i sensed it. lando stays and i draw a 1 (switch for 6) and a zero (switch for 1) for battle destiny. vader and 11. BOO YAA... lando dies and so does obi-wan...mebbe i resilienced him, i cant remember. i shuttle corran horn up to the home one which i had at the hoth system.<br/>
unfortunately brian was able to lose all 11 from his hand (except i think he lost from his used pile since he knew the cards there and knew there was nothing important). he goes and recoups on his turn and somewhere in here he gets the free executor at bespin (dont ask me how he got bespin AND the effect together with all the grimtaashing and recoiling and draining and battle damage) and puts ozzel on it. during his turn he also searches for something and i see there's 4 cards in his reserve, 3 worthless ones and one AT-AT CANNON. so i go and drain him again at the 3rd marker and he loses one from hand, and goes to lose one from deck.....i raise my arms in mock triumph as he flips over the at-at cannon.<br/>
HOWEVER i see that he has not yet deployed no escape. and i know it's GOT to be in the deck. so i draw, looking frantically for an ooc/tt to shuffle his lost pile......but to no avail. there's not one there. uh oh.<br/>
this is where brian must have gone into his infamous "must...not....lose...game" mode. cuz before i know it he has deployed no escape and returned the cannon to his hand, deployed it on some walker with igar and veers, and moved to the third marker in front of quigon. i get han chewie and the falcon to the bespin system so i occupy two bgs, on the edge my owen and beru that were sitting at the homo one warroom for 5, then fly the falcon over to join the homo one  (with corran piloting) in hoth space. then i move qui-gon over to the ice plains (i think) so he dont get punked. then brian tracks a 4 and blows up the mpgs, and he's tellin me i gotta lose all this force, and im like uggggh. brian deploys the hoth docking bay and drops a scrub walker there, and a scrub walker to the ice plains, takes garrison into hand from lost, and im like "oh sht" he moves the ex over to hoth space.<br/>
i go and convert the hoth docking bay which had been in my hand ALL GAME, shuttle corran down in front of one walker, bounce o+b lars up from the h1 warroom to the bridge, move qui-gon in front of the walker with veers and igar, and slide the HCF over to bespin (where it would drain for 2 for the rest of the game).<br/>
he goes and doesnt play garrison cuz he only controls the ice plains, but i lose a couple to his direct damage effect (dmn no escape, i even had honor out). he initiates battle against quigon and draws two tracked 4s against my qui-gon. his power a whole bunch to my quigon...it's like quigon and 8...i houjix. and brian's like "houjix?? who the hell plays houjix in a throne room deck??" so the rest of the game consists of me draining him at the bespin system and him draining me at the 3rd marker (and me losing force to the stupid direct damage effect). he has walkers at the hoth docking bay (my version), the 3rd marker, and the ice plains, and the ex at the hoth system staring down the home one (nothing happening there). i have the home one and then the HCF at bespin system. he gets off a garrison, but it's only good for the drain at the 3rd marker because of honor. as you can see this was a long game, and time is called...he gets the last turn but he cant bring me down enough. he ends his turn and ive got 8, he's got 5. TW by 8<br/>
<br/>
highs: guess<br/>
lows: not being able to get the ooc/tt in hand, in fact i had one and i had 3po'ed it earlier. having the ooc/tt at the right time would have given me a full win by like 20.<br/>
<br/>
so im PUMPED...i only have one victory point which gives me an easy second game...<br/>
<br/>
GAME TWO<br/>
Kingpin vs Quinn ?'s light senate/podracing<br/>
yeah i totally took the reactor terminal v out of my shields...heh. so his starting effect is the senate hovercam? im thinkin "the best guy i draw goes straight to the senate." well the best guy i drew was thrawn....hrm. i pull rendili, then lose ychf combo to get sec precs v, then put thrawn down to cancel the hovercam, then pull the audience chamber, then put sec precs v down on jabba's palace, then say "you go." oh and we raced in there too, he never forgot to race, i'll give him that.<br/>
so he goes and blah blah blah does nothing. i pull mara jade and her saber for the audience chamber and put darth maul with stick in the cantina which he had so kindly deployed. he goes and deploys some stupid senators and kills my thrawn, his forfeit covered but i had a ghhhk just in case. plus i wouldnt put it past this guy to be playing a coruscant guard, so i was prepared. next i put down emperor palpatine at the tatooine marketplace which he had also so kindly deployed, im hopin to use that to retrieve some. but he dont like that idea so much and he throws down lando scoundrel and epp leia, he says "shoot emperor" i say "if you hit my emperor i'll rip him up" he misses. he draws some decent destiny but emperor was forfeit 10 (virtual sec precs w00t!) and he covers easily. leia dies and lando sticks around....heh<br/>
i drop dengar w/gun, 4-lom, and crazy fett (boba boo-ie), shoot lando, use claw fish to draw some insane destiny and hit him up for i dont even remember how much. so now ive got control of the marketplace and i WANT to RETRIEVE.<br/>
but he still wont let me. he puts obi-wan down to square off but of course he gets punked. combine all this battle damage with my drains of 2 and 2 at the cantina and audience chamber, and the game is over right quick. he never even finishes the race. FW by 20-some<br/>
<br/>
highs: boba boo-ie<br/>
lows: i never retrieved!!<br/>
<br/>
GAME THREE<br/>
my LS vs Ben ?'s watto<br/>
this guy drove across the state with the eventual 3rd place winner, drew scott.<br/>
anyway the details of this game are rather worthless, im playing throne room with tauntaun bones against watto, so what do you expect? i was lucky enough to get honor opening hand, he was lucky enough to get dre combo opening hand, so he puts down reegesk, watto, and dre at a docking bay and makes me lose 2. then he deploys search and destroy and promptly forgets about it. im like "ok" put worrt down from my shield pile and he eats watto. ive got an ooc in hand so i play it, with a 50-50 chance of essentially ending the game turn two .. but i get prepared defenses.<br/>
he goes and activates six and pays to drain (?) and draws 3.<br/>
i drop power 9 quigon on reegesk's head and he ghhhks. he has a 6 card hand and is activating 6 a turn and worrt is still at the junkyard so he does nothing but draw.<br/>
i drain and drop obi-wan on dr dre and he ghhhks. he plays some more guys but basically i just drain him out. he never plays another watto. the high point of the game was when he was sitting there with one card in hand and im like "free ride combo" just to put the 5 back and he rolls his eyes and shows me tempest scout 6. heh. then i deployed it against his mara jade so i could retrieve one with draw their fire.<br/>
<br/>
highs: free ride!!<br/>
lows: drain for 1, drain for 2, drain for 1....the game took too long.<br/>
<br/>
i still got a pretty low score. drew is undefeated with 3 full wins. brian of course has won his last two.<br/>
<br/>
GAME FOUR<br/>
my mkos vs joe ?'s light side hoth<br/>
hunter was really afraid to play this guy cuz he was using light hoth with nick of time and power harpoon and junk...but whatever. i start by pulling rendili, then losing ychf/mofopoints to get secprecs v. deploy all that jazz and a docking bay from deck and on turn two im activating about 15. mara jade goes to the audience chamber with her saber for a drain of 2. joe does his matching pilot/speeder thing, searches one turn with rieekan and gets a rogue speeder, im like "where you deployin it?" and he's like "im takin it into hand" and im like "dont you know what the down arrow means?"<br/>
so he has to get haven instead and he throws a bunch of ships up there...dash/outrider, gen cal/mini falcon, bleh bleh bleh. i drop thrawn/chimaera and lat damage the outrider, then claw fish for a big draw, and he loses dash and the outrider. i totally blow it and forget that the outrider is forfeit = 0. how many years have i been playing with lateral damage? fockin a. but still he throws down jek porkins in red 6 and battles me next turn and i draw some phatty destiny again and im immune to whatever he draws, i follow up with guri on the chim-chim-aroo and pretty soon gen cal and the falcon go down in flames too. so he's lost space.<br/>
ground is a different story, he's got all the matching pilots zipping around and im losing force to the flipside of his objective. plus he has romas lock navander at the warroom so im holding on to my sense in case he plays t47 battle formation. now that i think of it, isnt that immune to sense? oh well, no matter as i threw dengar and boba boo-ie down in front of luke on rogue 1, initiate, draw 3 phat tracked battle destiny and luke's speeder goes down. im holding a ghhhk in case he retaliates against dengar (who was left behind after i forfeited fett), but that doesnt happen so i drop another fett and march in under the shield...another battle later and ive knocked out wedge and hobbie too. so i drain him out. im trying to be aware of the big tournament picture and i dont want to be in the top two after this game so i draw up a huge hand of worthless cards before the game ends. fw by 7<br/>
<br/>
highs: winning the battle for space<br/>
lows: outrider was forfeit = 0<br/>
<br/>
well my plan didnt work. after 4 games the top standings are:<br/>
drew ferguson 8 (+something)<br/>
reid smith (that's me) 7 (+something)<br/>
brian hunter 6(+XX)<br/>
i dunno who else 6 (+XX)<br/>
<br/>
so im screwed into playing drew. im hoping that ill end up as light side as my unstoppable throne room deck with tauntaun bones would tear through his mkos (worrt eats boelo, worrt eats ephant mon, worrt eats bib, sense your none shall pass, cancel scum and villainy, yadda yadda) but the coin flip falls his way.<br/>
<br/>
GAME FIVE<br/>
my DS vs drew's throne room<br/>
being as how im playing throne room also, i have playtested this match extensively. and it unfortunately is a match the dark side cannot win, unless the light side player makes a serious mistake or two.<br/>
my starting effects in this game are different...i cant start the fish cuz he does, and i dont start ychf/mofopoints because he will suspend it with first-action ddta shield. instead i start no escape and first strike. we start off the game by doing....nothing. he sets up his sites and 3p0, i set up my sites. he revos the blockade fagship bridge and the desert heart so im getting about 10 a turn. i know the minute i draw over 12 ill get grimmed and i dont want that so i stay at 12. meantime im trying to find my sec precs (v) cuz thats about my only hope.<br/>
we finally get to a point where neither one of us wants to be the first to deploy. so we sit in a stalemate for a few minutes. we count our life forces and believe it or not we each have the same amount of cards in life force/hand total. from 10:00 into the game to about 15:00 all we do is sit there saying "go. you go. you go. go." finally he decides hes going to do something. he deploys epp luke, epp quigon, and epp obiwan to the audience chamber. so i deploy the sec precs on tat:jp (canceling the revo he had on desert heart) and put emperor palpatine there (immune to goo nee tay) and epp vader at the lower passages (the order of the sites, my left to right, is desert heart, tat:jp, jp:lp, jp:ac). he drains me at the ac and throws v leia, corran horn, and screaming lando in front of vader, then deploys frozen assets (dammit). so i have to pull my 3rd shield (my first two were coward and battle order, i think) to save vader's ass. i use 2 to YAB lando and he battles anyway, and says "i retrieve one you lose one" because he started dtf and either didnt see or forgot that i started first strike. i didnt volunteer any information just yet (sorry drew =/<br/>
so vader dies and his forfeit covers. i made a bonehead move and swung at corran and hit and killed v leia with bd. what i should have done was nothing - and left his guys there to get beat on next turn. but i didnt. so lando sits there and i drain with palpatine next turn. i think i put a guy in front of lando too so he couldnt drain me. drew put v leia in the bacta tank but i altered it and my alter went to used! OLD SKOOL<br/>
so he goes and drains at the ac and moves luke over to join lando at the lp. i dont remember what happened there but im thinkin we cleared off. then i put darth sidious at the desert heart for another drain/more force gen.<br/>
so he goes and drops v leia and o&amp;b lars at the desert and battles, i know my bd is a 5 so i draw it and v leia stands alone. this is drew's mistake...the one mistake he made that would have let me win the game. i drop a beating on leia, dengar and boba boo-ie, shoot and hit her, and draw a crapload for BD (i was tracking pretty intensely this game, as was he). the battle damage is 16. drew is not playing a houjix. he IS, however, playing an it could be worse. and he DOES, however, have 13 force in his force pile. hmm. so he only loses 3. and i dont have a grabber. and he does have 3p0. hmm.<br/>
the rest of the game consists of him draining me at the audience chamber and him reducing any damage i attempt to do to him with the recurring icbw. somewhere in there i walked one of my guys into an 8-force beatdown which just speeded my demise. once drew figured out that i had started first strike (read: once i initiated a battle and told him), we had quite a contest of 4-force swings. but the throne room deck just has all the tools it needs in this match. and recurring icbw is too dmn good. fl by mid-20s<br/>
<br/>
highs: 16 battle damage, altering the tank<br/>
lows: him not seeing first strike, friggin icbw<br/>
<br/>
so after 5 games the standings are:<br/>
drew ferg 10 (+XX)<br/>
brian hunter 8 (+XX)<br/>
yours truly 7 (+XX)<br/>
bunch of random kids 6 (+XX)<br/>
<br/>
i say + XX for two reasons: 1. i dont remember/have access to the real scores, 2. they're inconsequential anyway: victory points are the only thing that ended up mattering here. drew and brian played opposite sides in game 5, so they are slated to square off in game 6. i KNOW beyond the shadow of a doubt that drew has no chance at beating brian...so after their game they will be the only two players with 10 victory points. so even if i win my last game by 60, i cannot make the final, as i will only have 9 victory points. no one else in the room has a chance of making the final, because no one else has more than 6 victory points after 5 games (how pathetic is that?).<br/>
<br/>
so after 5 games the tournament is already decided - drew will lose to brian in the last game and nothing else will matter. i wrestle with the futility of the situation and decide to do something i had never done before - drop from the tournament. i take drew's keys and go put my stuff in the car and take a walk and look for the hotel bar but it's a real shtty wet bar and i dont feel like paying 10 bucks for a frickin jim beam so i head back to the tourney room where brian is whooping on drew. yawn. so the final standings are:<br/>
<br/>
brian hunter 10 (+100something)<br/>
drew ferg 10 (+2 less than hunter)<br/>
drew scott 8 (yadda yadda)<br/>
two other guys (sorry guys i dont know your names) 8 (+not enough)<br/>
me 7 (+what-the-fkck-ever)<br/>
etc.<br/>
blah<br/>
<br/>
not to take away from drew scott's 3rd place finish, but im pretty sure that had i played my last meaningless game, i would have won (my throne room w/tauntaun boner vs. 1600-rated local's watto? yeah buddy), so i would have had 9 victory points and taken third place. in retrospect, i maybe should have done that, as third place got an epp qui-gon foil and i ended up with an alter foil...but who cares. i dont need the extra 1 ratings point, and i really wasnt in the mood for a worthless game of swccg right then. no regrets. really if i regret anything it's not being able to find the ooc (which i play 3 of) way back in game 1, a full win there could have made a difference...<br/>
<br/>
brian and drew dont want to play a final confrontation, and it's 7 pm and the con is...closing?? what kinda frickin comic convention CLOSES at 7?? so they work out some sort of arrangement and we all head back to ferg manor for pizza and some mo' gaming.<br/>
<br/>
