<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Alright this is a director&amp;#8217;s point of view so there really isn&amp;#8217;t much excitement in in but I did get to play one game which is later on. So any how I am trying to become a<br/>
tournament director and I did hold one tournament but it was unsucsessful:(. So I decide that I am going to hold one two weeks after  I get back from Florida, so  that gives me<br/>
plenty of time to help me and my friends playtest our decks.So through out the two weeks I spend alot of time over at my friends houses testing and eating freezy pops, and testing decks. When we get tired of playing Star Wars we go out side and play baseket ball for rares, Needless to say I won some crap but at least I didn&amp;#8217;t lose a DVDLOTS Tim:). Also during those two weeks I played around 40 games and out of all that card flopping I did I only lost two, yes that&amp;#8217;s right TWO games. I also have been learning to play Mordhiem over the past two weeks down at Mythica where the tournament is going to be held. <br/>
	So it&amp;#8217;s two days before the tournament and all of the sudden a bunch of people decide to cancel on me but hey I still should have enough to sanction it with me playing in<br/>
it so it&amp;#8217;s all good.<br/>
	So it&amp;#8217;s the day of the tournament, my friend, also named Jake comes to pick me up at 12:00pm, my brother is going to come down later because he was busy trying to firgure what my mom thought she saw swimming around in the laundry basin, What ever it was it made her come up stairs screaming.(hehe) Any way I get in the car. Jake is also giving two of our other friends a ride, they of course are, Forrest Lacey and Time Gilbert. So we arrive at around 12:20pm at Mythica and wait for the players to start flowing in. Kyle and James are already there(this is there first tournament, along with Tim and Jake but Tim<br/>
and Jake have been playing for more then a year). Well time ticks by and it is 1:00 with 7 people so it looks like I get to play, but 3 more show up just as I start to get my stuff ready. So I don&amp;#8217;t get to play cause I would make it odd and no one wants that.So they all get paired and I go hit up Jon to play Mordhiem. I play Dwarfs I just started but I am not half bad and I used to play Warhammer and I kick @#$% at painting. So we set up and play a treasure hunt scenario. he found the chest early and ran with it. He kept trying to shoot me to death with all of his archers but they kept sucking they he decided to fall back and<br/>
remove his guys. Anyhow something funny happened.<br/>
Jon: Cinnimon(the halfing archer) jumps out of the second story of a building.He failes his<br/>
check to sucessfuly make the jump.<br/>
Me: thats a strength 3 hit<br/>
Jon: Oh-no it wounded, he stunned himself for two turns<br/>
Me: No he fell on his keys<br/>
Jon: hehe<br/>

After prizes are given out I play a fun game with Ross<br/>
<br/>
My LS Tatooine Smack down vs. Ross&amp;#8217;s Maul deck<br/>
<br/>
I start Lar&amp;#8217;s Farm and podracer prep with my effect being Seeking an Audiance. He dosen&amp;#8217;t have a racer so I am going to win it no problem. We both start off kinda slow, so<br/>
for the first two turns we got the cards we needed and then Ross has this sudden bust  deployment. He plays Maul with Saber to the Landing site. Dengar with Blaster, Dr.E and<br/>
Baba, and Xizor to the Tatooine DB. at this point all I have out is  Naked Threepio but I&amp;#8217;ve got Lando with Axe and Luke with Saber and Lightsaber Profiency in hand. So I<br/>
activate 15 and use 3PO&amp;#8217;s ability and I get a  Ben Kenobi. He has no force saved so I and gonna go kick Maul&amp;#8217;s @ss so I deploy and he has no action. I fight and play Combat<br/>
Readiness and draw a 5 so I activate it he plays I Have You Now buit I Sense it. I cut Maul, he tries to cut Ben but I deflect it and then I draw a 4 and a  5 for destiny and he<br/>
gets a 2 so I have 26 power to his 7 so it&amp;#8217;s Maul and 19. I  move over to the DB and say go. He decides to quit cause he has no chance at winning now. So I win (yeah)<br/>
<br/>
We play part of another game but the store owner has to close early cause he&amp;#8217;s going out with his girlfriend.<br/>
