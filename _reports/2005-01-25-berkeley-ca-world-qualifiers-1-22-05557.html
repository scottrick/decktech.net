<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This is my first ever big tournament, but Ive been looking forward to something like this for a reaaaaaally long time. A couple friends of mine from down south drive up 7 hours to Berkeley to play too. Im psyched for the whole week before the tournament basically, except I cant find any LS deck that I want to play. I love WYS but I dont feel I have the cards necessary to make a very solid version of it. I have a RST built that got first for my friend at the last tournament but its not my favorite deck or really my style. I also have a bunch of decks built on cardtable that arent exactly mainstream but just strange ideas that occasionally Im tempted to try out. In the end, the night before the tournament, I decide that WYS is the deck I have the most experience with, and the one that I also enjoy the most and decide to stick with it.<br>
The day of the tournament I go get breakfast with my friends and the tournament director, and then we rush over to Kinkos so I can print my Virtual cards and he can print enough copies of command cards. We get to the place a little late and find only 4 other people there. But, as were filling in command cards and decklists 8 more people show up, bringing up the total to 15. Not bad. We finish up all the technical stuff and Steve announces the first round pairings.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1: <br>
My WYS vs. Jaymin Vaghashias Bespin Combat Readiness [v]<br>
<br>
It figures the first person I play in the 15 player tournament is one of the two people I came to the tournament with and playtest with all the time. Jaymin doesnt have any cards of his own, which means I had made him (with his input) both of his decks. Which also means that I know every single card in his deck. So my other friend, who was playing right next to us, throws random comments throughout the match about me getting an extremely easy matchup. Jaymin seems a little dejected at first, probably for the same reason, but I tell him to keep his head up. We get started. He gets his first turn free Executor and Piett to the Bespin system, but doesnt move them to Tatooine. I set up Luke [v] on Red 5 [v] and R2-D2 [v] at the sector for some early pressure as well as retrieval. Things go back and forth, my lost pile stays relatively small, while his starts to add up slowly. At one point he puts Veers [v] in Blizzard 2 [v] at the Tatooine DB to spread his drains a little. So next turn I drop Han w/ gun, Chewie, Enraged, and battle. His Trample misses and I play Life Debt to add 2 more destinies. He then pulls out an Imperial Command from his hand and asks me if he can play that to limit my destiniesdamnso I say yes, and he plays that. Random battles here and there, the Mist Hunter [v] survives only one turn as A Few Manuevers and All Wings Report In &amp; Darklighter Spin crack his immunity pretty easily. Once my lost pile starts to accumulate I deploy Melas on the Pulsar Skate at Corellia and Kessel Run. I move Pulsar Skate over to Tatooine, where his Executor is sitting, so on his turn he battles me there. I play Hyper Escape and move over to Kessel. He needs to pull a zero to sack my ship, and he only has 1 zero in his deck. So I move over pretty confidently, and tell him to draw his destiny, and of all things he pullsa zero. My dreams of retrieval die and we get into a damage race. Its also getting pretty late, and as the tournament director calls time, and I was ahead (narrowly), he shows good sportsmanship and draws up (after draining of course).<br>
<br>
FW +8 (2 +8)<br>
<br>
The Good: Luke [v] early for some pressure<br>
The Bad: Imperial Command turning my 5 battle destinies into 1<br>
The Ugly: the ONLY zero in his deck making an appearance at the wrong time<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2:<br>
My HD vs. Andreis Profit<br>
<br>
So I dont remember Andreis last name (or how to spell his first name either, actually) but it starts with an M. Before the game he tells me that he put this deck together last week and has only playtested it against himself. On the other hand, Ive been playing my deck for over a year and a half, and if not necessary a good deck, I at least know it inside out. I have a Blizzard 4 in my opening hand, so first turn I deploy Redilli, Executor DB, and then Blizzard 4 with Vader to Jabbas Palace. He loses to Visage. On his turn he deploys the Cantina, and then Luke w/ Lightsaber to Vaders site and battles. He misses the swing, so I lose the walker and he loses Luke. He loses to Visage again. I move Vader to the Cantina to avoid any free Master Luke nonsense, set up Zuckuss [v] and Mist Hunter [v] at Rendilli, and then pull Battle Order and Come Here You Big Coward. He reads over CHYBC and decides that its not a good idea to free Han yet. So for two or three turns, he looks over the table, looks at his hand, and draws some cards, while taking Visage damage and my drains at the Cantina and Rendilli. He deploys Obi-Wan [v] to Jabbas Palace and makes me lose to Visage too. So on my next turn I drop Maul w/ Lightsaber and Dr. Evezan to Obi-Wans site and battle him. I hit him and I decide that its not worth it to risk losing Maul at the moment (my Phantom Menace was sitting on the Claw Fish) so I operate. He deployed Luke, Rebel Scout and some Leia to the Audience Chamber and frees Han. On my turn I deploy Sidious against his three people in the AC and I initiate a battle. I play I Have You Now to add two destinies. He pulls something decent, and I pull a 5, a 7, and another 7. WOW. His side clears and Sidious stands in the aftermath. After that he puts Corran Horn and Wedge, RSL at my Death Star DB to set up a ping drain and because I think he really didnt have much else to do. I cant find my Put All Sections On Alert, and I decide that the games almost over so its not worth it to draw cards looking for it. I drain him out for the win.<br>
<br>
FW +24 (4 +32)<br>
<br>
The Good: winning I guess<br>
The Bad: nothing really<br>
The Ugly: such a lopsided game  maybe not in differential so much as the actual game. He didnt or couldnt do anything really and it was very uninteractive. I dont mind winning big, but it was almost a NPE because it was so lopsided<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 3: <br/>
My HD vs. Steve Sanders HB<br/>
<br/>
Ive played against this HB once before so Im not too worried. And I also added in some Hidden Base tech into my deck just in case for this tournament. He started two effects instead of three. My first turn, I dropped Rendilli, sacked YCHF.MP for Search &amp; Destroy, and then deployed the Executor DB and let him go. And so of course, the first thing I lose to Visage after pulling S&amp;D is my Death Star DB. There goes my second battleground site and I have no means of retrieving it except for No Escape  but even that wouldnt work because by the time I deployed it on my turn, there would already be another card on top of it. Damn.so I lose S&amp;D to the Visage at the end of his turn. I put down the Blockade Flagship DB and Vader to flip my objective and let him go. He deploys some more systems and also a Captain Han on the Falcon and a generic X-wing or two to Kessel and let me go. On my turn I deployed the Security Precautions that I had drawn, and then I deployed Zuckuss [v], Mist Hunter [v], Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter and stacked either a 6 or 7 on the Claw Fish. He drew a 2 which got reduced to 0 and I drew high enough for him to forfeit both Han and the Falcon. I cant remember whether he lost his X-Wing or not. In any case, after that battle, he lost Luke [v] to Visage after which he said, Ive lost my will to play anymore Hmmsorry, I guess? Haha, so anyway, he flips after deploying ten systems. TEN. So with my Rendilli out he only lost 4 to Security Precautions but its ok because I probed soon afterwards and then drained him out for the win. <br/>
<br/>
FW +21 (6 +53)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: Beating HB because I dont like it<br/>
The Bad: Losing Death Star DB so early and not being able to set up Search &amp; Destroy<br/>
The Ugly: The Emperor  hes one ugly mutha f*cka<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
My WYS vs. Greens SYCFA Mains<br/>
<br/>
So this time I cant remember this persons first name, but I do remember his last name. At this point I am in second place, but first place has 6 +82. So while Im playing my opponent I find out this guys related to the first place person. So I play a bit more cautious than I might have. On his first turn he pulled a Thrawn with an Imperial Command and an Executor and a bunch of other stuff so I activated and drew a bunch of cards due to Thrown Back [v]. He saved force the entire game, especially early in the game, so I was always a little hesitant setting up without having some backup, or even better, some tricks. So he does nothing his first couple turns and I start wondering what hes up to. I expect him to play space because of the Thrawn and Executor, and so I set up LSJK with his saber in the Cantina. Im hesitant to set up any space because he kept saving a lot of force and I didnt want Big Bertha coming down on me. But it turned out to be a mains platform as his next turn he dropped Vader, JQuille [v], and a couple other guys to the Cantina. He battled and played I Have You Now, but drew a 1,1, and a site. I hit Vader and killed another guy to attrition. He then moved out his remaining two guys to the DB. Next turn I set up Dash, Leebo, and Outrider at Kessel and added Han w/ gun to help out Luke some. He came down with someone and 4-lom w/ gun. He cancelled Hans text so I couldnt get the extra destiny and drew a 6 himself. I hit someone, and killed someone else to attrition and Han forfeited for exactly 6 so Luke lived on to drain another day. I kept draining him and he was getting in his own drains at other places. But this game I successfully pulled off a Kessel Run to retrieve some, which was good. On one turn he came down with Boba, BH, Vader, and an I Have You Now but pulled at 1,1,2,0,and 1. Ouch. But he finally killed Luke but canceling his game text with 4-lom and drawinga 1. But by then it was too late and I drained him out for the win. <br/>
<br/>
FW +17 (8 +70)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: Luke Skywalker, Jedi Beast<br/>
The Bad: 4-loms guns text.<br/>
The Ugly: so many 1s and 0s for his destinythat has to be frustrating<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
My HD vs. Philip Greens QMC<br/>
<br/>
So after 4 games I am 27 differential points out of first place, who is Philip Green. Im a little nervous going into this match because of his huge wins past three games. But its also my favorite deck so I am not as worried, although I do play a bit more cautiously. On my first turn I pull Rendilli, the Executor DB and draw some, while my opponent makes random comments about my all foil start, Colo Claw Fish, my lack of Epic Duel, and basically every other thing he could. It was all very entertaining of course. For Visage he loses Cloud City. On his turn he just draws. On my next turn I drop Vader, flip and let him go. He deploys Qui-Gon w/ saber and battles Vader. He misses the swing by pulling exactly a 6 but then crushes my hopes of surviving the battle by drawing a 6bastard. Anyway, I had hit him and drew a 5 so we clear the site, lose to Visage and then its my turn. I drop another Vader, a P-59 and a Dr. Evezan, but also draw into a Force Field and let him go again. On his turn he puts Leia at her room and Dash up in space. Perfect. Seeing this, I couldnt let the opportunity slip. I deploy Zuckuss [v], Mist Hunter [v], and Boba Fett, Bounty Hunter and battle him. He is a bit surprised at the virtual cards and their texts but after all the smoke clears Dash and Outrider both hit the lost pile while Zuckuss and Boba chill for a bit. His next turn he puts down Wedge, RSL, Red Squadron 1, and the cannons and picks a fight. Im slightly nervous about him shooting my ship out of the sky. He pays 3 and then draws a destinya 2, which makes the total destiny 5 and my maneuver is 4 ([v] Zuckuss adds one). He gets excited because he thinks he hit the Mist Hunter, but then I show him the part of the game text where it says -3 to weapon destinies too. He draws something that breaks my immunity so I forfeit Boba and his side clears again. Hes a bit bummed that he lost space and now has to pay for drains  since thats what he was hoping would happen to me. At one point he deploys a Qui-Gon w/ saber to a site. On my turn I deploy Maul w/ saber and battle him. He misses Maul, and I hit Qui-Gon, after which I play Maul Strikes. He then tries to see if it is legal for him to use Path of Least Resistance after weve both drawn battle destiny, which the tournament director with Clayton Atkins help rightly rule that he cant. So he decides not to play Path (before we draw destinies) and regrets it as he has to lose a bit of overflow. After that much didnt happen. He deployed a Luke, Jedi Knight once who got in a bit of a scuffle with Maul. This time he did Path before we drew destinies as I had both an I Have You Now and Maul Strikes in my hand. Nothing else really happens. He cancelled my Visage with Corran Horn after which I told him to lose to Visage accidentally two straight turns. (He didnt). But I had one card stacked on Firepower so I moved P-59 at the end of my turn over to the Holotheatre and on his turn he put down Chewie, Enraged and started a battle there. I shot Corran, made him lose 2 and then Ghhhkd the overflow. Thats about it. <br/>
<br/>
FW +17 (10 +87)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: Mist Hunter [v] owning space<br/>
The Bad: losing a drain of 3 on the last turn because of Pucumir Thryss at the Carbonite Chamber (but it all came from hand so its ok)<br/>
The Ugly: hmmnothing really<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
My WYS vs. Philip Greens HD Dueling<br/>
<br/>
So now I am in first place with a 7 differential lead on Philip, so I play him again. However, Peter N won big the past few games and is on both of our heels in third. I get a sense of dejavu almost because last tournament I was in the top two going into the last game playing the same WYS. My opponent for a little bit doesnt realize that he doesnt get force from the Cantina until I remind him. I set up Dash at Kessel fairly quickly to put some early pressure on him. He drops Lord Vader and his lightsaber to the Cantina with his saber. So I start thinking about my Han, Chewie, Life Debt madness combo, but then he deploys Mara and her saber to the Cantina too. Jesus. I cancel his drain of four once with Its a Hit and another time with Control. Ive given up trying to battle him on ground for the moment and am concentrating on getting my Nightfall and Boussh into hand. I cant find it for the life of me and am eating drains of 4, but then for some reason he moves Mara over to the Tatooine DB and leaves Vader alone. I look at my hand and see all the cards necessary so on my turn I drain 3 at Kessel, drop Han w/ gun, Chewie, Enraged and initiate a battle. As I get first action I play Life Debt, but he hits Chewie and then immediately kills him with Sniper &amp; Dark Strikedamn. So I draw my two destiny, which manage to break Vaders immunity, but am very disappointed that that didnt go the way it was planned. I cancel his Visage with OOC&amp;TT at the end of one of my turns, but on his next turn he plays No Escape, takes Visage back into hand and deploys it for freeargh. I still cant find Boussh anywhere. I pull off a Kessel Run and retrieve 7 force (all I could pay for even though I had Melas and Rayc [v] on Pulsar Skate). I finally draw a Boussh in my hand but its too late. He puts down a Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to Kessel and battles me. I forfeit one pilot to his 7 destiny draw. After that I move over a couple ships to Kessel and try to see what I can do. Next turn, after eating drains of 3 and 2 and 1, I have 1 force in reserve and 1 in hand so I draw up. I realize that I should have battled at Kessel. I had at least 16 power there and I could have reduced his ZiMH down to 0. Even with a draw of 7 and a forfeit of 5 I still would have caused 4 overflow, maybe even moreBut, I didnt and thats game.<br/>
<br/>
FL -16 (10 +71)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: setting up the Kessel drain early<br/>
The Bad: Not realizing to battle on my last turn instead of drawing up, Sniper &amp; Dark Strike for ruining my beatdown<br/>
The Ugly: Not getting Boussh into hand until it was already too late<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards I am disappointed because I feel I should have won the matchup and should have been playing in the final confrontation which was going on (and possibly designing a virtual card). But it was alright, next time I guess. I played this cool guy named Kurtis/Curtis while we killed some time so that the final confrontation could finish. Fun gameits good to see people having fun with the game and their decks and not taking it too seriously, which made me feel better about losing the last game. <br/>
<br/>
Final Standings (before final confrontation):<br/>
<br/>
Philip Green 10(+96)<br/>
Peter Nordstrom 10(+95)<br/>
Hari 10(+71)<br/>
Paul Green 6(+24)<br/>
Timothy Green 6(+10)<br/>
Marc Baires 6(+7)<br/>
Stephen Sanders 6(+5)<br/>
Clayton Atkin 6(-12)<br/>
Marc Masbou 6(-13) <br/>
Dave DeSimone 6(-22)<br/>
Andrei Markovich 6(-24)<br/>
Vinay Shah 6(-44)<br/>
Jaymin Vaghashia 4(-27)<br/>
Stephen Lee 4(-61)<br/>
Zach Hoffman 2(-110)<br/>
<br/>
After Peter Nordstrom won the final confrontation, we got to the prize support. I got some great stuff  an uncut DS Tatooine sheet, a few packs of Tatooine, Jabbas Palace, and Cloud City, a foil, some pins and other random stuff. Andrei, Vinay, and I played some pack wars. I pulled a Darth Maul, JQuille, and a Great Shot Kid! and didnt really lose anything of much value (I ended up giving all the cards except for those three to Jaymin anyway). AlthoughI kind of want to cut that uncut sheetthose Darth Maul AIs are very tempting. Overall a great tournament. Good turnout, good people, fun games, good prize support. If only there were more tournaments like this more often around here.<br/>
