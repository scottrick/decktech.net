<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <br>
<br>
This years edition of the German championship was held at Bensheim, a small and nice town located south of Frankfurt. Organization was in hands of Andreas Holtmann who resides in Bensheim so he plays a home game.<br>
I came alone from Belgium the day before and made some stops in Luxemburg to visit WW2 museums and the final resting place of General Patton. I planned to overnight somewhere near Idar-Oberstein, but the weather was so bad, I decided to drive straight to Bensheim and overnight there. I paid a bit more than usual for sleeping, but that happens if you dont plan enough before<br>
<br>
Anyway, there is decided to play with the old rules to prevent organizational problems. By the time you read this, the new massive errata/V18 change is in effect so this report is history and I wont include that many details as I am used to.<br>
<br>
<br>
MY DECKS.<br>
<br>
With the big change in mind, I spent little time in deck construction and testing. I tweaked on the decks played at Europeans few months ago.<br>
For light I went for a pure ground 3/2 deck built for speed and opening hand. Hence the name rock, scissors, paper.<br>
Dark I restyled my Coruscant CR mains &amp; toys and included more space cards.<br>
<br>
A total of 16 players showed up and for once I didnt forget my notes.<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME 1<br>
<br>
My 3/2 vs. Tamas Papps Walkers<br>
<br>
Well, I start against big blue/vehicles, the decktype I dont want to play against. Great.<br>
Tamas plays Look sir, droids as starting interrupt, takes U-3PO in hand and the Endor shield(V) + YMSYL effects. Its his plan B against 3/2 madness. Ughh.<br/>
First turn I have the opening I want with chambers and Yoda + saber on the generator core. Naked 3-PO also hits the table. Tamas responds with a restraining bolt (ouch) and U-3PO to block my drain.<br/>
The turn after I am lucky with my C/TV, I take a SATM to get rid of the undercover spy and my second SATM was also in the force pile and I drew it up.<br/>
I try to raise pressure with Leia bikini + Saber for extra drain at the core (hereby avoiding the Naboo shield) but U-3POs there again and my last SATM is gone. Meanwhile, Tamas sets up for the big explosion and keeps cancelling my drains with control (he plays four or five controls in his deck).<br/>
Once the MPG is gone, Tamas makes good use of the flipside of his objective and things go bad for me. Because of my decks speed (and some lucky draws), the loss is not that big.<br/>
<br/>
FL  -13<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2<br/>
<br/>
My dark Maxs TIGIH starting Civil disorder(V), DTF, and Squassing.<br/>
<br/>
Its the first time I see Max at a tourney, lets see how he does.<br/>
<br/>
First turn I camp Sidious + saber in his office and draw some cards. Max drops Rendez-vous point, Boshek in ship at Endor and moves Luke over to the Endor DB.<br/>
I must retaliate and drop Maul + P-59 vs. Luke. I forgot about Lukes gametext that makes firing weapons more expensive. On top of that, Max plays Antilles maneuver(V) which makes firing weapons too expensive. My BD is very low, both P-59 and Maul go down and Luke stays. Ughh<br/>
Next turn I draw cards and eat the drain. Maul + Maul strikes comes down a second time vs. Luke and this time hes off the table, but my bad BD draws cost me some overflow and a card stacked on the effect.<br/>
My space cards come too late to threaten Boshek + other pilot at the Endor system so I go for ground control. Leia + überLando try to get rid of Sidious and Janus but Max draws 0,1 for BD and thats the turning point. My ground drains run at full speed now and I can secure a timed win.<br/>
<br/>
TW +14<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
My Dark vs. Joerg Rautenbergs CC: Guest quarter and CP(non-virtual) start, deploying the West gallery.<br/>
<br/>
A bit a surprising start, lets see what happens.<br/>
I set up the usual Sidious stuff up. Joerg draws up. Second or third turn I invade the guest quarters With Mara, Palpy and Janus. Joerg camps Quiggy and Padme at the West gallery, who are battled next turn by Vader, P-59 and a dark strike. Joerg loses everything off table with five overflow.<br/>
I have board control, some battles occur involving Luke, Leia, Chewie and Fallen Jedi (she stayed long on table for I had the bad Maul in hand) but I play in function of differential and secure a big win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +23<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
My Light vs. Joerg Rautenbergers Mystril with Trained in the Jedi arts(V), Ket Malis(V) and Colo claw Fish.<br/>
<br/>
I get the fast start again with Yoda + Saber and the chambers. Joerg deploys Swilla correy on Shada, making her a thief and force drain +1 with another card. Mara + saber also add to the force drain.<br/>
I cancel that drain with the light side coward shield and keep some force for a next turn beatdown. When Shada + peeps are at the Spaceport DB, there is a drain of 5(!) ready so I must battle them away.<br/>
I deploy Ounee Ta to take a card from lost pile in hand but forget the -3 deploy on &lt;&gt; sites so my beatdown squad is just enough to get rid of Shada without overflow.<br/>
Once she is gone, I control the board and the game.<br/>
<br/>
FW +31<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5.<br/>
<br/>
My light vs. Angelos Ralops usual start.<br/>
<br/>
This time I dont have my rocket start so I draw up some cards. Angelo also decides to draw cards.<br/>
Second turn I have Mace + stick at the swamp but Angelo generates 16(!) force in his turn, enough to flip his objective. I can flip it back on the subsequent turn. Then Angelo overloads Obi-Wans saber (the one with destiny 5), I grab overload and redeploy the saber with Ounee Ta, that is tech! I battle with Obi, but forget Vaders shuttle has a permanent pilot so angelo keeps the 7 side.<br/>
The next turns I keep trying to get Ralops on the zero side, but mostly I fail due to the high attrition, outflank(V) and Sacrifice and am not able to grab all the nasty interrupts.<br/>
Suddenly time is called during my turn, but because I started the game its my last turn and I try to get more differential than Angelo despite imperial domination being on table now. In the very last draw phase I use 3-POs ability and hope to fetch the only card that can save me but fail. I needed an Away put your weapon(V) to get all my sabers back in reserve. When the game ends, Angelo has 18 force left vs. my 15. I dont give the full win to Angelo because I still had cards left for a final surprise.<br/>
<br/>
TL  -18<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
My Dark vs. Cedrik Vanderhaegens DBO.<br/>
<br/>
I didnt take notes here, but we playtested before. I could set up the Sidious stuff, but my opening hand was awful and the next 10 cards I draw were crap as well.<br/>
Cedrik secures Kessel and one of his sites so he drains me fast. I attacked him more than once on the ground but its not enough and the big drain at Kessel pummels me down quickly. In the final turn I activated all but one card and it was a bad destiny so I decide to attack the rebel fleet at Kessel with a lone ZiMH and I have enough battle damage to send my deck to the lost pile.<br/>
<br/>
FL  a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The final result after 6 rounds is as follows. The X is there because I didnt have the full names from every player.<br/>

Props and slops.<br/>
<br/>
Andreas for the good tourney and atmosphere, it was a blast.<br/>
Inconsequentional barriers and bith shuffle combo: I had a lot of barriers played against me and canceled them all but one.<br/>
The German highways, this time traffic went very smooth I was more than one hour faster at home than originally scheduled.<br/>
Me ending 8th this time, at least its better than ending 13th the last couple of tourneys.<br/>
@ Joerg: work on force generation when building decks, I am not the kind of player giving lots of icons to my opponent.<br/>
New reset of the game, I look forward to it because we return a bit to the old skool star Wars game. I expect a lot of new decktypes and ideas. On the other hand its a bit sad Ralops is gone, I found it such a great design, very tough to play against and a lot of hidden tech and playing skill is required to play it properly.<br/>
<br/>
Next tourney is the MPC Hannover 7 november, I plan to be there as well.<br/>
