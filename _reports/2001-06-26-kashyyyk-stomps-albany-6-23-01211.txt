<blockquote><font class="bfont"> LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR by Drowning Pool is a simple, but catchie song.  This was to be the original subtitle, but it didnt friggin fit.. so now its like a heading or something i really dont know, but it comes into play later.  if you have the song, put it on, if not ... die.<br>
<br>
Well the kashyyyk crew originally recieved word of this tournament at the infamous Tattoine Box Tourney in Fitchburg, MA last month that was followed up by dinner at the Ponderosa restaurant where the jedi testing of a cute waitress took place.  The Twiggs announced to us that they would be holding a tournament for a reflections 1 uncut sheet, and a challenge was put out for us, including bounty tournament winner Eric "The Albany Killer" Hunter.<br>
<br>
Being still burnt out from playing non stop at ramapo, steebo and i didn’t playtest much for this tournament.  we stuck with our ramapo open (WCQ) decks and took them to a small tournament in Lexington MA.  Home of the first shots of the American Civil War way back when.  <br>
<br>
I just want to do a quick recap of what kind of junk was played at this tournament before i get to the albany tourney.  Lexington is the king of all scrub towns.  Noone there even knew to count their decks after the game.  The TD didnt even know you couldnt play the same deck twice in one round, she wanted us to roll dice for it?!  One kid was playing a hidden base deck with 18 ships and their pilots, but didnt play the hidden base objective, it was all systems and ships.  Another kid played a court deck that used Rancors up the wazoo to eat Sean "Skippy" McCarthy’s Jedi Luke AND Quigon for a 36 force swing.  The kid was rated like 1350, sean is rated like 1850.  Another kid was playing dengar in punishing one... no really he was playing Dagobah Dengar, inside the Dagobah Punishing One.  So ill.  Highlights of the day were me shooting down the executor and power pivoting it when it had like 8 pilots on it.  Here is some super tech that i have yet to pull off with my QMC.  Ten numb with two missiles against the executor.  Sorry about the mess twice to take it out during the control phase.  so ill.  i cant wait to pull that off.  Oh yeah justin H20 and i both got a parking ticket too, which is super gay because the metermaid like camped out by our cars.<br>
<br>
So anyways I had to play steebo twice of course, so that was gay.  He took second and got me a SWEET @#$% chewie’s ATST lego set, which is the chillest set of legos i ever did build.  He bought two packs of white backed sleeves with the rest of his gift certificate.  we won premeire packs too, we saved four because one guy charges unopened packs for tourney admission so he can give it as prize support.  but i did pull the ISB droid in one of the two we opened.<br>
<br>
So in the car on the way home, we are stopped at a light and we are in front of this restaurant there are a couple girls with some dude and their parents standing outside.  steebo is checking out the girls and of course i start eyeing them.  then i look ahead and steebo is like "yo" so i look and theres the older girl smilling at me so i smile back as the light turns green and we pull away.. but we made a U turn beacuse we are just heading out the direction we were parked in and had to turn around. so if we get a stoplight im gonna write the number down and drop it out the window to see if the girl has the balls to call, but alas no stoplight and we drive by again i slow down, give her the smile and wave right in front of the parents, which is always sweet, she smiles and waves back, we drive on.. few words from steebo "how do you always do that"  AHHHH ITS ALL IN THE SMILE...<br>
<br>
Now, on to the albany stuff.<br>
<br>
So I lie to my boss to get saturday off for the tourney, and we were supposed to be at hayes’ friday night, but his mom went off the deep end and i guess started gunning people down as they crossed their property line, so me and steebo felt it best to chill for the night because he was sick and i have a backlog of crap to do, and im feeling shtity as well from hanging out with that clown all day.  <br>
<br>
There is also a bunch of hoopola going down on the buzzboard about tom rocco colorocco and him accusing twigg of cheating and something about jank spanking colorocco with a rubber hose, so we’re thinking heads are going to butt and this will be a good tourney.  <br>
<br>
Hayes picks us up at steebos and me, steebo, hayes, eric, and chewbacca in his ATST head out to albany in Hayes’ 93 dodge spirit which he somehow convinces to go 110 where as looking at the thing, you wouldnt think it to fall at 110 if you dropped it off a cliff.  So i have to tell hayes to calm down because of cops and killing us all with one slight mistake this while we listened to the fear factory cd about 9 times through and eric crying in the background for hayes to keep it under 55.<br>
<br>
We get to about where the tourney is going to be (card shop of the year or whatever it was awarded) and we are wicked early so we book over to the twiggs and are greeted kindly by the family including mrs twigg and twiggs 29387432 pets.  They are about ready to leave so we head over to the mall and all this is getting pretty lame and boring, as all car rides are, that i dont think i need to go into it any further.  on to the tourney.<br>
<br>
We show up, all kinds of albanians are there, but no rochester kids.  a bunch of kids from michigan made the trip becuase they are friends with joe "starfish" gianetti.  Jeremy Curussco and his girlfriend who are from our area showed up because his g/f’s dad lives in schenectady or some town like that, so it was cool seeing them.  otherwise it was the usual albany crew, art, aaron, twiggs, talbots, schaut, northrup, etc etc.  missing in action were chu and sokols, pete sodorski was obviously there as well.  Going into this tournament i am 1794, steebo is 2045.  my goal: break 1800, steebos to stay in 2000’s.  hayes and erics: win the sheet.  Game on.<br>
<br>
So pairings get called and its time to start this mother fukcer<br>
<br>
Game 1: Why I beat Steve Lewis’ GF vs Northrups ankle biters<br>
<br>
Dont know what ankle biters are?? I didnt either, but they are AITC chadra fans WITHOUT SLEEVES ON THEM.  Wicked gay.  Second turn i have vader, aurra and maul out with sabers to the desert heart draining.  He sandstorms them all on his turn two.  My heavy hitters are gone, i never got the characters nor could i take chadra fans with their STUPID two destiny drwas with another destiny to power.   Game Set Match<br/>
By like 22<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting an awesome start<br/>
Lows : Getting it all sandstormed away<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My QMC vs. Joe Gianetti’s HD/Beats<br/>
<br/>
This deck is so gay.  I destroyed it.  I got corran to the executor and pathed away from mara while doing the smae thing on cloud city with three characters running from vader and maul.  He has eight force in his reserve and i just retreived a ton with my off the edges, and im looping them and everything to retreive it all back, but time is running out and i want to get maul off my site so i can drain for a little extra because he kept blocking two drains.  So i drop leia for two path over melas and battle him with obi already there.  he triple battle damages saying "ill let you put me out of my misery" dark strikes obi, plays 5 destiny adders and hits me for 39 force.  I hold myself back from jumping over the table and biting him in his neck and go report his full win by eight, 30 seconds after signaling twigg that i had just earned 32 more rating points.<br/>
FL 0 (-29)<br/>
<br/>
So im O-2 for the first time in a long long time, which is gay because i hate this game and i hate losing and i dont want to play anymore at this point.. luckily i get paired facing a female... i hate playing girls i dont feel like a man, and im always the one who has to play them.  i had to play katie ham at ramapo, now i play jeremy’s fiance keysa here.  i know keysa ive met her, she is nice and we had a great game, here is how it went.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My QMC vs Keysa’s Podracing Dark Deck<br/>
<br/>
Keysa started the landing site with i will find them q uickly to get the trace is correct and sith probe droids.  I sat on my CC and drained.  She came at me once and i dodged the battle.  She won the podrace but i retrieved it all back and basically just drained her out while Twigg made faces at me because he figured id be distracted by breasts, which i was but that isnt the point.  the point is that i won by 30.  so i walk up to twigg lower my head and say that i win by thirty.. we both say that it makes me feel like a man to say that, and a good player.. i say jinx, he owes me a coke now im positive 1.  <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting a win<br/>
Lows : against a girl.  i suck. big time.<br/>
<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
So hayes is 3-0<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
eric is 2-1 <br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
steve is 2-1<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE... FLOOOOOR<br/>
<br/>
I try to convince eric to play raw deal with me but he would rather tell everyone how about how he lost.  so i walk around looking for girls in the clifton park mall but let me tell you that it is barren enough that all i did was go to record town like six times because thats the only store they had i think.  Needless to say there were no girls and so i got some chinese food and went back to the store.<br/>
<br/>
As this TR gets more and more boring....<br/>
<br/>
Let me just say how much i hate reporting on games.  If i ever faced someone good, and played a good game, i would love writing about it, which i have done in the past in games against Hayes, and once yannick and mike dalton, but i cant beleive that people would read all the games in my crappy tournament report during my quest to break the 1800 barrier for my decipher rating.<br/>
<br/>
All three of my wins in this tournament were by 30.  My losses were by 8, twenty something and thirty something.  Maybe thirty something twice, im not really sure.  I dont pay attention to stuff like differential except for my final differencial.  Let me quickly recap the last three games and get on to good stuff including my friend carla visiting from albany who has the sickest body you ever did see, and chris twigg macking her harder than i was.  Eric hunter screaming like a female rape victim (sorry i used the word rape again, it has to get included in every tr, its like my trademark) and liscense plate poker in 0 visibility rain.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 i played chris talbot’s Shmi Mains deck<br/>
<br/>
First turn i get maul and saber for free to his Outskirts because maul moves there for free.  Unlucky for him i got mara in my opening hand so turn two i drop mara and evazan to his shmi and epp leia.  Threepio wasnt even there for him to stack a destiny because he was in his force pile when he searched.  So i smacked shmi for a bunch, he couldnt get his sites out and id rained him for six the entire game and he didnt put one card in my lost pile.  He tried to deploy some guys but never had enough force, i had bad feeling out on turn one and he just got smacked around.  like i said i won by thirty.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 I played Some michigan kid’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
My tat mains deck gets raped by space.  And WYS sitting at Kessel is enough to rape the shti out of my deck.  I drop the executor and move maul up then to kessel.  He drops melas, tosses maul with destiny and next turn i draw up for ships and he gets rid of the executor.  I drop bossk, he it can waits.  Next turn i drop zuckuss with bossk, they get smacked. from there on, i owned the ground but the battleground sites were too far apart and he had insurrection out so i couldnt do much and he drained me to death while getting off a few on the edges before i could draw up and he shmakced me by like 33.  i hate kessel.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My QMC vs Mikey P’s SYCFA flip.<br/>
this was actually a cool game because of the huge space battle at the end.<br/>
<br/>
So he flips really easily.  i was going to go after his gunners but i thought better of it, because whats the use i lose 1 force when he blows the planet and i have menace fades.  So basically once he flips he starts loading ships at the death star and heads for bespin.  ive got all my sites coverd and am draining with pucimer.  the only thing is he retrieves three when he deploys a star D.  plus theyre mad cheap to the death star so hes loading a force up.  Finally he gets to besping when he has like 10 cards left.  but at the system i have wedge, corran in the red 7, the outrdier with dash, the superfalcon, and ten numb with two missiles.  So he moves over to bespin and unloads his dudes.  i was gonna sorry about the mess his ships, but i didnt htink it would be as fun, so i shot down the chimera with power pivot, shot down another regularly.  drew 3 destiny while cancelling and making him redraw his.  he lost a ton of ships and was left with only two, so i did the same thing next turn after draining and that was about game.  And once again i won by 30.<br/>
<br/>
So that was it, i finished 3-3 and came in like 9th.  which wasnt bad i guess. i finished with +27 differencial and was higher than steebo.  of course eric hunter won, chris twigg took second and hayes took third.  after that was the michigan crew, jeremy curusco and me.  So it was an okay tournament.  i don think i hit 1800 or anything, but steebo stayed in the 2000’s and that is good enough of a weeknd for me.  But let me say this about the top players in the kashyyyk region and how they relaly did at this tournament<br/>
<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
Hayes went 5-1 losing only to his brother, a kashyyyk player<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
Eric went 5-1 losing to one albany player, chris schaut<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR<br/>
Steebo went 3-3 Losing to two Kashyyyk players, hayes and eric - and Chris Twigg<br/>
LET THE BODIES HIT THE...FLOOOOOOOR<br/>
<br/>
I shouldve beat gianetti.  i was too dumb to stay away.  that still bothers me.  <br/>
<br/>
Now for the fun stuff and the good times at the casa de terwilliger as well as the crazy @#$% ride home in the rain....<br/>
<br/>
So we drive to twiggs house and pile in there.  It’s me, hayes, eric, steebo, the twigg family followed by the arrivals of joey G and the michigan crew as well as cool eric deluca (new transmission 1).  At twiggs house we played some cards and hayes and twiggs friend bagel played playstation2 football, hayes got romped.  Then my friend Carla from college came over and twigg kept making faces at me behind her and batting his eyes at me etc.  When i went to go get one of the 50 cheeseburgers on the grill he kept asking me if i was jedi testing this girl becuase she has such a SICK body.. i was like no, but your bro is.  CHris twigg was totally macking on my friend carla the whole time, it was friggin great.  It was nice of him though becuase noone else really talked to her and he made it easier on both her and i.  So then we played the star wars game "battle of tera kasi" or something like that.  Its like streetfighter starwars.  It’s pretty hot for an old game but the twiggs have had it for a long time and totally mop the floor with everyone except for Joey G who somehow has every move in the game memorized and keeps yelling them to us. "Downdowndowndowndowndownupdowndowndowndowndown TRAINGLE!"<br/>
yeah joey, i got that.<br/>
<br/>
SO then we had to go because hayes’ mom wanted them home and didnt want us imposing on the twiggs, which sucked because we really werent imposing if you think about it.  4 kids from out of state being really loud and attacking the cat and trying to feed it to the turtles, as well as eat 60 dollars worth of food and drink that they had gone out to get especially for us.. we mustve been more than welcome.<br/>
<br/>
We hit the road (thats a funny word ROOOAAAD) in hayes dodge spirit and it starts pouring.  Like pouring like you have never seen before.  WE were going to pull over but i convinced hayes to just drive like 30 because we definitely wouldve gotten clipped by someone who didnt see the road.  I have never been in rain as bad as the rain that fell that night....  <br/>
<br/>
We ended up outrunning the storm and hit mass and thus dry roads and started playing liscense plate poker for about the last hour of the trip.  Heres how it works.  1’s are wild.  Numbers are numbers.  J is jack, R is queen, K is king A is ace.  O’s are 10s.  Hayes and I start playing, then eric jumps in, and finally after some delirious babble, steebo who had just woken up.  The game consisted of us calling out what number car we wanted out of the next four and hayes RACING up to a car, then screeching down to their speed so we can look at the plates, him and i call them out and he guns it to about 110 to get to the next car.  Rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
So that concludes the Albany weekend.  I most likely forgot some stuff, and those do not include props and slops which will come as soon as you continue to scroll down.  thanks.<br/>
<br/>
PROPS<br/>
The twiggs for running a sweet tourney and hooking us up with food/shelter<br/>

<br/>
Alex Tennet because no TR of mine is complete without a mention of him.  Let me just tell you now that the cards me and steebo broke for dcon, we have all set and we’re not telling anyone, we’re saving it for worlds because we are hoping the next set helps us out (theres a good chance it will) but we will make a third deck for alex tennet and hand it to him the night before day 1 at dcon when he climbs into my bed in black undies.  He will win dcon with our deck, and none will be more happier than meeeeeeeee.<br/>
<br/>
SLOPS<br/>
<br/>
ME cause i couldnt break 1800 in the first chance i really got to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Starfish for lying about the triple damage, oh the pain that caused me<br/>
<br/>
thanks for reading guys, youre the best<br/>
