Sorry if this is a little short, I’m still pissed about game 4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay here is the obligitory Mirkwood Tuesday night TR.  Pre-Stuff I was going with a TIGIH high destiny retrieval for the LS and AOTBS crap fro DS. On a less-happy note Herb was finally back, and I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, that maybe he had gotten better to play during his absence, he hadn’t, just read game 4.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My DS vs. Josh Grace and his TIGIH<br/>
<br/>
Okay thhis Game sucked, I got nothing that I needed early, and Josh is a great player and took advantage of it.  I never took Luke with Paply, I tried to battle him once, with Fett w/Gun and Bane, plus Jabbas Through and Hidden Weapons, I missed on the HW, I missed on the Shot (have a few 7’s in the deck) then he played Insertion Planning, and I drew crap for destinys, the rest of the game was him chasing me around docking bays while he drained for a lot, and I drained for a little.  A couple late On the Edges helped his Diff.<br/>

Highs:  Uh... Josh is a good guy and fun to play<br/>
Lows: Fett and Bane getting @#$% slapped by some Punk jedi-wannabe.<br/>
Ugly: Um..where to begin<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs. Scott Poster and his RalOps.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I played against his deck last week, so I had a good Idea what to do, sop this is sorta how the game went. I signaled on my first turn for Ounee Ta,  Thns I moved Luke to the backdoor, and just stacked characters at his SpacePort DB, I also put out order to Engage, so he had to keep dropping guys there to battle me.  I would just lose 1 guy, while he lost at least 1 every turn from attrition, so the fact that I could throw more crap at him, plus a couple on/off the edges for about 10 force, and Lukes steady drain of 3 at the back door did him in.<br/>

Highs: fun game, Scott is a good opponent, and my deck which was built last night worked well, doing what it needed to do, keep 1 of his sites, and keep my drains and retrieval going.<br/>
Lows: Scott never found Vader, he would have helped him immensly<br/>
Ugly: The final battle where he lost 2 characters and a walker, plus 2 from Orimarkko, and stacked 1<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my DS vs. Tony Lawrence and his HB flip Matching Pilots.<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game was really wierd, Tony is someone I know really well I give him rides to and from a lot of Tourneys, and he really is a nice kid, a bit naive, but a nice kid none the less.  I’ve played his deck a bunh of times before, and I know what to do, since I have very little space, I was just going to get zUckuss and Bossk and wait for the right time to jump him. Which was when he put Luke in R2 in Red 5 alone at sullust.  Drop Blast Door Controls, and my ships battle, he loses everything.  He came down to the ground a couple times, but never with luke so after I flipped my objective on the 1st turn (pull spaceport DB, deploy to Corescant, drop a free VIgo and move Xixor).  I just kept pinging him for direct damage, and the few times he came to the ground He was beaten like a little @#$% by my Bounty Hunters he just stayed in space, but didn’t spread out to try and out damage me till it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 16<br/>
<br/>
Highs: AOTBS working wonders never cease, probing his base on the 2nd try<br/>
Lows: Tony wasn’t happy and @#$%ed that he made some mistakes, plus I felt dirty beating him as badly as I did, the game was never in doubt.<br/>
Ugly.  Bossk and Zuckass (and a tun later 4-lom) owning any system they went to. against a pure space deck<br/>
<br/>

Game 4 my LS vs. Herb Macy and His AOTBS start PotF to flip first turn<br/>
<br/>
Okay this was a game that almost made me not write this report, I have never liked Playing Herb, and this was by far the worst game he has ever played.  He started, and deployed Palpy to the Endor DB, I moved LUke over, and got him captured, now his objective is pinging me, but I’m getting him.  He moved Palpy to the BackDoor, and I moved Ben Kenobi, Han w/ Gun and Figrin Dan there, Put out Order to engage, and said go.  He dropped Bane and the 2 droids, battle, mindscan Han, and 4-lom Ben, I shoot at 4-Lom and miss, he captures Han with Iggy ans sends him to the used pile (good I have another in hand) I swing with Ben and hit Palpy.  He tries to Fire with Bane (since he mindscand Han) and I said no.  Then he said well I’m still going to play Jabbas through.. I said no it is a just Action and you can’t he kinda @#$%ed, and I said I’m not going to let you play it.  He sat there for like 5 minutes (really the game next to us went through 2 full turns). and asked again why I wouldn’t let him play it.  He says that he would let me, I said bullSh!t.  Then he says that he is going to play really slow since now he has to read all the cards really closely.  To make a long Story short The TD came over 5 minutes later and said that we had a half an hour and If I won by more than 30 I win the Tourney.  Herb was as slow as possible, even waiting for a while on automatic actions, and since I’m not a whiner, I didn’t @#$% about his stalling, thinking that I will not time out, since I have never in about 350 sactioned games timed out.  Well to make a long rant short, The game timed out, and I won by 25, had Herb not been a @#$%, I would have won the tourney, since I still had a few retrieval cards, and my reserve deck stacked, plus I was figgin every trun and winning.  So herb cost me the Tournament.  If anyone out there wants to pass on a message to Herb if he pulls this Crap on me ever again, I will phisically hurt him.  I will also watch very closely any game with me, if he even seems to think about something for longer that a half-second I’m calling the TD over to keep him from stalling.  I really hate timed games, it’s like Kissing your sister (no not your sister, she’s hot, YOUR sister, now do you see what I mean?)<br/>
<br/>
TW by 25.  God damnit I hate Herb for this, that cost me the ID foil that I have been trying like hell to get.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I beat Herb like the rred-headed Bisexual midget stepchild that he is.<br/>
Lows; See above<br/>
Ugly: Herb.<br/>
