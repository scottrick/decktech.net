<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, After a few weeks of playtesting, I decided to take the local Trek to Acme Games for the Tournament. After my 3-1 performance in Columbus 2 weeks ago I decided to keep my same decks, My RST BOOMRACE, and My Ties. My local group, The Milfonati Connection had been playtesting mass this last week and decided on the best decks. Me, Matt Scott, Aj Klein, and Wes Sutermeister were all going to be there, and we found out that John Veasey showed up and Dave Dalton did not. Our only loss was Tyler Martin, who was scrubbing out at a Wedding (his Mom&amp;#8217;s Grocer???)<br/>
<br/>
Well My rating going into this Tourney was 1635. Wow!<br/>
<br/>
WELL HERE WE GO!!!<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1:<br/>
My RST BOOMRACE vs. Corey Jackson (1496) Huntdown<br/>
Well I start my Strike Planning, and he starts the regular Huntdown stuff with the new Maul Dueler effect. I pull my Generals, and I Did It!, and I got a god hand. He gets a first turn Vader to the Lars Moisture Farm?? And I go and lose one. I deploy my Generals to the Landing site, get out Kensaric, deploy Shield is down, take out Bunker and Backdoor, and draw one, he goes. Force drain of two, I draw race destiny my 19 to his 7 total. He lets me go I lose one. I force Drain, throw myself a charge, Deploy Bunker, Charge, take out Deactivate and Deploy, Deploy Jedi Knight Luke, Move over to Bunker, Draw one, He goes, we both lose one. I win the race, but He kinda hurries his turn and Lets me go before I get to win the race so I have to wait an extra turn. I go DESTROY THE BUNKER!!!, drain for 2 at the back door, get out Midge. My move I win the Race, retrieve 6, he loses 6. he goes. He elises Vader over to the Bunker, Plays Dioxis = FAILS. Blind Duels anyway, throws his saber. I draw 6-5, he draws 3-1. I win the duel. He loses Vader and 9. That is the Game. I win this game by 35.<br/>
FW (2) +35.<br/>
Props: RST BOOMRACE. It @#$%in kicks ass.<br/>
Slops: Blind Duels. Never do it against High Destiny decks.<br/>
<br/>
Well my first game is over, and now I have very High Confidence with my Light deck. It worked perfectly. Well Matt Scott, AJ, Wes, and Veasey all won this game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
My TIES! Vs. Albert &amp;#8220;Studtradomus&amp;#8221; Klein (1685) PODPROFIT AINT LOSIN TODAY!<br/>
Well I have a very Bad feeling about this matchup, considering that he should beat my @#$% unless I get a god start. I start 3 combo effects, all of them except the battle order one. Well I draw, and I get my wish, 3 @#$%in Planets!!! @#$% yea. Well I deploy Sienar and Wakeelmui and 2 ties one at endor, one at Naboo. I draw he goes. He deploys Ben and Lando wit Axe, and Plays Outta Commision and I grab it. Well I go again, and I deploy Kashyyk and a tie, and Play Neimodian advisor get out Kiffex and put a dreadnaught there. ***BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE ALERT*** I then deploy Battle Order First Strike and A tie to the Death Star dockin bay, thinking I was doing some techy @#$%. Well he goes and deploys Corran to the docking and wipes out my tie. I think @#$%. I go force drain for 8 now having to pay. I deploy Arica and battle Corran but I get unlucky and Corran stays and I lose Arica. I deploy my last system and a tie, but now Im screwed. He releases han and starts the force drains. Well this goes on for a couple of turns, but as we get later we both cannot force drain to our full potential and I get down to only a few cards. Well he wins the race, because of the direct Damage or 4 and I end up Punchin myself in the face, because of my card Battle Order for costing me the game. That game woulda been over in 3 turns after I got my 5th system out and instead I lost. Damn that is a scrubby mistake.<br/>
FL (2) +31<br/>
Props: AJ and my hand<br/>
Slops: Alex George, Battle Order, and PODPROFIT.<br/>
<br/>
Well I just scrubbed out in a game that may have cost me the tournament. Well as a way of saying sorry, Aj walks over to Wendy&amp;#8217;s with me and we get lunch. We are still friends and I forgive him for some Jackassisness that he did in this game.<br/>
<br/>
I get a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger &amp;#8211; The cheese, the mayonnaise, the salad @#$%. So its really just a bacon burger with Ketchup. That makes my day just a little bit better.<br/>
<br/>
Well we get back and its time for the 3rd matchup.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
My TIES! Vs. Wes &amp;#8220;Westradamus&amp;#8221; Sutermeister (1563) WYS Bottomly @#$%.<br/>
Well I start the same @#$% again. I get another rather good start but It is not that good. I deploy in space, And start forcedraining. I get my spies out on the ground and cancel his drains. About 4 turns later he deploys a beatdown on a lone tie and I GHHK!!!!! It. I then deploy 2 ties and a cannon, lat damage the falcon, Shoot down the Pulsar, and outrider, All Power to weapons. He loses Han and 1. That means that I am rather safe for the rest of the game, cause I now know that he only has one ship left and that is Red 10. Well later he gets it out and I then wipe it outta the sky. I then forcedrain for about 8 a turn while I only have to lose 1. Well this game was fast and I drew a little and did not try to pump the diff. I end up only winning by 8 cause of mass @#$% on table.<br/>
FW (4) +39<br/>
Props: My ties @#$%in rock<br/>
Slops: Too much @#$% and a huge hand. @#$% me.<br/>
<br/>
Well after that game, I was rather happy with my Ties and I had the feeling that I would get in the top 3 this tourney. Well I had to back up my thoughts so I got ready for my next Matchup.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
RST BOOMRACE vs. Matt &amp;#8220;Scottradamus&amp;#8221; Scott (1864) Senate Pile of Jizz take it out and burn it.<br/>
Well this game pretty much sucked. It only took him 4 turns to beat me somehow, So I really do not have really any special happenings. A third turn Vader, P59, and DRE to wipe out some scouts and make me lose 11 over flow hurt me. I never got to blow up the Bunker. Finally on the turn I was going to win the race, Matts total drainage of 8 took me out. This game really sucked for me and I was starting to get worried. Only one battle, and not one force drain by me, shows a very small bit of offense. I could do absolutely nothing.<br/>
FL (4) +12<br/>
Props: Matt Scott on a perfect game.<br/>
Slops: Matt Scott for having too many Perfect games versus me. Silly @#$%er.<br/>
<br/>
Well Im kinda pissed cause now I&amp;#8217;m 2-2. I think I may be starting to scrub out, cause I have not done much so far. I lost two games and I am worried. I then decide to keep my chin up and WIN MY NEXT TWO GAMES (I hope).<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
RST BOOMRACE vs. Johnny Crawford (1764) Tie Bombers!!!! AAAAAAHHH<br/>
Well he starts just coruscant and No objective. He deploys a Tie bomber first turn to Endor and lets me go. He was giving me no force So I was only activating 6. I deploy Han and Crix and draw one. (NO WE wish to board at once or shield is down)<br/>
He goes and does not force drain me. I race I now have 18 to his 6. YAY. I&amp;#8217;m GONNA DO IT!. He deploys Wakeelmui and Sienar and Another Tie to endor with some proton bombs. I then Go. I deploy Leia worrying about a bombing run. Use my obj. Hand Update. I now have Bunker, Deactivate, 2 charges. I don&amp;#8217;t deploy them yet. He goes. Still cant find a system. Uses Imp Comm to get Piett and uses his once per game function. NO MERREJK. So he just goes down to his newly deployed Naboo in a dreadnaught. I then win the race, retrieve none, he loses 6. I DID IT! Which is deployed in my turn. I then deploy Battle Plan Draw Their Fire. I then do one of my many scrubby mistakes, which truly shows that I am not able to contend with the big boyz just yet. I deploy my bunker @#$%, and take home one into hand with ackbar and haashn with Launchin the assault and me drawing my pilots earlier. **did you notice my mistake** if not I&amp;#8217;ll tell you after the game. Well of course during his turn he collapses my Bunker. Which contained one spy and EPP Obi. I think @#$%. After this moment, Johnny informs me that I can still Blow the Bunker cause it retains its card type as bunker. I do not know if this is correct, but I go along with it, cause he is a TD and seems to know the rules. So I then move all of my characters over to the collapsed site and Deploy the Home one with Ackbar, Haashn, Blount, EPP LEIA, and Shuttle Gen Solo up at endor. I then Play Throw me another charge and notice that 4 of the remaining 11 cards are 6s plus the new 6 at the bottom. I also have another charge in hand so I think that I have a chance to blow the bunker. My turn, activate till 2 cards are left. Flip with caution. @#$% YEA. 6-6 throw me, The collapsed Bunker is blown away. YA YA. I don&amp;#8217;t even know if this is a correct ruling but I aint arguing and That made my game. Home One wrecks for the remainder of the game in space, while I retrieve 2 a turn, a tracked scout and a card with I did it!. I finally win by 12.<br/>
FW (6) +24<br/>
Props: My excellent game. I still would have won if I had not blown the Bunker, but I woulda only won by 4, cause the last 5 turns no force loss happened.<br/>
Slops: my Scrub Mistake<br/>
<br/>
**my mistake** I shoulda deployed Home one the turn before I was going to blow the Bunker. I shoulda held the Endor system, cause he cannot collapse If he does not control the site. I was one turn to early. Dang you Alex George.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
My TIES! Vs. Kyle George (1649) PodProfit does not lose<br/>
@#$%! Another podprofit. Well I get another great start with 2 neimodians advisors and one system. Deploy my system, Wakee, Sienar with Twilek, 2 ties, Neimo, his turn. He deploys some @#$% down on tat and lets me go. I force drain, then use my other Neimo to get out another system, use all power, deploy a tie there. Then draw. Get 1 more tie, a dreadnaught and another system. WOW!!! @#$% yea. He releases han, retrieves, deploys some more, and lets me go once again. I forcre drain for 6, deploy my a tie, deploy a dreadnaught, Draw one, NEIMO!!!, get out my last system. And he goes. He force drains me for some @#$%, I cancel one, and lose the rest +profit damage. I then go. Force drain for 8, deploy my final system. Deploy my Remaining Ties to empty lost pile. I draw, get both squadrons, 2 ties, and short range. He force drains, I cancel one. And lose a couple. My turn. He finally is over on the race total. I deploy a squadron and my tie on dreaded to get to that Magic number of 9 on table. One more tie to go, and it is in my hand. I deploy the other squadron and Now have only like 7 cards in lost pile. I also did forcedrain this turn, but forgot to write it earlier. Move phase lose 6, he retrieves 6. Force drains. I cancel one more. I am losing like 9 force. I go drain for 10. Deploy my final tie. Let him go. Drains for like 12 with prof damage. I play short range get 10 back. I go. Force drain. He goes Force drain. I go Force Drain. Game over. I win by 4. WHEEH<br/>
FW (8) +28<br/>
Props: nice start up.<br/>
Slops: Profit is fast.<br/>
<br/>
