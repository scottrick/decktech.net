<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well heres my Report on the states. I wasnt going to write one but luca did and i thought i might as well seeing as i sprained my ankle trying to learn to rollerblade so I can play inline hockey and before you start thinking im a sh!t rollerblader let me tell you this  it was my first time rollerblading and i only fell the one time (which was all i needed to ruin my ankle and even though i hurt it I played for another 20 minutes while it started to swell like a    b!tch). Anyway,they had the states at Australia On Collins on the 6th of may and i been playtesting my decks and stuff and felt damn confident for light trm was the way i went (theres a version of what i took on my page for both decks but i will post the full versions as well) except i had a few mods like one out of comission just in case people were playing huntdown. And for dark i took my bastardised tdigwatt except to makle its average destiny higher i added in some odds and took out all the characters and borrowed two empys off a friend. onto the games:<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 MY tdigwatt vs dave huebermans tigih speeders.<br/>
I start my usual which is tdigwatt with secret plans and the north corridor(the 2/1 site with force drain minus 1?) and the three effects for me are iao mob points and crush. he started the insurrection,  staging areas and something else. I got off to a bad start this game and he got a few drains in and setup a speeder at hoth with incom corp and he got out ebg and ended up dropping like four speeders a maintenance droid and that incom engineer that adds two to the destiny and then hobbie or zev. I monnok him lost about three times this game getting it back with my SFS and i end up getting his asp droids so he cant rig the catapaults and DIS a drain. i setup ties and a dreadnought at bespin and put empys shield at cloud city with an intecptor. he tries to rig a destiny draw and surprise assualts the sector. Ive been tracking his destiny and know its not the five and he draws a 3 and a 2 so he loses one and says its suppose to be the five but i tell him its two cards down cause he dropped the signal first. later hes getting down and i insert my first odds for the day so he doesnt activate and just drains so i move dlots in front of him and deploy land some ties to the db. he activates and odds pops and he has to lose 5 which is game over for him but before he loses he says "ill lose that after i force drain you" and i say "No"<br/>
so he loses it and i win<br/>
FW 2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my trm vs ryan (first tourny ever and didnt really know what to do)<br/>
he started with three effects that he couldnt and started audience chamber instead of jabbas palace. i had to show him that he couldnt start those effects and he ends up starting only all wrapped up. I ask him how he went the first game and he said he had the bye. all game he drops a lone character to a random site and i had bacta tank and obi with saber in hand, lando with ax and the beru family at the farm and R-3PO at my home one docking bay for hdwgitm. Each turn i would drop obi battle lose him to the tank and do it again next turn until i retired obi to my lost pile and used harvest to clean my lost pile. Lukes turn and he comes down battles and goes to the tank. He drops snoova and i say do you want to get the ax but he says he doesnt own one and then he ends his turn.  I could have dropped about four characters which would have been leia, luke, obi and chewie but i would have felt bad so i just drop luke and battle use draw their fire to get my harvest back and he loses him and like 2 more cause i drew bad. So luke is stuck down on tatooine. He starts dropping to endor back door which i dropped. so i have to use obi again. eventually i win with no lost pile and four characters down with all my sites out and win by 38<br/>
FW 4(+55)<br/>
<br/>
Game three my dark vs ?? playing mwyhl.<br/>
I hate playing mwyhl. he does all his crap and drops a db cause he started insurrection i put a tie at bespin and one at cloud city cause ive got empys sword and it reacts. tech mor and empy own the north corridor and i drop a tie to the db for occupation and take it off so i drain for three and he loses one to occupation. Ive dropped an odds in his deck but when that pops he had insights out so it does nothing. he has at the tat:db ben kenobi, Rebel scout luke with a stick, kal fal, figrin, and the lars family. I look at my hand to think what to do about that. I have in my hand dlots, stick, you are beaten, ties and all power to weapons. so i drop dlots no barrier i search for i have you now, drop his stick battle slash ben, i have you now on luke, you are beaten luke, choke kal fal and draw destiny all thats left after the battle is vader. I move vader over to the db for occupation damage and the drain. he then drops gold leader in gold one to battle my lone tie at the cc sector. I react with the squad, retrieve, play all power to weapons and my power is like 17 to his 5 and he loses ship and heaps more i drain him out and win by 31.<br/>
FW 6(+86)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 light vs adam amy aotbs <br/>
This game could have gone either way but being the bonehead i am i didnt drop draw thier fire in my first turn cause i want to set up with hdwgitm a bit quicker turns out this was one mistake. he get xizor to ds db with vigo and stuff and i beat him down elsewhere but he ghhhks(which is a     b!tch cause i had a frozen assests in my hand). basically i was draining him for one here and there and he had direct damage and a drain of two and two. i kept playing ooc getting these empy, iggy, 4lom, dengar, force lightning and of course prepared defenses(always get this, if you dont pick this as your first pick for ooc then your a scrub) and even though i got rid of his hit squad i still lost by 25<br/>
FL6(+61)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my dark vs micheals aitc/xwings<br/>
He was a bit upset with the performance of his light deck and was upset even more when he found out he was playing me. I thought this was his jawa deck that i beat by 31 with a ral ops(tramples are a jawas worse nightmare, stomp, splat, squish!) but yeah he starts with bargaining table and droopy mc cool is his rep(hhmmmm?). any way i drop empy to my cc db and a tie to the system and sector with a react in my hand. after a bit of draining and deploying. he drops luke and obi and a bothan spy to battle empy. he swings and he misses, i get i have you now, he swings again i get force lightning and play i have you now on luke. i draw 9 total and he drew 1 so i lose nothing and he loses obi  i drop a tie and get i have you now back. Ive been using monnok lost on him and take out some bothan spies and xwings with it(i end up using it 4 times on him for this game). I have dlots, stick, YAB, and then search for i have you now drop the lot against luke w/stick and the bothan spy. he weapon levs the stick from me and i think hmmm, what to do? I remember that i have a 6 a 5 and a 4 in my deck so i try to choke luke and get him with the six!draw destiny and he loses bothan spy and lots more. hes running out of force so he deploys two xwings to battle two ties cause he wins by two power but i react and he loses the two x-wings. after that i drain him out and win by 31.<br/>
FW 8(+92)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my light vs geelong guy that im going to have to say sorry to cause i forgot his name (i think its mark) with a ral ops.<br/>
Well this game was my toughest game of the day. he was playing a slow ral ops with victory class star destroyers and admirals. He grabbed my hdwgitm. there were a few battles. I drained him on ralitir with luke but he reacted over with epp vader and tarkin on a atst so i satm vader and battle he reacts with the other walker so luke goes to the tank again. He flipped at one stage and i flipped him back two turns later. he controlled the only system (rendili) all game and i couldnt get my bastardised falcon into hand to wipe out thrawn and chinaroo on flagship executor. I got a few harvests out early for free then he dropped something special planned for them so that kept them out. I was thinking that i was about to lose the game cause i had battle plan out and had to pay for my drains while he didnt. but thanks someone at the back door for saving my a$$ i won by 8<br/>
FW 10(+100)<br/>
<br/>
So i end up coming third which is good for me cause this is my first major tourny. daniel and adam where in the final and i didnt get to stick around cause my friend wanted to go but daniel robertson ended up winning the event and took home the bumbag. I get cards that i loaned out back and gave back the cards i borrowed. I got home and meet my other friend and go watch him play hockey cause his the goalie. his team was losing 9-2 but with about 27 seconds in the last quarter his team got penalty number 8 or 9 and that forced a forfiet cause of rulings so the game was a waste. I go to bed the end.<br/>
