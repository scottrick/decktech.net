<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> Well, the big day has finally come...going to DragonCon was an early birthday present for me, so I just wanted to have fun.<br/>
  So my step-dad and I are driving up to Atlanta from Central Florida...a bloody 8 hour drive, we leave my house at about 10:00 at night ON THURSDAY!!, but that couldn't be helped(un-foreseen delays). So we end up getting into Atlanta at about 5:30 in the morning, ack!. I was going to make new decks when I got to the hotel we were staying at but I just feel asleep till 9:00...then I woke up and furiously put together David Akers manip deck in the morning. I had play tested with the manip before going to Atlanta and I thought it was a fun deck so i decided to use it. For my LS I was going to use EBO...but i didnt have time to make it so i was stuck using my Profit/Sabacc deck...it works if it gets a fast start.(if it plays against TDIGWATT...its screwed) <br/>
<br/>
  I get to the Hyatt where they are holding the tourny and as soon as I walk in, I am surrounded by a chaotic mess of Aliens and Stormtroopers and Boba Fetts....and fat Klingons...it was sooo crazy...and hystarical at the same time. After walking down to the gaming room and seeing no one there I go back up stairs and find Walter Cowart and his bro Louis just chillin at a table...so i sit with them for a while and talk about these crazy LARP people, we then go downstairs and find the gameroom with more people in it now. I see that the TN crew has shown up(Clint Hays, Steven Lewis, Jim Sells and Bill Gordon), I also see Neal Razi, David Irvine, Chris Bentley, Charlie"CommieBoy" Herren, and Matt Lush just to name a few. I also met Juz for the first time, and his weird accent too," SW playerz there is 15 minutes remaining"..hehe(Even Lorentz impersonating Juz). So now I'm getting situated to play....On to the games now<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Game 1 - my DS vs. Daniel Sigrist's EBO (1689)<br/>
 I draw up my 8 cards and look at my hand...i look again...i see 2 vaders, an elis, a monnok, coruscant docking bay, and 3 senses...wtf...no Onith(the key to the deck), so I then look through my deck to find the DB control room, it's not there. I then draw up all my force and dont get a single M'iiyoom Onith(out of the four in the deck) but i do get my 3rd vader....whoop-dee friggin do. My opponent doesnt do anything on his first turn except pull out the usual with ANSB and then draws...ok...if I can get a Onith in my next draw I think I can still win...i deploy a few effects from my hand and deploy djas puhr to the control room which i got when i drew my last turn...pull out the rest of my 0/1 DB bays and draw....guess what i got when i drew...absolutely @#$%...i didnt get Onith...the game was over already, so after that he gets a bunch of stuff out by the 4th turn, I dont get an Onith till about turn 8 and that was to late...i had deployed a few of characters and they were doing all they could but it wasn't near enough...i got him with monnok a few times to make him lose a bit. But in the end i bit the dust. this game was an Ass way to start out....oh well. FL by 15<br/>
 0(-15)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Set for stun on commander luke(i think) and Jeroem Webb<br/>
Lows: the most assyist of assy draws I have ever had<br/>
<br/>
   Game 2: My LS vs. Andrew Morris's TDIGWATT (1985)<br/>
  My first thought of the game was OH Shit he is play This Deal Is Getting Worse, im screwed. My deck doesnt have enough power to even come close to beating this kind of deck...this is the only deck that my LS has real trouble with and guess what, it figures with my luck that I get to play the only guy that used it at the tourny(from what i could tell).Damn. Here's how the game goes...my opening hand looks good...lots of mains w/ weapons and my bacta tank and lando, a casino and a sabacc, along with a rebel barrier.decent start. first turn he plays Scanning Crew, ther goes my Obi w/ stick, he drops a few sites and draws. my turn he scanning crews luke away to the used pile....ok this is not fun...i drop the casino draw a few and save some...his turn, scanning crew again, i have no grabber in my hand, bye bye to the master luke i just picked up. So it goes like this for a few turns until i finally get luke, lando to the casino, my bacta tank out and and figrin d'an to the audience chamber. i draw a few, play CC sabacc and lose cuz i draw 2 sites and 3 characters for a sabacc hand.ass. he makes me lose the obi in my sabacc hand...then he plays scanning crew during his turn and puts the obi i had just picked up(i also got gift of the mentor too) in the used pile. he deploys an armada to the casino...i barrier like 2 people so he doesnt battle yet. i move away on my turn (during this entire time he has a drain of like 4 going on cuz of the other CC sites he is controling with lesser characters and the evil IG-88 w/ gun. i retrieve han but it doesnt help.he then throws down enough to wipe my characters off CC for good and i lose a lot of force. game basically over after that...he force drained me out big time.  FL by 46<br/>
  0(-61)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none<br/>
Lows: scanning crew is a @#$%...it was a bad match up for my deck anyway, i didnt have enough power to stop the little drains.<br/>
<br/>
 I knew what was happening...i was getting nutted on by everyone, i needed to get my focus back....<br/>
<br/>
   Game 3: guess what, my turn of luck, my opponent apparently dropped out so i get the bye(thank god). so i spend a few minutes sleeping(much needed) and re-think things through.<br/>
 2(-61)<br/>
<br/>
  Now on to game 4<br/>
  Game 4: my LS vs. Adam Piper's Endor ops deck (1590)<br/>
 I know I can beat Endor ops so I am looking to win. He deploys a bunch of stuff to the 3 endor sites he had out. I get a good start and decide not to give away my hand and show him what i am going to do. So he keeps deploying to endor which in my opinion killed him...he way over deployed to early in the game. so after a few turns of watching him do his thing, he deployed the effects to endor and flips. my turn, i throw down the squads...i put the casino with lando there, i throw chewie w/ gun on the falcon and deploy it to endor and cancel establish secret base. i put figrin d'an at the chamber and pull han out early and retrieve 8 force. i put the bacta tank out earlier and i put pucumir thryss with lando, obi w/stick at the lower corridor and end my turn and draw 1 card or so. his turn he deploys the tempest 1 and like all his tempest scouts to the casino. he battles i play It's a trap to cancel the battle. i then play sabacc and win and i get boba in ship.he ends his turn and i go. he loses to profit then i drain him at endor and the lower corridor. i deploy the core tunnel, luke to the lower corridor and deploy a H'emthe to the falcon with chewie. i move lando and pucumir to the core tunnel, and put battle plan out also, i end my turn.he decides not to drain and puts both the thunderflare and the stalker to endor, i barrier the thunderflare. he does nothing and ends his turn. i drain him for a ton this turn and it goes like that until the end of the game. he thought he might have a chance then with my tracked lift tube i retieved an additional 5 force with off the edge to seal the game. FW by 23<br/>
 4(-38)<br/>
Highs: smacking down the star destroyers and controlling endor most of the game.the deck worked like a machine.<br/>
Lows:watching him kill himslef by deploying so much to endor early in the game.<br/>
<br/>
  Game 5: my DS vs. David Irvine's crazy fake EBO meta deck(2052)<br/>
  When i saw him start the EBO stuff, i thought I had a good chance at winning, cuz i know this deck can beat EBO if it gets a good start. well i get that good start. i deploy all the stuff i need on the table by 2nd turn. i hit him with Onith a few times...only to get nothing. i like stunned by his cards in hand. well i decide to put DLOTS down and begin my domination tactics. i alter EBG, Goo Nee Tay, and traffic control. i end up altering EBG 3 times. it was crazyi like sensed and altered everything he had on the table, twice. but somehow he managed to get a few characters on table, he put 8D8 down early in game  and was getting a few drains off here and there. Her's where i am totaly blown away at, i still can't figure out what his deck was...he was deploying minimal people, wasn't force drianing me for much, he deployed to the control room and killed Onith repeatedly, he got tantive 4 deployed and wedge on board to the death star system to force drain, on my turn i twi'lek and get Come here you big coward, and i spread out to drain, i alter the bacta tank along with everything else that could possibly be altered. at this point in time i am so confused. my lost pile is bigger than his,just barely though. he is sitting over there just pecking away at me and blocking my drains whenever he could. I had never seen anything like his deck. it was mainly like 1 of every friggin card in the game and little amount of characters. so I lose but dont know how i lost...i did everything in my power to kill him but for some odd reason i ran out of cards faster than he did. FL by 13<br/>
 4(-51)<br/>
Highs:Altering everything in sight and makeing him kill Onith like 5 times.<br/>
Lows: Im still confused on how he won the game, but i am impressed none the less.<br/>
<br/>
 Ok i shake that game off and proceed to the final game.<br/>
<br/>
  Game 6: my LS vs. Ben Fox-McCord's Trops (1677)<br/>
  My profit and Ralops are always good matchups, well usualy. so we start this game off with a bang. deploys troopers to raltirr. and a site or 2 or 3.i go put momaw nadon to the chamber(he started with mara and jabba at the chamber also), i deploy bo shuda there to and order to engage in the same turn(sweet!!)i put the casino down and draw he puts down a few more sites and deploys a few of the unique troopers down. he moves mara and jabba away and loses 3 force.on my turn i put the bacta tank out, deploy lando to the casino sabacc his ass, deploy obi w/ stick and luke with stick to the lower corridor. i am sabaccing once per turn and winning everytime. he goes an deploys to CC:Chamber...bad move...i path of least resitance luke over to there during his turn. he deploys to the casino but i barrier and he loses 3 force there. on my turn i use my other path of least resistance and bring obi over and smack him with the gift of the mentor. he kills obi though,but he loses like 11 force to battle damage cuz his guys were hit except 1.i also deployed battle plan during that turn so bth of us has to pay to drain...but i had more force so it didnt hurt me as much.he goes and uses all his force to drain for like 1 at 4 sites(i gifted R2-D2 to help with the drains).on my turn i get the hansicle and play off the edge to retrieve 15 force and pull obi from the tank...i draw and get my gift of the mentor back a few turns later...after he had killed luke...but i had 4 tracked lift tubes waiting to be used....i pull luke from the tank and redeploy both luke and obi to raltirr to stomp on vader w/ stick and a stormtrooper. i hit vader and the trooper and then i draw 6, 6, and a PolR 5 for destiny...he loses the game right there. FW by 21<br/>
 6(-30)<br/>
<br/>
 Highs:smacking people with Gift of the mentor, twice, and my dfeck working like a machine against ralops.<br/>
