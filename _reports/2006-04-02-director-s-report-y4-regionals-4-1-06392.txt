<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Yavin IV Regional 2006 -  Directors Report<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So after weeks and weeks of planning and organization, the Y4 Regional has come and gone.  This report is just meant to inform everyone of how certain decktypes performed as a whole, as well as how each player fared individually.  We had 30 players turn out for this years edition (an increase from last year) from such exotic locations as Canada, Texas, Ohio, and Tennessee.  I cant thank all of you guys enough, its this kind of dedication that keeps this game going 5 years out of print and running.  So without further ado, the report:<br>
<br>
<br>
Our tale begins with a humorous anecdote on Friday night.  Pistone and Hollingworth were driving down from New England that afternoon, and were looking to playtest some the night before.  I had to help my brother build his decks the night before as well, so I suggested that they come over to my place for a few hours.  Seems simple, right?  Well..not exactly.<br>
<br>
To minimize the chance of having them getting lost on the way over from their hotel, I suggested a rendezvous at an easily accessible high school parking lot only a few minutes away.  Well, what follows is an exciting story involving suspicious vehicle reports, police interrogations, and full car searches.  I dont believe I could do the story quite as much justice as Mike, so Ill let him fill in the details.  It was one of those things that was very intense at the time, but pretty funny afterwards.<br>
<br>
So we tested, and Pistone got pretty frustrated with the Green Leader/TRM concept, so he changed it to a more traditional TRM.  Turns out that that change would be pretty huge for him on Saturday.<br>
<br>
Well, the event got underway at around 12:18 or so, and for the most part things ran pretty smoothly.  Prizes were given out all throughout the day, and around 7:15 ish the Swiss was over.<br>
<br>
Here are the final results:<br>

<br/>
Lewis lost to Reid in the first round of the semifinals by 9, but then won with his LS against Reid by 21.  <br/>
<br/>
Pistone conceded to Stratton in the semifinals; Stratton and Lewis agreed to split the money and Lewis was given the v card design.  Congrats to all four of them for making to the top of the Swiss rankings!<br/>

One very interesting statistic that I came across while compiling all of this data is that the top 4 finishers that used WYS (v) never lost a single game with it.  Was anyone using Emperors Power (v) for dark against them?  Im honestly curious and Id like a response from anyone that knows.<br/>
<br/>
Well thats it for the data reporting, Ill leave yall to draw your own conclusions from them.  Clearly WYS (v) was the deck of the day, and itll be interesting to see what impact that has on future events.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my personal favorite deck titles of the day (that are filter-friendly) include Brad Eiers Football and crabcakes, Brandon Pahls I Drove 9 Hours to Play this Crap, and Mike Pistones  Two no Six no Twelve Bakers Dozen!  and Brian Rippetoes Bomarr Monks on Dagobah.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thats about it, I guess..$450 in cash was given out total, plus some nifty uncut sheets and booster packs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who showed, and a special thanks to Bruce and Mike at Renaissance for giving us a place to do our thing.  And thanks for putting up with everyone(some more than others. ;). )<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope you enjoyed the read, and I look forward to reading the Players Tournament Reports in the near future!<br/>
<br/>
God Bless.<br/>
