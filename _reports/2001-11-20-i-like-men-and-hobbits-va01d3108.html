<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">AAh freedomcon 01. my first ever MAJOR tourney. well now for the pre stuff from a scrub like me hehe. Me,andy and Chris McClure and Efridge e. left good ole alabama at 12 noon wendsay. along the way, we stopped at a KFC and goofed off for an hour. needless to say we didn’t get to close to VA before 1 am. after stopping at some janky motel 8 in the middle of NOWHERE, we got up psyched about worlds. leaving the middle of nowhere at around 10 eastern 9 my watch, we got to the hotel with Little to no missdirection. after arriving at the sheriton, first thing we did was say that we were here, meeting David akers(sp) himself. this guy kicks so much butt Thank you dave. checking into the motel was ok. having 6 people in your room kinda cuts down on the expensives. who you ask was in my room? well me,andy,chris,efridge Brian Rippeto and Kevin shannon,who will be explained on how he got into our room later. well not much happened that first day except I goofed off and played cards. Im not even going to mention the last man standing tourney seeing as i got booted out first round. &lt;p&gt; now the explanation of Kevin Shannon. My friend efridge was hanging out at the Box o’ crap cards, looking for some card when he walked up looking for ds gunners one thing led to another and bam. but enough of this thursday stuff now for the pre world qualifier.&lt;p&gt;friday, after building my dark deck at 4 in the morning, we had to go through the whole decklist and cards. well needless to say everything was right. now onto the matchups.hehe&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;BOBOHEADED BRING HIM VS HYPERDRIVE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt; first matchup in a world qualifier, needless to say i was nervouse as CRAP!. first turn he raced i refused to draw race destony for the entire game and just went strait to the main point, first turn Emporor at the junkyard. he drew up his first turn. second turn janus. it would have been emp and janus first turn if he didn’t start GOONETAY or as i like to call it  GAY! needless to say it went Downhill for him. he had a few characters come down, like quigon lando oobi doobie but they all got the boot from the force. empy and janus are da SHIZ!. well i just sat and drained. fw by i think 15 (hard to remember)&lt;p&gt;(+15)&lt;p&gt; Lightsaber Beats vs scum &lt;P&gt; well i started the camp cause i was expecting scum. he forgot to show his rep and i forgot to call it on him (thanks to my 1410 ratein) needless to say every character i threw down got beat. FL by like 27&lt;p&gt;(-something) &lt;P&gt; Lightsaber vs ISB(Kim style)&lt;P&gt; well i had to play my light deck next and it was against kim katan and her secret TECH! being a guy i was destracted the whole time. I dont really recall the game because i was too busy under her TECH. i lost due to frostbite and the influence of her tech and her beauty. (loss)&lt;P&gt; Bring vs proph&lt;p&gt; Ok im tired right now and you really dont want to read stuff from a scrub like me so highligtes. he conseded after he forgot he had sac in his hand against maul strikes and force lighting. the rest of my games went downhill&lt;p&gt; Overall i went 2-6 didn’t qualify.&lt;p&gt;<br/>
