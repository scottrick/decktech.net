<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I’ve taken some psychology classes, so I know some stuff about dreams and whatnot, but I don’t subscribe to any one theory.  I do know that some content of dreams comes from what your sense picked up during the day.  I bring this up cause my last report left us just as I was about to sleep after I had concocted yet another assy light deck on paper.  Ya see, I had some funky @#$% dreams, which I won’t get into cause their may be li’l uns reading, but they involved that cute girl from the Dunkin Donuts who is also in my sociology class.  XXX baby.  And then I had another one about me losing my adult teeth in a psuedo violent manner.  I dunno what that came from, but I’ve been having those sorta ones sincei had my wisdom teeth out.  For those of you who haven’t had that luxury, it sucks.  I wasn’t sedated, so I was like "Wow, they’re breaking my teeth and listening to classical music.  Cool."  But I digress.  Severely.  So dark was the same: HDADTJ with Imp commands and Visages and power, still no dueling.  Light was a pile.  I start HB w/ Staging Areas and Insurrection, then have 2 On the edges, 2 Falcons, 2 Outriders, and mains and undercover and spies for some weird reason.  Lots o’ Visage hate, like 5x OOC/TT and then 2 Run Lukes.  I dunno what the deck was supposed to do, but whatever.  I get up at 8:30 and we’re just messing around till we have to leave at 11:15.  We load up the van and I drive Travis, Eric, Steve, and my Dad who would take the car back home to That’s Entertainment in Worcester where Nick Barnes had set up the tourney.  We had 8 @#$%ing people in attendance cause no one wanted to play twice in one weekend.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Rating before the tourney is still 2131, but with 17-1 not in now.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Steve "Stevie B" Baroni’s (1792) Anti-Me Deck<br/>
This morning Steve had built his old HDWGITM deck that starts Seeking An Audience to deploy R2-D2 from the deck to get mad twixs and mains (that Kyle Craft designed) but I wrecked it in a game so he just went back to the deck he had yesterday, edited some.  That is, it’s a New Age Throne room deck with Obi-Wan’s apparition to screw HDADTJ (my deck).  Anyway he starts by deploying jeroen to the H1 docking bay, I go and drop the Downtown plaza, Carida, and Arnet (anti WYS palace raider tech) to the Ex: DB and conserved force (mara was in hand).  He draws more so I just deploy Mara, her Saber, Blizzard 2 with Chinreau aboard.  I initiate, he misses the fallen portal, I hit Jeroen, and I draw a 1 for battle destiny.  He loses 13.  Next turn he drops appiration on the holo theatre (the middle site) and obi to the Downtown plaza and a twix or two and says go.  Ouch.  Again Goo Nee Tay makes its way out, but this time Battle Plan is out from the start so its a slow game.  Eventually I get vader out and kill off his guys after some cat and mouse on CC.  Game over.<br/>
FW +20<br/>
2(+20)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: You think you can tech against me, huh? ;)<br/>
Lows: Neh, playing someone rode down with (but then again there were 4 of us, so guess who I play next...)<br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
HB Mains Pile Vs Eric "Bounty22" Hunter’s (1960) ISB Scum<br/>
I saw the objective and didn’t know what to expect so I stuck with Insight as my effect in case I needed to get Menace Fades.  On his first turn he pulls a DB, drops another, and Carida, and the palace to grab the AC.  Whoa.  Fortunatly I had Blunt in my opening 8 :)  I pull my docking bays and systems, as usual, and after he flips a get off a grimtaash for a couple ORS to see no ships so blount makes his way to coruscant on the falcon while boush goes to the palace.  He drains me a little and deploys more guys, running away from boush I follow into the AC.  I invade the chamber by putting down EPP leai, and JK luke w/ Stick where he has puny jabba, chall, and 3 or 4 ORS.  I clear out most of the guys leaving only chall and and ors left while attri kills leai.  I dunno if my bro thinks he’s invincible or what, but he initiates against luke and I hit a guy and draw a 6 so he loses everyone and some force.  My turn I cancel Scum, and I get another beatdown in there.  Most of the time I jsut drain in the AC, and avoid his sandwhirls while OTE does it’s thing.  Eventually blount gets killed sitting alone on the falcon, but by then dash has helped me get Menace working.  Some late game skirmishes made it closer, but on the edge was my friend for the day.<br/>
FW +18<br/>
4(+38)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Neh. Trampling Leai like 2 times?<br/>
Lows: Him never drawing None Shall Pass.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
HB Mains Pile Vs Karl Sundberg’s (1935) EOPS<br/>
This was a hellofa game.  He start IAO, Mobil Poins, and SSP, I start the usual with Menace Fades.  He just deploys locations and draws.  I do the same hoping he would put a lone Imp to the bunker because I had Blount, 2 Jk Lukes, his saber, DTF, and Frozen assets in my openiing 8.  I think he saw my deck while I was playing Eric so he knew better.  Eventually I get impatient so I put blount and luke in the bunker, so he drops the FshipE and Admiral Chinreau and Merrejek and Guri at sullust.  He never gets rumors up.  We play the "how many cards do you have in hand because I may or may not be holding a monnok/grimtaash in mine" game for a long while, but my deck is very much red, and I needed blue for Menace.  I attempt to beat down the Chimaera with Thrawn and someone on it with a power 9 outrider (wasn’t able to draw cap’n han yet) and the DTF/FA combo, but it doesn’t do me much.  I just keep wishing I hadn’t cut Battle Plan as we play cat and mouse in space with Lateral Damage often acting as the Cheese.  Menace is working the whole game and he doesn’t attempt to confront me at the Endor DB.  I waste my Edges early with tracked 5s, not thinking I could save them till I had a 6 tracked.  This was kinda good because later he monnoked me for 2 Obis and 2 Clashes.  He saw UFury so he knew better than to put vader down.  Alas, my 2 ships weren’t enough to defend the 5 or 6 systems that were out, so despite menace fades he was making things very close.  Finally he sorta gets some ground out using my DBs to drain me at, and things are getting tight.  I’m forced to initiate losing battles for the DTF bonus, but I stupidly move my ground forces so i no longer control a battle ground site and he finishes me off with a whopping drain of 9, then initiates to use my own DTF against me.<br/>
FL -4<br/>
4(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Such a damned good game.<br/>
Lows: I have a headache.  Losing has that effect on me.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Eric "Bounty22" Hunter’s (1960) AITC Harvest Pile<br/>
This game was over before it began.  Eric made this deck out of desperation.  I just started activating alot early, and I was able to satisfy Battle Plan and beat him down on the ground early causing some major force loss that he was unable to come back from.  He attempted to take on my Lord with stick with his EPP obi and i drew very well and he didn’t.  I even set up S+D at one point, but late game owen and beru reared their ugly old heads and retrieved around 20 force.  Visage did my work and the drains were too much.<br/>
FW +25<br/>
6(+69)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Check the dif, and think of Dunkin’ Donuts.<br/>
Lows: Playing (and beating) my beloved brother again.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Karl Sundberg’s (1935) EBO MonCal Cruiser Deck<br/>
By this time it was getting latish.  Like maybe 5:30 or so, and it was getting dark.  Now, despite the fact that the store has some cool merchandise the place, like many comic stores, is a dump, so in addition to the heat not working properly the lights in the area we were in didn’t really work.  Yay.  So I start YCHF and get S+D set up with Mara and vader each with their sabers at the D*:DB and CC: downtown plaza.  Between that, my mulitple visages, and his elusive TT/OOCs I was able to get a huge lead.  I was even able to squeeze off a couple of drains in space with chinreau before he got EBO up!  But then TK and Boush joined the party and i couldn’t draw a trample to save my life.  Eventually i missed a sniper with lord at TK, but i was able to trample boush w/ a tracked 6 and my S+D kept working.  In the end we had a couple big space battles but my imp commands and such kept me ahead.  He came back with some big drains and the lack of sleep and light made my now splitting head ache incredibly worse as i watched myself make some incredibly stupid errors.  I hung on for the win.<br/>
FW +6<br/>
8(+ 54)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: S+D<br/>
Lows: I suck.<br/>
<br/>
6:30 roles around and the store says get out, so we are forced to call our tourney short.  Though I wanted another win I was glad to stop.  So I came in first by differential, proving now beyond a single doubt that HUNTERS are incapable of losing tournaments.  For my efforts I recieved another RII box topper and a couple of packs I used to complete a trade.  We divied up the ride since no ones parents were expecting us to be done then and weren’t there, and we went home.<br/>
