i don’t know what today’s date is and all i know is that this tournament happend the day before fathers day. the week before my bro and i where at ramapo then we crashed so we both had the same decks..then the night before we get a calll form mike pistone asking if he could sleep over and then play the next day. we say sure so i make the dark deal deck. we playtest i can’t get it to work, so i go to bed at 11:30 with a good light deck and no idea for dark... i actualy decided not to play. the next morning i find my old maul deck in good shape, just missing like 8 cards. i throw in the shaft so i can do some good in space. don’t even look at my light and go to the tournament at 12. 3 minutes later we are there and i find out hayes was going to play so i was surprised at that. anywho we have 24 people and we start things off.<br/>
<br/>
game 1 vs. dan mauiliox’s revo force choke, that looks like haye’s pile.<br/>
<br/>
instead of combat readiness for jabba’s palace which would be converted so i just get the ac. i get crap in hand and he started uh-oh, the camp and anti sac efect so that hurts all my charecters and my 4-4 sac package. i just draw up, getting my jp(i play 2 incase opponent may convert my jp) he activates, revo’s my maul site and plays some twixes and lets me go. i just deploy some jp sites and draw. eventualy i get down janus to my jp and alter his revo, play maul for free with saber and move him over. he comes down with obi, qui-gon, jedi luke and i think someone else but i baried obi. on his turni believe i clear the site(i stole wui-gons saber with maul) and all i have is janus left. from here i get the shaft on wedge and that does 4 a turn for a while, the he gets honor out, he drains for 2 a turn ocasionaly and we are in a stall mate, he can only force dain for 2, i do 2 a turn, eventualy he spreads to thin, i deul obi with maul and i take out qui-gon. also i eventualy smack corran horn for the game. i win by 5.<br/>

<br/>
game 2 vs steve anderson’s bhbm.<br/>
first turn he forgets to activate so that slows him down. i get down a ship to tat and let him go. he gets emperor to the d*2 db and lets me go. i flip with han to the cantina and he only activates 8 force a turn cause my objective. well anyway he just gets things going very slowly and i see it’s bhbm 7’s. i just start to drain and smack down choke vader, and keeping luke away form vader.i just drain and battle him out, not much happend this game.<br/>

game 3 vs. steve baroni qmc<br/>
i get a good start with maul to his stie first turn the a elis over to cloud city. he gets outrider to his cc first turn. i just drain and draw up. he just draws i believe. i get out some more guys to cc and let more jp site out. he puts down melas to a cc site and wedge in ship to bespin to set up menace fades. i come down and smack melas for 7 overflow after sensing his path, though he started the anti sac efect. he gets out battle order and another guy and i just go an take him out. he just keeps on coming down with guys and does off the edge once when he had 2 5’s a 1 and a 2,targeting epp leia. he draws a 5! bah, he said he took he risk cause he needed the charecters cause i had done a lot of dmage early.so anyway he flips and gets celabration up, he does anothe off the edge and retrieves 5.i have roc on wedge in space and hace ships there to satisfy batle plan and to stop menace fades. thgough he sorry about the mess’s one of my ships. i don’t have much anger out though and we both are low in force but he has moer cause of celabration and off the edge. i take out epp leia at the carbonite chamber for 4 overflow with xizor and fett but i lose xizor by actident instead of fett. on his turn he somes down and beats up fett for 10 overflow to win the game... if i had lost xizor it would of been only 2 overflow and i would of been able to mabye get the complete shaft out and win.anyway it was a good game.<br/>

first turn he just draws up after putting down a db. i get mirax to tat first turn and let him go. he gets merijek to the executer db and pulls a system. i put melas at my cantina to slow his activation down. he gets out the executer to fondor and puts some guys on it, he has a bunch of stytems out now too.i get dash and artoo in the outrider at tat. he also gets tempest 1 with 3 ors inside it to my spaceport db. i come down with 2 smuggelers and battle, triple, run luke run, he loses that and 11. i just drain and since i have batle plan out he dosen’t drain always. i start draining at his sytems and he deploys zuckuss in ship to where i have mirax and arto in side pulsar skate, i just barrier. anyway a few turns later i have outrider, arto, dash, mirax, lando in falcon, and theron nett with gun vs. zuckuss, bosk, exectter and some other sd. i battle, tripple, shoot down zuckuss, powerpivot executer, reduce bosk, arto i have bad feeling. he has 42 batle damage. he loses everything. next turn i drain him out.<br/>

highs: winning against a really good deck<br/>
lows:none<br/>
<br/>
game 6 vs.  jim valerie isb w/ forced servitude<br/>
well he gets merijek to execture db first turn, and pulls a sytem. i flip first turn and he goes. he just eats drains and gets more sytems outeventuayl he builds up one one of my db’s with a walker and like 4 probe droids, and playes forced servitude. which is like a savrip but only works with driods, he moves executer to sullust i think. needless to say i do battle with 75 battle damage on my turn vs the executer, but he still has 3 cards left cause of force servitude.next turn i drian him.<br/>
