<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">We get back from denny’s and we laugh at the big fat stupid b!tch, but we realize its 12:00 and we got to built or deck for tomorrow because people will expect the dagobah direct damage.<br/>
So we get back to the hotel, Raphael decide he will kept the Dagobah deck because its a machine and even if people expect it it will still do is job, but iam sure that people will start resistance and will play a lot of projective telepathy,<br/>
so i built a new deck i have play 1 game with...the MACHINE KILLA! 2 i wont get into detail since i have post it here, Dom built the same deck but is afraid of duel so i say instead of endor:db put tat:db + ben kennobi and he like it, and we decide for meta choice to take out great warrior because we didnt expect huge ds drain deck DOH!.<br/>
for ds i keep the same deck with a few meta change dom do the same but raphael take out all the sac..WATH! the goal of this deck is play huge amount of sac, but he want to catch people of guard and i think maybe it might be a good choice but i prefer to keep the sac.<br/>
so we go to bed at 3:00am and i felt asleep like a baby.<br/>
<br/>
DAY 3: top 12...who’s the man<br/>
game 1 The MACHINE KILLA! 2 vs Paul Todd Feldman brangus glee superstar with a lot of change<br/>
he start resistance so the plan work...he start kicking my butt<br/>
( like always MWYHL deck are slow but when the machine start working nothing can stay infront of it wihout getting kill)<br/>
and when i first play throw me another charge he grab it:) he look at my deck and he feel stupid because he grab a useless card<br/>
so after that i set up super falcon against, chimera+suckass in boat+bossk in boat+bob in boat after the big fight nothing stay execpt for super falcon.<br/>
At turn 8 he got nothing on table and iam drainning for 5<br/>
win by 23<br/>
<br/>
game 2 The MACHINE vs Matt Sokol strange x-wing deck with odd but no luke?<br/>
i put pressure on him drain for alot since turn 1 i knew what was is hidden base( its all about experience:)<br/>
go for the probe win by 15 but got 18 card in hand<br/>
<br/>
so now iam 2-0 but start to feel nervous because i dont want to scrub out like last year 3-1 and missing the final by 5 card:(<br/>
<br/>
game 3 The MACHINE vs Martin Falke (same deck as yesterday)<br/>
got some very unlucky draw and iam unable to put pressure until turn 5<br/>
so he get a good feet on ground and dont pay for battle order but i got hard time finding ship, but when i found my ship and alter i go for the probe and alter OMDH<br/>
i got the win by 6 but with 21 card in hand:(<br/>
<br/>
last game iam very exited but nervous because last year i was first after 3 but after losing to Steven Lewis by 4 card i miss the final <br/>
and i dont want the same thing to happen<br/>
<br/>
game 4 The MACHINE KILLA! 2 vs Dominic Gaudrault( my padawan ) with The MACHINE<br/>
i got the machine so i win<br/>
but he got unlucky in the second turn<br/>
he got Emperor and janus at &lt;&gt;:db and i got jedi pimp with beetstick in from of god and the puppet<br/>
he go get a db but he dont have any so i look at the deck and see is 4 vader in it:) so he cannot run and cannot capture the pimp<br/>
so i said to my head i going to beetdown him next turn but he pay 1 force with janus to get a card and guess what card he drew? yeah! your right the big juicy fat mother f*cker....lord i s*ck c0ck because iam a lucky b!itch vader:(<br/>
so he grab luke and ther no beetdown for me and he start putting pressure on me( i play so many time MWYHL that i never felt the pressure ds try to put on me)<br/>
so after a few turn i get control of the game and <br/>
win by.....it doesnt matter by how many i won (i hate the rock but i had to say it:)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so i made it but dom dont so i hope Raphael won to have a all Québec final but Raphael also lose:(<br/>
We will have to wait for next year.<br/>
<br/>
so i play Sokol but iam afraid of is ds since i took out great warrior:(<br/>
<br/>
game 1 <br/>
bla bla bla iam looking all the game for ship but draw late game i won by 20 not as much as i want<br/>
and even with a luke in is deck i would i won no matther what you said<br/>
+20<br/>
<br/>
game 2<br/>
i was in control of the game when he have 20 card in is reserve so if i draw all my card i win since i finnish first,<br/>
but since iam in control of the game i decide to play it to the end<br/>
( and for all of you who said he could have play a use interrupt are moron because is deck was oriented to avoid battle and hide so the only card he could play was, Master full move, twilek advisor and abyssin ornement, but he dont have force left,<br/>
and he could not play card like shocking revelation or ommi box because those card are for oriented battle deck to track and draw good in battle, so those card have no place in is deck)<br/>
so he won by 25 iam a scrub he is world champ and he deserve it because it took the deck that nobody expect and play those to perfection.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so i suck big time but since i finish 3 last year and second this year so d-con 2001 will be mine and nobody will take it from me<br/>
so if you want to waste time next year just go to d-con to have your a$$ kick by me<br/>
<br/>
after we go celabrate to the worse buffet ever see world EVERY THING SUCK THERE exept for free beer and hard as rock chocolate cookie<br/>
so we get a few beer get or trophie and go back to the hotel for more beer<br/>
Back at the hotel i decide not to play in team tourney since i play card all weekend and i want to relax at the pool with my girldfriend Nancy( she is the best girld a ccg player can have, iam a lucky bastard)<br/>
at the bar every body want to pay me beer that fine with me even if i feel unconfortable with it and i feel like a cheap mother f*cker<br/>
after 11 beer i start to feel the alcohol in me and decide to go to bed since its 3:00am<br/>
<br/>
next morning i go get my price 3 box of japaness:) (2 premiere, 1 hoth)<br/>
got pretty good box 2x luke, 2x han, 1x obi, 1x tarkin, 2x vader saber, 1x obi saber<br/>
so no vader:( and i got more useless card then usefull and only 5 sac card <br/>
<br/>
after that i got to catch my flight at 7:00pm and get back to Montréal<br/>
