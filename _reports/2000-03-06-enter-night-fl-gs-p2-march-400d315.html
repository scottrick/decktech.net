<br/>
 Game 4 : ' The Wretched' v. Leonard Mitchell's Tatooine<br/>
Celebration deck...<br/>
<br/>
Start : CotVG w/ 3 Effect thing. Obi's Hut ,convert <br/>
Audience Chamber. Ok. First off this was probably my<br/>
best game of the day ... the Slugfest with Ira were <br/>
maybe a miniscule under this game.  He deploys Tawss Khaa<br/>
to the Jundland Wastes ( his ) and draws up. I go and get<br/>
my Docking Bays while I drop Hutt Smooches to my objective<br/>
for damage. He hits me a few times with the drain of 2 before<br/>
I set up Battle Order and the game starts moving along. <br/>
He deploys Cantina , Mos Eisley , Tatooine system ,<br/>
and one more random.tatooine.site and sets up Celebration<br/>
with Gold Leader and Wedge I think. So here's the setup : <br/>
AChamber ( He won't go here ) , Entrance Cavern , Jabba's <br/>
Palace , Sarlacc , Hut , Eisley , Cantina , Tatooine. I <br/>
decide to try to stop his moving Harc Seff , EPP Luke , <br/>
and Tawss Khaa by tempting an Elis... BTW he has like +20<br/>
cards in hand so he grapples it and Senses it ( Loses 2 <br/>
more ) , I play another one and it gets through but he <br/>
Nabruns them all away back to like Mos Eisley ( Next time<br/>
Gadget ). He also has Boussh out but he keeps forgetting to<br/>
move her and stuff so he decides to make her useful. I <br/>
decide to strike up at the system. Zuckuss in Hunter , an <br/>
Outer Rim Scout , and Rappertunie go up the Tatooine system<br/>
to beat up on the Gold Leader. He throws some junk up there<br/>
but here is the basic situation he has a drain of 4 <br/>
( Cantina and Jundland Wastes ) , Celebration for 2 , and <br/>
Order to Engage is out. I have Zuckuss in Hunter , ORS , <br/>
and Rappertunie up at Tatooine , Jabba Boelo and 4-LOM a <br/>
Jabba's Palace , Mara Jade w/stick Evazan Sy Snootles and <br/>
like Brangus at Entrance Cavern , and enough musicians at <br/>
the Audience Chamber to hold it. He puts down like Lando in<br/>
Falcon , Tantive 4 , and some pilots to help up in space. <br/>
They knock off Rappertunnie and my Outer Rim Scout <br/>
and he puts a Gimer Stick on Boushh after breaking cover <br/>
and moves Boushh to the 'Ley Jabba no boder' site ( Jabba <br/>
,4-LOM , Boelo ). Hmm. He also has Tatooine Celebration out<br/>
but is at least paying for Secret Plans. He knocks out my <br/>
ORS and Rapster and retrieves and then it is my turn. <br/>
I finally get a few good shots of Un Harc Seff-able drains<br/>
in so he is starting to take some solid damage. I decide <br/>
to take the 3 on the chin and land the Zuckuss in Hunter <br/>
at the Le Jabba No Boder site. He does his drains and junk<br/>
but he is in trouble now and he thinks the space system is <br/>
safe. He starts dropping down Jereon Webb and other pilots<br/>
he had up there to get more force for Celebrating. Hehe...<br/>
I remember I retrieved Fett in his ride a few turns back so<br/>
I activate about 7 force... deploy Fett from Reserve with <br/>
the Objective battle ...retrieve 3 Force , draw a 5 to take<br/>
down another ship , and then bring up the SUPA SHIP. <br/>
Remember that Zuckuss in Hunter that landed well now he has<br/>
4-LOM , Boelo , Jabba , and an Outer Rim Scout (translation<br/>
: 2 destinies , 7 power , cancel your destiny) that spells<br/>
doom for him. I get to drain for free and he holds the <br/>
system for maybe 2 or 3 more celebrations but I've got him<br/>
now. I just made Boussh useless again because if she <br/>
moves over she'll get destroyed by Mara Jade and company.<br/>
He shuttles EPP Luke and Boussh up to the system but they <br/>
go down pretty quickly with me drawing 2 destinies and <br/>
such.  I also throw Chell Bekan out to battle Harc Seff and<br/>
retrieve 3 more while he loses 1. In the end I manage to <br/>
eek it out by 8. Win by 8 . Record : 6 ( +22 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Excellent game my  best game of the weekend.<br/>
Lowlights : Nothing really.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 : ' The Fragile' v. Hugh Shelton's Tatooine <br/>
Occupation<br/>
<br/>
Well he starts Tatooine and Security Precautions and I <br/>
start everything And grab Wise Advice. I go get systems <br/>
and get my generation up Very quickly while he deploys the<br/>
Jundland Wastes and later puts A PotF on it so that is when<br/>
I decide I can commit Luke and Obi To the Wastes while on<br/>
later turns I re-inforce it with Jeroen Webb , Tawss Khaa ,<br/>
and Corporal Beezer. The first time he attacks it with <br/>
Choke Vader , Mara , Tarkin , and Dengar to which I lose <br/>
Beezer to a choke and Tawss gets hit by Dengar , I slash <br/>
Tarkin and Dengar and attrition out Mara. I play Gift of <br/>
the Mentor for multiple destinies but he plays Boring <br/>
Conversation Anyway which I grapple just in case. Here is<br/>
somethingI have a Skywalkers in hand and I play Tunnel <br/>
Vision and see EPP Leia in there so I grab her and look at<br/>
my hand again and see that my Skywalkers is gone ! WTF ?<br/>
I'm a bit baffled and guess that I put it into my Active<br/>
Pile so I just deploy Leia anyway and battle Versus Vader<br/>
and beat him down for him and like 5-6 after him which<br/>
Would've been much worse with the Skywalkers. He deploys<br/>
U-3PO To the Wastes to shut down my drains so I throw the<br/>
Falcon to Kashyyyk for the deploy -2 for Cpn Han and throw<br/>
EPP Leia with him. Later he comes after me with Vader , <br/>
Veers , Brangus , and a few others but gets another Gift <br/>
from the Mentor which clears them out again. He gets<br/>
The Devastator  down at Tatooine or some where and I <br/>
deploy Order to Engage and start chasing him around while <br/>
I track A Few Manuevers and Play On the Edge to retrieve <br/>
back 5 force each time. He runs the Devastator To Dagobah<br/>
and probes but I tell him to take the probe card because <br/>
it can only be 2-8 parsec but with Dagobah Rules he can't <br/>
deploy to Dagobah so he has to eat the 3 to Order to Engage<br/>
and so I keep following the Devastator around and hit him<br/>
for probably like 12 force before he probes the right <br/>
system . I It Could Be Worse the damage and keep rolling <br/>
after him. Eventually he battles and Ghhhks but I play<br/>
Legendary Starfighter which hurts him some more before he<br/>
is dead. Not much he could do this game. Win by 20-26 I <br/>
think. <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Deck working fine. <br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Beating a friend of mine pretty badly right after <br/>
coming Back into the game. He didn't really have a chance <br/>
this whole game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 : 'The Wretched' v. Clint Hays' Clackdor 7 Ops<br/>
<br/>
Heh. He starts normal Op stuff and I start Court with B O.<br/>
I'll summarize this from EPP Luke's point of view since he<br/>
was deployed 3 times. First time he walks into the Audience<br/>
Chamber but notices a cut in his arm so he can't swing his<br/>
saber and just takes out the ORS who was anxious to plunder<br/>
his weapon for sale on the black market, next time he was <br/>
deployed he slashed Jabba and took out another musician <br/>
before dying this time. Last time he is deployed  he is a <br/>
bit too overconfidenthe is wise to Clash Fett and hits<br/>
someone with his stick and attrition but he should've <br/>
known some serious smackdown was gonna be coming<br/>
when I didn't draw battle destiny. Sometimes not drawing<br/>
battle destiny is Tech versus EPPs J Well lets just say<br/>
EPP Luke might've had his weapon when he was obliterated<br/>
But it wasn't in his handit was probably stuck where the<br/>
Double suns of Tatooine never shined. Win by 26.<br/>
Record : 10 ( +70 ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Pretty much everything.<br/>
Lowlights : putting serious smackdown on a bud. <br/>
<br/>
So I go 5-1 with +70 differential and get 4th place which<br/>
Is good for the Uncommon sheet of Premiere for Light Side.<br/>
Charlie Herren came in 1st with Throne Room Mains and <br/>
Ralltiir Ops. After the tournament we go to the Holiday<br/>
Inn and play like 8 hours of video game between me ,<br/>
Lee , Dan , Charlie Herren , Ira , and Andreas. Charlie<br/>
Was the only one who got any sleep. HehI have to<br/>
Tell you guys about the Holiday Inn's little bar called<br/>
The Austin Texas Steakhouse Saloon ;)  Ira told me the<br/>
Miami crew would be in there so I'm going in there <br/>
Thinking I'll spot them or anybody I know. I don't see<br/>
Them and I start to notice that people are staring at me<br/>
And Dan because we are underage. So I feel a little<br/>
Weird and go to the bar and get a menu. The guy says<br/>
We have to go sit somewhere else because we are minors.<br/>
You guys ever see that famous painting where there is<br/>
Starcases going everywhere and you really can't tell<br/>
Where the ceiling is ? Well this place has 3 levels and<br/>
Is like that because there is staircases going everywhere<br/>
And mirrors so it is crazy lookingif you were drunk<br/>
There you'd never find the exit. So me and Dan collapse<br/>
Into a booth seat and watch an old Party of 5 while there<br/>
Is a band playing. Watching Jennifer Love Hewitt with<br/>
No sound is TECH. We crack a few jokes and the<br/>
Waitress comes up there. Heh Dan is his usual wise<br/>
Ass self and after awhile I find that the waitress is <br/>
Hitting on himhe's like 15-16 hell I don't even know<br/>
But he looks younger and she was like old enough to be<br/>
His mother so I was cracking up about it later.  And<br/>
I was able to meet a bunch of people. Old people that I<br/>
Was able to see for the first time in a long time was Hugh<br/>
Shelton and Mitchell Velasco. New faces were John Arendt ,<br/>
Leonard Mitchell , and $cott Anderson. <br/>
<br/>
Props : <br/>
-Leonard Mitchell , Ira Myers , and Clint Hays for the <br/>
      super games. <br/>
-All the cool people I was able to meet. <br/>
-Having Fun and doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Slops : <br/>
- Getting no sleep.<br/>
- Not having Traffic Control in which would've given me<br/>
Another 30 points of differential but I still wouldn't <br/>
Have gotten 2nd place so I didn't really care. <br/>
<br/>
And to finish off the whole TR with my favorite quote of <br/>
The weekend : <br/>
<br/>
'I'm sitting across from the man Decipher fears the most<br/>
[Ozymandias] and he is wearing a Mickey Mouse T-Shirt'.<br/>
-Clint Hays at the start of Game 4. <br/>
