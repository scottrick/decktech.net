<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay this is the Mirkwood report (Look Stimmed Jim I dated it too)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pre-crap, I haven’t written one of these in a while since I have been sucking for the last month, and I don’t enjoy reliving a suckfest (well sometimes, but not a star wars suckfest).  So sorry if tis is not up to my usual standards, all but one of the games were very short, but I will try as best I can to give good detail.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My TR mains, vs. Matt Moses and his Court<br/>
<br/>
Okay Matt was always a competetive player, then he quit playing for a while, and this is his first tourney in a long time.  I wasn’t sure what to expect.  First turn I do the usual General stuff (Crix and Walex) to a DB, then leave the force (I have Luke and Han EPP versions in my hand)  I take 1 from court.  His turn he puts Mighty Jabba down to the AC and says go.  My turn Luke comes to visit Jabba, no none shall pass, whew, then Han, then KFC.  Battle Kill Jabba (Fat boy can’t dodge a lightsaber) he loses Jabba and 10 force, I lose KFC.  Next turn down comes Boelo Snoova and a vibro Axe.  Battle, he captures Luke.  Han shoots at snoova to save his friend, and hits the smell of burning wookie flesh fills the air.  He draws a 0 for BD, and I lose about 5 force to keep Han there, Luke is free, and he doens’t have the force to move Boelo.  Myh turn deploy Cracken to Tat. DB, deploy Bacta Tank, battle beolo, he loses about 10 force, move the Generals to Tat. DB, and say go.  He deploys Ree-Yees and Niado to Carkoon, and says go.  Suicide Obi comes down and clears them out, then he takes a bath.  that was pretty much the end of the game, I just drained him out, and let court so its thing.<br/>

Game 2 my HD duel fakeout vs. Nick from ST. Cloud and his WYS<br/>
<br/>
Okay let me preface this by saying that WYS will be erratted soon, the card is too powerful.  This game was short and sweet.  He got set up really early, and cancelled Visage early.  When I tried to do something cool and have Barquin D’an and Xixor attack a lone Palace raider ona craft, a door fell on xixor, and the poor bith couldn’t stop that smuggler from kicking his a.s.s.  When I move in front of his drains, I couldn’t draw a good enough destiny to chop luke, and I kept losing guys to attrition.  In the end He OtEdged for about 10 to add to this diff.<br/>

Game 3 vs. the new guy with the Hat (wow I suck at names) and his WYS.<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game wasn’t even fun.  This guy was very new, and there was only one battle of note.  Early on he put Melas and Talon in the cantina to battle Choke Vader and Iggy with Jizz machine.  I missed on the choke and the shot, but for some reason he only drew 1 destiny. so Iggy dies, and so does Talon.  My turn Tarkin and Ponda Baba kill Melas with a choke so I don’t have to lose anything (he barriered Tarkin) and I spread out onto the Tat. DB.  Next turn I put out S+D so he is losing 2 force every turn, he has kessel ran with Theron from Tat (wtf??) and finished one, Zuckuss with 4-lon as a passenger stop his space crap really quick, and the direct damage kills him off.<br/>

Game 4 my LS vs. Nick and his HD dueler.<br/>
first card I draw is OOC/TT so no visage for him. Okay on first turn I got to verify his deck so I knew it wasn’t odds, and that helped.  I just bided my time.  He had Vader, Mara and Janus at the DS DB.  I deploy Leia and Han with Guns and Chewie Protector, battle, Waepon lev. Vaders Saber.  He YAB’s Leia.  I shot at Janus and miss, he chops Han, I draw 6 in BD, he loses Mara w/ stick, I lose Han and Chewie.  but draw more of them.  Luke w/saber is hanging at the CC DB while this is going on.  HIs turn he jsut draws.  My turn leia gets some backup, and Janus dies a firey deat, while Cracken covers attrition.  He moves Vader to facve Luke, I have Courage, and 2 fives out of 3 cards, plus Run Luke Run, but he doesn’t duel.  I ballte, chop vader, and Luke dies.  He deploys Emperor to Exec. Med Chamb.  (the other exec. sites were revoed) I deploy another LUke along with home 1 Launching the assault and Hassh’n to Rendilli.  He deploys Zuckuss to Endor and gives me the drain of 2.  Late game he drops Vader with Empy and moves them to the holotheatre to try and drain me.  Obi w/stick and 3 straight 5’s say hell no, chop palpy, kill vader with attrition, and that was game. I drain him out from there.<br/>
