<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well after a mad long night out, i got in around 4am or so. Now simply lost as to how i am going to wake up in time to drive down to Long Beach to pick up my boy Bill. But i somehow manage to do it, i wake up around 9:10. Jump in the shower, and race out the house headed towards Long Beach. Thank g*d that there were no cops on the parkway, cause if i was pulled over while goin 85mph, it would have been over. I get Bill and we head straight over to TRI-County, and get there like a quarter too 11. <br/>
Now this is the first tourney i am in since like january this year... I am plenty confident in my game play, i was just more worried about stayin awake the whole time i was there. Well i managed, and while i was at it i managed to just clean house with a tourney winning finish of 8(+147), allowing me to walk away with a foiled Emperor (which i gave to my boy Bill who needed it badly)<br/>
First Game:<br/>
(my High Destiny Huntdown with Podracing VS. Sam Diamond???(maybe his last name) QMC mains/cloud city sabacc)<br/>
Well this game lasted all of what, 15 mins??? Real clear on what and how it went down. First turn Vader with Lightsaber deploys to his Cloud City: Casino, Second Emperor comes down to back up Vader, Third turn Mara joins the crew with her saber of course, Fourth turn podracing is over and he losses 11. The game was never in his favor, it just was not happening. Biggest move he made was ruined by me sorry about the mess luke with saber, leaveing Leia with gun and Qui Gon to be beaten down by Vader, Emp, and Mara... Visage picks away at him, and with in moments the pain has ended.<br/>
FW 2 (+28)<br/>
Highlights:winning sabbac and getting his falcon<br/>
Lowpoints:none really that i could find<br/>
<br/>
Second Game:<br/>
(my RST/Podracing VS. Wayne Cullen Endor Ops Death Star II)<br/>
Well after objectives were shown, it became obvious that Strike Planning was gonna be very little good to me to start. So i scrap it back in the deck and grap The Shield Is Down!, after all he activates for Endor no matter what. Ok, another quick game this one lasts like maybe 20 mins. He opens by deploying Moff from DSII to the bunker and Endor shield as well. I go and find the Back Door, drop it and Jedi Luke then move Luke over to the bunker. He had no back up at the time, so was forced to move away. Only to have Qui Gon with saber dropped on him, resulting in a ten card loss. Qui Gon moves over with Luke, and a few turns later the bunker is blown away. A turn or two after that or before that (maybe) i win the podrace... Not really much he could do at this point. Game is done at most three turns later, a full win by 39.<br/>
FW 4 (+77)<br/>
Highlights:the deck just working as quick and powerfully as it did<br/>
Lowpoints:another flawless victory<br/>
<br/>
Third Game:<br/>
(My RST/Podracing VS. Chris Wod!cka False Start SYCFA mains with Podracing)<br/>
Well i know Chris, to some extent, and i know that if he plays a style he backs it up. So when i saw him start podracing, i got a little worried. This game lasted somewhat more than the last two games i played. Not much longer, but longer. We both spent the first few turns setting up, for me that meant pretty much finding a dam A Step Backwards or two. Drawing one of them for podracing destiny you would think would not be a good thing, but ended up helping me to win. Due too a unfortunate draw in my favor, his race total did not beat mine. Now the only reason this was, was because i blew the bunker up before the race ended. Him losing his hand to his used pile was the end for him, if not for that brangus would have just kept grabbing those podracing interrupts to FU&lt;K up my total. So now that you see he had a force loss of 19 within two turns you can see how i took this game. Once he lost his hand i had all the time in the world. I dropped ablitity 4 characters, spread out and just drained him out the next few turns. No major battles or anything, just the long podrace due to both of us playing racing interrupts. Full win plus 32.<br/>
FW 6 (+109)<br/>
Highlights:WINNING that dam race<br/>
Lowpoints:not only having my A Step Backwards grabbed, but not being able to do anything but watch Brangus just tech me out. grabbin podracing interrupt after interrupt back into his hand, and not being able to do anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth and Final Game:<br/>
(My High Destiny Huntdown with Podracing VS. ??? some guy who i never met before WYS)<br/>
Well i saw his objective, and well to say the least i was happy. I saw no way my hunt down was gonna lose to a WYS deck, and well it went just as i expected. Vader first turn, visage which he could not cancel just ate away at him the entire game (which did not help him at all). Emperor joined vader for back up, and Mara with saber i sent to my DS docking bay (backed up by Put All Sections On Alert). He flipped his Objective for one turn the entire game, and could do nothing while it was flipped. ZIMH hit the table to bring the beats to Mirax in ship, no real card loss there but ZIMH was the only survivor in that battle. He got a few drains off at kessel, but did him no good since i retrieved it all when i finished the race. Nothing came my way to fight on the ground, he generally tried to keep it in the sky. But it was just too much, the 11 loss broke any chance he had, and visage did not help in the slightest. Full win plus 38.<br/>
FW 8 (+147)<br/>
Highpoints:ZIMH bringing one of the only battles the hole game, and clearing the table as he is supposed to do.<br/>
Lowpoints:FLAWLESS VICTORY<br/>
<br/>
So i take first along with my tired a$$ and hit the road as soon as my boy Bill is done. Not certain where he finished, but like i said he ended up with the Foil Emperor (cause i am such a nice guy). Not bad for my first tourney in 6 months... All i can say is, do we all see what this game has come too? nothing but direct damage, it is like playin burn decks. </font></td>
