<br/>
Deck intro :<br/>
<br/>
LS Deck - a LS deck. <br/>
<br/>
DS Deck - 'Bittersweet Symphony' - Musiciansbut this week I<br/>
had my grappler , Search and Destroy , and Battle Order in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : My LS versus Jason Selman's ECC Objective<br/>
<br/>
	I start my Y4 :Nudj thing and he starts the ECC <br/>
Objective (full-setup) and uses Any Methods Necessary to get<br/>
the Dengar theme. The first ten minutes all we do is deploy <br/>
stuff and draw. I put RliR1 at Bespin and save 2 for Spiral.<br/>
He drops down one of those special Obsidians and Dengar in <br/>
Punishing One but doesn't have enough to battle. I drop <br/>
Spiral with Lt. Tarn Mison and battle. I draw a 5 to get rid<br/>
of Dengar and he draws a 4 to kill my Red Leader. His ship <br/>
flees to the Cloud sector and I get to drain him for 2 at <br/>
Bespin for awhile. I Deploy GliG1 to the cloud sector with <br/>
Bron Burs and wipe out the special obsidian. I drain him for<br/>
4 in force drains for about 2-3 turns in a row. By now he's<br/>
activating 13 and I'm activating 20. He has Expand the <br/>
Empire on the Port Town District and deployed Lando with <br/>
Lobot at the Casino and won a game of Sabaac before moving <br/>
them over with 4-Lom , Jabba , and Jodo Kast. After that I<br/>
drop Beezer on the Spiral for forfeit and Harc Seff on Gold<br/>
Leader to save hide. He drops Executor up at Bespin and <br/>
attacks my Spiral. I draw a 5  and we are equal power. I <br/>
Tunnel Vision and deploy Falcon with Cpn Han , EPP Leia , <br/>
and deploy Wedge on the Spiral and Battle. I draw a 10 in <br/>
Battle Destiny and he has to lose the Executor or 15he <br/>
tosses the Executor and I rotate the Falcon and Gold Leader.<br/>
I drop Battle Plan and he has to pay for his drains while I<br/>
do to. Finally he spreads out and leaves Lando with Lobot. <br/>
I deploy Tawss Khaa , EPP Luke , Obi-Wan , and Yoxgit to <br/>
beat down on Lando and Lobot. Draw Their Fire is deployed : <br/>
I smack up Lando , and beat them down for them and 8 after <br/>
them. I move around on the ground and since I'm not paying <br/>
for Battle Plan he can't really do anything to stop my. <br/>
Win by 26 <br/>
Record : 2 ( +18 )<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Smashing the Executor in raw power<br/>
Lowlights : Having to play cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : 'Bittersweet Symphony' vs. Brad Barfield's Fallen Portal deck<br/>
<br/>
	I start my full setup and he starts Y4 War Room and<br/>
Insurrection.  Eh ? Well First turn I drop Jabba , Scum and<br/>
Villiany , and Boelo. His first turn he deploys Obi-Wan <br/>
Kenobi w/ stick. Ok. On my turn I deploy EPP Fett and battle.<br/>
Miss Obi and he hits Jabba but he has to lose 8 or Obi and <br/>
Obi goes down. Next turn he deploys Captain Han at Bespin : <br/>
Docking Bay and is done. Ok I deploy Mara Jade and go fetch <br/>
her stick and battle. He plays  Fallen Portal but doesn't <br/>
draw high enough and Mara smacks him and takes 2 force after<br/>
that. He deploys EJP Chewbacca to the Sarlaac Pit and 4 <br/>
Musicians and Brangus Smack him. CotVGangster hits him for a<br/>
bunch of damage and I drain him away. Win by 26. <br/>
Record : 4 ( +44 )<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Not much<br/>
Lowlights : n/a<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : ' Bittersweet Symphony' v. Walter Cowart's Steven Lewis-ish Speeder Ops<br/>
<br/>
	Hmm. I've got two ways to do this. Start the 3 Effect<br/>
setup or start Battle Order. He starts Yargna and Clackdor <br/>
Ops.  I get Jabba and Scum and Villiany setup again on turn <br/>
one. I drop Rystall to chill with Jabba for free. He takes <br/>
about 6-8 points of CotVG damage the game through. He drops<br/>
an op in a speeder and pays to drain me a few times. I drop <br/>
Lyn Me and EPP Fett along with Mara and Stick , and Umpass-stay<br/>
to beat up on an op in speeder for a Houjix. He doesn't have<br/>
many sites out so after not fearing Flapped Speeders I move <br/>
Umpass and Mara with stick to the Farm. He kicks out more <br/>
locations and starts setting the sites between my characters<br/>
to separate them. He drops another speeder op somewhere else<br/>
and kicks out Luke Skywalker with the norrmal Speeder Op <br/>
combo and another Speeder and finally puts out Ops. He flips<br/>
because he's got one normal Speeder Op combo , the Skywalker<br/>
site , and a site with normal Speeder Op combo with another <br/>
speeder. I start Helroting him to death. First I move Fett <br/>
and Lyn Me to the normal Speeder Op site : drop Chall Bekan<br/>
, Rappertunie , and DUN DUN DUN EJP DENGAR !!! battle <br/>
retrieving with First Strike and Scum. I shoot the Speeder <br/>
with Dengar ! Down goes the Op and 4. Hehe. He drains me <br/>
some more and I keep tossing my Ships because there is no <br/>
battleground systems out and for some reason I don't think <br/>
one is going out. Here comes the main blow I elis Chall , <br/>
Lyn Me , Fett , and drop another character or two with Dengar<br/>
to the Skywalker site. DUN DUN DUN !! EJP Dengar , EJP DENGAR !!!<br/>
First I target the Speeder with Skywalker in itdraw a 3 hmm<br/>
play the 3-Effect thing and BOOOM ! Skywalker's Speeder is <br/>
GOING DOWN ! Dengar runs and hides behind another tree : takes<br/>
aim and BOOM ! The Operative Speeder is hit too ! After all<br/>
is said and done I lose Chell Bekan and a musician and he <br/>
loses everything. Oh yeah the Objective Flips back. This is<br/>
the first time I've ever seen the Operative Objective flip <br/>
back.  All thanks to EJP Dengar , he's a monster ! The only<br/>
way to make him eat up Speeder Ops better is to have him be<br/>
able to shoot at adjacent sites. HEHEHEHEH. EJP Dengar , EJP Dengar.<br/>
Win by 18-24. Record : 6 ( +6X )<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : EJP Dengarmusician deck getting a real test <br/>
and coming through. <br/>
Lowlights : nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : LS v. Rene Hildago's EJP Obj Deck.<br/>
<br/>
	This game goes horrible for me. I deploy EPP Luke to<br/>
the Audience Chamber and drop Order to Engage versus him. He<br/>
deploys 4-Lom , blasts Luke , and draws 2 destiny to wipe out<br/>
Luke for Luke and 3 after that. I deploy Obi's Hut and Obi <br/>
and move him over to the Tatooine : DB. I draw up a bit and<br/>
we hit each other with 1 point drains. Obi decides he is a <br/>
bit hungry and goes back to civilization for food but he is<br/>
Always Thinking With His Stomach and gets lost at the <br/>
Docking Bay , high faluting new technology and all. Well he<br/>
deploys Mara Jade with Stick and Dr. Evazan at Obi's hut to<br/>
speed the game up. I drop a new Luke , Tawss Khaa , Beezer ,<br/>
and Wedge . Say I'm gonna winWeapon Levitate the stick from<br/>
Mara , whack Mara ,and draw a 5 for destiny. He draws a 7. <br/>
Well wedge and Beezer die and Tawss and Luke live and he loses<br/>
5 after Evazan. It all went downhill after that. He has EPP<br/>
Fett , Jabba ( Big Daddy ) , 4-LOM , and IG-88 at the Audience<br/>
Chamber. I deploy Cpn Han , Jereon Webb , and Falcon at DB <br/>
to try to get Obi. Unfortunately he Elises that group to <br/>
Mr. Webb and Han's Site despite my Quite a Merc bluff. Eek !<br/>
He also drops Vader , and Outer Rim Scout and someone else.<br/>
He starts a battle.  I'm in trouble. Fortunately IG-88 Misses<br/>
Han but EPP Fett Doesn't. He draws 4 Battle Destinies ! <br/>
7 , 5 , 7 , and a 4 . Oh yeah Vader adds 1 to each of them .<br/>
He has exactly 40 power and I have to lose everything and 18<br/>
after that  ( I drew a 6 for Battle Destiny ) That pretty <br/>
much did me in. I just run around and try to hit off as many<br/>
force as I can.  At the end I line up my guys to get whacked<br/>
by his big group again. Loss by 26. Record : 6 ( +4X ) <br/>
<br/>
Highlights : the spectacular explosion of destinies , Rene<br/>
is a nice guy too. <br/>
Lowlights : I am now knocked into 3rd place which means I <br/>
don't get any of Stephan's collection and my $20 is turned <br/>
into an EPP Luke. <br/>
<br/>
Well I get 3rd and can't seem to get a tournament in which I<br/>
go undefeated but then again it is pretty tough. David Irvine<br/>
went 4-0 ( Timed win against Rene Hidalgo who won second place ).<br/>
Dave was playing Ralltiir Ops and Yavin 4 Nudj mains I guess). <br/>
I buy 3 packs of Reflections and get an R2-D2 , Princess Leia ,<br/>
and Jabba. I trade the R2-D2 to Rene for a Foil Visage and Foil<br/>
Epic Duel.  Well I believe that wraps it up from here. If<br/>
any one wants to trade for the Foil Leia let me know.<br/>
