<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This would be the sequel to my first report about Genghis Con.  <br/>
<br/>
This toury was a little more interesting because first it was a surprise tourny, we had no idea it was really going to happen, but Scott Geata from Collectormania just ran it off the fly so I was pretty happy.  We were a little worried that we wouldn’t have enough peeps because Matt Reick went off to do some battle tech stuff and 3 of the prior 10 people in the tourny went to go play in L5R tourny, but the water was about to get a little warm.  This tourny was gonna start at 7pm and we stll had a long wait but Van Melancanon came running in at around 6:30pm with late breaking news . . . <br/>
<br/>
Brian Hunter lost a game at a the Parker Tourny, and he was gonna come to Genghis with Mike McConell to hail Jesus Fire Upon us.  So this little 9 man Tourny was assembled rather quickly, Geata insisted that he play, so we had a bi round :(<br/>
<br/>
I had a BHBM Inserts and Ties, (see Steven Lewis DPC) put together but I decided I’d opt to play my baby Agents of Black Sun.  My light of course was Hidden Mains since I don’t trust my other light decks.  The Tourny soon began a little bit after 7pm.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My Hidden Mains vs. Ben Tippie’s ROPs ack!<br/>
Ya I hadn’t seen ROPs post JPSTD, and I wasn’t running Ounee Taa of course so I was a little worried, flashbacks of Brian Hunter stomping my face in with ROPs entered my brain and I started to Panic, then I realized that this was Ben Tippie :P A good player, but no Brian Hunter.  He starts it off By pulling Carida and Raltirr DB.  He plays the Biker effect on Carida and I feel an aura of hapiness sooth over me.  On my turn I set up the Activation Shop Dagobah and Hutt and Home One DB.  He plays some bikers and draws up.  I get to my turn I activate like 10+ now and I drop Jedi Luke on my Home One he moves to Raltirr after I play OTE.  Ben rplies by playing some Junk Effect on luck that makes me lose force while he is with a Biker Scout.  I can’t lose my foothold on Raltirr or Else he will Flip and that is no good but he dosn’t battle me so thats good too.  On my Turn I back Luke Up with Ben, Chewbacca Prot, and EPP Leia and move luke the hell off of Raltirr.  Ben Still refuses to Battle me, and he lose 3 to OTE.  I keep building up at his DB while luke Drains with his Stick on CC:DB.  He finally comes to Raltirr and Brings a bigger Crew to the DB with 2 Bikers on Bike, one with Blaster, Mara Jace, Barquin Dan?, and Arnet and he battles.  I play Fallen Portal and kill the Bikers, he kinda moans and Leia shoots a Barquin since I wanted a Sure Thing and I let my Power take contrl.  I win the battle by several force and he loses another 2 to Orrimarko.  After that on my turn I get Ben his Stick and move over and start making him feel the OTE pain.  Between an uncontested Luke wth Stick Drain and a massive LS Beat force I finish him off full win for me.<br/>

Game 2 Agents of Black Sun vs. Van Melancanon’s Hidden Mains<br/>
Me and him had just played today, but we switched sides.  We had played this matchup b4 and we timed out and we both had 12 force left in the deck, but he won cause I had more stuff in my lost pile.  Van does not like this deck at all so he was kinda pissed off to paly me. I start off with my set up as good as usual DB and move Xizor there Draw up.  On my second Turn I activate 11 force and play Boba Fett and 4Lom and move them all to DS: DB FLIP to 7.  He draws up a little bit on his turn and I drain him for 1 and make him lose one.  I  then Play Palpy Dengar and Jodo Kast to my other DB and grab Force Ligthning and I draw Up.  He in response to Palpy plays Ben at the Tat DB and Deploys luke with him, flipping back.  Ben Gets his Book and his Stick, this in no good for me, and he moves them to Palpy.  On my turn I deploy a Vigo with Palpy and a Guri with Xizor (Ever Paranoid of a beat down) and I battle Ben and Luke, and Van laughs and plays Fallen Portal, I laugh and sense it, I play force Lightning used on luke, he swingd at Jodo and misses, I shoot ad Luke with Dengar and is Deflected by the Book, I shoot again and hit him.  I draw destiny of 4 Van gets a 3, I lose vigo, he loses luke and before men Brings him back Palpy Says Young Fool to Luke and removes him from the game, and Van gets pissed off.  I flip back Permamently and he runs away with Ben on his turn and Supports him a bit, he rethinks his strategy and plays OTE.  I begin to Set Up each battle Ground to the point he will be losing 4 or 5 on my turns.  He then Pursues one of My DBs with a beat Crew So big I could never really hurt him, espcially without my 4Loms arms which Go Removed Quickly.  He starts moving around with me to block a drain, and I’m to scarred to battle him even with my Flip Side cause I could not find Hidden Weapons to save my life, and no Point Man in my deck.  He plays Super Falcon and I play my Space and Devour it with Zuckass, Bossk and Dengar.  We do our dance and then he gets lucky on an On The Ede Draw and thats when he wraps it up, because of his retrieval he will get 15 or so back but the Game still does not resolve, and he starts to lose his retrival.  when Scott declared 2 minutes left I had 4 cards and he had 5 and he just sat it out which  was fine, although if I had another turn it would have been over.  Time out Loss -5<br/>
<br/>
2 +19<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Hidden Mains vs. Tom Meades Huntdown<br/>
I play Tom All the time, but I was off my game after th Van Debacle, so I played like a Moron.  We both Set up Dodking Bays and meets my Ben with Saber at Tatooine and he Battle with Lord Vader with Stick, and Tarkin.  He was fellin Pretty good since we both saw that I only had a 6 3 and 1 in my deck for destinies before I recycled so when he battles I grabbed the Death Stick with Weapon Lev and then he duels.  I Draw a One and I know I’m Screwed since he’ll cancel the high one, and he cancls the 6 ack, he flips a 5 that I glance ane he flips another 5 and he Wins the @#$%ing Duel by ONE!!!! I never really recover from the loss of Ben and the 9 force hit and I never get my On The Edgese going and he finished me with the Jedi Luke Coup de Tat duel and beats me by 5.  Full Loss by 5<br/>
<br/>
2 +14<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I have just lost an ASSTON of ratings due to that so I rip up my Dagobah and get really pissed, then Scott Says I get to Play Tom with my Black Sun Agents, and I say its on!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Black Sun vs. Tom Meade’s Hidden Main’s<br/>
Tom says he does not know how to play against any Alien decks, which I think it funny cause they are problematic as hell and harder to play. So I start up My engine activate 11 on turn 2 and move Xizor Boba Fett, and Bane Malar to my DS DB.  he still dosn’t do anything about it, I make him lose some force and Deploy Guri and 4 Lom.  For Some Reason Tom feels cute and plays Jedi Luke with Stick and Han and Blaster down and he battles, this is hilarious in retrospective.  He first Swings at Guri Misses, then Bobba Fet Hidden Weapons Luke and is captured.  Han Still adds when Luke was held captive (I think but we rolled with it anyway) and Bane Copied Han and 4Lom Canceled Han and Bobba Fett Injured Han so it went like this . . . 22 power and 3 Destiny to Toms 4 power and 0 forfeit Han . . . "Somebody Call My Mama, Cause I’m about to Kill Some One up in Here" But Hunter said that Line was WAY too overused and so I drew destiny and beat poor Tom by 36 . . . Full Win and revenge for me! <br/>
<br/>
4 +50<br/>
