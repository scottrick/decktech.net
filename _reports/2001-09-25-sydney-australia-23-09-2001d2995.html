<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings,<br/>
The tournament was held on Sunday the 23rd of September, I got to Chatswood at about 9:30am and met my friends Clarrie, Jared and Stephen Waiting for our TD Rob to come. <br/>
We started to get worried when it got to 9:55 and only 6 people were here, but at 10:05 we had about 12-15 people.<br/>
We signed our sheets and the tournament was under way.<br/>
<br/>
My Dark Deck was: Agents of Black Sun, Surgeon Variant heavily modified after tatooine and coruscant<br/>
<br/>
My Light Deck was: Quiet Mining Colony, Very Solid Deck using Wedge and his Squadron armed with cannons to shoot anything that comes.<br/>
<br/>
Game One: Dark vs L. Hewitts Watch Your Step<br/>
I had played this guy many times before, i set up getting my docking bays out and then he got out Dont do that Again, which hindered my activation to 12 for a few turns, i saved up and deployed Bossk in Ship, Zuckuss in Ship and Boba Fett in Ship to tatooine system, Set for Stunned Dash Rendar, Lat Damaged Pulsar Skate battled, he lost mirax ship and 6 force. I took the catina with ig88, 4lom, aurra and a vigo and had the prince guri and dengar and the tat dockign bay and a lone emperor and the ds docking bay. i ping and drained him out. <br/>
Full Win By 7<br/>
2(+7)<br/>
Good: Winning first match and getting it over with<br/>
Bad:  Dont Do that Again<br/>
Ugly: Paying 3 to drain for a while<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: QMC vs Stephen McCallums TDIGWATT <br/>
This was to be a very interesting match up, both decks were cloud city orientated and it was going to be very interesting. Steve got his sites out and told me to go. I got 8 force and got some of my sites out and deployed Wedge in ship to bespin: cloud city. next turn i got dash to bespin, and keir sentage with x wing cannon to bespin:cc. I deployed Ill take the leader AO on table, then Phlyo Gandish at his docking bay, Qui Gon with Stick at the adjacent site and flipped. Move Qui gon to the DB and basically had a unmodifiable drain of 5 for a few turns. I deployed more epps and aliens and got CC Celbration happening. He lost his MM/EO early and wasnt able to cancel. he was to scared to come to space when i had dash and theron nett with x wing cannon at Bespin and i had Kier Sentage and Wedge in their ships. I drained him out to win by 19.<br/>
Full Win By 19<br/>
4 (+26)<br/>
Good: Excellent Match Up and Unmodifiable drain of 6 at a docking bay<br/>
Bad: Beating a Good Friend<br/>
Ugly: Steves face at a drain of 6<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: Dark vs Tyng Yann Yenns Lightside Senators<br/>
Tyng is one of the best players we got around here knowing all the rules and being very competitive. He had also won 2 games, I started out by getting my docking bays and kuat and activating a lot. He was playing starting Shmis Hut to get 3po and stuff. Unfortuneatly i was giving him no force and he only had hte senate and shmis hut for 3 turns. He got obi wans hut and the city outskirts a few turns later. I monnoked early and got two valorums and two senator palpatines which cost him an early senate flip.<br/>
 i had flipped for a few turns and was ping and drain at coursacant docking bay and ds dokcing bay. he started battle plan so i was happy to pay and he couldnt afford to. he then came down to death star docking bay with jar jar obi wan padawan learner and stick agaisnt my xizor guri and vigo. on the previous turn i had looked at my reserve deck (with my objective not cheated) and saw a 6 and a 5 on the top. so he initiated battle and jar jar bombed on my xizor, he played losing track to put my prepared defenses on my reserve deck but he drew a 3 for destiny so xizor lived, then i played Set for stun on Obi wan and of course drew a 6 to his horror, it then became jar jar vs the rest. i drew my 5 for battle destiny and was power 19 to his 3. he lost jar jar and 13 force. that was the match winner for me, he lost too much and i won the game by 34 cards.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 34<br/>
6 (+60)<br/>
Good: SET FOR STUNNING Obi Wan Padawan Learner<br/>
Bad:  Have Drains Cancelled cause of stupid senators<br/>
Ugly: Jar JAr vs Prince Guri and Vigo<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: QMC vs Lucianos Court Deck<br/>
Luciano was playing a court deck that he lent to a friend a tournament ago, so i had some idea how the deck went, i won then and was hoping to win now. Lucaino is a very solid player and thinks well. he set up in the court, i got a very good start getting keir, ship, wedge, in the opening hand and set up on bespin for 4 force !!!. got 2 sites out and flipped on the turn. i was losing to court every turn but i just got on with my game instead of comign to tatooine which is what he wanted. i got battle plan and menace fades set up real quick so i shut him down. I set up on cloud city nicely and gave my x wings 2 cannons, and i got ill take the leader out and controlled 4 sites with pucimir on table. he came down to bespin with stinger zuckuss and dengar and i tried to shoot the stinger and got a 1 again i got a 1. he drew a 0 and 5 which i canclled thank god. I drained him out and i retrived everything with cc celebraton. he drew up as he couldnt do anything else and i won by 21.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 21<br/>
8 (+81)<br/>
Good: Drain of 10 on cloud city that is unmodifiable <br/>
Bad: Losing 1 to court every turn<br/>
Ugly: Losing 1 to court and 1 to death mark<br/>
<br/>
I am doing really well until now, I am leading the tournament by about 35 points, so i am hoping to win the next two games and win the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five: My Dark Vs Ben May Hidden Base<br/>
Ben is  a good friend of mine, and we play swccg quite a bit together, he made hidden base in the hope to play me, the game was a shocker, i flipped early and ping, he got honour out, luke at the forest so he is an immune epp, i always thinking with stomach him but had no one to put at the forest safely so he was rescued by obi wan a few turns later, after he flipped i got my 3 ships to probe and probe 3 systems and failed, the last system i probed was correct, but he had drained to much and was drain so little and he won by 17. Very Good Match<br/>
Full Loss by 17<br/>
8 (+64)<br/>
Good: DOH<br/>
Bad: Losing by 17<br/>
Ugly: Probing the hidden base on the last system left<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: QMC vs Ben Mays Darkside Senators<br/>
It was time to face my nemisis again, he was on 8(+65) and i was on  8 (+64), so whoever won this was going to win the speeder or sense foil on offer. we got started, he didnt flip first and gave me the go ahead, i got out wedge and keir yet again and flipped early with kfc and phlyo gandish and leia. he came down with vader and i leia hit him and he hit leia and my aliens were immune, qui gon came down to the dockign bay with saber and ill take the leader AO. mara jade and 4lom came down for the battle and i clashed mara jade, he forgot to lose 1 force to cancel so unlucky. han chewie lando and melas came down later to kill them, battle plan and menace fades came out, i started to set up and not have to pay to drain and he couldnt afford it. i was drainign for 4 force at the docking bay when pucimir came out to the upper corridor with taws and obi with saber. he then got that stupid orn free ta in front of my docking bay for 2 turns, i was retriving 3 with CC celebration and he had a large force pile, but eventually the deck came strong and teh drains were too much and i won by 7. <br/>
<br/>
