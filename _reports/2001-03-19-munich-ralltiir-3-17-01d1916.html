<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So here´s the monthly tournament-report from our local tourny in Munich.It started at 1pm and 12 people show, with 2 of them coming from Wien.I was pretty sure that I can win against the 9 others except against Julian Konrads dark deck, since he is my trainings partner and I often had lost against his version of prodigy.<br/>
Now here are the decks I played with:<br/>
<br/>
dark - a modified version of my ORS-Ops Vers.2 (on my page)<br/>
<br/>
light - Hidden Mains with a bunch of high destinies<br/>
<br/>
1 Game<br/>
<br/>
my dark vs. Alexander Mevissens(15??) Kirdo3 Ops<br/>
<br/>
He has only played one tourny before and is mainly a trader, so this ain´t gonna take long.He just wanted to play because of the one foil he could possibly win.<br/>
I start my normal setup by deploying Rendili form deck, getting Piett with Imperial Command, Merrejk with Piett, and Sullust with Merrejk and so on... .In the next few turns I get my ships to the systems, with Chiraneau at Sullust.He sts up with a few scouts and operatives, but his drains were early stopped by undercovers and my Objective.So I eventually drain him out, with no battle in the whole game!!!<br/>
FW +28<br/>
<br/>
2(+28)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: hm winning.<br/>
Lows: a very non-interactive game.I hate that!Also deploying too much.<br/>
<br/>
We were the first ones to be ready after about 20 minutes, so I traded a little.Next turn I played against Holger Schulz who is the only light winner.<br/>
<br/>
2 Game<br/>
<br/>
my light vs. Holger Schulz(1620) MKOS<br/>
<br/>
First turn he searches his deck with JPs gametext but there isn´t any location?After that he deploys a bunch of locations form hand and says go.Next turn I deploy Corulag from hand, Mirax to H1 DB, Dagobah with Hut from deck.His turn he only deploys Jabba to chamber.My turn I have a lot of force, deploy Ben, Orri, Kalfalncndros to chamber and battle.Jabba dies and he loses like 6 force.he thought that I wouldn´t deploy to chamber because I fear None Shall pass, but I has a grabber and this wouldn´t be too bad getting this @#$% grabbed second turn.So after this he deploys IG-88, 4-lom and Boelo to the Chamber.He captures Ori cancels Bens gametext and I loose Kal for battledamage.My turn I move Ben to Lower passages, after deploying Spiral with Blount piloting to Corulag.SO his turn he battles it .I drew a 6 to his 1 so I lose Blount and he Boba +2 force.After that he deploys guys to Chamber and to Desert Heart aboard the sail barge.I deploy Home One to help the spiral and get Obi and Han with gun to the palace.My turn I deploy Luke.Barrier.and Corran Horn, battle and he only lose one guy, shot by han(the rest is immune &lt;6)Damn.His turn he battles,Fallen Portal Dengar(I knew I would draw a 1) shoot the other guys and cleared the site.After that I retreived the cards from my lost pile with edge cards, cause he had huge drains with gailid and POTF in th palace, and cancel the POTF with clash.He finally deploys bib to CC DB to stop the drain of Mirax.My turn I deploy Melas, battle with a tracked 6 and win.<br/>
FW +22<br/>
<br/>
4 (+50)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning, kicking Jabbas fat ass!!!<br/>
Lows: poor captured Orrimaarko!<br/>
<br/>
Now the were only two undefeated players, me and Julian Konrad.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
my dark vs. JKs (1695) Throne room/HDWGITM/ CC-stuff<br/>
I know his deck, but this time he starts with 3 effects and no droid-pulling effect.So I get my normal setup after a few turns but before deploying a ship I monnok him lost since he hadn´t deployed anything yet.He had 3HDWGITM and 2I have a really bad feling about this and a bunch of EPPs.<br/>
Next turns he finally sets up on ground anddeploys I hope she´s all right, Goo Nee Tay.My turn I deploy DVDLOTS Tarkin and some Outer Rims to fight C-3PO/Artoo and Luke.I choke the droid(counts as ability 0 charcter) and kill Han of.So I lose tarkin and he all.Yeaha the bad effect is finally cancelled.But next turn he deploys a bunch of guys and Onee Ta to take I Hope She´s all right into hand he manages to finish Vader and the Outer Rim off.From now on it becomes a drain race with me draining for 8 and him for 4 and one drainedby an undercover.After my drains he has 1 force left, and I deploy one ORS.I play Abyssian Ornament to retrieve, but draw to high!!!Damn.I now battle and game over.<br/>
FW +19<br/>
<br/>
6 (+69)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning.<br/>
Lows: beating a friend<br/>
<br/>
Now I am the only undefeated and have to play Ian I.He has won 2 games right now but is in 5th cause "our local hero" manages to get 3 timed games and so we have some strange rankings.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
<br/>
my light vs. Ian I.(15??) Ralltiir Ops.<br/>
He deploys a swamp from deck and starts by now to get a bunch of sleens all over the planet.My turn I deploy Corran to kill one.Move over and go.he deploys a Mercenary pilot and Tarkin.Barrier.After that I get Leia to Ralltiir and finish´em off.After setting up at my docking bays and at system with Superfalcon(cause Corran was killed by Mara with him losing to cards for battle damage), He gets a Cloud drain going, and flips.But since I have Battle Order, Menace Fades and Honour going I don´t care.I have Order to Engage out and he wants to beat the Falcon.He deploys Boba and Bossk to Corulag so I move over from Ralltiir.His turn Vader comes down to Bossk and gets a Barrier.You won´t forfeit him!!!He battles, Spiral, I draw my 2 tracked 6´s + a 5and he only gets a 7(including ralltiir bonus).The system is cleared.And the game is over.I move Falcon to the clouds, killing his Cloud Car.I land with Falcon move Leia to a free site, he flips back, and I drain him out.<br/>
FW +27<br/>
<br/>
8 (+96)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: killing a funny Ralltiir-deck without Onee Taaaaa.<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
<br/>
So I go undefeated and win the 5th tourny ion row.After this is a monthly tourny this is a space over a half year.<br/>
I get a Imperial Decree foil´, and th esignal gets a random guy.<br/>
