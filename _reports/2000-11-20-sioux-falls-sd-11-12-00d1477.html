<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This TR starts about a month and a half ago.  I was playing in a local tourney, intending to do quite well.  I was playing my classic EBO baragwin deck and a cool abyssin deck.  However, the baragwins couldn’t retrieve enough and the abyssins just died against an endor uprising deck.  I went 2-2 and shamed myself.  Although, I did surprise assault Tagge and 7 troopers for 30 force.  Then, the Minnesota Grand Slam came around and I decided to shelve the baragwins for my friend’s Endor Uprising deck, since it was the last tourney it would be playable in.  I scrubbed out, going 2-4 and finishing 40th out of 48.  It was ugly.  Last weekend I finally got my confidence, and my rating, back by going 4-2 at a Rochester tourney, with a new light deck as well.  I decided to brave the possible storm this weekend to get home from St. Olaf to Sioux Falls for a tourney and to hang out with friends.  On Friday, the four guys who usually play together, myself, Adam, TJ, and Dom, make some decks and playtest a little at Adam and Dom’s house.  I have an idea which, to me, is completely original and beats Adam, even though he’s a lot better than me.  I then go to a friend’s dorm room, watch Pitch Black, and play Worms: Armageddon online ’til about five.  I go home and sleep until two, get up, go over to TJ’s house and work on decks a little more and then go to the All-State Choir concert that night.  Sunday afternoon, TJ comes and picks me up for the ride to the shop.  The weather is really bad, snow and all, so we don’t expect too big of a turnout.  We get everybody there, split off and start things up.  We only had ten this time.  My rating going in to the tourney was 1655.<br/>
<br/>
My decks were a Hidden Base fake out, setting up Close Air Support with guys on Endor.  I later found out that I didn’t have Midge in.  I’m an idiot.  Dark was my Court/Abyssin deck which has been undependable at best.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1-DS vs. Brian’s ? EBO w/o ANSB<br/>
<br/>
So I start Court, Prepared Defenses, No Bargain, No Escape, and Power of the Hutt.  He starts the Generators, the North Ridge, Medical Frigate, Menace Fades, and Civil Disorder.  I tell him he can’t start Civil Deisorder because it doesn’t deploy on his side of the table, so he goes only Menace Fades.  I also told him, if he was only going to start one efeect, he should start a signal for A New Secret Base.  He tells me he doesn’ have one.  At this point, I"m kind of wondering what’s going on.  I start and deploy Scum from hand, Jabba from RD using the AC and Boelo using Power.  He deploys the Echo Corridor and picks up.  At this point, I’m thinking he’s going to get EBO out real quick and I’m going to be in trouble.  Next turn, I drop Ephant form RD and draw looking for Myo.  The next few turns consist of him drawing for sites and losing one from Court, while I’m drawing for Myo and draining for one.  Eventually, I get Myo, drop him at the AC and Bane Malar with a couple of abyssins to the Pit.  He tries to come to the AC w/EPP Obi, but gets None Shall Passed.  He eventually gets the med lab out and deploys princess Leia there, and Sgt. Doallyn to the Corridor along with Hoth and Sullust.  He tries to Surprise Assault my drain at the AC, but loses by 6.  I’m draining at three sites now, the Dbay along with the others.  He deploys a Corvette to Hoth and an x-wing to Sullust.  I drop Zuckuss from hand and Bossk from RD and beat up on the lone x-wing and move over to stop the drain of one at Hoth.  My drain ends it next turn.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+33)<br/>
<br/>
2(+33)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning by quite a bit.  No lost pile at the end.<br/>
Lows: Whooping on an EBO deck w/o ANSB.  You’ll be happy to know, I traded him one after the tourney.<br/>
<br/>
So, I’m in first after one game, but Adam, who is in second, played dark as well, so I have to play TJ.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2-LS vs. TJ Olson’s (1756) Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
You must understand, TJ is a lot better than me.  He’s the one who introduced me to the game.  I have also never beaten him in a tourney.  He is playing this deck for the second time.  Not the second tourney, mind you; the second game.  He starts the Endor Ops stuff, Prepared Defenses, Power of the Hutt (mine actually), You Cannot Hide Forever, and something else.  I start Hidden Base (Kirdo III), Frigate, Strike Planning, Insurrection, and Squad Assignments.  He gets Ephant Mon to the bunker w/Perimeter Patrol turn one, so I decide it would probably be to my benefit to stay in space most of the game.  I get Gen Cal on GS1 right away and start grabbing systems.  He picks up.  I search for a system on my second turn and notice my Rebel Landing Site is missing, I draw into it and let him go.  He gets Lord Vader at the Dense Forest.  On my turn, I drop the Landing Site, Crix, and Kensaric.  He backs up Vader w/his stick.  I get Chewie and Wuta along with Menace Fades to halt his drains and flip.  He gets a Death Squadron w/Ozzel at Kiffex and U-3PO at the landing site.  Neither of us is lacking in force right now, so we can do pretty much anything we want.  I get Home One as back up on Endor, Luke at the Site, Wedge and Tycho in ships at Kessel and move Luke and Chewie to the Back Door.  I also set up Close Air Support on Endor.  He comes down with Tempest 1, Tempest Scout X with DS-61-x as pilot and another Tscout.  He battles and draws another Tempest 1, lamenting that he had forgotten to take it out.  I drew a 5, 1, and 0 and lost Luke, he lost the Tscout with pilot.  I backed Chewie up with another LUke the next turn and drained.  He moved to Kirdo and probed.  He battled with his guys against Luke and Chewie and I drew three fives.  He lost both his guys and I lost Chewie.  He brought the Executor against Home One, Tala 2, and GS1 and lat damaged the big one, I lost Blount and ship and ran away, The rest of the game was a drain race with me winning.  Vader came to confront his son, but bowed down to the power of a 5 and a 4 on a swing and a 5 for destiny.  I was lucky.  TJ was pissed.  It was close, but I won the drain race thanks to the back door and kessel.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+2)<br/>
<br/>
4(+35)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning such a close game.  Beating TJ for the first time in a tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Getting beat on and giving up Endor.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, there are only two undefeated players, myself and Adam.  We face of, knowing whoever wins this game will probably take the tourney.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-LS vs. Adam Nemmers’ (1809) Hunt Down dueler<br/>
<br/>
I start my stuff, he starts Hunt Down, Prepared, Crush the Rebellion, Imp Arrest Order, and something else.  I get a Transmission Terminated opening hand but, of course, he has Holonet Transmission.  We get set up.  He drops Executor: Dbay and picks up.  I drop Endor, Cal, and GS1 to RP and move.  He deploys a Dbay and draws, we lose to Visage and he loses Security Precautions off the top.  I’m feeling good.  I get Honor out to make him lose for a few turns until No Escape takes care of that.  I’m spreading and eventually, I have Home One at Endor, Han, Cal, and GS1 at Kessel, most of my ships in the lost pile, and I’m flipped.  He has Janus and EPP Vader holding the DS: Dbay and Mara and Evazan at the CC: Dbay, however I’m cancelling his drains and am only losing to Visage.  But he had an early jump on me and is winning.  We drain for a couple of turns, and then he deploys Zuckuss to Kirdo III, and probes (correct) and moves to Kashyyyk, I move Home One over to stop his drains and draw the Back Door.  Next turn he moves in front of the Falcon.  I drop Back Door, DoS and EPP Luke and Kill Zuckuss.  I also use TT to cancel Visage.  On his turn, he picks up Vader, but doesn’t have enough to deploy him again.  I know he has a Vader’s Obsession in his hand so I move Home One to Endor and shuttle the two up and draw Lt. Page.  He drops Vader to the Back Door and moves Mara to the Ex. Dbay and Dr. E to Janus.  I drop Page, shuttle down Leia and move Home One to Kashyyyk.  He looks at his RD (one card) and it’s a You Are beaten.  He uses Janus’ text to take that card and says go.  I know he will kill Page if I stick around, so I move Home One over and shuttle Page up leaving DoS alone with her father.  He intitiates battle and both die.  After that, it was a drain race.  I put Luke and Page at the Back Door, so I’m draining for six to his two, I won after that.<br/>

FW(+5)<br/>
<br/>
6(+40)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating a VERY good player.  Sticking to my strategy and keeping him out of space.<br/>
Lows:  nothing<br/>
<br/>
Well, since it was so close, we get to play again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4-DS vs. Adam Nemmers’ (1809) Profit w/Alien Han and Bo Shuda<br/>
<br/>
I start Court, Prepared, No Bargain, Secret Plans, and Power of the Hutt.  He starts Profit, Han, Signal and Underworld Contacts on Jabba’s Place.  My goal this game is to not let go of the Audience Chamber at all.  I start Jabba and Chall as my aliens and take a CC engineer.  As it turns out, I don’t need him.  I get Scum in my opening hand, so that goes down along with Myo from hand and Boelo from RD.  On his turn, he puts down Bo Shuda with Tessek I think, there.  I pull Ephant from RD and drop a couple Abyssins at JP and move over Chall.  He just draws for the next couple of turns looking for a sense, because I know he has Order to Engage, and he knows I have Point Man.  I spread out with Boelo and Chall at Jabba’s Palace and some abyssins at the Pit.  He comes with Lando and some other guys, I think and kills a couple abyssins and moves over.  We rumble on Tatooine for awhile, but he can’t get a sense and cannont force drain, either.  I wear him down and he eventually deploys Boussh undercover at the Executor: Dbay.  I move over some abyssins to stop her, but he’s so low on force he can’t move her back.  He deploys OTE and that hurts for two turns as he senses my Point Man and I track it back into my hand to play again.  From there on out, it was a drain race and, seeing as how he couldn’t drain, I won.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+19)<br/>
<br/>
8(+59)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning the game and the tourney.<br/>
Lows:  not much.<br/>
<br/>
So, I win the tourney going 4-0 and beating two players who I have never beaten in a tourney before (one twice).  My rating ended up going to 1727, which is good for me.  I got crap in my packs, so I gave them away.  Unfortunately, I had to leave right away so I could brave the snow and get back to school, so I didn’t get any standings.<br/>
