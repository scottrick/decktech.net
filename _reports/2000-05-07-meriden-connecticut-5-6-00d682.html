<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, skip down a ways if you want to get into the games. I was looking forward to this tourney for two reasons; 1. Both of my friends, Cody 'Legolas' DiCara and Ben 'Coran Horn' Reed, could go to this tournament. 2. Steve Brentson wasn't going to be there since he was at RamapoConII. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing against Steve at all. He's really good, but I've beaten him before and we have some good games. But he has been to every tournament that I have gone to since I got good enough to start winning them. It sucks when you're 2-0, and then you play Steve twice. Even with one win, he can still easily beat you on diff. So anyway, I was looking forward to a good opportunity to win a tourney. We made the trip down, made some trades, got our decks ready, and started.<br/>
<br/>
My Light: Running Profit deck, somewhat main heavy since that's my style. I'll post it later. <br/>
My Dark: I played my Sick of Yavin 4 Mains? deck. Because of limited playtesting, I overlooked one very important weakness, but it was still a solid deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs Random Newbie's Cloud City deck<br/>
I don't mean disrespect by calling him that, I just can't remember his name, and he was a newbie. He was playing some kind of Cloud City deck with Rebel Troopers, blasters, and the occasional main. He knew his rules allright, but his deck wasn't good. I tried to help him along, doing things like reminding him to force drain, telling him to save force for his blasters, and things like that. But in the end, it didn't matter. He never drew his Son of Skywalker, and Dengar was picking off his troopers left and right. During the whole game, I was draining for 3 at the Defensive Permiter with Mara, saber, and Evazan, so he went quietly.<br/>
FW +42<br/>
2 (+42)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning my first game by 42. Setting up like I should.<br/>
Lowlights: Having to play a newbie, and having to beat his ass. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs Tom Hollingworth's HuntDown w/ Dueling<br/>
Personally, I don't mind playing against HuntDown. I've only lost to it once (damn you Eric!), so I don't fear it at all. I had beaten this deck at states, so I wasn't worried that much. He starts Bane and Zuckuss in the AC (he lost his Mara), and started pulling docking bays with IAO for early generation. Ben Kenobi came down with his saber to free Han, and then moved to Tatooine: Jabba's Palace because I'm holding a Fallen Portal. Here's where we have some fun; He comes down with Vader + saber, Tarkin, Veers, and two random guys (IAO fodder). I know what's coming, but I'm not holding any dueling interrupts. He debates pulling a docking bay, but doesn't, and starts the battle. I try to Fallen Portal Tarkin, only needing a 2. I draw a 1. Despite all of the high destiny in my deck, I draw a 1. So I think I'm screwed. He starts the duel, plays Focused Attack, draw 0, 1, 0! I was happy as hell! I, of course, draw two 1s, one of which he cancels. So he has 4 total in the duel, and I have 4 total in the duel (2 for destiny because of the lightsaber, and 2 for Kenobi's game text). So we tie, and I live. I hit one random guy, and knock the other one out with destiny. I revive Han, so Ben w/saber and Han are facing Vader w/saber, Tarkin, and Veers. My control phase, disarm Vader, Mess Tarkin. Initiate the battle. Swing and hit Veers, draw a one, use Han's text to redraw, and draw a five! I clear the site, everyone lives. After that missed duel, the game was over. He killed Ben by drawing a total of seven with Igar on Tempest 1, but I just kept running, doing drains and Profit damage. <br/>
FW +30<br/>
4 (+72)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Drawing in the duel. Disarm + Sorry About the Mess to kill Vader. : )<br/>
Lowlights: Him having really bad luck in his duel. He could have easily won the game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs Greg West's Stupid F*cking Throne Room Mains<br/>
Way to change your deck from states Greg. Real original. : ) Anyway, Greg is damn good, and we always have good games, so let's go. First turn, he puts Obi and his saber to my Defensive Perimeter. That's what I forgot! I give Throne Room and early battleground to go to, before I can control it! I'm kicking myself for overlooking it, but what can I do now? I am slow in getting out sites, and Greg makes me pay for it by stocking up on the DP, and spreading onto my Kashyyyk. Of course I lose Crush off the top, so next turn he revolves my Wampa Cave. I put EPP Vader and random fodder at the DP to get rid of Obi, but I lost IAO off the top, so he Nabruns the squad over to kill me. I grab the Nabrun, which was good since he couldn't find his other one for the rest of the game, but that was the only good thing. I kick him off Kashyyyk with Nemet on the Executor, but he Landing Claws it after only a couple turn of draining (forgot to save force for IJASKAW). I put Mara to his Throne Room to do some draining, but I only get him down somewhat before he drains me out. <br/>
FL -20<br/>
4 (+52)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: See lowlights.<br/>
Lowlights: Making stupid mistake in deck construction. Not saving force for IJASKAW. Him basically outplaying me. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs Greg West's 10 Frieking Masterful Moves HuntDown<br/>
I swear, this deck had like 10 Masterful Moves. And I left out my grabber. Damn it! Anyway, he started Mara and Fett. He puts a first turn Vader to Jabba's Palace and ends his turn. I cancel Visage with a Bothan and Tawass Khaa. Then Ben and EPP Luke come down to the AC, miss Mara horribly, Fett manages to hit Luke (WTF!), but I play Gift of the Mentor, drawing just enough to clear the site, and he only draws a 4, so I just revive Luke, and free Han. He eventually kills Tawass and the Bothan with Zuckuss. He starts drawing, gets down to one force, and plays Masterful Move. I'm hoping that's he's looking for a Visage, but he pulls out a Ghhhk. I'm holding a Nabrun and Gift of the Mentor, with Ben, Luke, and Han sitting at the AC. Bastard! I Nabrun up and kill Zuckuss anyway so I can get rid of the Visage that he put down, but he just Ghhhks the 14+ damage. I'm draining away at the Executor, and he's only draining me for two. So he pulls Vader into hand, and deploys him along with Tarkin to the Executor. Duels Luke and wins, so I cross him and lose 5. I run away for awhile, but then he duels Ben and wins, cornering Han. He trys to lay the smackdown on my lone Leia, but I It's a Trap the battle. I do my last gasp move and Nabrun Han to the Forest Clearing, and deploy Wedge with him. Now that HuntDown's flipped, he can't pick up Vader (heehee), so he's drawing like mad for an Elis. I'm picking at him, and he's down to about 3 life force. He has the Elis, but all he has left in his deck are high destiny, so he can't pull off the Elis. I drain and Profit him out.<br/>
FW +15<br/>
6 (+67)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Beating Greg. Running away like a pansy school girl the whole game, and having it work.<br/>
Lowlights: Having Greg's own High Destiny kill him. Him dueling both Luke and Obi.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS vs Tom Hollingworth's Oola Madness Throne Room Mains<br/>
Yay, another one! He puts a first turn Oola to the Throne Room, and a second turn Obi to my Defensive Perimeter. Lovely. I respond with 4-Lom and Jabba to the DP. Battle, cancel Obi's immunity, and kill him with my destiny (tech!). I lose Jabba. So next turn he puts down his second Obi (dumb bastard. Seriously, if I drew two Obis in my opening hand, they'd probably get Monnoked away.). Oh well. I draw Mara to kill Oola, and set up Bossk at Endor with Devestator as backup. He's not draining for that much with Battle Order out, so he's starting to die. He Nabruns Obi over to Mara (during his move phase because of IAO), and Clashes her. But he can't battle, so I run from him (not Mara, just her support). He's really low on characters, and when I put Zuckuss up at Kashyyyk, the game went sharply downhill. <br/>
FW +16<br/>
8 (+83)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Beating a stupid Throne Room Mains. Playing a cool one though. He had like 4 damn Oolas in the deck, but after the first one, they all went off the top (heehee).<br/>
Lowlights: Him drawing two Obis. Stupid deck construction mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS vs Aaron Penna's TIE's with Dark Manuevers and Counter Assaults<br/>
Well, this one was for the tourney. I know that unless I screw up, I've got this one, because he has almost no ground, and I can just Profit/drain him to death. He sets up somewhat quickly, but I just retrieve all the force he drains me for. I free Han and put him and Obi at one site, Luke at another, and Leia at another. 6 loss a turn that he can't deal with. When he tries to set up at Endor, I beat on his lone TIE with Wedge in Lando in Millenium Falcon and the Tantive IV. He doesn't have enough left in his hand to mess with me, and even if he does have Choke Vader, I'm holding It's a Trap, Nabrun, and Gift of the Mentor. He delays the enevitable by retrieving by deploying TIEs, and playing Short Range Fighters for 8, but I just drain/Profit him out in an uneventful game.<br/>
FW +17<br/>
10 (+100)<br/>
<br/>
So I pick up a long overdue tourney win with an even 100 diff. Pretty cool. I get about 8 packs of Cloud City, but give them all to a newbie. My rating will go way up, and I can't wait til Brentson comes back (yes Steve, that's an open challenge). Cody had some bad luck with his light side, but his DS went 3-0 with a diff of over 100 (!), so he took 8th. Ben had a bad tourney and took 20th out of 22. Oh well. No props and slops (not my style), but a big thanks to Greg Forester for running the tourney, and two Greg West for giving me two more great games. See you next time. </font></td>
