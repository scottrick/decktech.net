<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The decks I used in the I10 cup were nothing new.  I had not much time to think of anything genius, so thats why I used HDADTJ and WYS.  And besides, it was just the I10 cup- I wasnt too concerned about the competition.  Going to Denver is like entering the perpetual lion’s den, with the #1 ranked player in the world there.  Because of this, I was sure I was going to need something new an innovative to come out on top.  As I mentioned in the interview, I had built the Watto Deck and an AOBS.  On Tuesday night I went to Kards 4 You to play with the locals and discovered how much I disliked the droid AOBS, so my dark deck for the next day would have to be the Watto deck.  So it’s Wednesday the 29th of August.  I get out of school and I head up to Phoenix with Enrique "The Man" Huerta and Justin "The Bigger Man" Beal, but not after a quick stop the Sausage Deli- my new favorite sub shop.  Light was obviously WYS and my rating was still 2210 at this point.  Here is that tourney in short.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
WYS Vs Andrew McCormack’s (1445) MKOS with Troopers and SAC<br/>
WYS is my friend.  It stops SAC.  MKOS is my friend because it gives me force.  I flip fast and start draining.  We fight some.  He gets down to 12 force and activates it all.  I have Jedi Luke in the Cantina and Melas and Lando with Gun at DB94.  He drops Tagge, I barrier.  He drops 12 Stormies, all for free.  I say @#$%.  He drops Maul.  Stupid Melas.  He battles, plays TA, I Run Luke Run, hit a trooper, he plays DJP, and then I draw two tracked 6s.  His total power is 67.  Mine is 25 (a ship in space adding to my power).  I have 42 battle damage and no Houjix.  After forfeiting everything I lose around 18 or 20 more, all of a sudden putting us on even terms for force.  Since his hand is now just 1 card I feel safe and spread and drain.  He drains me for about a dozen, but I am able to get force back with my Edges.<br/>
FW + 17<br/>
2(+17)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  42 battle damage!<br/>
Lows:  Almost drowning in the sea.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
Watto Vs Jonathan Dunn’s (1776) HB Tat Celebration deck<br/>
I start the Pod Race and box.  He doesnt start the new Insurrection because he doesnt have it.  I win the race, beat him up in space, make his guys missing with Always Thinking With your Stomach, and even out SAC him (my addition to Bastians deck).  Not interactive and very short.<br/>
FW + 35<br/>
4(+52)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Jon for the first time.  I like him, he silly.<br/>
Lows:  Beating him by that much... but then again he hasn’t changed his decks since GenCon.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
Watto Vs Michael Clement’s (1704) WYP(hil)<br/>
Harvest, Palace Raiders, and P Craft.  No fun.  Especially given the lack of anti retrieval Bastian packs.  My only hope was to kill off Owen and Beru because I couldnt grab or POOP any of his Harvests.  I couldn’t even make him pay force for them!  Of course, he didnt realize this, so he paid 4 force every time he used a Harvest.  I wasn’t about to say anything, though when he spent force to move his palace raider on craft I let him know that was free.  I’m such a nice guy ;) Anyway, I just went fast.  In both of these games I played I was able to get the fast flip with Palp or Television to Mos Espa and Watto to his hut.  In fact, out of both games I left Watto absolutely alone for about 7/8 of the game and he only participated in a single battle!  So yeah, fast Watto Damage, the race did its thing in my favor because Mike wasnt using any racing cards (a mistake for any WYS).  He harvest like 3-4 times before I am able to kill Owen and Beru, and I am pleased because I saw the first copy fly off the deck to the Race.  From there he just drains me a little and I am able to beat him up some.<br/>
FW + 19<br/>
6(+71)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Mike is a very good player.  He has great potential (and he demonstrated that when he beat Chu at DPC Phoenix).<br/>
Lows:  Me no know.  Me tired.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five<br/>
WYS Vs Michael Clement’s (1704) TDIGWATT Mains<br/>
If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a million times (does that phrase even make sense?): You know they have the gun- so why give them the bullets?!  Paul Maholick said that originally.  He’s an awesome guy.  But seriously, a 2 to 1 force ratio is not going to get it done for you.  At this point I was tired and made plenty of mistakes, like after I got Wedge in ship to the Bespin System I forgot the &amp;#8211;1 text for a turn, then wasted force grouping my guys at the Downtown Plaza for the drain of 2 when I coulda just kept them all with Phylo who was sitting at the CC: DB.  Anyway, despite my follies, he walks right into a Barrier beat down that basically ended the game.<br/>
FW + 23<br/>
8(+94)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Neh.<br/>
Lows:  I was then, and I am now, zonked.<br/>
<br/>
The Tucson crew I traveled with ended up taking 3 of the top 4 slots and we pulled nothing eventful in our packs, as far as I can recall.  We head home and I realize how very much I dont like the new Watto objective.  The next day I do the usual.  I go to school then I have this conversation with Hunter on AIM.  Basically we promise each other that we wont play racing or senate... he tries to get me to say no to WYS, but its all I have built, so I had to decline on that part of the agreement.  Anyway, I get through Friday and catch a ride to the airport with my friend Greg.  Waiting for my flight I discovered two other UA students also going to Denver, both female.  I forget the nice ones name now, only because I flew home with the other, highly annoying one on the way home.  Randi is her name.  As far as I can tell she only wears thong underwear, and frankly, she doesn’t deserve to.  Plus one of her eyes goes off in a different direction, but whatever.  No I’m not done being mean.  She spent literally 25 minutes telling the most inane story about her and her friend, and her boyfriend, and her boyfriends ex, and last year, and whether or not he cheated on her, and if it was actually cheating or not, because so and so said such and such, and so on.  I was ready to shoot myself.  Fortunately I had my trusty Discman nearby, so while the nice, good looking UA sophomore was drowned in Randi’s banter I managed to escape to the soothing, melodious sounds of Slipknot’s newest album, Iowa.  I am able to elude Randi, as I sleep through both flights (I transferred in Utah).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I get off the plane in Denver looking for an old guy.  You see I had asked Kyle Craft to set me up with a ride from the airport and a place to stay.  Well, Kyle never really gave me any details.  All I received was an email from Joe Diniega introducing himself as the Hawaiian state champ and informing me that I’d be picked up by his Grandpa.  I told him I’d look for an old guy and that he should tell his Grandpa to look for a tall @#$% kid with black hair.  As you may have read in Will’s report, Grandpa didnt greet me, but instead by Jayson, Joe, and Will did.  And Kyle, but he was hiding cause Will was planning on making a scene or something.  Well it’s great seeing Kyle again and I am introduced to all the Hawaiians.  So we get on the monorail thing and we find it all very amusing because it talks and stuff.  Next, as you might expect, comes the parking lot where, fittingly enough, their Grandpas pimpin’ van was parked.  There are a lot of different kinds of vans out there.  Theres the rape van with no windows in the back; the plumbers van, which is similar to the rape van, but has the square windows on each of the doors on back; the soccer mom mini van- you know the type.  Well Grandpa’s van is pimpin’.  No other words can describe it.  Its maroon with some old skool paneling; it has the tire on the back, and most importantly of all, window curtains!  You know whoever has mother @#$%ing curtains on their van is mackin’ no matter how old they are.  The inside is ghetto, too, like all the wiring and @#$% for the TV is ripped out, and he has this police scanner thing on the dash.  In between the two front seats theres a @#$%ing milk crate with a fire extinguisher in it!  Of course, all the chairs are captain style, with their own armrests, and to top it all off he has his air force medallion hanging from the rearview.  Big pimpin’ baby.  <br/>
<br/>
Well after a brief trip down memory lane with Kyle we find ourselves at the Diniega residence.  We get in the door and I am amazed at how bare the place is, but it quickly becomes clear that they are just moving in.  It’s all good cause it leaves plenty of room for deck construction and pick up games.  I don’t really remember much of what went on, I just know I lost a game or two to Kyle, built his WYS, and then kinda @#$%ed around until we were all too tired.  Kyle was the first to go.  He just sprawled out on the floor and we didn’t hear too much from him for a while.  Then, all of a sudden, he starts this loud @#$% snoring so I throw something at him but to no avail.  So my next step is to put the Maul beanie baby on his mouth, which woke him up and elicited some swearing.  Eventually we all petered out and drifted off.  Next morning we all got up late and scrambled to shower and dress and eat and such.  It was all kind of a blur.  We hop in the van again and were off.  We arrive with plenty of time and register.  I say hi to Scott Gaeta, the guy in charge of all the SW stuff for the weekend whom I met at GenCon 2k, John Arendt, and some other people Ive know only through tournament reports like Dan Christy, Van Melancon, and a few more I cant remember now at 2am.  Hunter strolls in a couple minutes after start time and is eating some nondescript item from Burger King.  I walk up and we say hey.  Kyle comes over and we make some remarks about Hunter feeling left out, since we were both wearing our world finalists shirts.  Anyway, we wait a while hoping more people will show up but in the end there are only 27.  Once again, decks are, like always, my trusty WYS SOLID and old time favorite, HDADTJ SOLID.  Interestingly enough, all of the decks I faced were WYS for light and Senate for dark.  My rating going into the weekend was 2210.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
WYS Vs Joseph Diniega (1787)<br/>
WYS just beats dark senate.  You start SquAss, Insurrection / Aim high, and then Battle Plan / DTF.  Battle Plan is what kills them.  They never drain you since they are only activating like 9 or 10 force tops.  With Goo Nee Tay out they never have enough to deploy two characters, unless they are droids and even then they still can’t drain you.  Besides, even assuming they do drain me, which only happened maybe 3 times all tournament, I just play Lost in the Wilderness (of which I pack 2).  It’s such a sick card in WYS.  Anyway, I dont really remember how it happened, but I beat down Vader for like 22 then I used On the Edge to get back some of my lost pile.<br/>
FW + 28<br/>
2 (+28)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Joe.  Hes mad cool and since we didnt play at his house it was cool to play him.<br/>
Lows:  Having to beat him by so much. <br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Dan Christy (1913)<br/>
Dan had introduced himself earlier and I told him it was a pleasure to finally put a name to a face, when I actually meant it the other way around.  Anyway, Dan is mad cool.  He exhibits a certain level of sarcasm and odd humor that I can appreciate, so our game was a ton of fun.  Basically I had a great draw, because my deck loves me so much, and he had a not so great one.  My Mob Points encountered no DDTA, and didnt all day except from Kyle, whose deck I built.  I just got Vader to the Cantina with Stick and started draining as visage did its thing.  I dont really remember what happened in this game except I was nearly doubling his activation, so there was no way he could get a foothold.<br/>
FW + 26<br/>
4 (+54)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Dan is the man.<br/>
Lows:  See above.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Jeremy Lamere (1999)<br/>
Another WYS.  Umm... they all seem the same to me.  Vader to Cantina, stick shortly, if not immediately, thereafter.  Drain, Visage, etc.  What more is there to know?<br/>
FW + 24<br/>
6 (+78)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Jeremy is from Montana.  Montana Rules! hehe<br/>
Lows:  None.  I get to play Hunter now.<br/>
<br/>
After this game I learn Hunter won by 31, exactly tying my differential, and we had both played opposite sides.  The moment I had been waiting for had finally arrived.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four<br/>
WYS Vs Brian Hunter (2338)<br/>
So I sit down across from him and Kyle gives me some words of encouragement.  I am ready for this.  Of course then he whips out his objective, My Lord, Is That Legal? And I’m just like, "@#$%!  Why’d you have to go and do that?" full well knowing he thought that it’d improve his chances of beating me, and he just kinda shrugs.  He starts Do The Have A Code Clearance, IAO/SP, and either TINT/OE or TPM- I can’t recall which.  I start the Dark Senate Killer Combo.  We shuffle, and shuffle some more, then he shuffles my deck and I shuffle his and we’re ready.  So we play.  Our first couple of turns each take like 3 minutes because we don’t want to do anything stupid, like forget to get a docking bay or something.  He gets Maul out to his hut first turn, but doesnt go into the senate for fear of a couple smugglers and their multiple destiny draws taking out a key delegate.  He also gets out Jabba’s Palace via a Neimoidian Advisor I believe.  I counter with an easy first turn flip and he Squabbles for Lotti Dodi.  His activation is cut and he has to pay to drain, so he doesn’t.  Things are fuzzy.  I know he just kinda attacks me on the ground, but none of those attacks amount to much since Goo Nee Tay makes all of his guys cost his entire force pile.  Vader comes down, I Dodge, he follows, then all of a sudden its Vader and 13 or something.  He never confronts me in space.  He just didn’t do anything.  I just sat there with a Dodge in lost pile draining at my 3 sites and at the system.  If there was anything more to say I would!  At the end I did On the Edge once, I think.<br/>
FW + 24<br/>
8 (+102)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating the #1 ranked player in the world.<br/>
Lows:  Somehow I thought it’d be more difficult than that.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, I did have an Okay hand, 2 smugglers, and 5 red cards, one of which was a Control Tunnel Vision, and he had what he considered to be a bad draw... though when you can dive through your force pile every turn I dont see how he couldn’t recover from that.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Kyle Craft (2152)<br/>
Kyle is smart.  He starts DDTA, so things go slightly slower for me then they normally would.  My third effect is No Escape, cause I know Kyle is playing Honor.  I go first turn Lord Vader to the Executor DB with stick, deploy the Bridge, and move him over to the DB.  He loses one.  He saves some force then loses one.  I dont drain cause I know Kyle is also playing 2x Lost In The Wilderness.  I just move Vader inside and draw.  Next JK Luke comes down.  I was hoping Vaders defense value of 8 would be enough, but he swings and that Kyle Craft luck pulls through for him and I am hit.  The stakes have been raised, so I play Sniper Dark Strike to add 3.  Okay, Im adding 5 to my total, and hes only a 7, all I need is *not* two ones.  Of course, I draw the two ones and Luke lives.  I curse myself for not starting Crush to get my IHYN.  He draws a 6 while I flip a 2.  I lose Vader and some force.  Then we lose to Visage.  Things aren’t good.  I am forced to Maul Strikes for Mauls saber, deploy Coruscant Maul and the stick and battle.  Fortunately this time I do hit, and he misses, but again, he draws a 6 for destiny and I am forced to lose Maul!  A Vader, a Maul and 2 sabers lost in 3 turns!  For once I am glad to have like 3 Vaders in hand so another comes out and he starts losing to visage.  He’s still not flipped, so I’ve some breathing room.  He stalls a turn and I just fortify Vader, drawing out his Controls.  He flips, but weakly, and Maul makes another appearance to flip him back.  He flips again, and all those Controls are greatly limiting my damage.  Sometime I head to space and he follows and we kick each other out, but not before I am able to grab Carida with Mob Points.  We get to the point where I have 18 or 19 force or so and he has about 25 and he just drew up to 10.  Now that his third Jedi Luke is on the table, and all of my Mauls have died to smugglers Visage is his friend, and there is little chance I can win the game.  And yet there is still hope.  Please note the specifics here might be a little off... As I am writing this I seem to recall having less force, which leads me to believe he might have fortified Han’s Cantina, where P-59 already was, by moving Lando over as he moved the other guys away from DB 94, but I cannot be sure; this all went down like 3 weeks ago, and in that time many a beverage hath been consumed.  All I know is that I whooped his @#$% in 2 battles and that changed the game.  Read on.  He finally went to space again with Dash and Outrider to satisfy Battle Order.  His guys on the ground are Han and Lando in the Cantina, and Luke and Melas and some other smuggler at the Mos Espa DB.  My hand consists of Thrawn, ZiMH, Lateral Damage, Imperial Command, Sniper Dark Strike, and P-59, I believe.  Well, at least those were the important cards.  I had been using They’re Still Coming Through and Janus and Imperial Command (just to get it into my deck) to set up my destinies, and here is where it counted.  I have Vader and Grotto and some other dudes sitting outside at DB 94.  So here I go.  No drain.  P-59 goes to the Cantina, ZiMH to Tatooine, and then Thrawn aboard.  Lateral Damage hits Carida.  I fight for free on the ground.  He shoots and misses, I shoot Han and hit and make him lost.  I draw a tracked 6 for destiny and he has to lose Lando and like one force or something.  I battle for free in space.  I draw 2 tracked 4s, thanks to Imperial command, so its my 15 to his 0.  He loses Dash and 8.  He flips back and all of a sudden the game has shifted dramatically in my favor.  He is paying to drain and I am not.  Visage is now my friend, not his.  He manages to drain me some and Visage eats me for a while before I am able to drain him out.<br/>
FW + 10<br/>
10 (+112)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Wow.  Kyle is one hell of an opponent.  The only reason I won that game is because he was out of practice.  All he had to do was deploy the Outrider to the ground and let Melas get on. <br/>
Lows:  None, it was a great @#$%ing game.<br/>
<br/>
Game Six<br/>
WYS Vs Kyle Craft (2152)<br/>
As it turns out Kyle would need to win this last game to get into the final 4.  I wasn’t opposed to letting that happen, but I really couldnt decide what to do.  So we just played, deciding that if it came close he could have it.  Actually, this is the match up we played the night prior where he beat me, so anything could happen.  And indeed, something did happen.  Kyle got the absolute worst luck I have ever seen anyone ever get.  Even with me trying to throw that game there was no way he could win.  It was the most ridiculous game of Star Wars I had ever played.  It’s not even like everything came together for me... It’s like he is playing 4 Mauls, 2 Squabbles, and 2 Lott Dods.  Considering he starts TPM, you’d think he’d be able to get out a Lott Dod, oh I dont know, maybe sometime before turn 8.  But no.  It was not meant to be.  He drops Zuckuss and Bossk on his third turn when all I had was Red 10 and Theron up at Tatooine.  I’ll Take the Leader is out, but when you have a deck full of 4s, 5,s and 6s you’d think you could crack immunity of 6 in 2 draws.  Well he didn’t.  And Theron was mad, bad and full of duff bars so Kyle ended up losing a force from that battle.  I’m not about to deploy Kessel or start paying for drains so I just fortify with Wedge in his ship, not willing to battle because I’m still not drawing battle destiny.  He drops pilots on both ships, fights, and again draws extremely poorly, while Theron draws well again.  He loses more force.  Then I finally get my third ship and smuggler so I draw destiny.  We fight and once more he flips a combined total of 4 for his battle destiny and I get just above the forfeit of his highest senator he had thrown aboard Bossk for forfeit.  The game just went further down hill from there for him, and promptly afterward he announced his retirement.<br/>
FW + 29<br/>
12 (+131)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  None whatsoever.<br/>
Lows:  Go reread that game.  You tell me.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, one must understand Kyle has done this at least once for each and every game he has ever played.  He gets all pissy, says, "I quit!" sells his cards, and then comes back in like 6 months.  So dont worry kiddies, you haven’’t seen the last of Kyle Craft, not by a long shot.<br/>
<br/>
After 6 I am in first, Hunter in second, Josh Bader in third, and Dan Christy in fourth.  I play Dan and Hunter plays Josh.  Hunter and I have our pick of decks.  Though WYS is invincible, I feel safer merely replaying the game Dan and I already played, so I chose to use Dark.<br/>
<br/>
Semi Finals<br/>
WYS Vs Dan Christy<br/>
This game was even closer than the one Kyle and I had.  I got off to a better start this time than I did against Kyle, but Dan was able to flip and stay flipped for most of the game.  He used all three of his Control Tunnel Visions twice, all for my Cantina drain.  Basically, he was able to fight me.  It was a huge chess match- if he took a piece, hed retaliate by taking one of mine, and so on.  Instead of canceling Visage, he used the OOC part to go for Vader but ended up taking out ZiMH, the ship I play 2 of, thus eliminating half of my deck’s space.  Battle Order was again a key factor in the game, as I paid for nearly all my drains, while most of the time his few were free.  Anyway, we exchanged battle damage, we both took turns playing cat and mouse for drain sites.  Over all he had better board control because he had more and faster space, but Visage helped keep things in my favor.  Then EPP Luke goes down to the Endor DB with EPP Han, flipping me back to make us both lose to Visage.  So next turn Maul comes down with some fodder, and his ship goes to DB 94- the plan being for him to survive the battle then DB transit, then go to space, flipping him back.  I battle and I play I Have You Now, he misses the swing, so I figure I am safe, but he plays the SATM/BF combo from the lost to add three, so Han hits the Dark Jedi.  Fortunately I draw high enough to clear his guys, but he also takes out mine, and my plan to flip both our objectives on one turn is no more.  Anyway, things are getting really close.  I have like no guys left on the board, and he is down to just a couple too, but he is in space.  I have like 15 force left or so, and he has like 22 or something.  I have like 3 cards in hand, something, the Chimaera, and Lat Damage.  I dont want to drop the Chimaera and Lat Damage with no one to go on it.  So I Janus and get Thrawn but I dont have enough to deploy him on his ship, and doing so wouldnt do any good anyway, since I didnt have an Independent ship to allow me to draw extra battle destiny (new Tatooine text).  So he goes aboard the Infiltrator and Ozzel joins him.  I Lat Damage the Outrider and move the Imps up then draw.  He deploys the Bantha Droid and cancels the Lat Damage, then battles, but I Imp Command and draw my extra Visage that I had been tracking, and something else.  Unfortunately he drew well too, so only Ozzel was left aboard.  I just keep drawing that for battle destiny, and I kick him out of space, and he kicks me off the ground, but I am able to get Xizor out, who does wonders against smugglers, so at the end I am able to satisfy Battle Order and I killed off all his stuff.<br/>
FW + 7<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  This is what SWCCG is about.<br/>
Lows:  None.  Again, Dan is the man, and this was one HELLUVA game.<br/>
<br/>
Hunter won his game, so it’s him and me in the final, and again, I get to choose the match up.  I chose to use light first.  I was highly confident I could win this game again, and I realize the important psychological advantage winning the first game of a duel gives a player.  Also, thanks to Visage, HDADTJ is the last deck you want to be facing when you are worried about differential.  I mean, not only is HDADTJ incapable of losing by very much at all, but Visage just adds this whole other dimension to force management: now you are playing against a clock, essentially.<br/>
<br/>
The way the money was going to be divvied up first was going to take like 400 and second was going to get somewhere around 135.  Not wanting to risk losing money on the weekend I accepted Hunter’s proposed split of 200 for second and the rest to first.  In hindsight I shouldn’t have done this.  I am well aware of Hunters ability to perform in final duels, and he was even the one offering me the split, not the other way around.  Anyway, what’s done is done, lets get onto the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game One of Final<br/>
WYS Vs Hunter<br/>
Something good players will do is try to change their play style when facing a tough deck for the second time.  Well, in this game, I can only assume Brian tried to do that.  Vader still got kicked in the butt for 8 or so force, and this game he even drained me once!  He paid 3 force to drain for 2 with Maul and his stick at the Palace, and I promptly played a Lost in the Wilderness from my lost pile.  Towards the end he caught on to Yeb Yeb, so he managed hold me to 19 this time instead of 24.<br/>
FW + 19<br/>
2 (+19)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  I won, didn’t I?<br/>
Lows:  It wasn’t sanctioned.  Whats the deal with finals not being sanctioned?<br/>
<br/>
Game Two of Final<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Hunter<br/>
We do our starting jank and I’m perplexed to see not just WYS from him, but also pod racing!  The two very things he swore not to play and here he is playing them!  Ah well.  It didnt even matter I had taken out my Sebulbas racer (the destiny in the deck is 19 ones, then the rest are all 4s, 5s, and 6s for the most part).  He starts SquAss and I do IAO/SP, Mob Points, and No Escape, I believe.  I get my best hand of the day.  I fetch Ozzel and Carida before I activate, I activate, we race, I get Ozzel to the Executor DB, the Bridge with Accelerate Our Plans, and drop Vader and his stick to the Cantina, then replace his Cantina with mine!  He loses one to Visage.  He cant flip first turn.  In fact he doesnt flip once all game.  He loses another to Visage.  I activate 17!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I drain, I fortify Vader with something, and I just draw.  The fast start I got was enough to prevent him from doing anything.  He just kept drawing and losing force.  That’s all he did for like 3 turns.  He even drew up above 12 once, so I could Monnok him Used.  Eventually, when it was clear he wasnt going to win the game, he won the race, causing me a whopping 6 damage, he retrieved, then played I did it.  I think I lost close to 8 force thanks to I did it.  I just didn’t care.  Everyone was sitting there watching Hunter lose, and I just wanted it to be over.  I didn’t care if I won by 2 or 32, I just wanted to be done.  And so I drained him out.  I didn’t count my cards, but there were at least 17 left.<br/>
FW + 1?<br/>
4 (+3?)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  I just beat the #1 ranked player in the world... again?<br/>
Lows:  Hunter obviously didn’t have a good draw.  I mean how hard is it to flip WYS?<br/>
<br/>
Well I get my cash and he gets his, but were stuck waiting for the Coruscant/Tatooine Sealed deck to finish up since both our rides are playing.  We just kinda sit there being bored with Kyle.  It is during this time the title of the report comes about.  Hunter is eating somoene’s peanuts and drops one onto his lap.  I point it out to him and he offers it to me as a souvenir and places it on my deck box.  I can only shake my head at the concept of Hunter’s crotch peanut being my souvenir.  Ah well, Hunter and I head out to eat with Bader at some point... I dunno, the specifics are confusing.  Bottom line is we go home without getting drunk and we watch Robocop 2.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning were all feeling the lack of sleep, but it’s all good.  It’s the invitational, which means I’d get two more shots at Hunter, hypothetically.  Well, I show up and learn that Hunter decided against playing for whatever reason.  As explained in Will’s report there actually weren’t enough people there to do two separate events, so they just kinda mushed ’em together into one big one.  Here we go.<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
WYS Vs Joseph Diniega (1787)<br/>
See Game One from the DPC.<br/>
FW + 21<br/>
2 (+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  None whatsoever.<br/>
Lows:  It really sucked to have to play Joe, with the same decks, in the first game, again.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really felt like @#$% that game.  Like, the last time I felt that bad during a Star Wars game I went 5-1 on the day and lost 32 points.  Needless to say I decided it was in my best interest to drop, especially since Hunter wasn’t there for me to beat up on :)  I’d just like to point out that I normally NEVER drop.  I dont see the point.  I mean, if you are doing crummy, its better to keep playing to get rating points back or whatever.  The only other time I’ve ever dropped was this summer when I was 4-0 and had to go to a party.  Oh well.  I spent the rest of the day helping run the tournament and organizing Kyle’s suitcase of cards that he sold to Scott.  Kyle ended up taking a bus home (wearing my RamapoCon T-Shirt) so that night it was just Jayson, Joey, and Will who did awesome at the mushed invitational, by the way winning himself a box of Coruscant AND Glass.  Unofficial Mad Props go to Scott for the whole prize support (a set of reflections foils, a sheet of foils, 3 boxes of packs distributed amongst all the players, then another box to third place!).<br/>
<br/>
Next morning I eat some buffalo burgers, a long john, and some coffee then were off to the airport.  Joey, Jayson, and Will are kind enough to come with me so we just talk and chill until I have to board.  The flights back are uneventful despite Randi’s annoying antics.  Oh well.  I am lucky enough to get picked up by Greg who I left a message for with one of my friends the night prior at about 2am.  And that was my Labor Day weekend.<br/>
<br/>
MADDEST PROPS GO TO:<br/>
