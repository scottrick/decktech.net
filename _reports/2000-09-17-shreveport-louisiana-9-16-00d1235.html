[Pre-tourney]<br/>
<br/>
Alright, it’s Wednesday and I still don’t know what to play. I know for sure some of the people will be running the same crap cause it wins for them, I hardly ever use the same deck twice in a month. So, I’m sitting around my room and thinking "Geez, light side is just @#$%" I mess around with a TIGIH deck, then try the Speederhaulics deck, but that didn’t fit my style. So I say screw it and work on a Dark Side. I fiddle with a Hunt Down speed dueler, and decide on a BHBM beatdown deck. Saturday rolls around and I have about 2 hours to make and playtest a decent Light Side. I’m flipping through my rare binder and decide on Hidden Base X-Wings. Basic stuff, start Squadron A.ssignments, Insight, and Strike Planning. Threw in 14 Wings, Gen Cal. , GS 1, New Wedge and Ship, Tycho and Ship, just for some easy destinies. I toss in 2 Clouds and Wing Cannons for ROps and Zuckuss/Fett hate. Too bad I never got to play a Ral Op deck. On to the tourney<br/>
<br/>
[End Pre-tourney]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get there around 12 and head over to Burger King to grab some food, eat, and we get started around 1:45 p.m. after Robert Rau (State Champ) got in from Baton Rouge. We had about 11 people I think. On to the games.<br/>

Decks:<br/>
<br/>
Light - HBX with D*2 twists<br/>
Dark - BHBM Beatdown<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - My BHBM vs. James Busby’s [1462] Pile - literally.<br/>
<br/>
I start IAO, YCHF, Mob. Points and the BHBM stuff. He starts Hidden Forest or something. Pretty uneventful game, I hardly remember it. I had Vader and his stick on Endor early and he started losing to Your Destiny, I kept telling him he could get Luke but he refused - go figure. He throws DOS and Gen Lando and Comm Wedge to Vader, YAB DOS, Barrier Gen Cal and beat the hell out of Wedge, next turn Takin comes down with ECC Iggy and Dr E. Operate on DOS and beat Lando to a pulp. I proceed to drain him out. <br/>

Highs: I won.<br/>
Lows: Ummmm.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - My HBX vs. Robert Rau’s [1870’s] ISB<br/>
<br/>
I’m thinking DAMMIT, WHY THE HELL DID I TAKE OUT BLOUNT!! Well, he starts with Imperial Square and drops Yavin 4, so I’m thinking he’s got a freakin huge fleet in his deck. I set up my stuff, Lando in GS1 at Endor 1st turn yadda yadda. I’m pinging him for 1 every turn and he’s building up a m@#$%ive hand. I throw down 4 X-Wings to Endor to back up General and throw down S Foils and Rebel Fleet. He drops Kessel, draws. I’m throwing down system each turn, convert his Kessel. He drops Jabba’s Space Cruiser to Endor and 2 or 3 ORS on it, he then drops ZiMH there and gets hit with It Can Wait. He puts down Devastator, Ozzel, and Evax to Kashyyyk and flips. Moves over to Endor and draws. Hmm. My turn I pull Wedge Leader and throw him to Coruscant with 2 Wings and move em to Death Star and I get away from Endor to Kiffex and flip Hidden Base. Next turn ZiMH comes down with Bossk in Bus to Endor and they move while the Cruiser stays at Endor and he’s chasing Gen Lando. He takes my drains for a while then gets out Den of Thieves. Puts ECC 4 Lom on ZiMH and 2 ORS. So he’s got ZiMH and BiHT. My turn, I put on the foils, drop 3 X wings to ZIMH and BiHT (there were 4 wings there already), drop X Wing Cannons, battle Organized attack, blow Zuckuss out of the sky, draw a 5 for bd and come up with about 40 something and he has to clear Bossk and his loaded Devastator. I drop Legendary Fighter on the Cannon X wing, cause hey, he blew up Zuckuss ;-) Im going around chasing his cruiser and he’s got no more agents on table so hes flipped and I proceed to drain him out.<br/>

<br/>
Highs: I beat the State Champ<br/>
Lows: Ummm.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My BHBM vs. Kirk Rice’s [1503] Rebel @#$% Team Deck<br/>
<br/>
This guy was giving me @#$% the whole tourney and he and his son Andrew are the sorest losers in the world. There just annoying to play and listen to, but fun as hell to beat, which I do on a regular basis. He starts Strike Planning, Insurrection and Squ@#$%in. I get all my stuff set up and toss Vader and stick to Cantina with PotF he’s losing 3 cause he thinks he doesn’t need Honor. He drops Lando in GS 1 to Endor and Tycho...big mistake. I drop DiPO (no immunity for you) BiHT and Fett in Slave 1 to Endor. Battle, make him lose 9, stack a card. Next turn Nien Numb comes to the Falcon, he battles, loses, stacks a card. He loses GS1, dont ask me why. So Fett proceeds beat the hell out of Tycho each turn while make Kirk lose 1 for battle damage, and stacking a card. So he finally puts out Jedi Luke and moves him into the Bunker. Hahaha. I drain for 4, 2, and make him lose 3. He moves Luke out of the Bunker and Obi goes in, followed by U-3PO. He has 3 Charges and still cannot blow the Bunker. Luke is met by his old pal Igar and Tempest 1 and gets whooped on. So now I’m draining total 8 and he’s losing 3 to Your Destiny.<br/>
<br/>
FW by 32 or something.<br/>
<br/>
6(+70’s-80’s)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I beat him like only I could have.<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
<br/>
[Final Game] Game 4 - My HBX vs. Jeremy Sumrall’s [1667] BHBM<br/>
<br/>
I knew this would be what I would have trouble against. I do my first turn Gen Cal thing and set up Wings, I can’t find any damn Wings. Pretty uneventful game. I end up blowing away Zuckuss again and Legendar Fighter blah blah. Draining here and there. He’s losing one a turn. Stacks a couple of cards and turns Luke while I had about 17 cards left.<br/>
<br/>
FL by 20ish<br/>
<br/>
6(+69)<br/>
<br/>
I end up winning the tourney anyways cause I’m that damn good. Pulls were good, I got a Jedi Luke, that makes 3 now.<br/>
