<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">     Let start the night before i want a new light side deck and <br/>
me and my friend are sitting in a room watching tv (8:00 PM).<br/>
My friend Joe ask if i can build is YJ deck, so i built both <br/>
of is deck and play with him to show him how it work (9:00).<br/>
After that Maxim ask if i can built him a YJ dark side and <br/>
look at is SW deck and if i can play test is deck so i say <br/>
no problem(10:00).After that Joe ask told me he dont have <br/>
any LS for SW so itry to built a new deck i never make before<br/>
but on paper look good to me( its a JT3 deck and draining<br/>
on CC with epp and pucumir)(11:00). so i start to be tired <br/>
building deck and watch South Park, and wasting my time<br/>
(1:00am) i look at my dark side and i decide to change nothing<br/>
even if i have to play like a god to win against HB or choke<br/>
deck ( i will post it this weak, its a HD without duel)<br/>
and for light side i was looking for a deck that beat the<br/>
popular DS deck( HD w duel and Ralop ) so i decide its key<br/>
to play CC indoor since at-at ans -st cannot come with retrieval<br/>
and Throne room start is a big advantage in this game. So iam <br/>
still wasting my time and dont make my light side:( (3:00AM) <br/>
we decide to go sleep and we will see each other in 5 hours<br/>
to the YJ tournement.<br/>
<br/>
     I woke up at 7:00 built my LS deck in 15 min grab my <br/>
other deck leave my trade binder( i want to concentrate on <br/>
the game) and run to the rendez-vous point. at the location <br/>
of the championship i realize i have grab the wrong deck:(<br/>
instead of taking my dark deck i grab my funny LS( i dare you<br/>
to post this) so i get in the car and i go get it( lucky<br/>
it was the YJ tourney first and i still have time to play in it)<br/>
<br/>
    After the YJ tourney ( finish 5 i realize this game is 100% luck)<br/>
the SW tourney start with 48 player. Like i said before i will post<br/>
 my deck this weak LS= throne room + choke site + CC drain site (late game with pucumir)<br/>
+ my epp beatdown crew + off/on the edge + high destiny easy to recycle<br/>
( this deck look like a 80 card deck but believe me it fit and work)<br/>
and my DS = HD + IAO w DB + character removal( you are beaten...) + lot of high destiny<br/>
<br/>
game 1 <br/>
LS vs Marc Renaud( tat system with CR and tat:jp<br/>
first turn i deploy 1 2/0 site grab a nudj and deploy orimarko to JP<br/>

<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS vs i dont remember sorry( HB asteroid)<br/>
this game was none interactive and slow because i<br/>
was always talking and asking for card and for ruling<br/>
and he was talking talking and talking at a point a was sure<br/>
it was a tactic to try to catch me off guard( it was the<br/>
first time i see this guy) he was draining for 3 at big one<br/>
but i was canceling it with counter assault, lose 4 each 2 time<br/>
and i blow is x-wing and he was making me lose 4 for ASanctuary<br/>
and i was making him lose 2 for visage each turn and 2 for SADestroy<br/>
each draw phase + draining him for 3 but he was canceling the&lt;drain of 2<br/>
after a couple of turn he decide to flip so i get zuckuss in boat<br/>
to 2 x-wing + deploy first strike + security precaution, i probe kessel<br/>
but its not is base so i attack retrieve one he lose one <br/>
and draw a 7 he lose everything. next turn he pay for the S-foil<br/>
deploy 6 x-wing and attack i draw a 7 he draw a 2 so he say lose your <br/>
zuckuss + 16 force and i say i will lose nothing i show him zuckuss<br/>
is destiny = 0 and show him secutiy precaution:) and during this turn he did not<br/>
deploy x-wing to protect his sanctuary. so during my turn<br/>
i deploy dengar in boat to the field and move it to the big one<br/>
that game i lose no more forece and he his loosing 5 per turn<br/>
FW 2(+14)<br/>
