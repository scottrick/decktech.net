<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well Im back from DragonCon and all I have to say is it was a blast.  I did my share of kicking ass and scrubbing out.  So it all starts about a month ago when I was thinking about going.  I thought Id have a pretty good shot at the open plus I heard about the DS2 pre-release so Im like sure I wanna go.  3 weeks later Im hypedbut there is one prob. Ive got no new deck ideas.  3rd A is still fairly new but those cards don&amp;#8217;t do nothin new for me so Im like @#$%.  Time was drawing nearer and nearer.  I figured set ur course w/and w/o manip would be hot as would Rops.  EBO sucks but I knew people would play it and anything else I was ready for.  I thought about Yops but Rops wrecks it so I say no.  So my choices were clear.<br/>
It would be Throne room mains for LS as it&amp;#8217;s the only thing that beats Rops.  And for DS I will go Rops cuz its bar none the best(just ask Clint he played the same).  So its Thursday the 29th and I leave w/my brother Louis for a long drive.  9 hours later I was in Hot-Lanta.  The city was huge compared to my little ass town and there was just too much to do.  The con was located in the center of town at the Hyatt(huge hotel).  I was staying at a motel called the Super 8 just a little wayz down from all the happenings so that was cool.  So Thursday night I playtested w/my bro a little and got some sleep as the open was at 1 the next day.  I got there early and none was there but that quickly changed.  Im gonna skip strait to the games now as that is what counts.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:LS vs. Tony Zamberlan(Set your course Blue)<br/>
HA just what I expected to see.  He started w/the 3 effects and Im like there goes SAC. I drew the corrider in my opening hand along w/obi so I @#$% that out along with a Hnemthe and goo nee tay.  He puts out Corlag and some ships and sez go.  I give obi his stick and draw some sittin pretty.  His go and he puts presence on the system and u3po on my site.  At the end of his turn I clash the presence and during my control I sorry about the mess and drain.  Put Tantive w/Wedge + Han at the DS and am done.  His go and he puts Kiffex and Big coward and draws.  We trade drains for some time and I finally get luke w/tawss <br/>
At the farm and sit there draining while I ICBW his.  He tries to come to me in both theaters and I just wreck him w/tracked 5s and re-establish my drains.  And that was that.<br/>
FW by 14<br/>
Highs:Countering whatever he did.<br/>
Lows:none<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:DS vs Adam Drake(Obi-Hut mains)<br/>
Well I heard a little about this guy and that he was pretty good so I had to be on the tip-top.  My opening hand is good w/ some sites and his was not too hot so I was glad.  He puts mains at the hut and tries to <br/>
Nabrun over(during his move as I started IAO)but draws high and cant pay so that sux fo him.  All along Im getting more and more set up and drainin and hes hurtin.  He eventually gets over to my planet and does <br/>
Some battlin  but screws up and allows me to YAB boi and beat down Han.  Game set match and a quick one at that.<br/>
FW by 21<br/>
Highs:high diff. Win<br/>
Lows:none again<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:DS vs Louis Cowart(TRM)<br/>
GAY GAY GAY that is all I have to say.  I hate playing my bro but tuff stuff right?  Well Im not going to get into this much but I will say I got an extremely ass draw and almost lost but pulled this one out my ass cuz Im good.<br/>
FW by 2(note:I would not beat him by a lot anywayz and would just draw a lot so that worked out)<br/>
Highs:none<br/>
Lows:playin me bro.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:LS vs Andrew Morris(this deal w/some manip)<br/>
Well I was a little worried as manip in the hands of someone good is bad and Andrew is pretty good.<br/>
He starts the walkway w/Plans and Crush.  My 1st turn I signal goo nee tay play a twix and draw some.<br/>
Ive got 2 lukes and hans so I fear monnok.  His go and he gets the sector draws some and scans.  I shock<br/>
And he never scanned me again.  I go and put luke w/Hnemthe to his site and play another twix and am done.  He goes and monnoks lost cuz he saw all the double mains but I sense.  He draws and says go.<br/>
I am severly chokin him and eventually get the MEGA falcon to space w/OTE and just kill whatever is in the the sky.  He never comes to CC(Im too buff) and the only guy he puts ts mara to the farm which I wreck.  This game was just bad for him.<br/>
FW by 23<br/>
Highs:big win <br/>
Lows:none<br/>
<br/>
So now Im feelin pretty good and think I might have a shot.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5vs Ray Bordier(Coruscant guy/youve heard of him)Set your course with some manip and SAC<br/>
So I a little worried cuz this guy knows his @#$%.  For an explanation of this game just read my 1st one.<br/>
Except this one was more in my favor and he played less space and like 10 vaders.  The only prob. For him was when ever he tried to bring it I would Just draw a 5 and kill vader(this was luck the 1st couple times but then I got to trackin and wrecked even more.  Just totally bad for him.<br/>
FW by 27<br/>
Highs:another BIG win<br/>
Lows:none(see a pattern)<br/>
<br/>
Well at this time Im in 1st followed by clint then Bill Gordon but Clint was just the same side as me so I play bill.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS vs Bills throne room w/Eloms and odds <br/>
Well I was totally unprepared for this and the only odds defense I had was vesdan so I hoped to get him quick.  Well my opening han consisted if the D*, Dagobah cave and the man yes VESDAN.  So his 1st turn he put Tantive to my Star and I cant do @#$% about it so I just work on setting up and flippin.  Which I do.<br/>
The only problem was a mistake on my behalf.Well 2 of them. First I played the man too early which wasnt too bad but when he brought the Eloms I played supid and split my forces leavin Vesdan an easy target.<br/>
I had vader w/Vesdan at the jungle on Bliz.Scout 1 and the desert in the middli and then other guys in a walker at the other end at the forest.  He puts EPP obi and and Elom against Vesdan and vader and Mech<br/>
Failures. Battle Hack vader and Gblow.  I choke the elom and then he draws a 5 forcing me to forfiet Vesdan.  Then he brings the odds and I choke and try to go to space and get beat.  He soon flips me back and I cant really do nothin but drain for little.  In the end it was closer than I thought and he only pulled <br/>
It off by 12.<br/>
FL by 12<br/>
Highs:NOT A DAMN ONE <br/>
Lows:U figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
Well I was a little disappointed but ended up in 5th which raised my spirits a little.<br/>
Clint beat bill twice and won(I knew this would happen)<br/>
<br/>
Well as for the team and the DS2 I totally scrubbed out but had fun and was just totally out of it so I don&amp;#8217;t care.<br/>
