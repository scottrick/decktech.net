<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Recently, every tourney in the greater Cincinnati area has been unsanctioned because of loss of players. I, Alex George, have not been to a tourney since September. I have playtested, but have not played anyone else out of my group of friends. Matt Scott had just been to FCON, and had played some very solid decks, that I decided to duplicate with a few changes. For dark I was playing a LTMTFM with Conduct Your Search to get activation and just pure power, and for Light, a MWYHL with all sorta wacky cards to win the game.<br/>
<br/>
We left around 8:00 AM for the 2.5 hour trek up to Mansfield Ohio. Our team tech for the tourney was listening to FEEL GOOD ROCK &amp; ROLL, a great mix of oldies rock on the road. We get there at 11 and go to Dennys for a nice small lunch. Then Its TOURNEY TIME BABY!<br/>
<br/>
12 people showed, and we waited till pairings were called. My rating going in is 1697.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
My Dagocrap! vs. James Booker (1844) Watto Space<br/>
Well I start DDTA, YISYW, and First Strike. Pull Legendary Starfighter, and Honor. He cannot get out Rendili. He gets a first turn watto, and Blizzard scout 1 to the Junkyard and I go. I deploy yoda and Honor, find his hut and deploy the training area from hand. Get out jedi test 1. I draw the remaining then he goes. He deploys Blizzard 4 and gets out Vader to Mos Espa. Shows a card, Honor cancels it. He moves and Blizzard 4 back to junkyard then I go. I get out daughter. Deploy Wars Not Make One Great. I deploy Uncontrollable Fury on Vader. I draw the rest to get the important cards I may need later for the beatdown. He goes and pays 4 to drain at the junkyard. I had deployed Battle Plan shield. I lose 1. He deploys a system and Boba Fett in Slave One. Then he moves Vader aboard the Blizzard 4, lets it get placed out of play, and vader is lost. He has to lose nothing to Uncontrollable Fury. My turn, I activate a bunch. I complete Jedi Test 1, whoo. I deploy Cappy Han and Falcon vs. Boba Fett. Battle I win, I deploy Legendary, and move them to Dagobah. He goes. He deploys something to the junkyard and Chimaera to space. He shows me a card, I have a sneaking suspicion that it is GA Thrawn so I lose 2 and it goes to Used Pile. He leaves Epp Vader and 4Lom at Mos Espa and I go. I deploy EPP luke, EPP obi, and Lando, Pissed Off to the Junkyard. I battle Watto and Blizzard Scout 1 with Ozzel aboard. I wipe everything out and like 3 extra cards, then move them to Mos Espa and pay for Lando, and He goes. He does nothing, but deploys Zuckuss to space next to Chimeara. Moves his Characters to the Junkyard and Deploys Watto then loses 2 to Legendary. My Turn, I deploy Home One with Corran aboard to battle the 2, he has to lose Chimeara, then I move the Falcon over to his system. He goes does nothing and has to leave Zuckuss there because no other systems are on table. I battle them and he loses him and Ghhk. I Deploy Kessel and move there, and finally control ground and drain him out. Full win by 17 I think.<br/>
FW 2 (16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: a good game for me, kinda sad for him though.<br/>
Lows: nuttin at all.<br/>
<br/>
Yippee..<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
My LTMTFM Winning Deck vs. The Td (forgot his name) THGG deck.<br/>
Well, well, well. I deploy Emperor to the Generator, he goes and deploys Qui-Gon to the Junkyard. I get out some docking bay, Blockade Bridge, Back Door, and Blast Door Controls, I deploy nothing, and draw. He goes and cannot force drain at the Junkyard. And deploys some jank characters to back Quigger up. I deploy nothing, deploy my last docking bay, and no I activate 13 force on my own. WOW. I draw a few. He goes and deploys the Theed Docking bay, and Yoda Master there. Moves Quigger over to the Tatooine Docking bay. My turn. I deploy Lord Maul and his saber, and LS combat with a 7 underneath, draw a 5, he loses Yoda and 4 from top of reserve. He goes, deploys Obi Jedi to the theed docking bay, more @#$%s at Junkyard, and moves Quigger over. I put a 7 underneath maul during his turn. My turn, put a 7 underneath maul, so I LS Combat Quigger, 15 to his something he loses Quigger and 4, and I play Qui-Gons end. His turn. He force Drains for the first turn at the Junkyard and battles with Obi, only to get Stunning leader. I put a 6 underneath Maul before the battle. My turn, put a 6 underneath, LS combat, my 13 to his 5 + 2 So I win by 6 and he loses him and 4 from top. Rewind to deploy phase. I deploy Vader, Dre, and Boba Bounty to Junkyard. He has Jar Jar, Lando wit Axe, Melas, and some other Jank character. I hit lando and hes lost. He tries to hit Dre with Jar Jar and misses of course. I draw 3 destiny and he loses everybody and he draws a 0 so I lose nothing. I control the board. He deployed no more characters for the rest of the game. I force Drain him out. Win by 32.<br/>
FW 4 (48)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Whoopin up<br/>
Lows: Whoopin up a little too much.<br/>
<br/>
EAAARRRRRRRRRR!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
LTMTFM Winning Deck vs. Tyler Martin (1857) QMC basically Winkelhaus Style.<br/>
This was the hardest game of the tournament for me. I deploy Maul with Stick fast to the core with his Saber. I decide not to deploy the Back Door until later as it may hurt me early in the game and give him a first turn flip. He goes and deploys EPP Leia to her Whores Room. He Deploys EPP Luke in the Hallway to stand guard over Leias business. My turn, I deploy Emperor to the Generator after draining for 4 at Mauls site. Draw a bunch. He draws up to try to flip. I drain for 6 total after paying 6 for his Def Shield battle Plan. He goes and deploys QRS and Ric to space and flips. Saves 3. My turn. I deploy Zuckuss in ship, along with 4Lom and Boba. Only to get alternatives to fighting. He had saved 3. his turn. He deploys nothing and does not battle with Queens ship. I battle Queens ship and He loses that and Houjix. He goes. Deploys Wedgies ship and shoots down my ship. @#$%. I go, deploy Vader and Boba to the Drain Canceling site and Battle something only to get it Pathed. I grap Path and deploy Do They Have Code Clearance shield, as I saw an Off The Edge at one point in the turn. He goes and deploys Corran, Paths Obi over, run luke run luke but I play I have you now and he loses everything and I lose EPP Vader. My turn, I deploy my second Vader. And they sit there. I drained. He goes and deploys more characters to the other sites and Pucimir. I go and Drain for 6 cause Menace fades was in effect. He plays Some off the edges to get grabbed. He deploys CCEL to get Masterful move comboed. He drains for 3 after I cancel one drain. He deploys Leia to the Back Door. @#$%. I drain for 6. He drains for 5. I end up winning the Drain race and the game by 3.<br/>
FW 6 (51)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: beating a high rated good player in a good game.<br/>
Lows: beating a fellow Connection member in a brain busting game.<br/>
<br/>
BOOM!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:<br/>
My Dagocrap! vs. Tyler Martin (1857) My Ties!<br/>
I  Messed up at the end of this game catastrophically and ended up losing because of 2 false moves on my part. He is using the Tie deck that I had used for a long time. I deploy my stuff, but he gets a real fast start. The Game consisted of 1 battle in space with Falcon Wackin his troops and Legendary Coming out. I also battled a Tie at his Dbay many a time to retrieve prolly 8 force with DTF. I controlled space late in the game with Home 1 and falcon following each other around. But he kept running away with dreadnaught. He drained for a lot and I got down to 15 cards and he was down to 14. Switch to the Second to last turn of the game. He deploys a Tie to my Docking Bay. And  moves his Tie and Dreadnaught away from my Home one. I go and save 1 force for destiny. I use Depa and say ill move it, then say nvm, but it had to stay since I had put it in Used pile. I battle tie, but have no destiny so I cant kill it. I am so pissed that I forget to move the two ships over. Now he does not have to pay to drain and drains for like 8. I go and drain for 2 and battle but in the end. I lose cause of my one mistake. If I would have killed his tie, he would have had to pay 4 to drain and he could not have own cause I woulda owned him. Damn. Lose by 14.<br/>
FL 6 (37)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none<br/>
Lows: see above<br/>
<br/>
AAAAAAAAAHHH JIZZ!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:<br/>
LTMTFM Winning Deck vs. Matt Scott (1896) His Dagocrap!<br/>
Well I know his deck and he knows mine since he played them both at Worlds. Only difference between My Dagocrap! And His Dagocrap!, is that he plays with Plo Koon, and I play with Depa Bilaba. Ok now on with the game. First turn, I deploy Emperor Palpatine and Blast Door Controls, get out Executor Docking bay, and draw 1 I think. He goes. He gets Daughter, Yoda, Yodas Hut, Training Area, and Jedi Test 1 down. I go. I do not deploy anything and I drain for 2 at the Generator, for 3 force with his Battle Plan shield. I draw a few force and leave 1. He completes his Jedi Test. He deploys EPP Luke and Battles. He targets Emperor and gets a 6 and a.. 1!. I draw a 7 for destiny, imp power 13 he gets a 5 so he has to lose Luke, and I lose nothing. My turn, I drain for 2 and draw a little bit. He goes and deploys Obi wan with stick to the emperors site, thinking he cannot have the same bad luck twice. Battles, and draws a 2 and a 4. Yip Yip. I get a 5 for destiny and He does not beat me in power so I lose nothing and he loses Obi. <br/>
***alert*** no more battles for the entire rest of the game.***end alert***<br/>
I go and drain. Deploy Maul and his stick. Get out the Blockade bridge. I decide that deploying the Back door would be a huge mistake on my part, so I do not do it. By now all my sites are out and I control both of my locations so I can now drain for 4. He goes and deploys Kessel, Home one with Haashhn, and Falcon with Cappy. I go, drain for 4. He goes, drains for 3, I plop down Enter the Bureaucrat. He controls it. I go drain for 4. He goes, drains for 3, I plop down my second ETB and once again his last Control smacks it back to my Lost pile. We end up just having me drain for 4 and him drain for 3 for the rest of the game, with me coming up on top with a win by 12.<br/>
FW 8 (49)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: It is my first Tournament win against Matt Scott<br/>
Lows: Boring Dagocrap.<br/>
<br/>
WHOOO can you Say REBOUND BABY!<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:<br/>
My Dagocrap! Vs. some Robert guy that I forget his name with a high rating AOTBS Racer<br/>
I know that I have this game won from the start cause I have all the counters to this. I get out Honor and Legendary. This game is also for the tourney cause he has 4 wins and 1 timed win. So if I win, I win the tourney. He starts Presence of the Force as his effect and gets the Auto Flip. He does me one damage, but I deploy Battle plan, so he does me no force drain. He deploys Mandalorian Armor on Xisor, and Draws the rest. I go, deploy Yodas Hut, and Trainging area and Daughter. Deploy Wars not Make One Great, and Honor.  Draw the last card. He goes deploys Broken Concentration, so I can no longer complete my test at all, there goes the Vigo Drain canceler. He drains for one, and I lose Uncontrollable Fury. He does not deploy anything. And draws 8 and saves 3. I go. Deploy Yoda, Jedi council chamber, Depa, and draw until 3 cards are left. He deploys nothing, and just lets me go after drawing a few cards. I deploy Kessel, and Falcon and Home One. He goes. Does nothing once more except drain for 1 and wins the race. I lose 6, He does not retrieve cause I deploy Aim high and he has nothing left. He saves 3. I go, and drain for 3. Deploy Epp Luke, and then EPP Obi, only to get imp Wookie Kissed. I battle, unluckily Miss, do not get destiny and he does not lose Xizor. Damn, but I do Resilience Luke back to my hand. He now knows that EPP Obi is coming back down, so he deploys a 3 man alien bounty hunter back up squad for Xizor. I go. Deploy EPP Luke, EPP Obi for free, and Lando, Scoundrel. I do not drain. I pay 2 to battle and 2 to retrieve 2. I hit xizor, and Dengar, he hits no one. I get destiny, and he loses everything. I draw a few and get all 4 of my OOCs, that I had been saving. I play all 4, and he has 8 in lost pile. I unluckily do not get Xizor, damn. He goes and deploys some space beats up against Falcon. I have to lose it and cappy cause He has 2 destiny. I go deploy Home one and Corran Horn. Battle he is out of space except for Bossk. He goes and battles and bossk is gone. I go and drain for 3. His turn he beats down on my characters and they are all lost. I go deploy a beatdown to his CC docking bay, and beat on 4lom and P59. He misses, and I win the battle and control that site. I then drain for 4 while he drains for 1 for the rest of the game, and I end up draining him out and win by 17.<br/>
