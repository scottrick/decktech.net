Day 1 of worlds updated!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunatly I wasn’t able to play in anything since last month inlcuding Decipher Day at NYC and a couple locals, but whatever.  Stupid parents.  So I was really looking forward for this weekend of playing (second TR forth coming).  Anyway, over the Kashyyyk list serv (see my page if you want a link to join!) a challenge was issued.  My boy, Stevie B was SURE that he or Mike Schiemer was going to win- NOT a HUNTER.  So I (and my bro, I guess ;) had my work cut out for me.  Friday roles around and I needed to take a bunch of tests at home so I could play.  When they were all done it was pretty late and I still hadn’t touched my light deck since last month.  Now, I knew my dark was solid, so I only needed to tweak a couple cards.  It was basically a non dueling HDADTJ starting the Epic Duel as a bluff, then I run a couple Imperial Commands and much power.  Lots of Visages so the destiny evens out.  For Light I had this @#$%ty Brentson’s Beats from the Hidden Base Platform.  Just a couple Tunnel Visions, some TT/OOCs, a couple Clashes, Beggar, the usual.  <br/>
<br/>
I go to sleep late, and wake up at about 9, suddenly remembering I needed to be at the train station in 20 minutes.  You see, in talking on the serv and on AIM I had arranged to meet Travis "Com Igar" Rumans at the local train station so he could finally play some Wars since arriving at Tufts.  Last minute I convinced my North Eastern friend Chris Cislik to also catch the train.  So I shower quickly and speed over.  Note: Metallica is a great catalyst for speeding when one is late.  I pick ’em w/o problem and we head home first stopping at Dunkin Donuts.  Good Stuff.  It’s now like 10 or something and the tourney doesn’t start till 12 so we play some games.  Travis beats my ill-constructed light deck with some cool tech (reacting with both the accuser and the shield to kessel- lucky me he didn’t have all power to weapons!), so I edit it, and we’re off to the Holiday Inn (I live in Boxborough).  We get there with plenty of time, I pick up my 1/2 box of RII and box topper I won last time, and it turns out 32 people in attendance!<br/>
<br/>
My rating prior to the tourney was 2131 (12-0 local preformances not in).<br/>
<br/>
Game One<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Jeremy Arak’s (1517) EBOX<br/>
I start IAO and Mobil Points every game.  This time my 3rd effect was YCHF so I can get Battle Order or S+D.  I get one of the 2 in my opening hand.  Vader finds his saber and makes his way to a DB for the flip.  Visage starts doing its thing, and soon Mara and Saber get down for some S+D.  Battle order hits the table and I establish a presence in space draining at carida for 2 with Chinreau.  This game is over quickly.<br/>
FW +29<br/>
2 (+29)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Seeing Jeremy again.  Dark deck working like a machine, as it should.<br/>
Lows: Beating him by so much.<br/>
<br/>
Game Two<br/>
Hidden Beats Vs Michael "The Rattler" Schiemer’s (1993) HDADTJ<br/>
As Mike mentions in his report this matchup is inevidable.  I start by pulling out locations with Insurrection and HB (I also started BPlan and Insight, he started SSP fearing my non existant retrieval) and canceling visage a couple times.  We just battle a couple times with vader clashed alot for most of them.  I was unable to find my OTE to make that any effective, and due to the poor destiny my efforts were unable to remedy I never succeded in hitting much so he never lsot more than a couple from battle damage.  Basically he jsut smacked down my leia and obi by deploying boba, jabba, dr.e and ponda to vaders site and operating on leai and raping obi, though i was able to get a 10 point beat down towards the end.  My deck wasn’t jsut cohesive enough to handle a player of his calibur.<br/>
FL -8<br/>
2 (+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: A good game.<br/>
Lows: I suck ballz.<br/>
<br/>
Game Three<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Jeremy Crusco’s (1556) EBO Stone Pile<br/>
Jeremy remarks that we haven’t played in a long while and I agree.  He starts BPlan, Strike Planning, and Wise/DoDn, I go for YCHF again.  To my dismay S+D is in my opening hand, but whatever.  Vader comes out fast, mara too, S+D and vsiage start the direct damage, but my hand remains very small since battle plan is making pay for my drains of 2.  He gets out dagobah and the jungle (so you can’t land ships) and stone piles what little remains of my hand.  Corran comes to the holo theatre to cancel visage and a couple of scrubs go to the 4th marker.  Its takes me a long time to get guys into hand, but in the meanwhile i satisfy BPlan and play my own Order.  There was only one real battle- I had deployed Thrawn on the Chimaera and battle generel lando in gold squad 1, but he played punch it so he was immune and he drew fantastic destiny.  Alas, my quick start was enough to put me ahead enough for the win.<br/>
FW +10<br/>
4 (+31)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Stone Pile!<br/>
Lows: I was pissed from losing so I wasn’t really in this game.<br/>
<br/>
Game Four<br/>
Hidden Beats Vs Brian "ReeYees" Partridge’s (1680) BHBM TIE #s<br/>
Brian’s the man.  He’s a really cool kid who had a decent rating till some local where he he did poorly.  Anywho, he needed to borrow the 3x Tech Mors for the deck from me so i knew to start Bplan, Insurrection, and Insight.  He gets out the emperor to the D*II DB, and wakulemi, but doesn’t do much more.  He just kept drawing and drawing- looking for Vader presumably.  This gives me ample time to duibld a sizable force pile and as such a great hand via tunnel vision. The game ends like this:  I activate, I deploy Beggar, I use 2 of his force and 4 of mine to deploy Lando w/ Axe to the D*II:DB.  He Force lightnings and kills him, so I Tunnel for Blount, who lives since force lightning is unique.  Luke, Liea, and Han follow with DTF at their heals.  I Battle, hit the emperor and since i used 2 blasters my power was +5 thanks to AIM high.  The smoke clears and he needs to lose the emperor and 31 force.<br/>
FW +33<br/>
6 (+64)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: 31 point beat down.<br/>
Lows: No Grimtaash.<br/>
<br/>
Game Five<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Steve "Stevie B" Baroni’s (1792) Anti-Me TRM<br/>
Time to make Baroni eat his words.  I start crush cause i know he’s playing revo.  He just activate and doensn’t pull a DB or draw.  I’m like WTF?  so i pull evader/monnok, ozzel and with imp command, drop carida and the EX: DB and ozzel to it. On his turn he drops obi’s appiration on the holotheatre (that is in the middle of the 3 ex sites) and a twix and a DB while pulling the other.  @#$%.  I just conserve force all game- being very glad he didn’t include battle plan in his deck.  Goo nee tay comes out, and things go slowly.  Fortunatyl he has trouble getting twixs, and he never plays more than one revo.  Zuckass gets to carida and he deploys dash in ship and battles, i stupidly forget to draw batele destiny, so i lose some force.  My turn i drop lateral damage, Thrawn on the Dvastator, and i do a ton of damage to him.  Later I amass a force at the CC: downtown plaza, and we play cat and mouse for a while with the D* and CC* DBs.  I’m just able to get a bigger force and keep winning fights.  Once i’m back on the 7 side visage comes back from being canceled and i win with ease.<br/>
FW +20<br/>
8 (+84)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating the deck that was specifically designed to defeat mine.<br/>
Lows: Neh.<br/>
<br/>
Game Six<br/>
Hidden Beats Vs Eric "Bounty22" Hunter’s (1960) BHBM TIES<br/>
Another one of those matchups that always happens.  Despite the fact his deck is TIEs space is never committed to by either of us.  I just use spies and epp luke from the deck to do some quick battling against his emperor and janus.  Key battle occured after he used emperor and epp vader (with luke in my lost pile) to beat down obi.  He lost vader due to attrit.  I came back with Epp Han, Leia, and Luke, for like 10 or 11 battle damage cause i missed hitting him.  DTF is my friend.  Then, to add insult to injury, i manage to place vader OOP when he has like 20-25 cards in lost pile.  From there we just skirmish with invinvible luke flying around everywhere.<br/>
FW +17<br/>
10 (+101)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Placing Vader OOP.<br/>
Lows: Playing my bro.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out Mike Schiemer went undefeated, but had 2 timed wins, so his differential was one less than mine, so I won the tourney proving once and forever that HUNTERs are incapable of losing tournaments.  I got SW Trivial Pursuit and a Bith collector’s edition toy.  Brian Czienski (sp?) came in third, and Eric, Steve, Michael Hawley, and Jimmy Schiemer all came in somewhere up there too.  <br/>
<br/>
After the tourney (and a couple good hits) Steve was at it again playing a fun game against my man Jim "Eclypse" Valeri.  It was mad funny and loud, with like everyone watching and Kris Earle, the TD, telling us to shut up like every other up.  Steve proved he is a tracking machine while Jim’s AOBS raped his force choke deck.<br/>
<br/>
During this time my mom arrived and loaded up the van with kids so when I drove Steve to my house I found Chris and Travis, and the Schiemer Bros there.  Soon the Schiemers parents came and we dropped Chris off at the train station.  Steve and Travis stayed the night for tommorows tourney in worcester.  I was upset my light deck preformed so pourly so i stayed up mad late cooking up another gay light deck that you’ll read about in the next TR.<br/>
