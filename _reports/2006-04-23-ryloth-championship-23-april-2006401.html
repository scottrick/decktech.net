<blockquote><font class="bfont"> RYLOTH CHAMPIONSHIP, 23 APRIL 2006 (NETHERLANDS).<br>
<br>
This year’s championship of the Netherlands (the Ryloth area) took place in the city of Eindhoven, in a place called 'het dorpshuis'. Entry fee was 10€ and prize support provided by Chris Menzel and Dennis Hes. The latter organized this event for us and offered us FREE drinks the whole afternoon, Woot!!!!<br>
<br>
I came along with Kris and Cedrik, who was the driver. The fuel was also for free!!<br>
<br>
I am the tournament director so the entry for me is also free. Anyway, I was the judge and did not play. Judges are not allowed to play and judge during championships.<br>
<br>
I’ll give you the important stats and results, detailed reports will come soon from other players.<br>
<br>
Ten peeps showed up: five home players, three from Germany and two from Belgium.<br>
<br>
The time schedule was tight, we had only 7 hours time to play six games. Unfortunately, Chris Menzel came in too late and I had to give him a game loss. OOPS. Kris van Beurden got the easiest victory in his SWCCG career. A bit pity that Chris came too late, the matchup would have been Dark senate vs. Light senate!<br>
<br>
Today was the really first real test in the area for V11, the tournaments held before were too sparsely populated or scrubby and could hardly be seen as a real test for the latest virtual set.<br>
<br>
During the first round, the tone was immediately set. 10 minutes gone and an awful lot of annoying cards on table: back door effects, luke luuke(v), the professor, Sim aloo(v), forced landing(v), dismantle on sight(v) (yes, this one too), jedi tests, undercover spies plus other random evasion and NPE cards. Only TRM was missing.<br>
<br>
All games in round 1 are full wins with very high differential between +21 and +29. Light and Dark each won two times.<br>
<br>
Second round Chris Menzel also played, dark side win 4 out of 5, two time wins though.<br>
<br>
Third round again dark beats light with 4 - 1. One time win.<br>
<br>
Standings half way:<br>
<br/>
1.	Martijn Peeters 6(+54)<br/>
2.	Cedrik Vanderhaegen 4(+57)<br/>
3.	Frans Zwiers 4(+13)<br/>
4.	Paul Van Hoorne 4(+11)<br/>
5.	Chris Menzel 3(-1)<br/>
6.	Dennis Hes 2(+9)<br/>
7.	Kris Van Beurden 2(-7)<br/>
8.	Johannes Kriedel 2(-34)<br/>
9.	Andreas Holtmann 0(-48)<br/>
10.	Patrick Leenders 0(-55)<br/>
<br/>
Round four ends with 3 – 2 for light, one time win. Cedrik (two time wins, 6 points) and Martijn (four full wins, 8 points) are the only unbeaten players, the odds that none of them will win this tourney are very small as third place Kris is at 4 points; Martijn and Cedrik are tied against each other.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth round again 3 – 2 for light but only full wins now. Cedrik beats Martijn and both are at 8 points and very high differential. One of them will win this tourney, the others are too far behind. Martijn and Cedrik play each other again in the last round. A real final confrontation!<br/>
<br/>
Sixth round Martijn beats Cedrik with +17. Once again 5 full wins, 3 – 2 for light.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Dark wins with 17 -13 (including the forced game loss from Chris Menzel round 1). It seems that –despite all ongoing discussions stating that light is way too strong nowadays – the Ryloth championship brought balance to the force.<br/>
<br/>
Sim aloo(V) was included in almost every deck, but he hit the table only after light had done the most important downloads. However, he won the game for dark on a few occasions but that does not explain why dark today was stronger than light.<br/>
<br/>
The complete absence of TRM might be an excuse but that deck is very unpopular here. I played a TRM myself during V7 but that was the last TRM I’ve seen around here. Nobody likes to play with or against it. Two years of tournaments without a viable TRM, in the USA they will not believe this :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A TRM-less world doesn’t mean we’re all scrubs and noobs. On the contrary: I’ve looked trough the decklists myself and I can confirm 100% that a lot of creativity, originality and combo’s were included in today’s decks. Deckbuilding is the strong point here in Europe, making the meta very difficult to predict. See for yourself: two WYS, two Watto and two MWYHL almost identical, the three tank decks differ from each other and 11 other decks. Also interesting is the absence of huntdown decks.<br/>
<br/>
The only really drawback today is Sim aloo(v), many players included this one multiple times. The more I read this card, the worse it becomes. What the hell was going on in the heads of the designers??? Turn 1 Sim against MWYHL or a WYS(V): game. Using darklighter spin and squad wookie in a hidden base? Each ship with matching pilot costs you 4 force extra. Ridiculous. Please give this critter a huge errata. We URGENTLY need more constructive play, sim is just one of the many NPE cards around today, despite the wide variety of decks shown today.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing I noticed: very few emperor’s power(V) and SAC being played.<br/>
<br/>
So, that’s it for now. I learned a lot today, even if I didn’t play. But making a good deck for the regional next week will be something extremely difficult I really don’t know which decks I have to build.       <br/>
