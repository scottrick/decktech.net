<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I decided to attend a Wednesday night tournament at the Wizards of the Coast store in Utica, MI.  The problem was  that it started at 6PM, and I lived all the way across town.  So I was looking at a 45 minute drive without traffic, and as all metropolitan residents know, the traffic is heavy between 5 and 6.  I called the TD at 5 minutes until 6 and told him I was coming, but I'd be about 5 minutes late. He told me he had 14 players and that I'd get the bye for the first round.<br/>
<br/>
So I finally get there, and the store doesn't have any EPP except Obi.  I needed Obi, Han and Leia for the deck I was playing since I only had one copy of each.  Didn't matter though since I had left my credit card at the other card shop I had checked for that stuff.  I had picked up a Mara there.  So I called the other card shop and he said he did have my card and that he'd hold it for me until my tournament there on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
The way this trip was shaping up I was pretty worried.  My DS deck was all set.  I was ready to play Hunt Down with dueling.  My LS deck was going to be a variant of my Beatdown with A Great Warrior deck that is on display at Decktech.  I had to replace three EPPs with regular characters.  So I put Obi-Wan, Daughter of Skywalker and Han Solo in for the EPP versions of those personas.  I was just in time as the pairings for the 2nd game were being called.<br/>

Highlights: Full win.<br/>
Lowlights: Poor differential. <br/>

Overall total: 2(0)<br/>

Game 2- My LS Beatdown with A Great Warrior vs. Wolf Diamond-Innes (1500) DS Cloud City deck<br/>
<br/>
Wolf was a very inexperienced player playing in her first tournament.  Yes, I did say her.  I started with Mind What You Have Learned (MWYHL), Dagobah and Draw Their Fire on the table, and she started with a Cloud City site that gave her 2 force and myself one.  On her turn she deployed another CC site and Bespin and she dropped 2 destiny 3 characters and inserted Never Tell Me The Odds.  Not a bad first turn for a beginner!  I activated and deployed Yoda from hand and the Training Area from my deck.  I like being able to take things out of my deck because it often extends the amount of time the insert spends in my deck.  She drained me for 1 on her next turn, and deployed a couple more CC sites.  She dropped another two characters to a second CC site where she would be draining for 1 force.  Now I would be looking at losing 8 force if the insert popped up.  I activated the full amount, 10 force, and was fortunate to not see an insert staring at me.  I removed a Great Warrior from my reserve deck using the Training Area and deployed Yoda's Hut from my reserve deck using Dagobah, and then I made sure I got my deck shuffled up as the insert had been close to coming up.  I pulled Tawss Khaa from my force pile using a Tunnel Vision and deployed him as my trainee with Great Warrior on the training area. Wolf forced drained at her 2 Cloud City locations.  I took the drains and she deployed characters to a third CC site.  On my previous turn I had drawn Chewie with Blaster Rifle and BoShek.  After she drew up, I activated 12 (no insert) and then I attempted my test only to fail.  I only drew one destiny though as I had forgotten my MWYHL game text.  So I dropped BoShek and Chewie on an Ugnaught and Avarik.  Started a battle and retrieved 1 for Draw Their Fire and she lost 1.  At this point I explained one of the cardinal rules of SWCCG: don't deploy without 4 ability unless you have an extremely good reason for doing so (i.e Lone Warrior).  I shot the ugnaught and she lost Avarik to attrition plus about 5 other cards.  Wolf drained me for 1 on her turn and then she deployed Bossk in the Tooth at Bespin.  She then proceeded to draw.  I activated 3, and since I had forgotten to deploy a site from my deck on the previous turn I played a Signal.  I pulled Descent Into the Dark.  After shuffling I continued to activate.  I think I activated another 9 force without seeing the insert.  Then I drew 2 destiny for my jedi test.  The first one was 'Star Destroyer!, so I passes the test.  I drained for 2 with Chewie and Shek, and then I drew up.  I got Daughter and Lando's Falcon.  Wolf drained me at 3 locations on her turn and then deployed some weak characters to one of her already occupied sites.  On my turn I activated 12 force and the insert popped up.  I had a Shek, Chewie and Yoda for 3 and she had deployed a destiny 2 character and had a total of 8. I lost 5, then drained for 2.  I dropped the Falcon with Daughter on Bossk. Started a battle and retrieved 1 for Draw Their Fire and she lost 1. She forfeited Bossk and I took control of Bespin.  I drew Obi with saber and a Tunnel Vision and two more cards.  On her turn Wolf drained for 2.  Then she drew.  I drained for 2 at my CC site and 2 at Bespin.  I played Tunnel Vison to get Luke and dropped them on 2 more aliens where Wolf had not deployed 4 ability. Started a battle and retrieved 1 for Draw Their Fire and she lost 1.  I hit both characters and she had to lose about 10 cards.  On her turn Wolf drained and moved her remaining characters to block my drain with Chewie.  I then drained at Bespin and at Obi's CC site.  I played Tunnel Vision to grab a Nabrun.  I played the Nabrun to move Obi and Luke to visit Chewie and Shek. Started a battle and retrieved 1 for Draw Their Fire and she lost 1.  At this point the Descent Into The Dark was very imporatant as the cards I had used for Nabrun were being recycled and I needed destinies for my weapons.  I hit three characters played Jedi Presence to make Luke power 10 and Chewie power 12.  Game Over.  I won by 15, most of which was active force.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Remembering to draw 2 destiny with MWYHL and passing Great Warrior with Tawss Khaa.  Winning every battle and remembering to retrieve every time I started a battle.  Making Luke power 10 and Chewie power 12 in the game ending battle.<br/>
Lowlights: Playing a newbie and only getting one rating point for the whole round, despite not losing.<br/>
<br/>
Game total: 2(+15)<br/>
Overall total: 4(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-  My DS Hunt Down with Dueling vs. Brad Boza's (1532) Quiet Mining Colony (QMC)<br/>
I started the game with the Holotheater with Visage and Meditation Chamber.  Brad started with Insurrection on the table in addition to the locations the QMC allows.  I got the Audience Chamber and Mara's Saber in my opening hand, so I deployed the Chamber, Mara from my deck and the Saber from my hand and then I deployed Bad Feeling Have I from my hand.  We each lose 1 force for Visage.  Brad deploys three locations and then deployed Threepio to the Audience Chamber and drew some cards and we each lost a card for Visage.  I drained for 2 with Mara, played a successful Sniper on Threepio and drew up. We each lose 1 force for Visage.  Brad drops EPP Luke on Mara.  He hits with the saber and I miss with mine.  He drew a nice destiny too.  I lost 5 cards and Mara and he forfeited Luke. Then we each lost 1 force for Visage.  I deployed the Cloud City Downtown Plaza on my turn with Vader with Saber there and Dengar with Carbine.  I save 3 force since I was holding Force Field.  Brad loses 1 force since I flipped my objective.  Brad deploys Obi with Saber to the audience chamber.  Then we each lose 1 force for Visage.  I drain Brad for 2 at the plaza, and then I hit it with a Presence Of The Force.  At that point I deployed Epic Duel, which I somehow forcot to deploy from my deck to start the game.  I deployed Mara and Bossk at the Audience Chamber, and initiate.  I target with the Mortar Gun and I capture Obi.  I flip my objective again and he loses 1 force for Visage and I move my 2 characters outside to the recently deployed Tusken Canyon.  Brad moved straight to his draw phase and then lost 1 for Visage.  I drained for 3 at the plaza and 2 at the Canyon.  I drew some cards, and made Brad lose 1 for Visage.  Brad dropped EPP Han and EPP Leia at the Canyon.  He hit Bossk with Leia after I used 3 force to cancel the first targeting of Bossk by Han.  In the meantime Bossk had missed with the Carbine.  My hope was that I could  capture Leia, and leave Han by himself.  So I lose Mara to attrition after he draws 2 destiny and he lost Han and got Obi Wan back.  We each lost a force this turn for Visage.  I drained at the plaza for 3.  Then I asked if all those cards were his force pile.  Brad said yes.  I asked if he had a reserve deck, and he said no.  So I played an Elis Helrot during my move phase and initiated an epic duel against Obi.  I drew my two destiny and he didn't have any, so Obi was placed out of play.  The game ended when he didn't have enough left to lose the 9 cards for Epic Duel.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning the game on an Epic Duel.  Capturing Obi-Wan with Bossk.<br/>
Lowlights:  Missing the capture of Leia, which would have kept Obi in my possession.  Forgetting to put Epic Duel on the table to begin the game.  Not finding either of my Grand Moff Tarkins.  Forgetting to activate extra force every time I had Vader on the table.<br/>
<br/>
Game total: 2(+21)<br/>
Overall total: 6(+36)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4- My LS Beatdown with A Great Warrior vs. Kyle Sultes' (1472) Imperial Occupation<br/>
Kyle started with Dantooine and the Jungle.  I though that was a bit odd, since most players start with the Forest, but to each his own.  I started Draw Their Fire.  Kyle started quickly by deploying an operative and a pair of sites from reserve deck.  He also deployed Bane with the operative.  On my turn I deployed the Training Area from my deck and Yoda's Hut from my hand.  I paid 3 to deploy Yoda at the Hut from my deck and took Great Warrior into my hand.  I had Tawws Khaa in my hand, but decided that I'd rather draw than deploy Tawws.  I drew Obi-Wan and so that was a great decision.  Kyle drained me for 2 at the Jungle and deployed an operative and a character to the Forest.  I saw that I had a Planet It Is Farthest From in my force pile when I played a Tunnel Vision, but I also had EPP Luke.  I chose to get Luke and go for the beatdown.  I deployed both EPP Luke and EPP Obi to the Forest.  Kyle had left himself with a unique biker scout and the operative, so I battled and retrieved one, while Kyle lost 1.  I hit the operative with Obi, but missed the biker with Luke.  Then I draw a 0 for destiny.  Still, my opponent was looking at 7 damage.  He forfeited the scout and tried to play a Ghhhk, but I reminded him he had to have force to do that because of Draw Their Fire, and so he just lost cards.  I moved Obi and Luke over to the Jungle to block the drain against me.  Kyle merely move the characters back to the Forest on his turn.  Before that he had deployed a Spaceport Docking Bay.  That was useful as it allowed me to play Shocking Information.  Kyle had also proceeded to deploy a Biker Scout, an operative and a Speeder Bike at the Docking Bay on his turn.  On my turn I didn't have a drain, but I finally had a chance to play a Signal to get The Planet It Is Farthest From out of my deck.  I deployed that on Dagobah and targeted Dantooine.  I also deployed Tawws with Great Warrior to Yoda's Hut and this reminded me that I was supposed to be deploying Dagobah sites from my deck, so I got out the Swamp and deployed it.  I drew some cards and got a Tunnel Vision and a Han Solo.  Kyle proceeded to drain me for 1 at each of his 2 Dantooine sites, and the he tried to deploy a Dreadnaught straight to Dagobah.  I reminded him of the Dagobah rules, and told him he'd have to deploy it at Dantooine and move it over to Dagobah.  So He deployed it at Dantooine and then he realized he didn't have the hyperspeed to make it to Dagobah.  He deployed another Biker Scout with Bane at the Forest along with a Bike.  On my turn I drew 2 destiny and passed my Jedi Test.  Then I deployed Lando in the Falcon with Melas to help him fly the thing to Dantooine.  I battled and retrieved one while Kyle lost 1 for Draw Their Fire.  The battle damage was satisfied by the Dreadnaught.  On Kyle's turn he drained me for 1 at each of his 2 Dantooine locations.  The he proceeded to flip his objective by deploying another non-unique site to Dantooine.  At that site he deployed his third operative a biker scout and a Bike.  He also deployed a second biker scout and bike to the docking bay.  On my turn I decided to play a Tunnel Vision and pulled a Nabrun Leids.  I moved Luke and Obi over to the just deployed location.  I played Mechanical Failure on the Jungle targeting the Bike with Obi and Luke.  This made the bike power=0, but the pilot was also power=0 because of the bike's text.  Next, I deployed EPP Han and EPP Leia with Luke and Obi.  I initiated a battle and retrieved a force, while Kyle lost 1 for Draw Their Fire.  I had been holding Frozen Assets and Beggar, but my opponent did not have any active force, which surprised me because of the number of reacting cards he had on the table.  So I played some interrupts: Jedi Presence, I Know, Gift of the Mentor, Skywalkers and Don't Get Cocky.  I forgot to target with my weapons, but when I remembered it after drawing battle destiny I realized it didn't matter anyway.  My rebels with Obi were all battling at double power and were power 10, 8, and 6.  So I had 29 in personal power.  I drew 9 battle destiny as I forgot the extra destiny entitled by the EPP cards, so I could have drawn 2 more.  I total power of 54 and my opponent had 3.  So he had 48 or 49 battle damage after forfeiting. Game Over.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning the game on one big battle.  Passing my Jedi Test with Tawws for the second game in a row.<br/>
Lowlights:  Forgetting to target with the EPPs and draw the extra battle destiny I was entitled to.<br/>
<br/>
Game total: 2(+23)<br/>
Overall total: 8(+59)<br/>
<br/>
Well, it was a fun tournament, but I finished third as there wound up being 2 other guys who were undefeated and neither of them had received a bye, so they had higher differentials.  I realized I needed a lot of practice and that I am still making several mistakes, which will cost me when I play against better competition.  <br/>
