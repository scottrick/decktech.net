<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first attempt at a tourney report. I always read everyone else's and decided it was time to give<br/>
something back. This was the first tourney I've been to in over 8 months due to work, so I expected to feel<br/>
the full wrath of many of the different strategies. This was also my first tourney in a new region, having just<br/>
moved from Tattoine to Dantooine. Picking decks is always hard, especially against unknown players.<br/>
Having no feel for the local game, I decided to have fun with my decks. I took a Dark Tatooine Occupation<br/>
and a Light DOS to Jedi Knight Ph.D.. My goal was to have fun and finish at  3-3 for the day. This was the<br/>
annual Halloween Tourney where costumes were encouraged. I took a pass on that. The decision on who<br/>
would win costume of the day was never in doubt, thanks to Chris Gregg, errr Queen Amidala or Queen<br/>
Gregg. While not nearly as revealing as his Slave Leia from last year, he made a lovely queen. My wife was<br/>
impressed with the boots and dress, but couldn't get over the eyebrows. Pluck'em next time, Chris. This also<br/>
was a sendoff to Matt Lush before Worlds. He was sporting the full Pimp Daddy look with a great jacket<br/>
and a fly hat. Best of luck at Worlds, Matt. All stuff aside , lets get to the games. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 DS Vs LS HB/ RFC Kessel Runs/ Wise Advice<br/>
<br/>
I had started with Combat Readiness to Pull The System and Jabbas Palace first turn, but changed to<br/>
Security Precautions on Jabbas Palace. I dug for the Audience chamber and put out Jundland Wastes. <br/>
Monnok first turn netted 2 Bulk Cruisers and revealed a lack of characters.  On his turn, he deployed<br/>
several systems (Ralitir, Kessel, ...). This gave me more than enough force to deploy some big blue from my<br/>
hand. Blizzard 2, pilot and some little alien Named M&amp;#8217;iiyoom Onith as a passenger. He deployed Boshek to<br/>
Kessel and proceeded to fortify it with tons of ships. Every turn from here out, Onith eats every character in<br/>
sight. Obi, Han, Wedge. They all went while setting up a steady drain on with a Presence of the force, And<br/>
ETE on  the wastes. Feeling pretty good I decide to invade space and probe.  I know the base is Kessel. I<br/>
put out Vaders Shuttle, Ozzel and some other pilot and move to probe. Only he hasn't flipped yet. This is<br/>
going to hurt. Next turn, he cleans the sight out and I lose a few cards. After losing every character things<br/>
are looking bad. He plays a Kessel run on Boshek at Corillia, moves to Kessel. I draw destiny: Dag Cave.<br/>
Goodbye Boshek. Now it's down to a drain race. He flips and I start looking for any ships or battle order.<br/>
No luck till at the very end, vader and tarkin probed Kessel ending the game. Full win 2(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Drawing 0 on a Kessel run to lose the ship and Boshek.<br/>
Lowlights: Trying to probe before the flip. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS MWYHL  vs DS Ice Plains/Combat Readiness3rd Marker(?)/Broken Concentration<br/>
<br/>
That summed it up right there. Broken concentration was rough. Luckily he had a hard time drawing sites.<br/>
That let me stay in the game for some time. While struggling with DOS as she plodded through tests,<br/>
Ben/Saber was always thinking with his stomach, only to be found later By Luke, Kal fal And Orimarrko<br/>
who knocked Vader off of Hoth. Unfortunately U-3PO joined the party and that was that. Never a sorry<br/>
about the mess when I needed one. Eventually DOS trained and flipped, but he was too spread out. This<br/>
game was close as I searched for an on the edge, Vader landed at the Hut with Bossk In hounds tooth and<br/>
time ran out. I had 11 to his 14 (2 +1)<br/>
Highlights: It was a good game. I was amazed that I was able to survive that long. Unfortunately, training<br/>
that far loses too many cards to come back from. <br/>
Lowlights: 4 lost Grimtaashs netted me 0 cards. This was a well balanced deck. <br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs Endor Bunker<br/>
This game was the one I hate to play. The kid has no deck protectors and a bunch of Ewoks. Now that's not<br/>
saying that those are bad but the combo can kill.  The power of the dark was too much too fast as the<br/>
Tempests took over Endor with the force he gave. FW  by 40 4(41) <br/>
Highlights: Trampling General Solo<br/>
Lowlights: Playing a newcomer and demolishing him. With differential being so important in todays<br/>
tourneys I Had No Choice.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS Battle Order vs HDADTJ(Presence Of The Force, Epic Duel, VOTE)<br/>
This game hurt from the start. Vader first turn, I draw my only DOS in my opening hand and am losing to<br/>
VOTE every turn. I had 2 Transmission Terminated, just couldn't find them. Going to plan B, I train EPP<br/>
Luke because of the decipher rulings on MWYHL.  Obi/saber deploys to Executor moves to holotheatre to<br/>
cancel visage. Next turn he is lost in a battle with Djas Puhr. While Luke trains away, Vader and Tarkin<br/>
chill in the Cantina having a cold one, admiring Vaders saber and sharing a few steveweisers. VOTE is<br/>
redeployed, canceled with Trans Term instantly. Chewie and Epp Han roam the executor till they bump in<br/>
to U-3PO. I really need to put 2 SATM in this deck. He slowly drains thanks to test 1, I slowly train. Webb<br/>
goes undercover in the Cantina. By luck I stone pile Bubo. Here I made the second major mistake. Alters<br/>
should have been +8, but I let it go at +4. The first mistake will be in the Lowlights. Hindsight is 20/20.<br/>
Luke flips with a 6 on test 5. I retrieve some with On the Edge but he spreads and I'm losing too many too<br/>
fast. Time is getting close, I draw my last 3 in the final minute to make sure he gets the full 2 points.<br/>
FL(-19)4(+22)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Luke Trains to   Test 5 with a 6. That's twice I 've trained to test 5. Too bad both have been<br/>
losses. <br/>
Lowlights: I started Battle Order. Had I actually read my text, I should have made him pay for every force<br/>
drain. I never did the whole game. That could have slowed it to that crawl I needed to win. Two mistakes<br/>
from the rust of an 8-month layoff and I pay. It was a good deck though and still probably would have won. <br/>
<br/>
Game 5 LS Battle Order vs  A Lot of ties<br/>
This Kid impressed me. While not having the card wealth that a lot of player do, he built a cool tie deck that<br/>
really pushed me. He managed to Talon roll the Falcon with Epp Han and Chewie aboard. He played a lot<br/>
of interrupts  that boosted his ties. Man I hated those. I trained DOS to test 5 with a 6 on it and decided to<br/>
exact revenge. With Han and Chewie aboard the Spiral drawing 6&amp;#8217;s they cleared the spacelanes, chased off<br/>
the Executor and saved the day. Still a young kid learning but he was fun to play. FW(+22) 6(+44)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Him talon rolling the Falcon. DOS To test 5 and actually winning. <br/>
Lowlights: None. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS vs LS Nudji/Revolver/Farm....<br/>
<br/>
I could see this one coming. I changed my usual start, went with Jabbas Palace and BFHI to try to slow him<br/>
down. Deployed DS my first turn with the Audience Chamber. I didn&amp;#8217;t really have any strong characters in<br/>
hand to start and that hurt. Down Came Obi/Lightsaber Pro/Obis Saber. Not good. EPPs blitzed me,<br/>
attritioned off walkers and ruled Tatooine. I managed to put up some minor resistance but not enough. <br/>
FL(-16)  6(+28)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
While not a sterling day, I made a few mistakes but I had fun while doing it. It&amp;#8217;s been awhile since I can say<br/>
that about SWCCG. Brian is a great TD who went out of the way to make sure we had excellent prize<br/>
support, (Something we lacked in Utah). i look forward to the next tourney in the area.  I met the infamous<br/>
Chris Gregg, dress and all. Maybe eyeliner would help. Next year? All in all it was a good day full of good<br/>
agmes and learning experiences.  I posted some stats below from Brians post if anyone is interested<br/>
about what was played. I wish Matt the best of luck at Worlds. Thanks--Degenx---<br/>
