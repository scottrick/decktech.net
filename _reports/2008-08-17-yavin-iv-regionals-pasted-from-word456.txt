Yavin IV regionals 2008<br>
<br>
After the mpc I took a break for a month or two then played a few locals but they were before v15.  I thought through some stuff when v15 came out and there was a lot of heated discussion about some of the cards, but I was wrapped up with finals so I still hadnt prepared much.  The text mpc shed some light on the v15 meta, but it was a match play event and some of the stuff wasnt played much so the picture still was a little clouded.<br>
I tested with coach Stratton and Reid a few weeks before the regionals.  We mess around with a lot of different light decks winning.  For dark, not much was doing well, except Reids entanglements deck.  So we worked with it a bit, added mkae v and the green card and decide to use it.  <br>
So it was gonna be me, R. Smith and Dan tartaglione travelling together to the event.  Friday, I got the Indiana Jones meal at burger king.  It was kind of not that amazing, like, it cost 7 dollars, for a burger fries and drink, but I only got 1 peel off contest thing, which I lost on.  So that was kind of lame.  Anyway, I left C-town at 5 pm, arrived at reids at 7 pm, and then we left for dan tartagliones, which we got to maybe at 9pm.  Then we played some games of star wars cards then some kid came over and tried to hustle tortellini in some games of the Mario fighting game or something.  Idk.  Then we woke up and drove to merryland.  I bought some pepsis for breakfast but they were diet and that kinda blew me out. <br>
Oh yeah before we left dans we watched the first hour or so of pulp fiction.  Its a good pre game strategy.  For my attire, I had packed about 5 outfits for the overnight trip.  So I decided not to wear the team ohio 2005 throwback jersey.  I was going to wear the new alternate crimson and gold USC payment plan jersey, but decided against that as well.  Eventually I decided to go with the salmon colored polo shirt I bought at the old navy.  <br>
We were about 30 seconds away from the location and aglets called me and I told him we were almost there so w/e then we waited like a half hour to start anyway.  Oh my ls deck was hb omdh, aka reidtech hb, aka the deck ive been using basically exclusively since pa states last summer.  I worked with the deck all week and warped it a lot for hunt down, then took a lot of that stuff out and went with a more basic version in the end.  <br>
1 vs dark lsc racing<br>
So dark lsc is a pretty decent deck.  Reid used it a lot at locals after the mpc and booker used it with some success at the mpc.  Early on he drains for 4 a bunch and I atrocity it when I can.  I setup in space pretty solid at a couple of systems and draw a bunch of cards just looking for assorted stuff.  The plan vs combat with the hb deck is to get on a couple systems and drain, then get on a site for resistance.  So thats kind of what I did.  He won the podrace and got some cards back.  I set up at the audience chamber (my bg site) with obi jk, his saber, and mace.  Steve comes with mara, p59 and a tracked 7.  He shoots mace with p59.  But I randomly had a clash of sabers for mara, so p59 I think took some overflow.  Steve couldnt circle obi with vader cuz obi had his saber.  So like the game on the ground then consisted of sidious, mara and doctor e combo chasing obi, leia and ki adi around.  In space I drained then flipped at some point.  Against combat, you can be more cavalier with flipping, as most dont use many ships, usually a few zuckuss in mh if any.  Also if they run a precautions its probably the virtual version.  So then steve was ahead in damage so I omdh to retrieve my lost pile.  A few turns later I use ki adi and play it again to retrieve about 10 more.  After that I drained him out and flipped HB let me run up the score in what was a fairly close game for most of it.  Fw +30<br>
Game 2 v dagobah train dos<br>
So I had the occupation deck so I didnt know how the testing matchup would go.  Not getting any early pressure was nice for me.  I setup and flipped like 3rd or 4th turn.  I did a bunch of damage and grabbed it could be worse.  Luke came down and fought a walker but that didnt do a whole lot.  Landing claw on devastator was successful because I peeled a few cards to visored vision and one was godherdt.  Anyway after about 3 turns of mass drain and direct damage the testing deck was buried too far to mount a comeback.  Fw +17<br>
Game 3 v mike gemme wys<br>
I had tested a game vs booker using wys and won so I felt ok.  Wys cant really challenge you at the system, and its hard for them to attack at multiple ground locations cause they usually need 2 guys per site.  So he drains at kessel early with luke and during the game he retrieves a lot of force.  I play battle order shield and should have used something else I think.  I do my drop and he has the super chewie atst out and I think I maybe ghhk out of a fight.  He did have mirax and stuff and always replaced my AO every turn so I got like 1 commander damage in the whole game.  He had a lot of damage reduction.  The grond loop was good in this game.  Late game I move a ship and ozzel in front of luke at kessel to block the drain.  Melas has drained at the cantina a lot and stuff and he retrieved tons of force but occupation was just too strong in the end and edged him out for a win by 8 I think<br>
<br/>
Game 4 v desais hunt down<br/>
He got some good damage going but I had a decent ground setup with my sabers and guys though image of the dark lord stopped some of it.  I think I played a lot of my atrocities for his back door drain.  I think omdh went off at some point, and I used it could be worse and got some use out of it.  In the end though the fast pressure and maul/much anger lock was too much and I lost by 7.<br/>
Game 5 v gogolens sycfa destroyers and good cards<br/>
It was a syc deck with kdy v and some epps and a zimh and other techy stuff.  Early he has chimaera and thrawn draining for 2 and stuff, so I atrocity some of those.  I just draw early.  One thing I am careful about is to not deploy my alderaan.  I played hb v sycfa twice, one at worlds v hunter, one at mpc in a pickup game v French.  Both times my deploying alderaan helped the opponent.  So I was careful to not do that here.  Anyway I wasnt sure if I wanted to go to space or ground so I grimtaash him lost and get his 2 mauls and 2 death star gunner vs that he looped with strategic reserves.  So then I spread on ground, obi and saber to my AC, mace and saber to his db, and quigon moves from the db to the ds war room.  In space I stockpile everything at tatooine so I can do an omdh run, and I do it to put me back in the game.  He drains for 2ish a bunch and ultimatum capped his chiraneau drains.  I get padme out doing 2 damage also.  Late in the game he overwhelmeds my falcon with padme on it.  So it stops her damage, but also gives me the greenlight to do the luke v flip lock.  So I do it, drain him down to 1, retrieve my lost pile and win by 37.  <br/>
Game 6 v desais profit<br/>
I do some damage, he does some damage.  I ghhhk a beatdown.  I mess up and he flips me back but I still do a lot of damage.  I grab were doomed and sneak out a win by 1<br/>
<br/>
Semi finals <br/>
Game 1 v gemme hunt down<br/>
I do some stuff and he does some stuff.  I alter emperors power v which was fairly useful.  I also got to verify early that all his ships were in the deck so I was more reckless with my space setup.  He does maul and much anger but like drew some cards then wanted to cloak but like cloak is move phase so I fight maul next turn and lose lando so much anger is gone.  The game is close and we all do a lot of damage.  Late game I only have a few cards in hand and so he parks zimh in front of luke.  I deploy wedge on the spiral and overflow zimh by a few.  Really late game he is probing but is guessing wrong.  My hb was naboo and I had the outrider there so like it was risky to go there.  I initiate some space fights to get more cards in hand off of evac control v.  I am conscious to always have cards for limited resources.  He probes wrong and has only 1 force left which he loses to visage.  Fw +2<br/>
Game 2 <br/>
I basically needed to win this one too as the first game didnt do much for the match.  Well I setup in space and he just draws a lot.  He has kessel drain but I had all 3 of my controls (btw I guess I forgot he grabbed my controls and should have stacked his there too lol).  So I flip and have a bunch of damage ready.  He drops han epp, chewie and the atst to a site where I have a walker.  But that site in the judland wastes, so instead of 3 destinies he gets zero or something.  So then I just do some more random damage with occupation and stuff.  He didnt have artoo for a while so were doomed wasnt as effective.  He didnt retrieve as much this game.  I ended up winning it by 6 or something?<br/>
Finals <br/>
Game 1 v desais hd<br/>
He got off to a strong start with emperors power and stuff.  My start wasnt as strong and I had to draw a bunch.  I peeled the AC to visage so had to put ki adi mundi on a ship to retrieve it. I do some random pings here and there but he comes down with the maul much anger lock and I dont think enough about a way to break it and just icbw the damage, and icbw gets grabbed.  There really just wasnt much that went right for me this game, I played pretty poorly and justin played really well.  Fl -23<br/>
Game 2<br/>
I almost didnt play this but figured Id try it.  He puts chewie alone at a site so I drop 5 guys and a walker and overflow him for 10.  Then he counterbeats me and clears the site.  I drain him down some but scoop at some point once I get below 23<br/>
<br/>
Overall: swiss: 5-1 (10 vp), +86?, semifinals, 2-0 (4vp) +8?, finals 0-2 (0 vp) -23+x<br/>
There was a lot of funny stuff that happened but if you want to know about it then go to the event next time.  I won 100$, which was below what the pool was gonna be, since some people bailed.  I also got an uncut sheet, well, the pc owes them to us I guess cause they werent there.  I traded my ejp 3p0 pack for a yj box so reid, dan and I could play pack wars.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh btw on the 2 hour drive home from reids to my place, I heard little waynes she licked me like a lollipop song FIVE times.  That was cool<br/>
