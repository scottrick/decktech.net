<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pennsylvania States, 2007: a tournament rookie's recollections.<br>
<br>
My first tournament ever and I decide it should be PA States, a tournament likely to draw some of the biggest names in SWCCG on the east coast. What was I thinking? Thinking about the breakdown of big decks likely to show up, I figured I was likely to see Hidden Base, Mains, and QMC for light side. I was not disappointed, although I didn't have the chance to play against QMC. For dark, I expected SYCFA, Endor Ops, CCT/IG-88, and maybe some sort of vehicle deck (Walkers or Tanks). This was pretty close as well: I played against a CCT deck and a Cloud City/Tanks deck and heard about someone playing EOps, but I didn't see SYCFA anywhere. (I don't have many details due to scarce note-taking time.)<br>
<br>
I played the meta-eluding Invasion for DS and a fairly standard Hidden Base with matching pilots.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Invasion vs. Aaron Kingery's HB-X.<br>
<br>
Kingery was an excellent opponent, cutting me some breaks since I was new and it was my first tournament game ever. Swarms of X-Wings and high activation allowed him to nail down some strong drains and cancel mine. Once I cut and run with my battleship, I forgot to probe for the hidden base; this probably sealed the game for me as Kingery later told me I had been at the secret system. Getting a couple more drains through might have turned the game, as I lost by 8.<br>
<br>
FL 0 (-8)<br>
<br>
Game 2: Hidden Base vs. Mike Carr's TDIGWATT Dark Deal.<br>
<br>
This game against another great opponent played out without too many surprises. I was packing enough ground power to hold a site. I dropped Qui-Gon with Saber to the Chasm Walkway, which gave me a couple turns of free drains. Soon, Mike played 4-LOM with Rifle and Mara Jade (v12). Unfortunately, I made the stupid mistake of forgetting to play the Rebel Barrier I had in hand. While it probably wouldn't have saved my Jedi from certain demise, I would have had the chance to send Jade to the Weather Vane instead of having my permanent saber zapped by the droid. Oops. It was a close game, though; I only lost by 1.<br>
<br>
FL 0 (-9)<br>
<br>
Game 3: Invasion vs. Drew Scott's IITFYS (v) Mains.<br>
<br>
When I saw Drew's start I knew I was in trouble. Mains is a tough matchup for Invasion on the best days, and Drew's playing pounded it home. No game changing mistakes here- it's a bad matchup and my adrenaline rush was wearing off. I lost by 31.<br>
<br>
FL 0 (-40)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Hidden Base vs. Ben Kline's CCT.<br/>
<br/>
Determined to turn my record around and win at least once, I was paired against Drew's neighbor Ben. Ben was able to get Search and Destroy out midgame but I forgot to lose to it most of the time. Lest I be accused of cheating, I forgot to utilize my Mantellian Savrip more than once, probably costing me as much as I would have lost on the turns I didn't occupy a site. I also forgot the automatic immunity granted by the &lt;&gt;Forest, losing cards unnecessarily and paying for drains I didn't need to. I achieved my desired win by 15.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (-25)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Hidden Base vs. Vinay B.'s CC Tanks CR(v).<br/>
<br/>
Overconfident and distracted by the sandwich I picked up at the Subway a couple doors down, I played this one sloppily. Not much to say here; I let my attitude run away with me, losing by 5.<br/>
<br/>
FL 2 (-30)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Invasion vs. Mike Carr's MWYHL Asteroids.<br/>
<br/>
Paired up with Mike again to close the day, I had no idea what to do against a deck like this. Despite the direct damage from Asteroids Do Not Concern Me (v), I was able to win by 10 against one of the strangest decks I've seen.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (-20)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I had a great time mingling with the Big Guys and meeting the faces behind the screen names. Justin Desai and Tim Simons took first and second; I took 14th. I'm looking forward to my next shot at greatness- the mistakes I made at this tournament won't be repeated.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to<br/>
*Scott Lingrell, for organizing and running an excellent tournament, despite the trials he faced arriving on time.<br/>
*Aaron Kingery, for being a great first opponent and letting me use some v-slips when mine went missing.<br/>
*Mike Carr, for cutting me some slack when I didn't have my crap together and giving me a couple hints about how to play this crazy game.<br/>
*Brad Eier, for wearing a TEAM OHIO t-shirt so people knew where he was from.<br/>
<br/>
Muttered epithets to<br/>
*Ben Kline, for demonstrating how to drink beer while having sex with his wife- didn't need to see that. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
