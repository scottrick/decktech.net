<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So June 2nd rolls around and its time for me to try the new set out before Ramapocon. I make my decks out of my two complete sets and box-oh-crap I purchased at the gamers guild (only one main in the whole box). After testing deck designs, I found that dark side lacked a dominant deck platform. SYCFA and MKOS gave the dark a lot of force fast, but a question arose: what do I do with the force? Where and how do I do my damage? That Hoth crap deck lacked any true play value outside of&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; no I can&amp;#8217;t think of anyway that deck wins. The Cloud city objective was a joke even with the new card. So my thoughts settled on the Maul capture deck, SYCFA (none flip), and MKOS&amp;#8230; play testing Thursday night leaned on the Maul deck, cause well, it was cool and new.<br/>
<br/>
In testing light side proved to have so many strong deck platforms. From QMC, RST, to MBO, light side wrecked dark side with a vengeance! Testing with the twiggs showed a broken MBO and RST&amp;#8230; those deck just flip so fast, its sick. After some more testing, I go with anew version of Pat Ziagos PA states champ deck.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday comes and the store is filled with an array of new deck designs. Out of the 25 people that show, here is a breakdown of the decks:<br/>
<br/>
Dark:<br/>
<br/>
MKOS- 6<br/>
Hoth Jizz deck &amp;#8211;4<br/>
SYCFA (Flip) &amp;#8211; 2<br/>
SYCFA (no flip) &amp;#8211; 4<br/>
CC objective &amp;#8211; 2<br/>
AOBS &amp;#8211; 1<br/>
No objective &amp;#8211; 3<br/>
Maul capture &amp;#8211; 3<br/>
<br/>
Light:<br/>
MBO &amp;#8211; 2<br/>
RST &amp;#8211; 6<br/>
QMC &amp;#8211; 5<br/>
No objective &amp;#8211; 5<br/>
MWYHL &amp;#8211; 2<br/>
DBO &amp;#8211; 1<br/>
Old school ops &amp;#8211; 1<br/>
Hidden base flip &amp;#8211; 3<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
Dark vs. Joe Gianntei&amp;#8217;s QMC.<br/>
	First turn I drop Maul with saber to maulâ€™s site and I use Jabba&amp;#8217;s palace to pull the audience chamber and then the chamber to pull Mara with stick. A lack of the queen left me with a drain of 5 on Tat the whole game. He set up pretty fast with a 4th turn flip. But Vader and tarkin paid a lone epp han a smacking visit. He tried to path over Epp Luke, but sence said no. He made it a really close game with off the edges and celebration. But in the end, the drain of 5 did him in.<br/>
<br/>
2(+12)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
Light vs. BJ Handmeoffhard&amp;#8217;s Hoth Jizz.<br/>
	First off I love this guys name. Wow I love that Hoth deck. Nabrun Leids kept the beat down squad killing him on hoth. He did manage to get a few guys with an ice storm, but it didn&amp;#8217;t matter. I took over all his sites with guys. Harvests made it so I won with no lost cards. God bless Hoth decks.<br/>
<br/>
4(+40)<br/>
Game 3<br/>
Light vs. Chris twiggs&amp;#8217; SYCFA no flip.<br/>
	It was a blow out game. He put all his guys at the farm and with the +1 to hit my guys, no one ever made it out alive. With lord vader, maul, tarkin, and doc e there, I had to give up the harvest tech. I attempted to go take over the death star but UNDERCOVER SPIES came out everywhere. I think he played 6 or 7 spies and undercovers. SICK! I then tried to go to the air, but Chimeara, Bossk In Hounds Tooth, and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter came to eat me alive. Chris did a good Job killing me.<br/>
<br/>
4(+28)   <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
Dark vs. Brian Twiggs&amp;#8217; MBO deck of death.<br/>
	I tried to go take over Yavin 4, but epps and Scouts came to say HI. He finally flipped 5th or 6th turn and went after the death star. I had used most of my forces trying to take the ground, so he owned me in the air when I went up to fight. Luke in red 5, Han in falcon, and Dash was his death squad. It was a weird version of MBO, ground beats with like 4 or 5 ships. He only played one system to drain at, I guess the drain of 4 at kiffex and the 14 card lose to the attack run did me in. What a broken Deck! Watch out for this at ramapocon!<br/>
<br/>
4(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
Dark vs. Chris twiggs&amp;#8217; Hidden base flip.<br/>
	Once again I got the drain of 5 going 2nd turn. Galid and search and destroy added some big damage in the game. 6th turn he came down with all the epp beats, but some barriers and eles helrots kept me save! Once he flipped I unloaded in space and got his hidden base on the 2nd try. Search and destroy and security precautions won me the game. <br/>
<br/>
6(+30)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
Light vs. brian Twiggs&amp;#8217; CC objective with Scum.<br/>
	Scum, there is something I wasn&amp;#8217;t expecting to see. He got a slow start, and my 3 grimtaash&amp;#8217;s got all his doubles. Scum never hit the table, but he was able to put up a good fight with disarm/doc e tech, and Skrilling insert. Late game he put out Sullest and Endor with bounty Hunter ships. WTF!!! Who plays that type of stuff. Weird tech cause I lost all my ships to drain and battling. So now he&amp;#8217;s draining me for 4 in the air and an insert is in. But his insert ever popped and my harvest tech won me the game. God I love the new stuff! <br/>
<br/>
8(+37)<br/>
<br/>
So the top 5 end up like this:<br/>
Chris twigg 10(+111)<br/>
Brian Twigg 10(+99)<br/>
BJ Handmeoffhard 8(+69)<br/>
Joe Gigga 8(+69) &amp;#8211; and after he heard his diff was 69, he told us all about his long sexual experiences with the 69, not a good time&amp;#8230;<br/>
Matty Sokol 10(+37)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope you had as much fun reading this ersatz report, as I had writing it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I kept the game descriptions short so I could give list of what I found to be the new tech with Tat:<br/>
1-	MBO and RST are soooooo broken.. you need to tech <br/>
<br/>
for these decks hardcore!<br/>
2-	You have to play both search and destroy and security precautions.<br/>
<br/>
3-	Pod racing is HUGH.<br/>
<br/>
4-	Maul Capture decks are fast and furious!<br/>
<br/>
5-	Hoth jizz decks suck.<br/>
<br/>
6-	Light side mains are still and will remain good.<br/>
<br/>
7-	No one played mpoints or staging area.<br/>
<br/>
8-	No need to play cards like no escape or the light side version, cause decks like rops and old school y4 are gone.<br/>
<br/>
9-	All the stuff from this report will be at ramapo, watch out for those broke MBO and RST decks, I am not joking&amp;#8230;.<br/>
<br/>
10-	I should have flown to England to do this report, just like Mike &amp;#8220;Deck&amp;#8221; Gemme.<br/>
