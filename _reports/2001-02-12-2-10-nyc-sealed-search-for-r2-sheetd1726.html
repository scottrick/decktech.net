Pack one, go right to the foil.  Jedi Luke!  sweet right?  NO WAY im playing dark, so i grab the Guri and pass.  <br/>
I think a good thing to do for the sealed decks is list the whole deck.  This is only my second booster draft ever so Im really not that good at it, but since i have some good tech strategies I didnt do too badly.  I thought i had drafted a Black Squad Tie foil to Talon Roll with but i either lost it or passed it, I didnt draft enough characters either.<br/>

Okay, the sunsdown is for my high destiny adding power under nighttime conditions, also for my super tooex tech to boost all of my guys.  Guri and stinger is balls, as well as snoova with the axe.  Well guarded and intruder missle are there simply for destiny.  Merril is there cause alot of ppl played Cloud city, as with restricted access.  Quarren is abillity two, youll see my jetpack tech in game 3 against the guy that won, aaron kingery.  I gave him his bets game, he said it himself.<br/>
<br/>
Game One - My pile vs. Martin Terwilliger’s Pile<br/>
<br/>
Mr twigg got sick pulls.  Dash in the outrider, EPP Luke.  DO i even need to say anything else?  He starts kessel, gets dash and ship there, and that is pretty much game for a while.  I get heavy ground stuff going but he is draining me at tatooine and kessel.  THere is no detail to this game, we just drained each other.  We get down to like 5 cards each, each draining for 5.  He lands some ships to block my drains, including unpiloted red1... i dont realize its red one and i lose the game by 2, because he blocked my drain of two with it at the judland wastes.  Also he blocked a drain elsewhere i think i couldve battled because the ship is forfeit 0 or something like that but either way i shouldve won, instead i lost by 2.  So im pissed, not at mr. twigg but at myself because he didnt realize it either, trust me.<br/>
FL by 2.  0(-2)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Controlling a drain of 3 at kessel?<br/>
Lows : the losing because of an unpiloted red1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two - My pile vs. aaron Kingery’s sick @#$% light deck<br/>
<br/>
Aaron won this tourney, his deck was balls with tech.  He had baragwain tech and gran tech (he didnt use the gran on me).  So im draining with snoova at the audience chamber, hes bargwain teching me at some tatooine site.  If got ability four with some scrubs at the audience chamber and i slap jet pack on snooova.  He is retrieving everything i drain.  Janus is draining at judland so he drops sandwhirl.  I control and am all excited but i put first strike out and he battles the skrilllings i just dropped to the bargwain site and retrieves it.  But! i react with snoova for TWO and capture his bargwain after he misses with the pistol!  So hes reeling he cant beleive it and we are having a blast cause we are really cool with one another.  So after that he beats down merril who is on cloud city b/c i didnt see that my drains at that site were -1 and he beats down chewie.  He goes and beats down my lone quarren at the audience chamber and chewie cant react this time because hes carrying the bargwain and i end up losing by like 10.<br/>
FL by 10, 0(-12)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  JetPack tech and Aaron admitting to the entire tournament that i out-teched him<br/>
Lows:  losing anyways.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Pile vs. Some other guy’s Pile<br/>
Sorry i never saw this guy the entire day and didnt see him again after we played.  He starts kessel too, this ones jap though, and deploys Talon karde there with a ywing and a proton torpedo.  I start with the normal pull AC, snoova, vibro axe.  Drop Feltipurn and drain.  I get janus out and start tracking my intruder missle.  I draw up until i get guri and her ship then i beat down the ywing, move it to tatooine where hes got some bum on gold 2.  Meanwhile he drops Luke, rebel scout to fight janus and i dont have my jetpack and im afraid janus is getting beatdown but he uses all his force and i projective telepathy so hes saved.  I decide to track my 7.  Then Guri in her balls ship battles the bum at tatooine next turn and i think i have a destiny 5 tracked above the 7, but it was the other way around, i pull the 7 and do some damage, but there is still some bastard xwing draining me in the clouds of tatooine, but i dont move there because i beatdown on luke that turn, draw the 5 and that is pretty much game because his destiny is the yavin4 war room.  I beat this guy by 12.<br/>
FW by 12.  2(0)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: beating this guy down<br/>
Lows: having too many cards in my hand from drawing for guri.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second time today ive been at 0 differential in the middle of a tourney, so im not happy.. and guess who i get to play next?  my good pal and extremely good player, andy klema!<br/>
<br/>
Game Four - My pile vs. klemas pile<br/>
I dont remember much about this game.  I was tired and he beat me down.  From what i remember it was a very short one.  I didnt get guri or janus.  Snoova couldnt do much with just a quarren.  He beat me down pretty bad even though i captured his Beru/Owen.  By the way Klema, i accidentally stole your beru/owen if you want it back you can suck a nut!  hahahaha.  So he won by alot and that was it.  Sorry about the lack of detail on this one, the increased detail on all of the rest should tide you over.<br/>
<br/>
So that was it, i played a pickup game against klema with my (hayes hunters’) dark deck and @#$% RAPED him like he couldnt beleive.  I love when scrubs beat big players, and i love it even more when i do it!  Me and klema had a good time.  Then baroni and oakes played some ultimate trek and i played some too, with baroni and deluca.  Both of them @#$% raped me worse than i assraped klema earlier.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanna see an extensive props/slops list go to my construct TR, but for the sealed it was very short.<br/>
<br/>
Props<br/>
Lingrell for running a kickass tourney<br/>
Aaron for winning and having nice gran tech against baroni<br/>
The twiggs for helping me with my sites and being really cool all together.<br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
Baroni for losing with emporer and lord vader even though hes my boy he still deserves slops for that<br/>
Klema for assraping me in sealed then letting me give him a reach around in a pickup game<br/>
<br/>
thanks alot for reading, sorry the grammar was especially @#$%ty considering im a writing major, my hands are killing me right now and im tired.  Take care guys<br/>
