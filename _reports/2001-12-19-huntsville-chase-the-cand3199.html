<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">D@mn jon, i had to pay 15 dollars to take a taxi down to the deep this weekend so i could play chase the can with some friends of mine. well, it was money well spent. Well, i get down there and they are starting the 3rd round of Lord of the Rings, and i hear the Wars tournament was going to be postponed untill 5 o`clock, so i wasted some time and built a QMC deck for a friend of mine. So the tournament starts and they call out the pairings. I’m playing a guy named michael i think.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My crap o’ @#$% WYS vs. Imperial City Mains???<br/>
Efridge Engelhardt (1695) vs. Michael ??? (1500ish???)<br/>
He starts Imperial City (or is it square? the one the emperor deploys free at). Drops a twix and draws a few.  My first turn i drop homeone docking bay with a palace raider there, play goo nee tay. He drops Arica to the docking bay, i barrier. I play spaceport docking bay, squadron for dash, provide a patrol craft for my friend, and with the backup of a fallen portal, i transit to tatooine docking bay. He saves for a couple of turns and i drain on the ground with palace raiders growing in numbers. He drops Executor to Dash’s system, i barrier. I deploy Cpt han in falcon with a raider for forfeit, break executor immunity and beat him off of my system. I revo his Imperial Square. He gets no force ever.<br/>
FW +29<br/>
so now im 2 (+29) and 2nd seat going into the 2nd round. In my theed palace packs i pull AI mace that i sell to the tourny director for 5 bucks, WOOT!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
Efridge’s ISB Space trash vs. Brian Rippetoe’s Throne Room Mains<br/>
Efridge Engelhardt (1695) vs Brian Rippetoe (2134)<br/>
I knew i was going to lose this match, for i have played a similiar game like this with him in the past. So, his first action he plays dont do that again and denies me my mobpoints search. he plays some twixes and says go. i play a docking bay draw. he activates and revos my coruscant, i evader, he grabs it. DAMN!!! hehe. i play maul in ship at tatooine system that i drew. i drain in space for a while and i make the mistake of playing tatooine docking bay, a battle ground for him to go control. I FINALLY flip and put 5d6 at the docking bay, so phylo and posse are only draining for 2 a turn. He plays the camp so im not generating crap at my docking bays, and im force to transit over and fight. we do so and i lost almost everything i have and he loses lando to the bacta tank, and i was like "well, i dont think this is a good idea." so i play another ship and drain somemore. he drops homeone to mauls system. he plays Jedi Luke to home one, he plays epp han to home one, and i barrier han. so he fights. i play I Have You Now, he senses, i grab it. i play maul strikes, and it goes through. my 2 destinies are crap, and i lose by 6 or something, so i lose the 6 cards and fly away. in the end, he outdrained me, and started It could be worseing all my drains, so i drew up.<br/>
FL -19<br/>
bah, 2 (+10)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
Efridge’s crap @#$% ISB space vs. Andy McClure’s Modified Senate beats in the hands of Chris McClure<br/>
Efridge Engelhardt (1695) vs Chris McClure (1823)<br/>
In my starting hand i had realized that the tatooine docking bay (the only battleground that could by played all game) was present, and i was like "wow, i dont think this card will be played all game" so i activate and he plays dont do that again, and i was like "damnit!!! i cant believe i forgot about my system" thank god i got tatooine in my opening hand. so i played it, drew a few. he activated, gave me goo, and drew. i activated, played maul in ship at tatooine. he set up senate. i drained, put emperor at the docking bay to activate, looked for a force lightning and got carida. he drew more. i monnoked lost, got his lukes. i scanning crew and got his epp obi. i got executor and merrejk to play fondor. next turn i deploy executor with evax and i scanning crew. he has han, chewie, and the falcon, and the spiral. i draw for imeprial command. next turn i put piett on the bridge with a scout and chireneau. by now im draining for 4 a turn, and he can only cancel one. he plays han, chewie, and the falcon with lando aboard to mauls system, and i tell him he cant deploy lando as a passenger. he take it back. next turn he deploys han, chewie, and the falcon with lando on the spiral, he battles, i remind him that he has no ability, so he takes it back. next turn he deploys han, chewie, and the falcon, spiral with lando and epp quigon aboard, and fights. i have like 10 cards dmg, so i ghhhk. next turn i deploy vader on zuckuss and fly to a system to drain. i keep retrieving and he has run out of things to do.<br/>
FW +9<br/>
okay, im 4 (+19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
Efridge’s crap @#$% WYS against Jason Wade’s Huntdown dueler<br/>
Efridge (1695) vs Jason Wade (1611)<br/>
i thought this would be a bad matchup because unless mara or vader werent in the cantina, i couldnt throw luke there to clean the site, i was i was carefull. i start my thing while he puts emperor at back door. i dont get my admiral’s order or a celebration in my hand untill the very end of the game. i revo the holotheater and take it over with melas and a palace raider, and i bite the drain of 4 a turn in the cantina because i was an idiot and forgot to start menace fades. so i draw about 20 and get celebration into my hand and he draws up. damn him.<br/>
FW +11<br/>
6 (+30)<br/>
<br/>
Well, i think i placed 2nd under rip, maybe 3rd....<br/>
&lt;shrug&gt; beats me. i had fun, chase the can was the best.<br/>
<br/>
Props go to Jim Colson for running it, Steven Lewis for giving me pointers on a deck for a friend of mine, and to Chris McClure for giving me a ton of points.<br/>
<br/>
Slops to the ever growing number of people that are getting out of the game, its really a shame. hopefully those of us that are still here will keep it alive, even if it is for a couple of more months.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
