<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well this tourney was supposed to have a good turnout but a lot of people backed out at the last minute.  not much pre tourney stuff.  i had tested some new decks and they were ok, as well as modifying a few decks i already had.  i decided to go with my isb deck for dark, its a big blue with imp commands, tramples and such.  i dont have any ors so i just use scrub isb agents.  it isn’t the best deck but its fun to play and is solid.  for light side i had tried various wys and mains decks, but they almost all lost to aobs.  so i just grab my hbx deck from states, change about 8 cards and i’m set.<br/>
<br/>
game 1. ls vs josh ds2 starter<br/>
well he forgot his cards but wanted to play so he bough the ds2 starters. i setup fast at endor with xwings.  he drops a guy in a tie, and a non unique tie, and lt grond to his endor site then draws. next turn i lock sfoils, shoot the guy in the tie, and do 27 battle damage.  i also use epp luke to beatdown grond for 8 more battle damage.  after that i spread out a bit in space.  he tries to come at me with a walker and trooper , but i barrier and run, thwn drain him out.  <br/>
fw 2 (+30)<br/>

game 2. ds vs adam ebox<br/>
well i have isb decree and he has ebox so i should have an auto win, right??  not true.  this game was close, because he had a lot of stuff to get around decree. i flip fast and setup some drains, but rebel fleet cancels them.  i try decree but he has an arcona.  i trample it.  later he came down with another one and i trampled it.  sometime i found my search and destroy and that proved to be really big.  he retrieved some with allwings, but not tons,, mabey 5 cards.  he does suicide strikes with epp obi and stuff to slow s &amp; d and decree.  we fight in space once i get setup and i kill a lot of his ships.  late game i kill all his guys on hoth and once decree is locked in along with isb, theres not much you can do.  <br/>
fw 4 (+42)<br/>
<br/>
game 3. ds vs edwin ebox<br/>
gee...not ebox again, man its not an easy matchup.  well turn 2 he sets up ebo and drops an xwing to kiffex. next turn ozzel and dominator and imp command beatdown the xwing. after that he puts 1 ship at like every system and i cant find my ships.  man i would have got killed if it wasnt for decree. that card is money.  even with his bonuses gone though, i was losing like 6 a turn.  luckily though, i was draining for bunches too.  he had no retrevial, while i was getting back an isb agent each turn.  eventually i kill off some xwings here and there.  he brings the beats with jedi luke, epp leia and han on hoth to stop decree, but i trample han and beatdown everyone else. thats game.<br/>
fw 6 (+62)<br/>
<br/>
game 4. ls vs dan sycfa ties<br/>
well i finally get to play dan after a few tourneys of him not getting paired with me.  he is running the set your course tie deck, with tons of guns.  i setup sfoils and a bunch of ships at kiffex and kessel, and flip.  he is retrieveing a lot. i grimtassh him a few times for ties and random interrupts.  i retrieve mabey 9 with all wings.  he cant find any all power to weapons so i just sit at my heavily fortified systems and drain, while cancelling his drains.  late game he tries to fight me but he gets smacked around and thats it.<br/>
fw 8 (+83)<br/>
