<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">  Twenty-seven bad hombres rode into town for this six-game shootout at high noon.  Missing Olympics coverage and everything.  Man, the sacrifices we make for this game...<br/>
<br/>
  The whole thing couldn’t have happened without Martin Norris (Rogue 7), without whom we’d be at home watching some Swede win the gold medal in table tennis.  <br/>
<br/>
  My decks<br/>
<br/>
  Light Side: Free Us Or Die - Power Profit, tremendous beatdown potential.  Also anti-Bring Him Before Me tech.<br/>
<br/>
  Dark Side: Twisted And Evil - Hunt Down with more than enough characters to dominate on the ground, enough ships to hold its own in space, and a surprisingly high destiny average.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 1 - LS versus Kyle Krueger’s Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
  He starts with Prepared Defenses and doesn’t deploy an alien to stand guard over Jabba’s favorite decoration.  He goes for the flip instead of That Thing’s Operational, so on the first turn he controls the Bunker with Sergeant Barich and deploys Perimeter Patrol and Ominous Rumors.  <br/>
<br/>
  I deploy Ben Kenobi to the Audience Chamber and free Han, to start causing damage good and early.  Kyle deploys Igar in Tempest 1 to Jabba’s Palace.  I get Jeroen to the Bunker, shutting down Perimeter Patrol, but he can’t battle this turn.  Follow him up with Jedi Luke and his saber.  Draw Their Fire.  Battle, swing, hit, flip a measly 1.  Oh well, 9 to 2, he loses Barich and 7 cards. <br/>
<br/>
  Move Ben, Han to Jabba’s Palace.  Kyle drops Blizzard 1 without a pilot there and battles.  ’React’ with I Know to deploy Leia for free from the deck.  Draw 5 and 2 to his 4 and 1.  He forfeits Blizzard 1, I forfeit and revive Leia.  On my turn, deploy Lando In Millennium Falon at the Landing Platform on Endor, battle at Jabba’s Palace to finish off Igar and his walker.  Then move Jeroen and Luke over to the Platform, Jeroen hops in the Falcon and takes off to the system.  <br/>
<br/>
  He gets Lord Vader and Tarkin down against Jedi Luke, and on my turn, we battle.  I swing at Tarkin, he cancels one of the draws.  Play Glancing Blow, draw a 5 to his 4.  I’m immune to his attrition and ahead on power, so he forfeits Tarkin.  On his turn, he starts a battle, with the still power zero Vader, and I hit him with the saber, then flip a 4 to his 3.  He loses Vader and 9 force.  The objective damage and force drains soon ends the game.<br/>
<br/>
  Win by 30<br/>
<br/>
2(+30)<br/>
Highs: We had a fair number of battles.<br/>
Lows: Another game involving a spy and a beatdown in the Bunker.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 2 - DS versus Keegan Carlson’s Quiet Mining Colony<br/>
<br/>
  No Vader in my opening hand.  Deploy a docking bay and check.  None activated, either.  So I drop Sim Aloo to Docking Bay 327 and draw a card.  Keegan uses all 6 force he activates, getting Bespin: Cloud City out and using Strike Planning and Squadron Assignments to set up General Calrissian in Gold Squadron 1 at Bespin.<br/>
<br/>
  Soon I get Lord Vader down and flip, but now Keegan has backed up Gen. Cal with Wedge Antilles, Red Squadron Leader in his ship and Bacta Tank is out.  Deploy Zuckuss In Mist Hunter with ECC 4-LOM and Djas Puhr (forfeit fodder) in the backseat.  Battle, flip a 6 and 4, reduce his battle destiny to zero.  The attrition takes out both pilots, and Lando goes to the tank.<br/>
<br/>
  Deploy the Emperor to the Guest Quarters.  Kyle puts down EPP Luke there with Yoda’s Gimer Stick, and for a turn we each have a character with total immunity to attrition at the site.  He has no force to battle, so he turns the table over.  I put down IG-88 With Riot Gun, battle, draw the tracked 6 and capture Luke.  Flip back.  <br/>
<br/>
  At this same site, he deploys EPP Han and Chewbacca Of Kashyyyk with All My Urchins to make me lose some force.  Deploy Mara and lose 2 force to start a battle, target Chewbacca with the tracked 6 again, he’s captured.  Han gets pummeled and Keegan loses him and 12 more force.<br/>
<br/>
  As his last gasp, he gets Lando back from his Bacta Tank,<br/>
drops him in front of the Emperor and pals again.  Lose 2 again (from my hand, couldn’t have put it back for differential anyway) to start the last battle.  He gets cheeky and plays Rebel Leadership, so I just capture him and win with drains and Visage.  <br/>
<br/>
  Win by 27<br/>
<br/>
4(+57)<br/>
Highs: Taking back the Bespin system, capturing three mains.<br/>
Lows: Sluggish start.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 3 - DS versus Joe Olson’s Profit<br/>
<br/>
  I give him Mara Jade and Jabba The Hutt as my aliens. Vader and his saber at Jabba’s Palace on the first turn.  Joe drops a Projection of A Skywalker there to cut the drain down and draws cards.  <br/>
<br/>
  Drain for 2, give Mara her saber, then Vader and my pair of aliens trade places.  Joe gets out Docking Bay 94 and See-Threepio to start using How Did We Get Into This Mess.  Drain at the palace, Joe plays Lost In The Wilderness.  Hehe.  Oldest trick in the...D’oh!  Draw a 6 for my Sense.  Mara comes up missing.  Still my control phase, so the fat gangster has to go look for her.  Search party destiny draw is a 6, so she’s back in business.<br/>
<br/>
  Joe deploys Order To Engage, Master Luke, and Tawss Khaa at Jabba’s Palace, but doesn’t battle.  So he’s setting up a Fallen Portal trap.  Bring it on.  Sniper takes out Master Luke, 4-LOM With Concussion Rifle joins the beatdown squad.  Battle, he plays Fallen Portal, targeting Mara, and takes her out.  Cancel Tawss’ text, flip a pair of 3s, he gets a 6.  Sheesh, what’s with the 6s on both sides this early?  Forfeit Jabba, he forfeits Tawss.  <br/>
<br/>
  Deploy the Emperor at Jabba’s Palace, Tarkin at the Audience Chamber.  Joe gets Orrimaarko at Docking Bay 327.  Deploy IG-88 With Riot Gun, Djas Puhr, Zuckuss In Mist Hunter (forfeit fodder) at the bay.  Battle, capture him, since I suspect he’ll get another 6 destiny otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
  Ben with his saber, Master Luke, and Boushh make a big push in the Audience Chamber.  Battle, he swings at Tarkin and connects with a 6 and 4.  Vader slashes Boushh, and I play I Have You Now.  Three flips for a total of 11 attrition, clearing out his side of the site.  Tarkin is gone, but Vader stays.  <br/>
<br/>
  In a similar battle at Jabba’s Palace, Ben Kenobi and Master Luke w/Luke’s Lightsaber battle the Emperor, who fends them off and makes Joe forfeit Luke.  He revives him, but loses the saber.  Get Janus Greejatus down , move him and the Emperor to the Audience Chamber and move Vader to face Luke and Ben.  Joe battles, I swing and hit Luke, flip a tracked 6 to clear the site.  <br/>
<br/>
  Iggy, Djas transit to Docking Bay 94.  Jedi Luke nails my parked Zuckuss In Mist Hunter at DB327.  Lose it and a few more cards.  Deploy Lord Vader with his saber there to beat up on the young jedi.  Swing, hit, flip a 5, he draws Yoda’s Hut.  Ouch.  Power 12 to his 6, he loses all but the last few cards of his life force.  Doesn’t take long from there.  <br/>
<br/>
  Win by 14<br/>
<br/>
6(+71)<br/>
Highs: Taking out six Lukes and Bens.  <br/>
Lows: All his early 6 destiny madness, flipping Insertion Plannings, Artoos, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 4 - LS versus Nick Jones’ Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
  He starts with Mara and Jabba The Hutt at the Audience Chamber.  On the first turn, he deploys the Endor: Forest Clearing with Lord Vader and his saber, then Bad Feeling Have I. <br/>
<br/>
  I activate and draw, so he gets a drain in and backs up his aliens at the Audience Chamber with the Emperor.  On my turn, get Jedi Luke to the Forest Clearing with his saber and battle.  We both swing, we both miss.  I play Glancing Blow, The Force Is Strong With This One, he plays I Have You Now.  I flip a total of 9, he gets 6.  <br/>
<br/>
  17 power to his 6, so he loses Vader and some more cards, Luke is immune to the attrition and stays.  Nick puts a Presence Of The Force at Jabba’s Palace and moves Mara over from the Audience Chamber to drain.  Bad Feeling Have I keeps me from putting a very good hit squad together, so I hold off for a turn and he gets me for 4.  Ouch.  But I get Honor Of The Jedi up and running with Luke draining on Endor, so we’re both getting hit hard.<br/>
<br/>
  Then he deploys EPP Boba Fett at the palace and moves Jabba over.  Elis Helrot from there to the Forest Clearing, costs him all his remaining force.  On my turn, deploy EPP Leia to the Audiene Chamber, play Someone Who Loves You to free my EPP Han and flip.  Secret Plans is out, so I don’t retrieve any force.  Also deploy Ben Kenobi, start a battle.<br/>
<br/>
  He plays I Have You Now, I play I Know and Jedi Presence.  Flip 1, 1, 3, 4, he gets 0, 1.  Total power 28 to his 5, he loses the Emperor and 14 cards.  No force left to battle his characters at the Clearing.  On his turn, Nick deploys Tarkin to add to his overwhelming numerical superiority there and battles.<br/>
<br/>
  Swings at Luke, misses.  Swing at Tarkin, hit.  The Force Is Strong With This One, flip 6, 2.  He gets a pair of 3s and wins the battle by 5.  Lose it from life force, he forfeits everybody but Mara.  On my turn, deploy Chewbacca to back up Luke, battle, swing, hit, flip a 1 to his 3, he loses Mara and his 8 remaining force.  <br/>
<br/>
  Win by 19<br/>
<br/>
8 (+90)<br/>
Highs: Jedi Luke holding his own against appalling odds. <br/>
Lows: Taking a lot of damage early on, and not retrieving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 5 - DS versus Brandon Smith’s Endor Scouts<br/>
<br/>
  He starts with the Back Door and Careful Planning for the Farm and Forest.  Haven’t seen that one before.  I activate and get out a docking bay, draw to get Vader.  Brandon gets Madine and Panno down to the Forest.  Deploy Vader and his saber with Tarkin to the Forest, battle.  Swing and miss, flip a 1.  Cancel his draw, he loses Panno and a bit extra.<br/>
<br/>
  An Ithorian and a couple scouts take over the Back Door and Madine moves away to join them.  I get to force drain, and put the Emperor at the Farm.  Move Vader and Tarkin over to chase the scouts around.  He battles and plays Insertion Planning, I swing and hit Madine, flip a 3, Vader adds 1, so it isn’t quite wiped out by IP.  Cancel his draw, he covers the battle damage with his scouts.<br/>
<br/>
  An Ithorian and another of these unique scouts at the Forest are met by Djas Puhr and Captain Sarkli.  Battle, flip a tracked 6, he also gets a 6.  D’oh!  My sides is cleared, he loses 1 force.  He gets a T-16 and a scout down at the Back Door, moves his guys from the Forest over.  <br/>
<br/>
  Sniper takes out the biggest scout, and I battle.  Swing, miss.  He plays Covert Landing, I cancel it with Sense, drawing the 6 that would’ve been my battle destiny.  Flip a 1, his is canceled.  He hasn’t got much power there now, so he forfeits the remaining guys to cover the battle damage.<br/>
<br/>
  Put my hand back with Reactor Terminal, drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
  Win by 37<br/>
<br/>
10(+127)<br/>
Highs: The Emperor was left alone to drain all game.  <br/>
Lows: Saw this deck in action later, and there are some mains and tougher characters, they must not have come up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Game 6 - LS versus Doug Taylor’s Alan Parsons Project<br/>
<br/>
  Doug Taylor’s a great guy and a local squadron member with a surprisingly effective deck built around constructing the second Death Star.  He starts off with Mara at the Audience Chamber, gets her saber on the first turn, and plays Masterful Move to go get a Monnok.<br/>
<br/>
  Then, for some reason, he passes up the usual first turn Jerjerrod and DSII sector grab to use 4 and look at my hand with the lost Monnok.  Two Master Lukes.  Ouch, I joke about socking him one for that move.  Since I have no characters left in my hand, he moves Mara over to start draining at the palace.<br/>
<br/>
  He gets a drain in while I get my feet back under me, and sets up That Thing’s Operational.  Deploy Ben Kenobi and his saber at the Audience Chamber, free Han, retrieve 5, including the two Lukes.  Move them over to the palace to block Mara’s drain, and end my turn.  <br/>
<br/>
  Doug drops Ozzel and Vader With Lightsaber and battles.  Play I Know to get EPP Leia as a ’react.’  He swings at Han twice and connects on the second try.  Shoot, hit Ozzel, swing and hit Mara.  Flip a 5 and a 4, he gets a 3.  He forfeits Mara, Ozzel, and Vader, I forfeit Leia and send her to the Used Pile with Someone Who Loves You, and Han, whom Ben revives at the end of the battle.<br/>
<br/>
  Now I’m getting in drains and objetive damage, so Doug gets the damage started in space.  Baron Soontir Fel at Endor to begin draining.  He got to verify earlier when I searched for a docking bay, so he knows there are no ships in my reserve deck.  Of course, they happen to be in my hand right now.<br/>
<br/>
  But I’m not ready to go up there yet, so I get Jedi Luke to the Endor: Landing Platform for extra force generation from Staging Areas, and a cheaper deploy since Profit is now flipped and doesn’t help me get him down cheap.  Give him his saber to drain.  Doug gets Tempest 1 with Godherdt piloting to the platform, then transits Jerjerrod over and embarks. <br/>
<br/>
  Battle, play The Force Is Strong With This One to add a destiny.  Flip a 1 and 3, he gets a 4.  He forfeits Godherdt.  On his turn, he deploys Sullust and transits the walker away, then moves the DSII into orbit around Sullust to make me lose force to That Thing’s Operational.<br/>
<br/>
  Instead, I ditch Your Insights Serve You Well to get Honor Of The Jedi and deploy it, covering the force loss from TTO.  Doug gets Bossk In Hound’s Tooth to Sullust, where he gets to add a destiny thanks to TTO.  On my turn, deploy Draw Their Fire, drop Home One at Endor and battle, flip a 1, he gets a 1.  He loses by 3 from life force.<br/>
<br/>
  He deploys the Devastator and battles.  I flip a 4, he gets a total of 6.  He wins by 8, and I take it on life force, since he has to forfeit something now.  But he moves Bossk In Hound’s Tooth and the DSII over from Sullust to scare me away.  It works, since he’d have four battle destiny draws if I stayed to fight him there.  <br/>
<br/>
  Deploy Lando In Millennium Falcon at Sullust and EPP Leia at Jabba’s Palace, move Home One over.  Doug gets Blizzard 2 with Evax down to Jabba’s Palace and battles Leia.  We both flip high, he loses Evax, I lose Leia.  Get Chewbacca down with Han at the Audience Chamber, move Ben over to the palace.  Now Doug has the DSII orbiting Sullust and occupies three battlegrounds, though, so I get hit for a drain and 2 force from TTO before I drain him out most of the way and end it with a couple battles initiated with Draw Their Fire.<br/>
<br/>
  Win by 18<br/>
<br/>
12 (+145)<br/>
Highs: Interaction on ground and in space.  <br/>
Lows: Early hit from the Monnok.  Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  So I finish in first place, Joe Olson takes second and gets a cool Chewbacca mug hand-painted by Martin’s wife, since I’ve already won an authentic Mrs. Norris mug.  And Nick Jones comes in third.  <br/>
<br/>
  Good show to Matt Bryant for going 4-2 against a lot of tough opposition, including two wins against a nearly 2000-rated player and hard-fought losses to the guys who finished just above him in second and third place.  <br/>
<br/>
  Thanks to Martin for running this any so many other tournaments in Seattle, and to all the guys who showed up.  See you at the next one!<br/>
