<br/>
By Brian Terwilliger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The First Annual 'Battle of Midway' took place to allow a sole champion within the Coruscant region.  Coruscant has the most number of 2000 players, and is arguably one of if not the BEST regions in the game.  Our region is consisted of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.  Within the states separate 'sectors' of players attended the tourney to battle for the Coruscant crown.  The 'sectors' attending were Penn, Rochester, Syracuse, Jersey, The City, and Albany. <br/>
<br/>
The tournament was quite unique since it had 4 full rounds, (8 games) which were sure to knock out all undefeated players.  The most popular light decks were Nudj Relvolver and Tat Celebrate.  For Dark, there were a many decks.  Many based on 'anti-revolver' packing 15+ sites each, others included ISB Probe Droid/Undercover, Hunt Down/Epic Duel, and Cloud City Special Delivery.  <br/>
<br/>
The Albany group consisted of myself, my dad, and my brother, and Star Wars buddies, Aaron Kingery, Matt &amp; Dan Sokol, and Johnny Chu to name a few.  My bro, dad and I each entered the tournament with the Nudj Relvolver and anti-revolver AT-ST beat down deck with 14 sites.<br/>
<br/>
I'll review the tournament through my games since that's what I saw with the greatest detail.<br/>
<br/>
MY DECKS :  REVOLVER and an AT-ST Beat Down Deck<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1:  REVOLVER vs.  (???) an Endor Operations Deck<br/>
<br/>
I got a terrible hand and it looked bleak from the beginning.  My opponent set up the back door and my EPP's were worthless since I couldn't Nabrum and couln't battle when they deployed (an endor card which also makes me loose a force).  I was losing this game for the first 20 minutes but slowly caught up, I had Battle Plan out (but forgot to enforce it the majority of the game) and revolved the Back Door and gave Igar an Alien Beat Down (Twas Kah, BoShek, and Harc Seref.)  From there I took control of space w/ Tantive IV and the Spiral.  Obi Wan Smoke screened Evax and Tempest 1 off the table.  From here I battle my way to victory with a tracked destiny 5.  It was close but I squeezed out a win, mainly b/c my revolver's were useless.    Win  +15   2(+15)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2:  AT-ST vs. Martin Terwilliger, Tat Celebration<br/>
<br/>
My dad.  A 2.5 hour drive to play my dad's deck which was designed to beat me.  Well the game moved quickly as he set up celebrate fast with 6 x-wings at Tatooine  and 3 sites locked I needed to beat down.  My drains at Kiffex and Kashyyyk were ignored b/c I didn't have the force to feed Battle Plan.  So after taking drains up the wazoo for a couple turns, I placed Vader dlos, and Igar/Tempest 1 on the grand and 6 dreadnoughts with pilots.  I slowly took over the Tat system (after tying down his Organized Attacks).  And choke Vader went to school with a tracked destiny 6 to choke EPP Luke.  Another close one, but when the dust settled, Chicken walkers remained A.O.K.     Win +15    4(+30)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3:  AT-ST vs. Dan Sokol, Revolver<br/>
<br/>
After playing this game I realized I would have had a chance if I has started with Decree, but now I know.  So obviously I lost, but it was close.  He drained me with all EPP's at the Cantina and I took the air.  I held an Oota Goota Solo the entire game so he couldn't Ellis over the mosh pit against my Zuckuss and Tempest 1.  Late in the game he dropped 3 2/2 character's at Yavin sites, revolved and drained.   Loss -5   4(+25)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4:  REVOLVER vs.  (???), Ralitir Operations<br/>
<br/>
With a lucky draw, I revolved his system and next turn dropped Red Leader in Red 1.  The rest of the game can be summed up by, a few dark characters&amp;#8230;.   EPP smack, Nabrum, repeat&amp;#8230; let sit for 25 minutes, serves a family of 4.   Win +38  6(+63)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 5:  AT-ST vs.  Aaron Kingery ,Tat Celebrate<br/>
<br/>
This game was downhill from the very beginning.  Aaron dropped down 6 x-wings on turn 1.  Next turn he used x-wing assault squadrons to recycle them into his deck.  A few turns later he has 5 squadrons at Tatooine and several x-wings.  His power was well over 50, so I gave up the air battle.  My AT-ST's were useless since he only deployed 3 sites; Cantina, Jabba's Audience Chamber, and Mos Eisley.  After a big climatic Battle at Mos Eisley with every blue card in my deck, Vader, and such, I lost the battle 57-45.  From there he sat drained retrieved more, and beat on my remaining walkers.  I was driven to school, and Ben Kenobi was the bus driver.  Loss -10  6(+53)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6:  REVOLVER vs.  Aaron Kingery, Corlag Operatives<br/>
<br/>
This was a relief b/c my deck is ready for such cheese.  And I'm glad to say that since Aaron and I have know each other forever, we had fun with this.  After revolving most of his cool sites and his system, we talked trash back and forth.  'See this operative and guard, bring it on&amp;#8230;!!'  'Ok, EEP Luke and Han.'  'Loser.'  The game was a lot of fun as the rebel's flushed out Corlag.  And Obi Wan bounced operatives off each other.  But the play of the game goes to Aaron.  After it was clear that I had the game locked, he deployed the Tyrant to the Death Star, reach in his front pocket and played 'STAR DESTROYER!'  He said, 'Now what hippie!'  I laughed and sent Tantive IV and Wedge to kill it.  Win +29  8(+82)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 7:  REVOLVER vs.  Mike Dalton, Corlag Operatives<br/>
<br/>
The game followed the same structure as the last one accept I lost 8 cards to an early monnok (revolvers and 3 EPP Luke's).  But the game went slow, we battled mainly in the air, and BoShek took down Blizzard 2 with a tracked destiny 5.  This game should have been over a lot earlier that it did.  My opponent just ran out of ways to run.  Win  +21   10(+103)<br/>
<br/>
GAME 8:  AT-ST  vs.  Johnny Chu, REVOLVER<br/>
<br/>
At this point in the tourney my brother Chris was playing Matt Sokol for 1st place and the winner of this game would take 2nd.  This time I started with decree, and it made all the difference in the world.  I got Bosk in Bus in my opening hand and Yavin IV system.  I threw it down for quick drain.  Then Bane Malar and a Tempest Scout shuttled down to Yavin.  I killed a Nudj and then his EPP's came.  Luckily he missed Bane w/ Leia's blaster and my tempest walker remained.  My next turn I pounced onto Yavin with Vader dlos, and Tarkin in Tempest 1.  Slowly, the AT-ST's found their way to Yavin.  Decree was locked for the entire game so all my 2/0 sites served me well.  A late attempt to Ellis Obi-Wan and EPP Leia to my lone Zuckuss was defeated with an Oota-Goota-Solo.  From there my dreadnoughts took over space and the chicken walkers swarmed Yavin.  Revolver was finally defeated.   Win  +6    12(+109)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This tourney was a lot of fun and we are going to make it a seasonal classic where combatants send their best to the Battle of Midway.  My bro and me took top 2.  Not bad&amp;#8230; eh?  Below is a final tally of all 38 players.<br/>
