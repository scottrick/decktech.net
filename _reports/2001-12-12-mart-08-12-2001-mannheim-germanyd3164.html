<br/>
Damn, what a strange and long weekend, just 2 words before I start to report.<br/>
<br/>
"Watto Decks Just Sucks"<br/>
<br/>
Ok, know I’m ready to start with my first tournament report. The weekend started with the <br/>
tournament in Mannheim, it was just a small competition with only 12 players, but 12 players<br/>
are enough for Europe, and so we were able to play 6 games, and for me a tournament newbie, it was <br/>
just a great expirience, so let’s start with my firts game against : <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christian Wilbs/Watto Deck (it was a deck with the typical winkelhaus style from decktech)<br/>
<br/>
I’ve played Pod Profit and lost the game with -8, but it was a ruf game, and after 20 minutes <br/>
fighting for Mos Espa, we started to play our own way, I tried to win the Podrace as fast as possible to<br/>
play I Did It, and my "Threepio With .." and "A Gift" kept me alive, cause no drains at Tatooine, and<br/>
so I just hoped to get "Honor Of The Jedi" fast into hand to stop the direct damage of 2 every turn, but NO honor for me!<br/>
After some hard battles in the Chamber I released finally Han, and then things started to get better, the only thing<br/>
that killed me, was my missing Master Luke (He Hasn’t Come Back, Yet). So Maul With double bladed saber gave me the rest,<br/>
and the sucking tatooine occupation make my sick. I’ve lost my first game with -8 Damn!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2 Game against a good friend of mine : <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sascha Winter/<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this was just fun, I knew Sascha and his deck, I’ve played over 100 times against him, and I knew his<br/>
style to play, so I just wait for his basic mistakes, and my "Court Of The Ville Gangsta and Podrace Deck", was just<br/>
to good, the first round i pulled out Gailid, and started to drain for 2 after the first round, after some drains of me<br/>
and the podrace with Watto’s Box the game was over, I think it tooked my only 15 minutes to beat him, with +32<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3 Game against :<br/>
<br/>
Nico P./Watto Deck<br/>
<br/>
The second Watto Deck in just 3 hours, and that at my first tournament after 1 year, I wasn’t able to beat him in<br/>
the chamber, he just deployed Palpy and killed my sweety Threepio and my "A Gift" so I had to try to kill Watto, but<br/>
Maul and Vader protected his ass, and after some high drains with mauls stick and the tatooine occupation the game was over<br/>
and I’ve lost it with -11 Damn, Watto sucks, and I’ve lost my 3rd game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4 Game against :<br/>
<br/>
Michael Fritsch/No Objective, No Style,No Way To Kill Me<br/>
<br/>
That was just a beat down, after 5 turns.He played Lars Moisture’s Farm starting and he deployed just Qui without his stick<br/>
so with Colo Claw Fish, Jade with stick, and the new Boba, I beat him down, and gave him direct damage of 15 or higher,<br/>
after this battle, and after Podracin’ with Watto’s Box, the game was over, and I beat him with +40<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5 Game against :<br/>
<br/>
Nico P./Watch Your Step ....<br/>
<br/>
My 2nd Game against Nico, and now I played my ruf Dark Deck, he played a basic Watch Your ... Deck, with Dash and Wedge <br/>
in the sky and tons of Palace Raider. But, he wasn’t able to kill my Gailid, and Jade with Stick,Dr.Evazan and IG-88 With Gun<br/>
stayed in the Cantina, their were no way for him to beat me, he’s Luke was just killed every time with Colo Claw Fish, and <br/>
so I won the race, retrieved 11 Force and win the game with +16<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
6 Game against :<br/>
<br/>
Andreas Flachsbart/ISB Ops<br/>
<br/>
My last Game, and I hoped to win this game, and I won this game with +26, it wasn’t very hard to beat the sucking ISB<br/>
Spy and Outer Rim Scouts, I just finished my Podrace with 5 race dests, and after I canceld his Mobilization Point<br/>
with my defensive Shield, he wasn’t able to activate enought force and to beat me. I pull out all my mains to my battlegrounds<br/>
fliped my card and gave him a direct damage of 7 or higher every turn, so the game finished after 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this was just a small tournament report of a small tournament in Europe, but I wanted to pull it out to decktech,<br/>
a friend of me won the tournament with the new Dark Lightsaber Combat Deck and Dagobah Training Deck (for the light side)<br/>
I made the 3rd place with 4 wins and 2 lost games. So it was OK, but WATTO DECKS WILL ALWAYS SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
