<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">8/26/00 Today there was another tournament held at the Book Exchange in Augusta Ga. The one last week was won by Paul Meyers. I wasnt able to play because i had to work. So all last week i playtested decks, i made all kinds from light numbers to endor ops.  none made me happy though.  On friday night i get on decktech and i see a deck posted by bastian, its a brangus glee deck. i like it so i put it together. it wrecks most anything i can throw against it. for light i ended up playing a harvest deck.  i hadnt seen one in quite sometime so i thought it would play well.  plus i couldnt think of anything else to play.  so i get there and there is a pretty good turnout 20+ i think.  i have the highest rating of anyone there going in at 1971.  well first round pairings were announced and i have to play against a 12 year old kid who only learned how to play a couple of days ago.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my Harvest Vs. Forrest's ??????????<br/>
he starts back door and no starting interrupt.  i start the usual obi wans hut lars farm.  there really no detail to go into this game.  i drain 2 at lars farm with a bomar monk, 2 at back door with epp luke and 1 at the endor docking bay. i only deploy 9 cards and win the game by 51.  <br/>
2(+51)<br/>
<br/>
i really hated playing such a new person to the game. there really wasnt anything i could do to win by less. i didnt have traffic control out and i didnt draw or activate much.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My Brangus Porn Star Vs. Chris Meyers Profit.  <br/>
the brangus deck wrecks profit of anykind. i set up brangus at deathstar. he does his own thing for a few turns. blast door controls wreck him. brangus brings back set for stun, monnok, and always thinking with your stomach 4 or 5 times each. jedi luke gets missing, boussh gets captured by ig-88. i kill a couple of ben kenobi's and epp hans with epp vader, i had 2 6's and a 5 stacked.  lose vader exchange a docking bay for the just lost vader.  i take it by 22.<br/>
4(+73)<br/>
<br/>
this deck is a machine. to anyone who thinks otherwise, i suggest trying it out. if you are good enough to play the deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My harvest Vs. Paul Meyers bhbm numbers.  <br/>
this deck was a surprise to see. Emperor, tech mor, and some destiny 4 mexican come out. odds hit many times and i was keeping up for the most part with a harvest on my and his turn. rise my friend keeps his odds very high. i almost outlast him but drains at endor with presence and rendilli with presence proved to be too much for my stupid ass light deck.  lose by 2.<br/>
4(+71)<br/>
<br/>
this deck sucks ass. but i couldnt think of anything else to play. oh well i guess ill have to head back to the drawing board.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My brangus Vs. paul Meyers elom profit.<br/>
so i get to play paul again. He starts with the alien han, uh oh, your insight and something else. i start off fast with brangus and many monnoks insue.  he loses like 20+ cards off 3 monnoks. i dont think he understood what i was doing cause he asked me "how many monnoks do you have in that deck". im like 1 dude, you havnt seen me exchanging a docking bay everyturn when i play a monnok. i take no drains all game i think and i only lost 1 to profit damage 1 time i think. not much of a challenge playing against eloms with this deck. towards the end of the game i drop barquin dan and broken concentation. i drain him to one card and then retrieve my whole lost pile. win by 39<br/>
6(+110)<br/>
<br/>
i felt alittle bad about retrieving my whole pile. IM LYIN LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my harvest Vs. Carmine's set your course ties.<br/>
he starts off slow for a tie deck. he only drops 1 system and some ties. it could be worse handles drains.  he plays his one grabbler on my tunnel vision. not sure why he did that.  anyway i harvest on everyturn. I hope she's alright comes out and hurts him pretty bad. plus drains of 2 at obi's hut and lars farm with monks. and late i drop super falcon against a squadron tie and an interceptor. and i play i know. 5 destinys against 2 ties with no destiny. i play legendary star@#$%er.combined with i hope she's alright push me to victory. win by 26<br/>
8(+136)<br/>
<br/>
the deck worked perfectly against ties.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my brangus Vs. Clay Cushman's Charlie herrins there's good in him.<br/>
<br/>
the winner of this game would win the tournament.  i start slow, it took about 5 turns to draw a brangus.  but a first turn vader to the endor docking bay chokes him for a while. i get 2 monnoks in, getting 2 falcons and some other stuff. onith takes out 2 captain hans and a wedge. he dosnt do much this game as i got a good draw with the monnok's.  hot jedi never comes out and i drain at endor system and his 2 1/0 docking bays.  he plays an out of comission and i have a pretty good size lost pile.  he gets a death star docking bay so my recursion is halted. it didnt matter though as i had already killed most of his characters and he was almost out of force. fury comes out pretty late but i never lose to it cause of the lack of characters. plus vader got missing.  i win by 14.<br/>
10(+150)<br/>
<br/>
once again the brangus deck rolls. even though i got a bad draw with no brangus's it really didnt matter. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So i win the tournament. i should get acouple of ratings points. not many though as i lost to paul and 4 of my games will serve as making up for that loss.  but all in all i had a fun day.  now for the props and slops<br/>
