Pretourney:<br/>
I arrive 15 minutes earlier and meet Heraclio and a friend at a near bar, where we have a coffee. I use my Jedi powers and go to the WC. When I get back, Heraclio has payed the coffee for me... :-).<br/>
Well, there’s no more pretourney this time. I’me getting sick about telling to everybody how I spend my time and blah, blah, and trying to figure what to say to make you think I’m funny, etc. <br/>
Only 9 players. I expected that, since we are on holiday here (Spain is a BIG holiday, you know). <br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
DS: Retardosausus ’Hunter’ deck card-by-card. I decided to give this one a try. I have to modify my Brangus deck and my old Dark Deal v. 3.0 doesn’t seem to work. I played ISB a lot, but long time ago, and I haven’t tested how I do/must do with it.<br/>
LS: Watch Your Beer (my WYS with Palace Raiders). A pretty solid deck that I get too confident to play with = lose sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. Mario Tarín’s TIGIH/Scouts. <br/>
Uh-oh. This is too much for a warm-up for my 1st time with Retardosaurus. And Mario seems to be playing way better than me lately. And he’s playing a new deck, too, but I’m sure he has tested it a lot. I cant remember what he started, but he was playing straight scouts, so those kind of. I start IAO, Mob. Points and SSPFT. He sets up in two turns (gasp!) with every cool character you can think of: Midge, Luke, every other scout... My deck gets slow, and I deploy DVDLOTS to get Luke and go to Chirpas. But he manages to deploy there Orrimaarko and 3 more scrubs, play a card to reduce my draw -3, another to make his +3  and wipe me out there. For now (incredibly fast, like 4th turn), he’s won 2 battles, so I lose Vader to never deploy him. I deployed Arica to stop his drains, keeping me from deploying to space, but in the end he gets Corran Horn, break Arica’s cover and battle. I have Ghhhk. The game has gone too fast for my ISB, or I must to learn how to slow it. <br/>
<br/>
High: Having a real test to this deck. Props to Mario, he played masterfully. <br/>
Low: Hmmm... none, really. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Bye.<br/>
Cool. Grrr... I hate Mario for making me have the bye. I tell everybody at the store how I hate him. I see him sneaking into the other room with a big smile on his face... :-)<br/>
I ask at the shopper for singles and find a lot of foils I’m missing, so I buy them. Like 18 cards. I trade a lot, too, and I feel happy... heh, funny, you spend money and feel happy... hehheh... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Bye: 2 -23 (2 -23)<br/>
<br/>
High: Uhmmm...	<br/>
Low: Errr... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs. Heraclio’s MKOS/Abyssins. <br/>
First time I face this deck. I dont know if it’s sooo good or it’s just I’m a scrub or he had a god-hand. <br/>
Sorry, I cant remember what he starts, but nothing strange for that kind of deck. I start Squassin, Insurrection and Staging Areas. He sets up softly at JP: Audience Chamber, but I get no aliens in hand to avoid None Shall Pass. Although I get Cap. Han and Dash. So I set up with them at Tatooine, along with Tatooine Cellebration. I know Zuckuss in Mist Hunter can cause me some problems, but I’m holding Wedge, EPP Han and another Falcon in hand. I dont have Rebel Barrier, but I save 1 force to bluff it. Wrong. It happens he deploys ZiMH, 4-Lom with Gun aboard, Bossk In Hounds’ Tooth, Stinger/Guri,  and I think Virago ALL OF THEM for cheap, thanks to Scum And Villainy and other gametexts. My jaw drops. He battles, and well, since he has 4 battle destiny draws and each of them is +2 from his flipped objective -and now I only draw 1, which he cancels with his objective, I lose everything but the Falcon, wich keeps there for the rest of the game -resting in peace.  Next turns it’s me draining with Jedi Luke at the Cantina and at a docking, and without T:Cellebration and Menace Fades, Gailid kills me. I try, joking -you know, to pretend I’m a jerk and draw up all my cards, knowing he has Abyssin Ornament. Of course he plays it at retrieves 4 more cards. (Heh, he thought he only had 3 to retrieve and I had to remind him... :-))<br/>
<br/>
FL 0 -18 (2-41)<br/>
<br/>
High: Again, playing Heraclio: big fun. Props to this guy, and to his excellent deck. <br/>
Low: I s*u*c*k big time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs. Nacho Esteban’s EBO-X.<br/>
Okay, we got paired 2 times the tourney before, and I lost to his EBO-X twice. But it was cause my new version of Dark Deal stinks. And now I know every card in his deck, hehheh. This is, though, one of the rarest games I have played in my life. He starts the usual effects, but it seems he’s going a bit slow. And me... Let me tell you... It’s 4th turn and I’m still activating 5 cards, cause I have got in hand every single ship and Walker, but no locations, no admirals, no Imperial Command, and more important, no Outer Rim Scouts and no cards to search for them. I draw every turn, and my hand gets to 21. I’m like okay, I’m gonna lose, lets do it easy and go home. He’s been slow, too, but already has 5 XWings with Gun at a system, like 3 at another, EBO running and the Bantha Droid letting him have a new hand playing How Did We Get Into This Mess UP TO 4 TIMES in a single turn. Unfortunately for him he couldn’t get the card he needed -XWing retrieval, I think. I draw (it’s 5th turn) my 7 cards, after deploying a couple effects. My hand gets to 24 cards! I have nothing on table but red cards... One of them is Den Of Thieves, and I finally get an ORS. He draws and after telling me for a couple times, he plays Grimtaash... lost. Incredible. I play 3x Imperial Commands and 6x ORS, but, 24  with cards in hand I have no duplicates. He sees I have Executor, Devastator, Piett, DVDLOTS, Guri, another 3 Star Destroyers, Boba in Slave I, my 2 Walkers, pilots... I cancel one of his big drains with an ORS and lose 3 random cards (I can choose from 24...). My turn. Since he has deployed a couple systems, I can now deploy Avenger with Chiraneau aboard, along with Dengar in Punishing One. Draw a few. His turn, I cancel a drain with another ORS and lose 3 from hand. This is getting different... Now I can deploy Zuckuss In Hunter to Fondor (he has there 3 XWings so I cant deploy Executor), and Executor, and move over to his Sullust where I can drain for 2. With Battle Order on table, we had to decide when to drain, so we havent lose too much, and this has slow him more than me, since I couldn’t drain early. Next turn, I cancel again another drain with an ORS, and deploy the Walkers to Hoth, with Ozzel and ORS to one, Merrek (I finally draw him... when every planet was out...), and move a walker to the Base to fulfill Imperial Decree. I flip my objective. He now drains for 4, using 9 cards!. From here, it’s me ahead in the drain race, so he comes to battle in a final attempt. I deploy my Admiral Order, more ships, clean the house and win a game I never thought about. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
