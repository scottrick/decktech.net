<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ontario SWCCG Provincials Director’s Report (Sat May 12, 2001)<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Toronto -- The Ontario 2001 SWCCG Provincial Championships was held<br/>
Saturday, May 12 at Metro Hall (55 John St.).  The reason I start off with<br/>
this is because there were numerous notable absences at start time.  We<br/>
ended up with 34 players but I could name at least 20 players (mostly from<br/>
MenaceCon) who could have played but did not show up.  So we could have had<br/>
50+ players but some players’ schedules were in conflict or some players<br/>
forgot.  C’est la vie...&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Mike Stirling (Toronto) was the surprise dominant player of the day up until<br/>
the last game.  Mike was in first place for most of the day and then had to<br/>
face off against Filip Vukcevic (Oakville) twice in a row.  At the beginning<br/>
of the 3rd round, Filip and Mike both had a chance to make the final duel<br/>
but only if one of them won both games because their differential would not<br/>
be enough to hold off the other competitors.  Mike and Filip ended up<br/>
splitting their games with final differentials of +84 and +73, respectively.<br/>
Not enough to crack the top 2.  On a side note, Mike wasn’t ’all there’ by<br/>
day’s end but it didn’ t seem to affect his gameplay. =)&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Sachin Sud (Toronto area) suffered his only loss of the day in sanctioned<br/>
play, in game 4 to Filip Vukcevic’s light deck but it did not affect his<br/>
differential badly (loss by 6).  Sachin’s early huge differential wins,<br/>
certainly gave him the cushion down the stretch so that he could qualify for<br/>
the final duel even if another player were to go undefeated.  In fact, he<br/>
did more than just qualify, he finished first in the standings.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Martin Prud’homme (Orleans), suffered an early loss in game 2 at the hands<br/>
of Stephen Agnew’s (Toronto) dark deck by 12 cards. However, undeterred,<br/>
Martin would go on to win every game from then on and finished with a<br/>
convincing 31-card win over Norman Lansing (Bowmanville) to propel him into<br/>
2nd place by 12 differential points.  Martin was 4th entering into the final<br/>
game as the final 2 playoff spots could have been grabbed by any of 7<br/>
players who had at least 4 wins at this point (Mike, Sachin, Martin Leblanc,<br/>
Filip, Jeff Peck, Stephen and Martin).&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
So Sachin Sud and Martin Prud’homme finished one-two after 3 rounds of play<br/>
and would face each other in the Final Duel.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Game 1:  Sachin played My Kind of Scum dark deck against Martin’s, Watch<br/>
Your Step light deck.  Martin took firm control of space with Dash, Theron<br/>
Nett and Wedge at Tatooine and Kessel.  Sachin was setting up in Jabba’s<br/>
Palace but was pressured to go fight Martin because Menace Fades was in<br/>
effect.  A lucky Out of Commission kept Myo (Sachin’s rep) in the sidelines.<br/>
Reacts, destiny adders, and Talon Karrde helped Martin hold an advantage in<br/>
battles at Tatooine sites.  Although Sachin was retrieving and battling, his<br/>
characters did not stick around for very long while Martin’s huge forfeit<br/>
smugglers absorbed a lot of damage.  a Noble Sacrificed Theron Nett sealed<br/>
the 14 card win, even with Secret Plans on the table.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Game 2:  Martin played Bring Him Before Me for his dark deck against<br/>
Sachin’s Yavin: Throne Room light deck.  This game was off to a slow start<br/>
as neither player could setup quickly.  Martin established control of the<br/>
Cloud City docking bay with imperial mains.  After losing to Your Destiny,<br/>
Sachin deployed Luke and Obi to the docking bay for an all or nothing<br/>
battle.  Luke was captured but released due to Blaster Proficiency and the<br/>
site was eventually cleared.  Martin then tried to setup in space at Carida<br/>
to drain but Sachin quickly deployed the Super Falcon and proceeded to<br/>
deploy Legendary Starfighter.  In a game of little draining, this Effect<br/>
sealed Martin’s fate along with a 5-card On the Edge retrieval by Sachin.<br/>
Sachin would hold on to win by 20 cards.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
The final duel featured some very strange games and to compound that, light<br/>
side won both games even though dark side seems to dominate the current<br/>
SWCCG scene.  Congratulations to Sachin on becoming Ontario’s 2001<br/>
Provincial Champion.  Both players received a custom sling-bag with their<br/>
respective placings and they will receive a bye into Day 2 of the<br/>
Continental Championships being held at GenCon Game Fair in Miilwaukee,<br/>
Wisconsin on August 2-5.  Sachin, as Provincial Champion, also earned a bye<br/>
into Day 2 of the World Championships being held at DecipherCon (location to<br/>
be announced) sometime after September 11.  Hopefully, both players will<br/>
represent Ontario at these events.&lt;br&gt;<br/>
&lt;br&gt;<br/>
Thanks to all the players who came out to play and I hope you guys had some<br/>
fun and I look forward to seeing you at the next event.  Check<br/>
