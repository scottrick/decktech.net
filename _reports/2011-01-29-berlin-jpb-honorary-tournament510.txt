<blockquote><font class="bfont"> <br>
This TR will hopefully prove that people who don't have other SWCCG players in their area are not helpless and deprived of the means to be good at this amazing card game and, more importantly, to have fun. It will definitely show that, as every game, SWCCG is a game of mistakes.<br>
<br>
History<br>
<br>
As this is my first report ever, I want to give you some information about myself. Especially that it's finally confirmed that I am not Patrick D..<br>
I live in Poland in a city where only two more ppl are aware of the constant existence of this game. One of them does not own cards, the other has everything but he, according to his own words, "cannot bring himself to playing this game when one can draw 3 or 4 destinies in a single battle". Fair enough, but that basically means I have no one to play with or against here and so the only way for me to enjoy SWCCG is with the use of Holotable. I do the latter a lot. Since I got back to the game in December 1997 I must have played more than 700 games. I played with decks built by others, with my own creations, fun decks, competitive ones, crappy and good. I've done it all, I've seen plenty. <br>
I played in one RL tournament before Berlin. It was early 1998 when I took a DBO and Executor CCT to finish almost at the very bottom in a last official SWCCG tournament in Poland. I built some decks in the meantime trying to talk my friend into playing with me (I lost him to WoW) and even trying playing with my wife twice (fell asleep both times). I never succeeded with my persuasion skills and so my next RL game took place against DDM already in Berlin the day before JPB Honorary Tournament.<br>
<br>
Deck choices<br>
<br>
Some time before the MPC 2011 I started playtesting on HT with Barry Alperstein. I usually talked decks with Jarad Konsker and Tom H. as well, but I don't meet them on HT that often anymore, so we just exchanged a few PMs and deck lists. I also thought it would be good to get in contact with a person, who both plays on HT and is coming to Berlin. The only candidate that stood out of the pack was DDM himself, so I sent him and e-mail and after him making sure that his usual teammates aren't coming, we decided to join forces. After a lot of talking and a bit of playing with my fellow PTsters, just a week before the MPC, I narrowed it down to 4 decks a side. At that point I was thinking WYS(v), QMC, TRM Reid Style or Barry's Yet-To-Be-Revealed Mystery Deck for LS while HD(v), Rops, Eops or HD for DS.. I ruled out strong Profit for LS as I thought everyone would be rdy for it, and I regretfully decided not to spend more time on Court as, as I then thought, "Profit flips it straight away taking the whole engine away from it, so I can't take it". <br>
<br>
In the meantime, DDM was producing the weirdest DS. decks with the speed of a machine gun, while Barry finally deided to go with Watto and Eops for DS., and with my QMC for LS. And then came the MPC. We were a bit surprised with the speeder decks that emerged, but other than that nothing really new happened in the meta with foreseeable disappearance of regular WYS and  the demise of Watto, to which Barry among others contributed. With that data I decided to build 3 decks per side (WYS(v), QMC, TRM with Sabers / Rops, Aobs, HD(v)) and I finally sat down to printing and cutting v-slips (HUGE props to V-kit and JediJer here). <br>
A little aside here. I can only after that experience understand why so many ppl were pissed off by the PC to pull off the infamous Revolution. For me, the on-line only player, it was a matter of waiting for another HT update, which came out pretty soon. But for everyone else it meant spending hours on looking through their old and cutting hundred of new slips. What a chore!<br>
Because of how tedious putting decks together is, I forced myself to narrow my choices down to 2 decks per side. WYS(v) seemed such an obvious and good choice after the MPC that it was too good to be left alone and therefore I believed everyone would tech for the Corellian machine. That was my LS cut then. With DS. I knew I'd take Rops as one of the two. It's the deck I have the most experience with, my early-days-mentor Darren Pilbeam thought me the game on this platform, so it's always a safe choice for me. While I was deciding on a 2nd DS. deck (AOBS with Too Cold For Speeders Combo just in case was half built), a pretty meaningful thing occurred i.e. Mike Richards posted his Tournament Report. It turned out that his DS. deck that took him to the Top 8 was COTVG. My initial reaction was how the heck do you play Profit in Matt Sokol's bracket? I concluded it must be anti-Aaron choice and I went on reading his TR. Literally when I got to the part when he was talking about his game against Mr. Sokol, DDM started talking to me. I got distracted and almost missed the most crucial part but thenwell, read for yourself:<br>
<br>
me: I am just reading Richard's TR<br>
  how the hell is he not flipped against Profit???<br>
 David: I read it too<br>
 me: (with Court)<br/>
 David: he said he wasn't ?<br/>
 me: is the frozen guy not regarded a captive?<br/>
 David: ahhhh<br/>
  errr<br/>
  I slept two hours last night :D<br/>
 me: :(<br/>
 David: checking right now<br/>
 me: If that's the case, I am back to playing Court :)<br/>
 David: Court Of The Vile Gangster / I<br/>
Shall Enjoy Watching You Die<br/>
The frozen Han character deployed<br/>
by the Light Side Objective Card<br/>
You Can Either Profit By This... / Or<br/>
Be Destroyed will count as a captive<br/>
towards the flip condition of this<br/>
Objective card, but because a frozen<br/>
character has ability of zero, frozen<br/>
Han will not flip this Dark Side<br/>
objective by himself<br/>
me: !!! Jeeezzz...more slips cutting :/<br/>
 David: :D<br/>
<br/>
So I built Rops and Court for DS.. The final decision to play QMC/Court was made during a long drive from my city to Berlin. I weighed and thought about a lot of aspects but the most crucial one was that in both decks I decided on you track for the cards in piles more than for specific destinies, which suck in both of the piles anyway, so you gotta make plays without them. An argument really vital for an on-line only player.<br/>
<br/>
Lists<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to write a detailed strategy for either deck, I'd rather focus on very short histories of them, their weaknesses, strengths and some cards I like.<br/>
<br/>
QMC<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say this deck is my own creation, but its initial idea (no matching ships, just a Reid like TRM fleet + ATF+Lando Effect) comes from Jarad Konsker. I took a deck from his hands to further develop almost two years ago. Throughout these years, which saw me playing this deck in almost every Online League game, I decided that Overseer with his pilot is the most magnificent activation platform, that H1 is a better way to hold a system, that I don't want EPPs in here as I miss all swings anyway, and, last but not least, that Lando Effect is one of the most amazing cards ever.<br/>
<br/>
This deck:<br/>
- activates tons<br/>
- easily draws ppl into making mistakes, which cost a game<br/>
- has a nice mixture of ground and space<br/>
- has 3 ways to end a game (drain race, battle in space, battle on the ground)<br/>
- has room for nasty tricks<br/>
- still folds to SAC<br/>
- colapses when Harc(v) is dead or not around<br/>

<br/>
This deck was originally made by Johnattam Murray aka. Throdo and did really well at Worlds last year. I saw the deck for the first time in the hands of Nick Culpepper. I tried it quite a lot on HT, won some, lost some but one thing I definitely learnt about this deck is: it's really, really fun to play. It also has some very intricate tricks built in, some of which my opponents tasted in my games with it. As I already said, I would have never taken this to play if not for Mike Richards and DDM, so props to you, gents!<br/>
<br/>
This deck:<br/>
<br/>
- can set-up really fast when needed be<br/>
- makes ppl really mad and impatient with its pinging damage<br/>
- can produce a lot of power with as little force as 12 and 8 cards in hand<br/>
- keeps coming at you<br/>
- shield busts itself during the 1st turn<br/>
- still struggles with Mace the Ace and SAC<br/>
<br/>
I won't go into details about the specific cards, you may found them on Throdo's decktech page and in Richard's TR. I will just mark the 2 changes I made to Mikes deck, which I worked with in the end. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
None Shall Pass (V)  less counter prone that barrier, I never used it throughout the day, though,  so I  <br/>
                                     think 2nd  <br/>
                                     Cold Feet(V) is a better choice (or maybe Stop Motion(v) as its a nice counter as <br/>

<br/>
As for the things that happened before the tournament, I will definitely remember meeting David and Paul. They were the first ppl I met from our community of SWCCG. They were exactly what I expected and more in the nice and helpful area. They borrowed me some cards, and then I played my first game against DDM and his not-at-all-like-Mike-Richards speeder deck. I won somehow and we went to sleep. We woke up an hour before the registration started, had some breakfast and made a first mistake of the day: we walked to the shop where the tournament was to take place instead of driving there. Berlin is one of those old imperial cities with long and wide roads where number 253 is at least half an hour walk from number 192. Now we know! We made a few jokes on the way about being late to tournaments but we finally got there on time. Almost everyone was there, the Swedish guys, Wales community (  ), the Vikings!. Chris and zee Germans arrived minutes later, with them showing me to themselves, pointing and finally feeling me out, checking if I am real. <br/>
All seemed good at the end and they announced the first pairings. I gotDDM. Ofc. How often have I read about teammates traveling together for miles only to play each other. Well, this felt nothing like this, as I only played David once live However, I felt bad for him as half of his decks strength is in surprise factor and I knew it inside out. <br/>
<br/>
First game: my QMC against DDMs Rambo trooper deck.<br/>
<br/>
Ill let David describe his deck in detail, I will just say that its on HD(v) platform with build-a-vader EE, Imperial Stockpile, sending single troopers that draw 2 or 3 destinies, add a destiny to power and shoot ppl to death and for overflow. He starts his usual stuff, i.e. pulls his activation (Endor and 3 xJP sites) and puts Nevar to the imperial city. I pull a site, find Harc and his ship and I had enough force to put Corran to the city and clear Nevar. I even drew some, I think. He deploys Domination, Vader, MMTM to Jabbas palace and a trooper to Corran site. I play Coward so he has to deploy another trooper to a different JP site, so he can retrieve Nevar, and when he fights, retrieves, plays some interrupts and I finally Houjix (no force to grab), hes left with a very short hand an no force. I was tempted to kick the single troopers ass, but I decided to pull more activation and flip with Leia and a scrub instead. David pulls a system (Gal this time), attacks my Lobot with whom I attempted to pull Lando from RD as a react. David sensed, which I grabbed and sensed instead so I dont have to lose anything by my two guys this time. He then draws some and accumulates. I just drain and pull some stuff from force pile. I dont know wheather he has no more troopers in hand or if he decides that he needs space presence sooner or later, but instead of going after Leia he deploys Executor to Bespin, which I barrier. I think he has another sense in hand, but if he plays 3 for it, Executor is up for a next turn H1 beatdown, so he has to settle for deploying Thrawn to the big ship. <br/>
I really cant remember what happened in the next few turns, but in the crucial turn of mine the situation was as follows: there was a barriered trooper in front of Leia, I had just drawn his Ghhkk with a 3 character battle of some kind and there was Executor on Gal (no Thrawn) in front of Harc in his ship. David had 2 cards in hand. I drained at Bespin and issued a beatdown on a lone trooper with Leia accompanied by Lando, Scoundrel (v) and the Lando Effect. He reacted with the gun, I did the Lando effect stuff and then he shot Leia andforgot Gals text!!! Which would turn mine beatdown into a beatdown of me instead. Still, to give you some perspective of how scary a single trooper can be. I had one destiny tracked, 2nd was low as usual but I added 3 to it, so it was a decent amount in the end, around 17, I believe. Troopers forfeit was 0 ofc. He still only had to lose 8, I think. <br/>
Nevertheless, I was pretty much in the zone from then on and took a game by 15.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+15) / VP: 2<br/>
<br/>
Second game: my Court against John Ms Cor 2/2<br/>
<br/>
When I saw what John plays I wasnt happy at all. Early pressure form Yoda + a possible Mace with Saber turn 2 or 3 to my AC would mean an uphill game for me. The game went differently, however. I think nothing happened turn 1 for John (he just played virtual Cor:JCC, and 3po that got Failured, and that sticked for good), and cause I had plenty of evasion in hand, I dropped my usual package: Jabba, Bip, Scum, system, DB. Drew 1, saved 1. He went with Yoder to the JCC, pulled something with the sites text and said go. I pulled another DB and reinforced the chamber. I lost to his drain and he drew. Feeling good about the AC I deployed to space with Boba, checked where my other ships are and said go. He didnt drain this time and attacked me fleet with HC&amp;F(v) I drew low and he cleared me with attrition. I retaliated with the Cruiser and Bossk feeling pretty confident I would kill Falcon with attrition. I got my 3 force back (First Strike) but drew low again and had to lose Bossk. Ouch. I had 8 force saved and Boba in RD so when he battled next turn I reacted with it and this time (with Prize on Jabba) I cleared Falcon with a drawn Vibro Ax for destiny. He then mounted an attack on my AC with lone Qui Gon, but I ceased fire and overflowed poor Jedi Master by 13 after forfeit. The game ended soon after with 20 left in my life force.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+20) / VP: 4<br/>
<br/>
So I thought: that went surprisingly well, bring on some more!<br/>
<br/>
Third game: my QMC against Dirks Watto<br/>
<br/>
Dirk is the nicest player I had to face all day. Hes just pure politeness and style, so the two games I played against him are what I will best remember from Berlin. Hes from Chriss crew, so I thought hell flip HD(v) on me, but they went with Watto that day instead. Not a great match-up for me, but I think I just have to match his initial speed and the more time we play, the less damage he can inflict on me. He starts KDY(v), Endor Shield and Ni Chuba, pulls his system, Cave, drops guys for 2 DD (I lose 1 from hand and Escape Pod, which I played for Houjix), piles them at the junkyard and its my turn. I miss pull 1 site, put another one from hand, Overseer is in force, so I draw and am lucky enough  its the 3rd  card in force pile, so I manage to save 2. He activates, deploys to Espa, bluffs a card. I pay 2 to see Tyrant at Bespin for 4 force with Thrawn abroad, and 1 force left in his force pile. I get Harc(v) this time and flip with him + two scrubs. I then fish for ATF from force pile and deploy Evac + fish for a Spiral on his turn. He drains for free, bluffs something, for which I lose 2 (and we joke about him guessing correctly when I would lose and when I would pay for his objective) and puts EPP Maul in front of my scrub. I barrier, he senses but I sense in return. At that point my highest ability character is Leia, so he watches my draw closely. I draw a 3 and its pretty high draw if you consider my destiny average. He then battles Overseer and I think about having a shot at killing Thrawn with reacting Spiral, but because of the bloody average I decide to play it safe with ATF. I spread around the CC even more, put Pucmir down, H1 with Ackbar to Bespin (barriered) + Celebration. From here on, between Leia, RP, Celebration and my drains of 6/turn I am steamrolling to another victory. Dirk tries to set-up Tat Occupation to get me down by some more, but its too late. I win by 20 or so.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+ ~20) / VP: 6<br/>
<br/>
So I feel pretty good, I have a little bit of time to grab something to eat and when they announce the next pairings, I am just finishing my coffee. I get to play Kristian, one of the Vikings. They say the whole team is pretty strong, so I need to make sure I dont make any mistakes. Wishful thinking<br/>
<br/>
Fourth game: my Court against Kristians Rebel Senate<br/>
<br/>
Kristian is this flawlessly English-speaking Viking, who, I thought, has the biggest potential in deck-building area of all players there. I spoke with Paul before this game, how his Rops got dismantled by Kristans senate, so now I was thinking fast what my plan should be. He started Wokling(v), SPlanning and QD(v), I started my usual 2 effects. I decided to gamble a bit by deploying Jabba + Bip + Scum + 3 shields on my first turn, while I luckily got the Passenger Deck to give me +2 activation next turn. I decided that I wont deploy the system this game and Ill leave it to my recurring fleet to battle it out for his system if he has one. I really hoped he had one, but I didnt expect it that early. It came with a Mothma pull, who was joined by Yoder pulled by JCC and his saber in senate. I carefully considered his activation potential and reinforced the AC myself, and then pulled Coward (4th pull, I am busted). The following turn was one of many this game that I forgot to make him lose for my objective. Kristian deployed new Bail to senate and HCF(v) to his system. And from this point on we fought over Coruscant sky. It took me turns and turns of battling, deploying, re-deploying, reacting, retrieving, and losing to finally clear his space package (which was huge and diverse). In the meantime, I was draining for 1 at the AC and not making him lose 1 for my objective, while Kristian didnt drain at the Night Club with Mace and Yoda for 2 turns (after the game, he said he thought Id pulled BOrder  and I was out of my pulls 2nd turn :/) and then I was getting hit with 3 and 1 (at senate). Nevertheless, my retrieval proved to be too much for him in the end and I finally pulled my 5th and 6th shield to win the game by 10.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+10) / VP: 8<br/>
<br/>
So I expect to play Angelo or Chris now, but I get one of the other Vikings instead  Morten this time.<br/>
<br/>
Fifth game: my QMC against Mortens SYCFA Flip<br/>
<br/>
I get to play LS this turn and Morten flips SYCFA on me, so I feel pretty good. I just have to find 3 cards in my deck (being: Houjix, Pucmir, H1), play fast and I should win this even if he retrieves 20 force. Everything goes right for me this game. I have barriers, houjix, Alter, so I just spread out, drain for 6 a turn and dig for H1. He tried to keep pace, flipping and attempting to battle me some, but I used barriers, ATF and Sense extensively to keep space and when H1 hit the table he was already in his teens with life force. All details you can find in Mortens TR (link: http://starwarsccg.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=288:james-paul-booker-honorary-tournament-berlin-012211&amp;catid=44:tournament-reports&amp;Itemid=141). I ended winning by 32, so I almost took home the Dutch bounty, but Julian beat one of the other Vikings by 36 the very same round, so it went to him instead.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+32) / VP: 10  <br/>
<br/>
After this game I am 100% sure Ill get Angelo now, but apparently he lost a timed game, so I am to face Dirk again. I am thrilled to play this guy one more time (did I mention he is a very nice dude?), but when he shows me LSC Combat my mood changes<br/>
<br/>
Sixth game: my Court vs. Dirks LSC<br/>
<br/>
Just before the tournament, I played a few games on-line against Combat with some decks I was testing for me and DDM and whether I lost or won those games, they all had one thing in common: they were a grind. I was already feeling tired at this point of the tournament, so having to play a game that ignited so many off-putting feelings was disconcerting. I knew, however, that if I win I take it all (I wasnt aware of the final confrontation), so I pulled myself together and started my game. I activated a ton, so I threw 4 guys to the AC (inclding Velken) and said go. Dirk was racing but I am not sure if he forgot it on his 1st turn or decided not to. He got Yoda to the 3/2 site and said go. He raced this turn and I went with a ship to Nal Hutta and more back-up to the AC. He drained and drew, pulling sense or alter along the way  cant remember now. So I was out of shields at that point (grabber, Border, 2 x SAC shield) and I had to attack him cause with the huge retrieval and drains of 3/turn, I would dwindle fast. Luckily he had Yoda at the 3/2 so I put First Strike out and attacked. He had no evasion so he took 1, I got 3 back and he decided to cut my guy to used. He drained on the following turn, deployed Luke, JK (missed a saber pull) to the 2/2 and moved Yoda there. Now it wasnt so straightforward to battle there and I was still uneasy about spreading to the Barge (which I pulled at some point), lest Mace comes over and he has Nabrun as well. So I think we exchange drains for the sequence of turns and then he retrieved like 10, as I couldnt find any of my 2 shield pullers. WowThis wasnt looking good. I forget why (maybe I did pull plans) he had no force in his force pile the turn when I decided to Elis the whole Chamber crew to his two Jedi. If anything else, I thought, Ill block a drain. So I did, and when I battled and retrieved, Dirk slapped his forehead in dismay as he had both the new Casey card and Balst The Door, Kid in hand I ceased for a moment, but he never asked to take back and we just followed with the battle. I ceased fire and overflowed him for 10+ (bless you Gela(v)!). We then run around the generators exchanging battles, losing to my objective and FS. When they finally called time, it looked like I have 2 more life force than Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
TW (+2) / VP: 12<br/>
<br/>
There it was, I won!!!<br/>
Or at least I thought so. Everyone congratulated me, I made phone calls, watched everybody getting their prizes and when I was about to get the trophy I heard final confrontation for the first time That was new. It turned out that Angelo, who took 2nd place after Swiss, wanted to battle it out for the trophy. He said that we hadnt played during the tournament, so its only fair to see who really deserves the glass. Yeah, as tired and mad because of that as I was, it seemed reasonable. It was around 7 PM  when we sat in the corner of the shop to play the first game.<br/>
<br/>
Final confrontation, game one: my QMC against Angelos Build-A-Vader HD(v)<br/>
<br/>
I am of the opinion that if you can keep Harc(v) and his ship on table this match-up should be a win. Of course its not easy and when Angelo started Combat Response my heart skipped a beat. I had to make a decision, which I consulted with Tom H. after he beat me steadily in the same match-up just a week before. Start or not to start Evac(v)? The reasoning is simple: you gotta keep Overseer on table, otherwise youre choked. With Black Leader and additional pilot, or worse even an additional ship, they draw two destinies and have around 10 power. Harc(v) is 5 + a destiny to power so something around 7 with the average in my deck. Hes immunity &lt;6 is enough to keep him alive against a single destiny, so I could lose some from hand/RD and hopefully back-up. Tom was advising me not start Evac, cause of obvious reasons, but I gambled and I stacked: a site/BoShek(v)/something. Angelo looked at me and, sincerely or not, declared that he likes that start. We then proceeded with the game. He activated anddeployed a system  a huge thing for the future safety of Harc(v). He then saved a bunch and said go. I activated, went for a site andno Overseer there. Bah I have to dig for it, but luckily its a 2nd card I draw. He then deployed Galen + Hoth site, flipped and said go. I really feared that he can get another ship with his pull, so I used Beldons eye for Harc(v), got a site and deployed a scrub + Obi to CC to flip and unflip him at the same time. I did not consolidate, as I had a barrier and Houjix in hand. And then came his fleet. Cause it turned out he had Galens Fighter with Black Leader in hand and he Responsed for Punishing One (v) with EPP Dengarwow...not only he got 2 ships, but also +3 to attrition, so now a lousy 3 wrecks my day. He battled, I evac-ed and hold my breathbut he drew a 2! I drew a 2 as well and lose 3 from the top. He moves Galen in front of my scrub and its my turn. I drained for 1, moved Harc(v) away, deployed H1:War Room and said go. <br/>
I dont remember the following turns that well. They involved Obi being Circled by Vader, me running away on the ground a lot, him draining on the ground and me steadily taking over space. In the crucial turn, things were looking good for me. I had H1 with Overseer in front of Black Leader in ship and Victory on Celebrated Bespin , Booster draining on Kashyyk, Fallen Jedi and Lobot at a site, to which Angelo just moved Galen and Dengar. I had about 12 force left with his 14. He had a very short hand, so had I cleared space I was looking at a slim win in the end. Wellthat would happen if I hadnt done what I actually did. I had this amazing interrupt in hand called Antillies Maneuver(v). I was activating while thinking where to battle. Space would be an obvious choice, but in some sort of blind stupidity I decided to play the freaking interrupt so to be safe with him unable to swing at me. As my dumbness continued I was thinking: with me drawing 2 destinies (tracked), adding + 3 with Lando effect, I could clear him from the site!!! That would be goooood. Wellit wasnt, as I forgot (sic!) that Galen has his saber and that he will likely add TO ATTRITION. So he did, and due to it I was left without ground. I fought for 2 more turns, trying to get the differential as low as possible, but I only got it to -11.<br/>

FL (-11)<br/>
<br/>
At that point I was mad with myself. I dont remember the way from the shop to the bar where we sat down to the final game at all as I was trying to figure out a plan for a 2nd game. Someone might have talked to me, maybe I was asking Angelo questions about his past performance, but at the back of my head was this nagging thought: how to play??? I was tired, hungry, and angry with myself, so the only thing I came with was: play fast! So we sat down at the separate table to play a game accompanied with beer and garlic bread that finished at 23:30!!!<br/>
<br/>
Final confrontation, game two: my Court against Angelos QMC<br/>
<br/>
We sat down after it all finished to compare our QMCs and it turned out my version is different than Angelos by 30 cards. It meant that I was facing a deck I did not really know what to expect from. His start with Beldons Eye, KTEOF and Squassins gave me some idea of how he plays, though. I sticked to my plan  and played awfully fast, going to AC first turn (with Velken as well), pulling everything I could activation wise. I know how hard it is to lose cards early with QMC, and I hoped hell lose something crucial. He just pulled a site next turn and drew. I drained for 1 (paying for BPlan), and deployed a ship or 2 to Bespin. He then dropped Harc(v) + 2 scrubs to his sites to flip. I drained, and attacked both sites, clearing him from both, if I recall correctly. Details are pretty vague from there on. Some crucial plays involved: Leia, RP with her gun to my Chamber (no presence, but no loss from my objective and safe Jabba with his Bounty on), him cancelling Scum (which I retrieved with FS), him clashing Mara and not initiating a fight with 3 guys for 6 force loss, me pinging in space and sometimes at his sites, and then clearing him from space with my mighty fleet. <br/>
This game got really interesting from a turn I deployed 4-Lom to AC and redeployed Scum. I had 2 battles in that 1 turn, retrieving 6, making him lose 2 and space. I had 30 something cards in life force, plenty in hand and Angelo didnt look like a happy man at all. By then came The Move, highlight of the weekend for sure. After seeing my lost pile so thin, Angelo mumbled something like: I at least have to try and Nabruned all ppl from a site he had stacked with 3 characters to the AC (with only Jabba and Bip there). With Leia, RP there and 4-lom at an adjacent site, I felt safe, so when Angelo asked me if I have an action, I said no. He then played a single card that he had in hand, which wasPrincess Leia(v). In the quiet words of the Virgin Mary... come again? <br/>
I panicked! I had no Ghhhk, or a puller in my 8 card hand. I had Elis, but a 5 on top of the RD and just 1 in force pile, no stunning leader as wellI was f***. Later on, Paul told me that it was pretty funny to watch my expression at that very moment of the conversion. Needless to say I lost Jabba, Bip and 13 cards from life force and hand. Geeezjust before that move I thought I had that one!... WellI still had around 14 cards in force, 2 in hand, FS out, he just cancelled scum again leaving himself without force in force pile. There was still a chance. So I drained for 5, and attacked with my 2 characters in hand for another 2 force swing. I then drew 1 and said go. I knew Angelo had his destinies tracked, heck, I tracked his 3 last destinies myself, so I knew that when he activated and left 3 it was a 5 and 2 4s in that very order. He drained for 2 and thought for a looong while. So long that it was apparent to me and probably everyone else watching that had he stayed put he would win the match by exactly 1. So imagine my surprise when he fetched for a card and tried Nabruning to to block a drain at Maras site at CC: having 4 force in force pile and a 5 for destiny on RD Now, ppl couldnt decide whether my face looked more surprised after The Move, or Angelos face when he drew a 5 for Nabrun and lost a match to me by1<br/>
