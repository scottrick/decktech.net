<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">SO I tried to write this freakin’thing twice now and it screwed up both times so I give up.  Basically for anyone who is still interested, I went 3-1 and lost my last game to Brian Rippetoe’s chesse Profit insert deck.  I beat Jon Chu and two random guys.  Thanks for reading and maybe next time I try to write a TR it won’t screw up.<br/>
