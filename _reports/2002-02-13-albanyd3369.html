Hi. This is Eric Hunter talking about a recent trip to Albany. Basically 9 of us where planning to go, then mike merleto and Andy Klema decided not to come (that is the short story). So 7 of us go cause elrond says 2 gay hobbits cant come (9 of us, same number as the fellowship, bah stupid joke people!). Anywho on Wednesday brad reihnhold comes up from North Carolina. From all the pictures of seen of brad he as always looked stoned. Why? 2 hours of sleep from big tournaments. Anywho when he arrives he doesnt look stoned. So despite popular belief he is not a stoner. Well moving on, he arrives and Hayes (my bro) plays cards with him while I watch evangellion. So I watch like half of it and my dad comes down and yells at us to go to bed so I do. I get up again and watch the rest of Evangellion. It is ok, but the last episodes Shinji becomes gay, he gains self worth or something and they abandon the cool Eva thing. So then we go to mike Gemmes house. We get there and Justin and Steve are there or at least get there later.  So I get there and I make a fellowship for brads lotr deck (well my deck he was going to use).  Then I make an isb it sucks. So I take brads Isb and tool with it. Trying to make it like my System overload deck. I realize that there was like no chemistry in the deck, like it didnt match me, not a good synch ratio (Eva thing).  So I play a game or two with my brads light saber combat, I decide to make it. I play against brad in lotr. I lose and I remake my deck. We leave to go back home. We get there and I tool with brads Isb deck some more and make it into my original System overload deck which used bombers. I play against Hayes really good light side senate deck. I beat him by 4. So anyway the time is like 4 am and I packed last night so I just go to bed.  I wake up and I pack cards. I need like half the cards for my light side and I made changes to my dark side. I bring lotr and raw deal and other stuff. Im ready to go and we leave at like 1. We stop at an convince store we get donuts and I get munchos and slim Jims. I eat 2 donuts a couple munchos and 2 slim Jims, then my breath is bad I have some orbitz gum. From eating all that @#$% it tasted like scalloped potatoes. Freaky.  So we talk tech in the car and we come up with some destroyer droid deck whatever. We get to Albany; everyone is there except Jeremy Oakes. So Anywho here is a recap.<br/>
7 people go to Albany. <br/>
1 car-Justin, mike, Steve (staying at Twiggs)<br/>
	other car Hayes, brad, me. (Staying at Sokols)<br/>
Oakes comes once he gets leaves work.<br/>
<br/>
So I playtest and hang out and its cool.  Twiggs, Joe (Jigga), and Matt Sokol are there so its fun. I play my dark side deck against Steve Baroni and I beat him even though he plays planetary defenses on the senate. I have a dark deck for the tournament tomorrow. At like midnight we go to Dennys and we eat, Jigga tells me about the 2.99 grand slam so I get that. We leave and go back to the Twiggs. We decide to go where we are staying and Jigga comes with us. We watch the movie called heat that is pretty cool. I get the crazy idea to attack Jigga. So I jump at him and hes just like ok and takes it. Here is a little description of Jigga. He is like 6 and 250+ pounds. What I did was pure suicide. Anywho he gets me into a wristlock and I tap out. I attack him against he just sits on me. I attack him again (my logic is that he will eventually wear out cause he is laughing hard and so he cant breath normally.). this continues for awhile then he says he has to go home. I Work on decks with brad and Hayes and Sokol. Then Sokol goes to bed then after awhile I go to bed too. However I cant sleep with Hayes and brad talking about decks so I go upstairs and sleep underneath the dining room table. <br/>
I wake up and shower. I watch cartoons while everyone else does the same. Then Mrs. Sokol tells us we she has been cooking breakfast. Last night I was joking around and asked what our breakfast was going to be and Matt (Sokol) said the complementary continental breakfast. So when I see the spread I am amazed. Chocolate fondue, cinnamon roles, eggs, bacon, potatoes, cereal, orange juice. I eat a ton because it was amazing. So anyway we go to the tournament and brad tells me he and Hayes have like the same decks. Which is kinda queer. <br/>
My decks are lightsaber combat with like every card borrowed from somebody. And isb, overload, tie bombers, space. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1. My light Vs brads dark.<br/>
I play against brad. Brad puts made the deck I was using and so he teched out for it correctly. He beats me with his bhbm by 15.<br/>
Highs: none really.<br/>
Lows: bad match up number 1!<br/>
<br/>
Game 2. My dark Vs Hayes hunter light,<br/>
Hayes has light saber combat and when I went to sleep last night brad played my dark against Hayes light and they say the light crushed it. I stick with my game plan and get naboo out and Zuckuss and scimitar 2. Next turn I blow up his site. I get out spaceport db and I drain there with an isb agent. He cant retrieve (coward) he cant drain (isb) and he cant beat me in space. I win a timed victory.<br/>
Highs: beating my bro.<br/>
Lows: none.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My dark Vs brain twigg hb.<br/>
I get out executor to Fondor and my tie bomber with jonus. We are draining in space and I flip, with a spaceport db to his Aquaris. He flips and I eventually probe his system (last one) He have been battling it out at the spaceport db and I have been retrieving agents. Eventually get his outrider, EPP qui-Gon and EPP obi-wan at the site. I have been tracking a 0 so I overload Qui-Gon. I eventually win the site. However during the game we have been battling in space. My jonus has been forfeited and retrieved to satisfy all damage. My baron and canons have cleaned up space and my SDs and admirals been keeping the peace. Eventually he loses Artoo and I battle him with a lateral damage.<br/>
Highs: my dark deck, also space battles are fun this was a great game.<br/>
Lows: none.<br/>
I play Gemme with my light and lose cause of bad match up. Then I beat Oakes with my light then I get a buy with 3-2 and 15 people at the tournament. That does not seem right.<br/>
<br/>
Chris twigg wins it and My bro gets second somehow. Then there is a raw deal tournament. We have like 8 people and there is a round robin. I lose 2 games to Chris and brain and win the rest with 2 timed wins. One of those wins was mike Gemme playing a card to draw 2 when he had 2 cards left in his deck. Any way the top 4 where my HHH vs. brain Twiggs rock.  And the winner of that vs. the winner of Mr. Twigg and Chris Twigg. Well I make a bonehead move cause Im tired and whatnot and I play heel turn first turn without looking at his hand. Well I almost win despite that. Brian loses to Chris in finals. Anyway Mr. Twigg who ran it says he gets 3rd cause he lost to the winner even though I would won in tiebreakers like I beat him during the normal rounds. And I won 1 more game then him. Doesnt matter just a pack difference. So after this we go back to the Twiggs and we play around. Everyone is working on lotr. At about 2 we decided to go to Dennys. This time Jessie some random kid goes with us to Dennys. He kinda just invited himself to go home with the Twiggs as well. So in the car all the kid does is swear and says to me how much weed he has in his pocket. Also my bro was like u have an impressive vocabulary (sarcasm people!) Then Jessie went I have an extensive vocabulary, I just choose not to use it.  Everyone in the car (Hayes, Oakes, and me) look at each other. I mean who uses the word extent to show the extent of their vocabulary? Whatever. We get to Dennys. And Im amazed at how many people are there. When living in Boxborough with no car you rarely are out at such a time. So we sit and we order. I wanted some pumpkin pie.  So we are trying to order drinks and I just wanted pie, so after everyone gets a drink I ask for some pie, everyone yells at me and brain says forget him just bring the drinks. So then she brings the drinks and we try to order food. That takes like 10 minutes. Gemme orders toast and fries. Oakes the 2.99 grand slam. Brain orders fries Hayes orders ice cream number 4 I order pumpkin pie, Jessie orders some sausage deal, Justin gets the grand slam and I forget Steve. Anyway Mike and I are checking out the girls at the other tables. I see this wicked hot brunette and mike likes this blonde, I dont know. Nothing else to do. Then we get the food and the pie I get looks nasty. Brian himself said that looks like my @#$%! So Oakes gets some of my whip cream and rubs his throat and it comes out and it looks nasty. I try to eat my pie but it sucks. Then Oakes gets the idea to make little sperm out of napkins so he throws them across the table. Then I make one and its a big one so people are like make more dudes! So Im like u guys want me to make more sperm?  We get a laugh at something the brain says then for some reason I say something and my voice squeaks. Brain capitalizes and mike starts laughing hard. Then in mid laugh he starts sounding like a girl! So he is laughing for like 5 minutes and he scares our waitress away. So we go back to the car and we are on to a Kessel run. From Dennys to the Twiggs house. Hayes in our mini van against Gemme in his jetta. So we speed out and get on high way just like 3 seconds behind Gemme. Then on the high we just speed. Hayes gets the car to like @#$%ing 120! A freaking mini-van! So we pass the jetta and we are owning them. Then we pass 2 police cars! @#$%! Turns out no one is inside but we slow down to like 50 as does mike. Then we get to the exit and its red, Oakes reminds us they make the lights red after midnight so we just speed on. We have like 5 seconds on them and we Hayes gets the idea to take a short cut. Hayes takes it and we get lost in some neighborhood. We get there to find Gemme beat us and we walk in. We open the door finding Gemme holding cup of tea. Oh we were just fixing ourselves a cup of tea. We all just crack up. Anyway we work on lotr then we (Sokol, brad, Hayes and I) go to Matts to sleep. We do decks then I go to sleep on the Sokols couch upstairs.<br/>
	Anywho, I wake up and its Sunday morning. Here is where things get freaky. My bro walks by and goes upstairs to shower I guess. Well I hear some talking so I think Matt is talking to my brother upstairs. Then from down stairs comes Matt, turns out he was talking to brad. Then Matt is in another room asking to use the comp, I figure he is talking to his brother. Then his brother walks down form the shower! Then Matt comes and straightens everything out.      It turns out he was talking to his dad and that he shares his room with is brother. Things like this happen when you get like 4 hours sleep for a couple nights. Well for breakfast there we dont have another 5 star meal. So instead I dont eat anything. We go to the Twiggs and hang out. At 11:20 we leave for the tournament. The tournament is supposed to start at 11 people. So here are when things get queer. We get to the store and Im trying to trade for some stuff. Then Steve calls asking if anyone has seen his shoes. What? Whatever. Brad and I sit down to play a game and Steve arrives and goes to brad and asks him where his shoes are. Brad tells him that they are back at the Twiggs house. Brad and I continue playing out game. Then Steve comes back and says that brad has to get a ride and go back and get his shoes. Brad is like whatever. You see Steve has been a @#$% to Brad and me all weekend and actually took brads and Hayes hat and hid them all weekend. We are like 2 hours form buffalo people! Its freaking cold! Also Hayes looks like a fruit because he hasnt had a haircut in a while. Anyway Steve is demanding that he gets the shoes. Brad is like dude, if u give @#$% then you should learn to take @#$%. So Steve being a total @#$%, grabs brads deck, which is basically, made up of all my cards. And says your not playing cards until u get my shoes. So Im really pissed Ive been taking @#$% from this kid for like 3 months and he just did this! Hell no! So I get up and start following him. Are u @#$%ing retarded? I ask. Get brad to get my cards and u will get your deck back. I just want to beat the @#$% out of this retard however I have never tried to beat some up before, its just not in my nature. So I just walk back to where I was playing and clean up the table and now Im really upset. So I just sit down and put my head on the table. I dont know what happened in the next like 15 minutes but I think mike took brad to get the shoes for Steve. Steve when u read this know one thing, what you did was disgusting. Youre a sorry excuse for a human if that is how you treat people. The fact that I called you friend once sickens me. <br/>
	Anywho, Mike, Justin, and Steve leave to go back home and the tournament starts. I get paired up with Aaron Kinglery.<br/>
Well I get a really good hand and I have ranger sword gewmgil, no strangers and everybody is trucking down. At site 4 cave troll, at site 5 cave troll. No problem. Eventually beat him with cantea getting rid of sting to overwhelm frodo.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 <br/>
I play against. I cant believe I forget your name! Ive played against u a bunch of times but I keep on forgetting it. Well he played the entire shire. Every hobbit was in it. He also played uruk hai and well I just plow through double moving every step. The reason he lost is cause he didnt have enough good cards.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
I play against jigga. Anyway I get an assy hand and I dont get weapons or aragorn till late. Because of that I dont get my nazgul late so at kaza dum he walks through with no nazgul. I lose this one.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
I play against Chu and I lose cause he gets like 12 minions out at one site. Screw that.<br/>
<br/>
Well the morning was gay the tournament was fun. We go to wendys and we dominate. Everyone dominates, Except for Aaron, and schaut (who came with us). They where yelled out. Anyway during this time we talked lotr tech and why Schaut won. Anyway, After dinner we head back to the Twiggs. On the way there I made fun of brain twigg, Jigga, brad and Hayes whom where in the same car. So Brain said, You just got 4 people annoyed, I said, I like my odds. Anywho when we arrive at the Twiggs Brian tries to grab my legs as I get out of the car, I kick him away and run out swinging my back pack in defense. I run up the driveway when from the shadows emerges Jigga. The impassable Giant. So I try to run behind the bushes, I cant get past. I run back seeing my only escape is through one of them. Then from behind I head Brian running at me. I fall down so I trip him up and I roll so Im on my knees ready to wherever. By this time I have lost a shoe and my foot is cold so I needed to end it fast. However Jigga again is impassable. Brian chases me again except this time I fall and push with my legs to flip him over. After some scuffling I kick him in the jaw when I tried to kick him away. That brought Hayes and brad over and the put me into a death lock. I could not move, I was done. So anywho we head back into the Twiggs and decide to get some cards in. SO I played against Shauts sauron deck. I beat him by getting to site 9 first. Then we do some multi players. Brian loves brackets so we make two 4-player games, top 2 from each would play to win the competition and a pack of r3! Anyway brain Mr. Twigg, Jigga, and me play. Jigga and Mr. T win. They play against brad and Aaron. Jigga wins the thing. The whole process took like 4 hours. Hayes won the loser brackets because I let him live. So anyway we are just chilling and For some reason we are all making fun of Jigga. Saying hes gay and what not. Aaron is on a role, everything you say he turns it around and makes you gay. It was wicked funny stuff. Well the we talk about school and at like 2 Schaut, Jigga, and Aaron leave. So now we are just tired but its cool. I finally play against Chris with my dark deck. The first game I lose cause my hand was really bad. The second I get to Bespin fortify it, get bad feeling. Nuke all but one of his sites. He is activating like 7, me 15. So I can use canons and retrieve isb agents and all that stuff so I win. So against a great player like Chris the match up comes down to the draw. So we are listening to music and we play some raw deal. At like 5 we go to bed. <br/>
	Pumpkin the demon cat. Prowls in the night tearing wrapping paper as easy as one would tare paper. The cat shows its fang in a silent cry and walkes beside my head. The stealthy silence and the darkness make someones snoring sound like an ox trying to die. Anywho I pick up the cat throw him out of the room and close the door thingy and go to bed.<br/>
	 I wake up at like 12. Get dressed we say good byes and leave. On the way home we get pizza, meet a wicked hot toll both attendant and some other crazy stuff. We eat steak and watch escaflowne till the night is young. Not much else happens. It was fun.<br/>
