Ok, its Sunday morning, and I can’t think of anything else besides Star Wars, since I’ve just played in the last 2 days, my tournament and the I-10 Day 1 Tourny.  So I go 3-1 ending with a 6(+42) 5th place, not to bad.  Little did I know I would not have a glorious Day 2.  Lets just say things took a turn for the worst <br/>
<br/>
My Decks: <br/>
Light Side - Testing all the Way <br/>
Dark Side - TIE Rage/Set Your Course <br/>
Rating: 1782 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First Game: <br/>
Me vs. Mike Sinclair’s EBO Deck (rating 1753) <br/>
<br/>
Sinclair and I have had our share of bloodshed over the last year or so.  I knew this was going to be a long and grueling battle and a long grueling battle it was.  Basically hardly anything was deployed all game because of fear of guns.  I have guns and he is playing x-wing swarm.  The best part of the game was I caught his first signal, because he’s playing EBO, you catch that card.  He has 6!!!!! in the deck and stacked 4 on that bloody card.  Anyhow, there are 2 reasons I lost this game: 1, I took about 11 in a battle because Frozen Assets is a good card.  2: A rebel barrier at the last minute that saved his little hind.  Mike and I have a very tense/fun good game.  He is probably one of my favorite players to play against because our games are always good, and I’m always dark side vs. his light.  Great Game<br/>
<br/>
FL (-4)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness: <br/>
<br/>
I made him stack 4 Signal, = total force of 21!!!<br/>
Guns are way cool<br/>
TIE retrieval is a beating<br/>
Great game with a great opponent.<br/>
Having fun playing against a light side space deck<br/>
<br/>
Sadness: <br/>
Not playing a card that is destiny 5 recycle to cancel Frozen Assets<br/>
Not finding card to cancel barrier or catching the bloody card <br/>
<br/>
Game 2: <br/>
<br/>
My Training Deck vs. <br/>
Aaron McCormack with Hunt Down Dueling (Ben’s Deck rating 1771) <br/>
<br/>
Well, even though he is a McCormack, he has a good deck and knows how to play the game.  I haven’t helped or seen anyone come as far as this guy has, along with Ben.  These guys can now hang with the bigger fish in the sea, or minnows where I come from, right Justin? J <br/>
<br/>
Game goes its normal way, I get out honor, start training<br/>
He goes docking bay raw and gets Chimera and Thrawn so fast with 2 docking bays filled up.  So I’m getting drained pretty good and whatnot.  Turns out that wasn’t the downfall of my game.  Lets just say I had 4 characters hit the table and one got circled, you know who, if not, quite the game right now lol.  So I took some beatings that game and wait around for the next round to begin, now knowing I really have no chance of being the winner for this I-10 tourny L<br/>
<br/>
FL (-22)<br/>
0(-26)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness: <br/>
Got test 5 out, that countsright? Not really<br/>
<br/>
Sadness: <br/>
 I couldn’t find my characters to save my life<br/>
Taking Courage out of my deck<br/>
<br/>
Alright, now that I know I’m screwed for the tourney I get to play a scrub next, right? WRONG.  I play my roommate, senior Hug.  Oh goodie, not only do I get to play against him enough, he is by no means a scrub.  Guess this will be another close game.  Last time I played against his deck I won by 2, that means nothing, this game would come out to who gets the most crap out first.  Pat had to lose to Kitani twice who ended up winning the tourney, why he couldn’t beat him once so he didn’t or not play me is beyond my belief.<br/>
<br/>
My TIEs vs Obi’s Hutt, docking bays (his rating 1845)<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I get a good hand, Seinar (my baby) Merry pull out Kashyyyk, yeah<br/>
Pat put in a Home One in his deck, he doesn’t know I put in Lateral Damage againhehe<br/>
Anyhow, that didn’t matter, because lando and han came down to beat up on merry 2nd turn.  Why I DIDN’T pull out a system is beyond my and my downfall.  Because of that I had to draw up and that is when Mr. Grimtash goes DIE, so I take it up the butt twice for that and say thank you sir may I please have another.  (He plays 3 grimtash, psycho).  Anyhow, it came down to that I didn’t have enough drain, I needed one more turn or my once per game.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-3)<br/>
0(-29)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
UhMerry took it up the butt<br/>
Good game as always with my buddy<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
UhMerry took it up the butt<br/>
Did I mention merry took it up the butt, (btw, he got OOC that turn as well).<br/>
I lost the game to my buddy.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this really sucks, this is by far one of the worst days I have ever had, because now I know I am not going to have a positive difference by the end of the day.  So I lost my first three games, big whoop, I get to play a scrub now, but wait, Hi Pat, would you like to play another game, sure why not.  So I sit down with Mr. Hug once again.  I see we meet again grass hoppa.  This game I know is gonna suck and come down to a last turn thing again<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here we go.<br/>
<br/>
My training deck vs. MKOS Mains &amp; Imperials<br/>
This is one of the most amazing decks I’ve ever seen, it is so creative and inventive, much like bounty hunters are.<br/>
<br/>
I get a semi-normal start, seeing as I got my muppet in my opening hand.<br/>
It came down to I really didn’t give a rat’s tail about training much, I hit 3 and I stopped<br/>
I came down with all the characters I had, actually found them.<br/>
Biggest event of the game, 3 turns of Gold Leader in Gold 1 with melas stickin it out with the Chimera.  First time I missed killing it, 2nd time he had Guri and I killed her off, 3rd, I tracked that destiny and the sucker went away.  Thank the good lord for test 2, it’s a beating.  This means he has to pay for his drains for the rest of the game and I don’t.  That was the entire story,  I beat up on his guys, and I’m like, minus 3 attrition everywhere because I have a muppet at home.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+9)<br/>
2(-21)<br/>
<br/>
Goodness:<br/>
REVENGEhehe<br/>
Great game as usual with roomie<br/>
Killing off the chimera, that’s like killing a pro in Half-Life with a piece shooter, not easy<br/>
Thrawn for not making an appearance in space<br/>
Getting my characters<br/>
<br/>
Sadness:<br/>
Didn’t get to train, I like doing that<br/>
Emperor pinged off 2-3 guys with force lightning, I can’t tell you how much that does to a guy.  You want to talk about getting in your opponent’s head, zap about 3 of his characters and see what he does.<br/>

Gamerz Edge You for having the tournament <br/>
Enrique Huerta for holding a great day 2 Tourny <br/>
Playing a real good day of cards <br/>
Eating before a tournament, so I knew what I was doingfor the most part again.<br/>
Even little muppets like me have to eat ya know<br/>
<br/>
Slops: <br/>
Losing 3 games <br/>
Playing roomie twice <br/>
<br/>
Well, its on to states, guess I should go make a new light deck now, I still like TIEs, even though I should probably throw in another system so I can find them.<br/>
<br/>
Good nite to all, and to all, a good nite <br/>
