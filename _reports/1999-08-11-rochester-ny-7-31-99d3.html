This was a regular SWCCG sanctioned tournament.  I arrived a little late, but everyone was trading so it was all right  I turned out I was 14 and now there wouldn't be a bye!  So everyone was happy.  Anyways, I traded for another Concussion Grenade(Junkin is key!).  The only really high ranked player there was Chris Janiak.  We started and this is how it went:<br/>
I start out against Matt Quirk(sp?)  He starts with Throne Room/Swamp/Farm and I am kinda scared since I know it must be pretty good with that start and I start my usual Imp. Occupation/Eriadu/Swamp/Twi'Lek There Is No Try(he's playing sense/alter I assume).  His first turn he drops a nudj from hand and gets one to swamp from reserve, then draws.  We both draw a lot this game.  I get a horrible hand and end up drawing about 2-3 turns and finally get enough to flip.  5th turn flip and the battling starts.  He alters Nightfall, and then we battle.  I get 2 destinies almost every battle and hat is enough to wipe out most of his mains.  He probably Moved away/killed 5 operatives with Obi-wan(ops at both adj. sites).  The game goes a while, but in the end I put down ops/buddies and drain him out.  He had Obi/Luke on my planet the entire game!  Thank god for Imperial Arrest Order!!!  I pull it out for the 4 card win with 2 minutes before he was gonna call it!  <br/>
2(+4)<br/>
My second game I play the lowest ranked light side player because every Dark Side player won. I played the Adam Nobles who had lost to Chris Janiak by 28!  I wasn't surprised though...  Se we start.  I start Throne Room/Swamp/Farm him Ralltiir Ops.  I know this games in the bag cause my decks always kill Ralltiir ops, even if that's all they can do!  I get a Nudj down first turn but no revolution!  Anyways, I get a revo/Goo Nee Tay/Battle Plan for the first turn that I draw up.  Decond turn, deploy all the above plus another nudj and draw.  Third turn he's activating 3 force per turn and I'm activating a lot more(with all the twix Yavin 4 sites out).  He deploys enough troopers to flip and moves them to the swamp.  I then realize that Battle Order overrides Swamp text so I deploy Han and Leia to his site.  I battle, Hit 2 guys, and draw a high destiny.  That clears the site but I have to lose Han.  His next turn he deploys Coruscant and says he hopes I don't have another revo.  My turn, Revo.  Drop Obi/Saber/Electrobinocs to Ralltiir.  Find a 7 on top and play On The Edge for 6.  The game ends with me retrieving everything and recirculating everything else with traffic control.  I drain him out.  Win by 42.  Good first ever game for my light deck!  <br/>
4(+46)<br/>
Third Game Vs Jason Stewart's Notorious HDADTJ(only notorious to me because he beats me Almost every time with it...).  I start the same with my light, him with Everything from Hunt Down and Bad Feeling.  I get a revo opening hand but am too afraid to use it(I know he has 3-5 Suprises in his deck and that could hurt on the 2-0 site I had already put out...)  So I get down 2 Nudjs and get Obi to a non-battleground with Binocs and I get a 1 on top for a sense.  Then I deploy Revo on his Med Chamber.  Surprise...Sense...Worked.  Suprise Again...DoH! Doesn't work...he breaks the lock. Doesn't matter cause next turn he deploys Downtown Plaza and saves.  Following Turn Deploys Vader/Tarkin and Elises for 4 to Obi-Wan.  He uses his last 4 to elis so he can't battle, so he just initiate an epic duel.  I draw a 7!!! and a 1  :-(.  He plays focused attack and draws three crappy destinies but it is enough to beat me by 1.  I cry and lose obi and 9. That's when the game turns bad.  His Next turn he deploys Bane Malar and Blizzard 2 and moves over to drain at 2 sites.  Then he monnoks me for 4 senses and 3 on the edges(doesn't really matter, I lost 4 7 destinies in a row from obi's 9.  I lose the game after that.<br/>
Full loss: 34(it amazes me how he always uses so many card and STILL wins by so much...)  <br/>
4(+12)<br/>
Then we take a lunch break where I go to Del Taco and get some AMAZING Chili Cheese Fries... <br/>
4th Game Vs. Michael Nobles who for once has a very good deck!  I am always giving this kid cards and helping him and his brother on deck strategy but this game he is in a bad mood for some reason.  He is playing Dantooine Ops and he starts Insurrection.  I didn't see any Noble Sacrifices all game but I did see Savrip.  I win easy after he decides he can't win and pcks up his reserve.  I am kinda mad cause I have like 4-5 used interrupts in my hand, but I let him and just tell him not to do it becuase he'd have to leave the tournament if I had cared.  I don't remember what I won by though...15 maybe.<br/>
5th Game Vs. Chris Janiak's HDADTJ.  He tells me I am gonna win easy and I say that he is.  I tell him my deck sucks againts HDADTJ but he is afraid of all my 7's so he never Duels(thank God!)  I have him down to a 2 force per turn lock until he starts drawing and finally gets and Evader.  Next turn I revolve the sites again and play On The Edge(which he Hell To Pays) to get back all my Revos.  This was an ugly game, and I cancelled Visage second turn.  He was having a horrible time and Vader only hit the table once, right in time for bron burs to make a suicide run and draw a 7 to kill Vader.  I win by 20 or so.<br/>
8(+40?)<br/>
My last game I am paired up against Charles Clarkson who always has a good light side mains deck.  Today he is using all the endor mains along with the usual Obi's and Luke's.  So, I start good with a second turn flip which he meets my operatives with some good Ol' mains!  They die, so do his mains.  I have the advantage because my guys are cheaper, drain better, and I have Imperial Arrest Order down so he can't nabrun.  He does a VERY cheap play and the tournament director says it's legal, which I assure him it's not but that's ok.  He has 9 force total and I have Sunsdown out.  He deploys Obi with Stick to an operative and Garindan.  He initiates with 3 in reserve.  He swings and hits my Op and Draws a 3 to Sunsdown.  Then he plays Smoke Screen with no reserve and the TD says he can!  I know he can't but there's nothing I can do so he does and I Ghhhk.  The TD asks if it would make a difference and I say I woulda like to save the ghhhk but hey.  Anyways, my drain are too much.  Full Win by 15?<br/>
10(+55?)<br/>
I come in second place to Jason Stewart(Grrrr...)<br/>
