<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the obligitory Mirkwood Tuesday TR.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-Tourney Stuff (this was requested a few times) I was going with a BHBM with Walkers and tramples for DS (I have been playing it since the MN grand Slam, and it is something like 30-2 in tourneys.  Losses were once each to Josh Grace, and Mike Raveling, both of whom also lost to this deck as well).  And for LS, an pile of crap that I threw together Monday night  in the form of a OMDH deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:   My DS vs. Graham Neal.  Okay Graham is one of this states best SWCCG players, but I whip him at WWF Raw Deal all the time, so I was not afraid.  I did the usual starting stuff, with IAO, MP, and Imperial Decree.  (If asked I will post the deck again, I posted it about a month ago to no response, but it will explain the ID, which I didn’t use all tourney).  He starts MWYHL, with Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Wise Advice.  and then he curses cause I have beat him with a few different versions of this deck, and I told him it was new (it was, I think I changed 2 cards from the last time I played it:).  Well, Graham was trying to trasin Twass Kah, and beat me down at Docking bays, and as everyone well knows beating the DS in a power battle, doesn’t work.  Nothing in the game really stands out, other than His Darn Savrip keeping him in the game (I win a battle by 14, he keeps the guys on table, and loses Cpt. Han and falcoln from hand.).  After one beating in space, he tried to take on the Exec. with Chirnaeu with the superfalcoln.  Thank god for Imp. Command.  He loses by 10, at first he was going to leave Cpt. Han on board but decided at the end to lose them both (good choice, in my hand were Bossk and Zuckuss).  But after that I owned Rendilli, and he tried to battle me at the CC DB, but kept losing guys to my tamples, and huge amounts of battle damage.  In the end I win by 23<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating Graham, winning the first game<br/>
Lows: Uhh.. Vader got sliced up by Obi, but not much else, I was in control the entire game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LSA pile o’; Crap vs. Jerry Flynn and his setr your course for Big Blue.<br/>
<br/>
I start HB to get the systems and use Insur. plus SA and Wise advice so I can get DB’s as well, and keep cards that get sensed.  IJerry started with IAO, MP&lt; and SAomething special.  I knew this was going to be a close game, since I have a light space fleet, and his ground is next to nothing. We spent the first couple of turns setting up, and here is where Jerry mad a mistake, he pulled Piett and Merrjeck, and put them at Exec. DB, next turn he deploys exec. then moves only piett there.  Leaving Merrjeck alone, I had a few force saved, and used them to come down with Han w/gun, Chewie of K, and Tycho.  Battle, shoot M. draw 2 BD, here is where I was expecting a ghhk, he doesn’t have one, He loses 14 force.  That was the game, we spent the rest of the game draining at our respective locations, and I pulled off a late OMDH to retrieve 8.  that wins it for me, as I drain him out, full win by 5.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Merrjeck getting killed.<br/>
Lows: Jerry didn’t read Chirneau close enough and moved him to alderaan, where he can’t drain because of his objective, and isn’t a battleground system, so chirnaeu doen’t work. Cost him 5 force in drains.  I don’t liek winning like that.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My DS vs.  Timm Halversons Local Uprising on Tat.<br/>
<br/>
This game was really boring, as I took control early of 2 Tat. sites and killed Ben when he finally got to Palpy.  I took control of Tat. with the Exec. and a lat. Damage on Falcoln, sending the Falcoln to rendilli to take on my BH ships (who he killed, we had control of each others systems at the end of the game) but left Tala 1 to take on Exec. alone.  The only real damage he did to me was to put out Order to engage, and then Barrier the guys that I put down.  Really annoying, and since he made me waste all my senses on earlier battles, I couldn’t find one to stop him when he didn’t have a control (he played with at least 4).  But my Control of all hsi sites and the Battle damage I had done to him in a few battles did him, as well as forgetting to deploy Luke for 3 turns 9 force right there, in FW by 20 something<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning again, and controlling all his sites, the game never being in doubt<br/>
Lows: Beating up on Timm in his first Tourney in a while. <br/>
<br/>
Game 4 <br/>
<br/>
My LS pile o’ Crap vs. Jim Li’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game sucked, I really didn’t want to play my LS at all, and I pretty much just threw it away as quick as possible, so I could go back to playing Wrestling.  This game went Quick, Jim is a good player, and he took all the advantages I gave him by not caring about the game.  Only 2 battles, first one he Used Force Lightning and IG- /gun to capture Ben and Beat a lone Lt. Blount, and the second one he used Vader to beat up on Leia w/ Gun Fl by about 25.  Would have been more, but I gave him Luke early, and Grappled Sense the Sense cost him 4 and Luke cost him about 5<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Well, I got to play a game, and see how Jim plays BHBM<br/>
Lows:  My LS sucks, and I really didn’t want to play it.<br/>
<br/>
Okay so overall I had a good Tourney, sorry to those people who want more detail, I don’t take notes after the game, so I just put in what I remember.  If you have specific questions D-mail me.<br/>
