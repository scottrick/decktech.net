<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hey Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I haven’t played since like States, since I can’t seem to build a dark deck to save my life. Anyways, A group of the "Bridgewater Crew" decided to get together and play an EPP Overdrive tournament since our local store owner FINALLY bought a new EPP Box after a year of begging.<br/>
<br/>
So, the date flips back and forth for a while and it finally lands on Wed the 18th the day before. So, Mike Pistone whose organizing it says he’s playing Light, I need another EPP Luke so I want light. Everyone who goes (all 6 of us) gets the side they want, so it’s all good.<br/>
<br/>
==== The Drive ====<br/>
<br/>
The drive is uneventful as usaul, I flip through my unlimited premiere ds jank (I’ve already looked at the ls stuff), trying to figure out stuff I should worry about. My list is narrowed down to this:<br/>
<br/>
Emergency Deployment<br/>
Limited Resources<br/>
<br/>
Ya, plus a few other stupid things that could maybe happen if they got a 20 card combo going. Lightside definatly has the advantage in space, as long as I don’t get tallon rolled by a swarm of ties. I planned originally to hold Tat + Y4 Systems and have luke and a few guys do beatdowns, but Mike talked to a few people and we decided it would be a better game plan to attempt the "Don’t Call Us, We’ll Call You" Style. All twixes and 1/0s, and go to them.<br/>
<br/>
==== The Draft ====<br/>
<br/>
After everyone arrives, Mike Pistone, Dan,Mailloux, and myself (Jon Bragg) get our EPP Luke packs. Matt McGann, Rich Hinds, and Andrew (something crazy) take EPP Vader. We switch cards with the opposite side and i take a look at what i’ve got.<br/>
<br/>
My 1st 2 rares are crap, Into the Garbage Shoot and Red 3. Next is Thank the Maker, which, in a dire situation could bea game saver, and finally, Han Solo. he’ll be refered to as Captian Han from now on (since that’s what i refered to him throught the tourney as).<br/>
<br/>
Also disappointly, other than Luke + Han, I didn’t get a Don’t Get @#$%y (which would have been tight), and I’ve only got 4 other characters with ability!!! Beru, Shivy Wolf, Rebel Trooper, and a Talz. Plus 1 X-wing. So much for system holding. I throw together my deck and realize this is gonna be one hell of an uphill battle.<br/>

==== The Games ====<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:<br/>
"Droids Kick Your Ass" Vs Matt McGann’s Deck<br/>
<br/>
I start my twix, Matt Starts the Tatooine Drain +1 1/1 for dark site, giving me a 4-2 force advantage first turn. I get Dattoine in my opening hand, but no characters. His turn he deploys the farm, and draws up a bit. I activate quite a bit, deploy Datooine, and draw up, getting Luke into my hand. He deploys the Tatooine DB, so there are now 3 sites to chose from, and Vader comes down at one of the drain +1 sites. I get Beru + a droid in my hand the next turn and prepare to beatdown Vader, but he deploys a imperial gaurd and another character to help hold the site. I try to It Could Be Worse some damage, but he nails me for 4 It’s Worse Damage. Luckly, My forces took over two of his sites, so I maintained a steady drain of 2. Eventually, I began running low on force and went into the We’re Doomed Loop. He brought down a force to beat down Luke and a few others, so I was forced to retreat to just one of the drain sites, while he too drained for 1 (with We’re Doomed). Matt made one mistake of dropping down the Y4 DB. I followed with Han to drain for 2 to his 1. Matt overloads Luke. Not Cool. The card grew thin, and so did our characters. I have 3 force and he has 2 cards when I had a Talz and a mining droid at one site running around draining, and Cpt Solo at the Y4 DB. Matt moved Vader over to the Y4 DB from Tat after draining, and a Jawa is sitting opposite my Talz + mining droid. He’s got 1 card left I’ve got 2. I make a HUGE gambel, as I know this is "EndGame" and this is when stress screws with your mind. I use my 2 force to move Han to the Tat DB and move my Talz over to the Lars Farm, giving me a guaranteed drain of 2 the next turn, however the gambel is his jawa is alone at a drain 2 site vs my mining droid who can’t block the drain. Matt drains for 1 at the Y4 db and uses his last force to move to tattoine db. I drain for 1 and win the game.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win<br/>
(2) +1<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Han Solo getting some good drains in. Minining Droid for owning the game.<br/>
Lows: Beating him on a crazy move that he didn’t see.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:<br/>
"Droids Kick Your Ass" Vs Rich Hinds’ Deck<br/>
<br/>
Rich starts the DS: War Room, and I start the Y4 War Room. I get Luke in my hand which is sweet. So Rich draws up 1st turn. I activate, draw up 1 and get my We’re Doomed, so I decide to let him go. His turn he deploys a Tatooine location (The Farm i think), A Bantha, 2 droids and an Imperial Pilot, not on the Bantha. Ok I say. I draw up another card my turn saving up my force and get Beru and a droid in my hand. He drains and stuff, and deploys A Imperial Guard. my turn I deploy the droid and scomp link access his deck. He’s got like 2 elis healots in there and a limited resources, damn, but EPP Vader and Colonel Wulf are in there which would be his heavy hitterrs. So I plop down EPP Luke, Beru, the Trooper, and battle. Emergency Deployment! @#$%. I know my luck Vader would hit the table, but no avil. He draws a limited resources and 2 red cards, so I laugh. He tries to collateral damage me, and misses. I laugh. I hit the guard and win the battle and he loses the guard and the droid due to a sucky destiny. His turn he deploys none other than a dark jedi lightsaber on the pilot, and deploys the y4 db and another tat site. He moves them all over and says go. I Drain, put a Tatooine Belt on Luke and deploy Han + Wolfy to the y4 db. Sure enough, Elis comes down his turn, with Evezan too. Arr. He uses 5 force to swing and operate wolfy, leaving Han to soak up the battle damage (luckly I lost just by 6). He moves inside to my drain 2 site (3 with the saber). So I drain, scomp link acess and see Elis is in there, as is Wulf and Vader. I move Luke over to his other Tatooine site to try and win a drain race. His turn, I we’re doomed, lose 2, he Elises, He’s got 2 friggin elises. Wtf? Ok so trooper gets operated on... not good. luke dies along with most of my deck, but i take out saber pilot and everone else at the site sept Dr E. I old ben Luke back. I battle, Emergency Deployment! AGAIN!?! He gets 2 Red cards, but Vader too. I take out Dr E Cause I know Vader will die. He draws 0 for destiny, I draw like a 6. He loses stuff, I lose Luke. I then deploy my x-wing to the y4 db to drain. He deploys a few droids and some scrub pilot guy to Tat and Wulf to the db and battles. I Panic! I draw 2 red cards, and believe it or not a power 1 droid. To tie me the battle. No one wins, and I laugh at the stupidity. I then deploy a Talz to the site and give him power +1 with that effect, and beat down Wulf. It’s all good. But eventaully his drains outdo mine, and he wins by a mear 3 cards after a nasty near end of game Limited Resources for 4.<br/>
<br/>
FULL LOSS<br/>
2(-2)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating Down him twice<br/>
Lows: Elis, Limited Resources, Emergency Deployments x2. Gay.<br/>
<br/>
Light Side has only lost 1 game (mine), Dark side has had strokes of bad luck basically vs some tech ls stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:<br/>
"Droids Kick Your Ass" Vs Andrew’s Deck.<br/>
<br/>
So Andrew isn’t doing to well today, and tells me I’m going to win. Nothing like a self-esteem booster after my last lost. He starts the Mos Eisley, and I Start the War Room. His turn he draws up. I get Luke + Han in my opening hand. I deploy y4 jungle and Datooine (also in my hand) and a droid and say go. He draws up. I deploy Luke + Han to drain for 2 at Mos Eisley. He draws up. I scan his deck with my droid, he’s got nothing, like 2 storm troopers and Vader. His turn he draws up. I drain, he draws, I drain he draws, he deploys 2 death star 1/0 sites, and draws, I drain he draws, I drain he draws. He deploys a droid, I drain he draws. He deploys Reactor Terminal and I Deploy Traffic Control. He’s got about 20 cards left at this time, and my lost pile is empty. He deploys the DS db. and his whole force basically. 2 Storm Troopers, a Bantha and Tanbris there. I deploy Talz + Beru there and move over to a drain 2 site. He follows with a stormtrooper. I kill it by 1, move father in. He loses Vader to a force drain. Game. I drain for like a zillion he drains me for like 3, I overdeployed early game causing me a little smaller win than I would have liked.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win <br/>
4(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well Luke + Han drained for 2 for about 30 turns.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: I overdeployed with blasters + Stuff<br/>
<br/>
Light Side Sweeps again, now 8-1 in 3 rounds.<br/>
<br/>
Final Game:<br/>
<br/>
"Droids Kick Your Ass" Vs Andrew’s Deck<br/>
<br/>
I play Andrew again because I’m in last due to my single loss. We play the same game again basically. This time he gets the farm down too. He deploys Vader there and I only have Beru, Talz and a droid at Mos Eisley. We get into a LONG Battle. It goes on almost all game, We deploy all our characters and stuff and battle turn after turn. Eventually I lose Han, and then Beru, he loses Vader to a saber swing and his droids are in his lost pile. Luke prevails after sucking up battle damage himself then old benning. He nails me with 2 cards left for a Limited Resources, and I pull out the victory again, with a long drain streak at the end with Luke.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win<br/>
6(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Another Win! Booyah 3-1 for the 1st time ever!<br/>
Lows: Lost alot of people in the long battles and got limited resources even though I knew he must have had one in his hand and shouldn’t have traffic controlled.<br/>
<br/>
Light Side Goes 11-1 in the day. Mike takes 1st he gets a Star Destroyer! From our SPED Pack, and takes Han and Garandin, and 2 other crap rares. Dan takes 5 basically random rares he doesn’t care about. I get 2 Kessel Runs, my Thank the Maker I never used and a Moment of Triumph, Rich gets a bunch of random @#$% rares, Matt takes 3 Tactical Re-Calls and rips them up, and Andrew gets whats left.<br/>
