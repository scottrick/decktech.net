<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I had been playtesting my decks about 2 weeks prior to the regionals, so I was pretty confident that I would place at least in the top 8, and maybe the final with some luck. I was playing my undefeated RALops deck (17-0 now), and YOPS (2-1). I really wish I would have gone with mains and toys over the YOPS, because YOP's auto loses to ISB and Raltirr if they're playing decree. Anyways..onto the report..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1st Game, My DS RALops vs. some guy's ebo/hb without 5 battle ground systems??!??!<br/>
<br/>
I auto-start Bad Feeling Have I vs. HB and he starts rebel fleet (which he never used). First turn I drop a twix site and search, I grab the Jungle and notice there is another twix site in my force pile...sweet. I draw up and end my turn. He gets 3 systems down and draws a few. Next Turn I drop 3 imperials down, flip, deploy an at-st to one site, then bunch the other 2 scrubs together at the forest. I feel really sorry for this guy because he hasnt played in a long time and doesnt know the errata on hidden baseso he basically cant drain until he gets ebo out..then he can drain for 1. I fortify Ralltirr, deploy search and destroy, and deploy imperial decree while controlling my coruscant and my ralltirr. He come after me with a mon calamari and 3 b-wings to Ralltirr, which I beatdown on my turn with ZIMH, Boskk In Bus, and Executor. My drains on ralltirr and my search and destroy did him in.<br/>

2nd Game, My LS YOPs vs. Ross Lillies SCREW/Heavy SAC deck<br/>
<br/>
Going into this game I was praying to god that Ross wasnt playing ISB, and he wasnt, so its all good. He starts Jundland Wastes and Jabbas Palace. First turn he drops vader to the Jundland Wastes and Alters my Yarna.@#$%! I really have to control my drawing this game so I keep it down to around 6-8 cards the whole game because a monok would absolutely rape me. I flip the objective with a 3 sites controlled by 3 ops/3 y-wings. He gets down POTF on the wastes, a saber to vader, mara and her saber to JP, and ETE on Jundland Wastes. Im like, Jesus Christ, your out draining an operative deck at 2 sites alone! I end up winning because he doesnt have the beatdown capability to handle operatives, and my retrieval gets me ahead in the drain race. It was a fun game and was funny to hear people saying, That kid just organized attacked his y-wing, on the ground, killed off vader, and didnt have to lose anything! I felt bad beating Ross with cheese<br/>
<br/>
FW(+11)<br/>
4(+37)<br/>
<br/>
3rd Game, My DS vs. Tony Lutzs Kashykk Speeder Operatives<br/>
<br/>
I hate playing against speeder ops because it is so damn cheesy. I get ungodly lucky though in the 2nd turn when I masterful move for a monnok after seeing him draw a bunch of cards, then nailing 6 ops, and 3 interrupts which I will not name because it was a cool idea and he is probably gonna want to use it in the future. From there, I flip raltirr, get the decree going, and slowly kill him with a drain at kashykk for 1. He makes a fatal mistake after sending EPP Han and a sandspeeder to raltirr the ending his turn. I drop Vader/Tarkin trample han and beat the speeder down for 11 force and the game. I felt really bad because for about 15 turns I just said, Drain 1, go. I wish we wouldve interacted more, but I was too afraid to go to his op planet for fear of speeder beatdown.<br/>

FW(+26)<br/>
6(+63)<br/>
<br/>
At this point I am in the #1 seat at the tournament figuring all I needed was 3 more wins, then Im in the final. Little did I know my easiest games where behind me and the hardest ones to come.<br/>
<br/>
4th Game, My LS vs. Robert Raus ISB ORS <br/>
<br/>
I know this game is an auto-win vs my deck so Im not even going into detail because its @#$%ing pointless..the guy had no chance of losing with Imperial Decree and ISB vs. a YOPS deck. The only reason this game was a low diff loss is because he draws a @#$% load of cards at the end and I draw up.<br/>

5th Game, My DS vs. Some Dudes Elom Inserts<br/>
<br/>
This game was the hardest game Ive ever played with my Ralltirr deck except the time I played Mike Pattersons Dagobah X-wings. He draws up his force pile first turn and I drop the jungle to Ralltirr, and I know he is playing inserts because he start, Throne Room, Jungle, and Farm  looks like paul hodges/bill gordons insertsNumber and Assasins. First turn he draws and yoda stews 3 cards down. I deploy the jungle and draw up a vesden (sweet-hes the only insert protection I run). He drops 2 eloms and a bothan spy. I respond with another site and a docking bay; then I drop an at-st with vesden and an at-st pilot on it, and an at-st pilot at an adjacent site. He drains and drops more eloms and suicide mains, and I just run. His insert pops and he loses 5. He is totally dominating raltirr, so I figure I need to satisfy his battle order in order to have a chance at this. He has a GLIG1 at raltirr btw. I drop Boskk and a 2/2 scrub to raltirr..clear the planet, and move to kashykk. I go the his throne room with igar, vader, tempest 1, and 2 2/2 imps. I spread to all his sites on yavin, deploy mara to his chirpas hut and drain him for abou 8 force a turn and finally win.<br/>

6th Game, My LS vs. Some Guys Hunt Down Big Blue<br/>
<br/>
I guess people are out to get me today. AnywaysI play like an idiot this game and forgot that ops have to flipped in order to get the destiny..so he pounds my ops for a ton and I lose a ton from drains/beatdown. So he has 35-40 cards left in his reserve about half way through, and I have 12. I start to make my comeback here. I get ops flipped, somehow manage to clear his 5! Yes 5! Walkers off bothawui with ops/epp obis/lukes. He dominates the Bothawui system so I cant run away with my y-wingsit ends up turning into a drain race at the end which I win. This was the largest comeback I have ever made in my lifehe shouldve won this game by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I end up like 10(+75) and the standing are like this<br/>
<br/>
1. Micah White (Lost in the final)<br/>
2. Frank Troung (Won The Final)<br/>
3. Robert Rau      (only loss to micah I thinkor frankcant remember)<br/>
4. Eric Berger      (only loss to robert rau)<br/>
5. Martin Boehm  (only loss to robert rau)<br/>
6. ME  Joe Horbey  (only loss to robert rau)<br/>
7. I think Brian Guthrie got thisnot positive<br/>
<br/>
I really wouldve liked to have seen Robert Rau in the final because he really deserved to go . Just look at who he beat!!!!! He was a nice guy with good decksah well<br/>
