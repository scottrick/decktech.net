<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">In the midst of all the D-Con reports, heres one from a local tourney filled with people you’ve never heard of. <br/>
<br/>
(quick note, if you don’t want to read the pretourney story, skip down to the games, I just noticed it’s kinda long)<br/>
<br/>
Friday evening I look on Decipher and see a tourney posted for Saturday at Evermore in Kingsport.  It’s posted for 1 o’clock and I figure I’ll go and try to reclaim some of my lost rating points and pride.  I wake up Saturday about 12 and take a look at my car, the right front tire is flat.  My front tires have been fairly smooth (and even have some of the steel sticking through them) for a while, but now my tire won’t hold air.  I’m not worried at this point as I figure my friend Nick will go and I can get a ride with him.  This isn’t the case, Nick isn’t going, so I turn to my last resort, my brother (this is at about 12:50 and Kingsport is a good 30 minutes away).  He tells me sure I can use his car, as I walk out the door, he mentions that it’s almost out of gas.  After grabbing some money I head out.  I arrive at Evermore at about 1:20 to find out that the tourney is starting at 2 because that’s what the store owner told everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I sit down and look over my decks, I’ve got EBO and a TIE deck VERY similar to Monkey TIE’s that I figure I’ll play.  I’ve also got my old RalOps trooper deck.  At 2 the tourney starts and I decide to play my troopers instead of the TIEs since Ounee Ta comes out soon and ruins the deck.  And for light I borrowed Grady’s (the tourney director) Profit deck (cause after several tourneys with EBO and TIE’s I got sick of space).<br/>
<br/>
On to the games, 10 people have shown up.<br/>
<br/>
I’m going into this tourney rated 1778.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1.<br/>
My DS vs. Eugene’s(sorry I forgot your last name) Profit w/speeders<br/>
<br/>
I’d never played Eugene before, he started Profit and I Twileked for Strategic Reserves.  I asked him if he had any starting interrupts and he said, oh yeah, I forgot.  He got out Maneuvering Flaps I think, I really didn’t pay much attention.  My opening hand is good, Vader, Ozzel, a few stormtroopers, CHYBC, and a &lt;&gt; site.  I deploy site from hand and also deploy a site from reserve deck.  Draw and get Dark Jedi Presence and a trooper assault and leave the rest.  He goes, I think he activated and saved, my turn, I activate, deploy another site from reserve deck, deploy CHYBC, and draw a few, saving a few also.  He activates, deploys Leia to audience chamber, freeing Han, he tries to retrive and I tell him about CHYBC, he leaves the Signal in the lost pile, he also deploys Keir Santage in a Sandspeeder at the Palace and says go.  I activate, and bring the pain, I deploy Vader, Ozzel, and many troopers vs. Santage and Sandspeeder.  Battle, assault + presence, destiny 5 + 1 for Vader.  He gets no destiny.  After the dust settled he had about 3 cards left in his reserve.  He activates, drains for 1 and I lose 1 for his obj.  I drain and say go, he does the same thing, game ends shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
Result FW 2 (+39)<br/>
Highs:  Eugene is a cool guy, I was glad to meet him, he showed me his trade book and had about 20 various Vaders in it WTF, I’ve got like 6, total, oh well.  Troopers are a machine.<br/>
Lows:  None<br/>
<br/>
It’s about this time the TD announces that an Emperor will be given out for 1st prize.  Now I’m psyched.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2.  My (Grady’s) Profit vs. Eric Erwins SYCFA Scum deck.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Jabba and Ephant Mon at the AC and prepared defences for No Bargain and 2 other effects.  I start General Solo for profit and signal for Goo Nee Tay.  Turn 1 he drops Dr. E at the AC and plays Search and Destroy, I say, ok, it’s cancelled.  The game consists of me trying to deploy to the JP sites at +4 each (DS Goo Nee Tay hit table quickly)  and getting None Shall Passed each time, then going to the DS and getting continuously attacked (battle, I retrieve 3 (scum first strike) you lose 1) by random aliens.  I get locked down and can’t ever seem to find the right things to mount an offense.<br/>
<br/>
Result FL 0 (-15)<br/>
For the tourney I’m 2 (+24) I think<br/>
Highs: Well, it was respectable.....<br/>
Lows:  Losing with a deck I shoulden’t have played.  And ensuring Eric the Emperor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Halfway through there are 3 undefeated players, Eric, George Rogers, and Andrew Bledsoe.  I’m the top 1-1 player.  The pairings go up and Eric plays light against George (this means we can’t play again) and I play light against Andrew.<br/>
<br/>
Side note here, Eric is rated over 1800, I’m at 1778, noone else here is over 1600 (most are high 1400’s or low 1500’s) so I’m really needing to win my last two games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 <br/>
My LS vs. Andrew Bledsoe’s BHBM<br/>
I start Goo Nee Tay again and I’m not exactly sure what he starts.  He gets Mara and Vader at the AC and I drop Ben + EPP Chewie and Yoxgit against them.  We battle over that for a while (I am cursed with low destiny).  He gets Tarkin out and I get Luke out so I don’t lose to that effect (Luke is at the Palace, not the AC).  Having 2 cards stacked, he moves over Vader, and Mara (I killed Tarkin) to JP and takes luke.  He’s taken alot of damage and leaving the site leaves him open to drains, by this time I’ve got Leia w/ Ben in the AC draining for 2 (saber) and Han + Chewie in the Cantina draining for 2.  Plus damage for 2.  He plays rise my friend, leaving Mara alone.  I will chase Mara for the rest of the game.  He duels, I win and he draws a one, whew.  I drain and damage him and chase Mara some more, I see that he’s on his last turn (he’s almost out of cards) and I ask if he plays any 7 destiny’s.  He says "A few".  I’m seriously worried as I’ve not seen any to my knowledge yet.  He duels and I win again, he draws and I see green, I think, Intruder Missle, game over, but it’s a saber, I start breathing again and finish him the next turn.<br/>
<br/>
Result, FW 2(+24)<br/>
For the tourney  4 (+48)<br/>
Highs:  Scraping out the win, having a good game.  <br/>
Lows:  Almost having Luke crossed.<br/>
<br/>
Eric beat George but has to play him again anyway, I play Andrew again.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My DS vs. Andrew Bledsoe’s Profit<br/>
I don’t remember what he started, I started Reserves again.  I get a God draw (Vader, Ozzel, st’s, a &lt;&gt;site, assault and Presence).  I activate, get a site and say go.  He activates, and draws.  I activate, get a site out again and deploy the one in my hand with it, I draw, getting another assault as well as a few more troopers, I save a few.  He activates, and deploys DOS with Saber to a &lt;&gt; site, using all his force.  My turn I activate, drop Vader, Ozzel, all the troopers, plus a Cadet from reserve, battle, assault and Presence.  He loses daughter and almost everything, I drain him out shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
Result FW  2(+40)<br/>
Highs:  My trooper deck is a machine, winning big again.<br/>
Lows: none to speak of.<br/>
<br/>
George loses to Eric again (but only after scaring him) so Eric win the tourney.  I finished 2nd and Eugene took 3rd.<br/>
I think George took 4th or 5th.  Chad Rogers took 6th I think, I’m not too sure.  I didn’t know any of the players except Eric, George, Chad, and Andrew before the tourney anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the end has come, my trooper deck has reached retirement.  It ended on a good run winning 19 of it’s last 20 tourney games (most of which with large differentials).  I’ve got to get a new deck now.  I’m going to post it in a day or two.<br/>
<br/>
Props and Slops time.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
-To Eric for winning.<br/>
-To George, for almost beating Eric the last game.<br/>
-To Chad Rogers, for playing troopers DS, you’re the man.<br/>
-To Eugene and Andrew, for being cool people.<br/>
-To Grady Hutchins (the TD) for trading me the black bordered Gold 1.<br/>
And to my trooper deck, for being the machine it was and for beating the piss out of all that it faced.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
-To Wayne (owner of Evermore) for not cutting me a deal on the Middle Earth The Wizards starter decks he had (they’ve been there for half a year).  $5 a box is too freaking much for a game that noone plays, c’mon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That’s it, thanks for reading.<br/>
