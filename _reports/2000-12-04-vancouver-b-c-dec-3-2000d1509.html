<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Someone told me I should write a TR so here it is.<br/>
<br/>
I get to the store around 9:45. It’s not open yet but there’s lots of people outside. I stand around talking to people about decks. Gary bugs me about losing the Foil Vader(more on that later). Anyways, the it takes a while for the tourny to start so I buy a couple packs of DS2, promise I’ll put the rare in my deck no matter what. I get some crap Admirals Order, swap it in for an ICBW. Me, Ryan, Gary, and Andrew throw all the commons from our packs together and start playing sabacc. Then the tourny starts. Oh yeah I’m playing HB with only 8 ships or something. And for dark i’m playing Imp Command BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My HB vs Josh’s Death * w/o objective deck.<br/>
<br/>
Not much happens. I set up, have falcon, cap han, gen lando, and numb at kessel all game draining. He loses hi only ship the executor early. He blows up Yavin, I lose some force, retrieve everything w/ on the edge. I drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
Full win by 39. Fun game but not really exciting. No battles or force drains by him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My BHBM vs some Agents in the court deck( sorry i cant remember many names)<br/>
<br/>
I get set up, put executor w/ pilots at Fondor, Darth and his saber at CC docking bay and Mara and saber at endor docking bay. He puts out Uh Oh, Boh Shuda at AC, plays tessek and kabe and 3 chadra fans. He puts out some chandra fans at another interior jp site. I play Blizzard 1, ozzel and general veers tat jp and say go. He plays 4 chadras and battles. I play imp command, lose Emperors Power. Get 3 destiny, im immune to his draw of 3, he loses 3 chadras. He moves the surviving chadra to the jp entrance cavern, moves over 2 more chardras from the AC. I play Tempest 1, and 4Lom w/ gun, trample 2, battle, he loses about 5 or something. He finally plays luke to flip my obj, but he doesnt have much left and i win it by 19<br/>
<br/>
4(+58) That was a fun game but i wanted to trample more guys. I also forgot to make him lose force from Your Destiny and Insignificant Rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- My HB vs Ryan M’s SYCFA deck<br/>
<br/>
Hm. Ryan always beats me with his SYCFA deck. By lots too.<br/>
His deck has lots of ground beatdown, good fleet. We set up slowly. He gets Emperor w/ Sim Aloo to D* docking bay quick then draws for a while. After a couple turns, out comes Tat Cantina, Mara, saber, 4Lom w/ gun, and S&amp;D. I’ve finally got the falcon out at kessel, but i dont wanna lose so much to S&amp;D so luke w/ saber, Wedge, and Zek come down. Luke gets barriered. His turn the pain begins. Vader, saber, tarkin come down. Luke gets U R Beatened. He battles, play focused attack to add to Vaders power. I lose about 17 force plus all my guys. And luke is down there alone. My turn, I activate all but one, use strike planning to look for a general. The one card is Star Destroyer so i play on the edge on Han, get back some force. His turn he plays some ships, probes my base(Kessel). I beat down his ship at Kessel, he ghhks. I play Boush at Cantina, move to kiffex where ZIMH is. He beats down Luke for lots! All this time i’m taking S&amp;D damage so ive got little life left. His turn, he plays janus greejatus on ZIMH, then battles me. I play punch it, react spirol. He loses a bunch. My turn, I spread out and drain, but I cant pay for battle order much longer. His turn, nothing. I’ve got 2 life force left so he knows he’ll win. He recycles his hand w/ reactor terminal. My turn, i break Boushes cover, get in one more drain of 6, then i lose by 2.<br/>
<br/>
4(+56) Lost to Ryan again. Stupid Focused attack makes Lord Vader 13 power. Thats nasty.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My BHBM vs someones MWYHL<br/>
<br/>
Nothing much happens I drain, beat his guys on the ground, force lighning leia when he tries to do test 6 by deploying leia to same site as Vader and Emperor. Full win by 13<br/>
<br/>
6(+69) Nice differential right now. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My HB vs some MKOS<br/>
<br/>
He flips quickly, brings out Mosep, Trandoshans, Scum and Villainy, and drains me. I eventually get out GLIG1 and Falcon, use suicide EP luke to kill some of his guys. I’m using my 1 on the edge, 1 kessel run to retrieve force like mad. I kill his guys, drain him till he has 1 force left, then retrieve my entire lost pile except for the kessel run<br/>
Full win by 37<br/>
<br/>
8(+106) Only 1 player is undefeated now. Me, Ryan and Andrew are all 4-1 but I have highest differential. So I play against the undefeated guy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My BHBM against Joe’s? Agents in the court.<br/>
<br/>
His rep is ........ a jawa???? Again I set up fast, get a nice drain of 7 with all my sabers, and fondor out, play battle order. He plays Ardon Vapor Crell, Luke w/ saber, and a vaperator?? I play some walkers pilots, trample ardon then beat down on luke. Again i forget insignificant rebellion. He plays tessek at AC, his rep. Then 10 jawas, and luke w/ saber at tat jp andbattles my walkers, he has about 40 power. ????!!!!!! with jawas and luke??? Whatever I kill some jawas, lose both walkers and General tagge. He moves a lone jawa to another site. I play Veers, Blizzard 1, battle. He deploys a palace raider, that skiff thing as a react then uses it to react the skiff thing, 2 jawas and luke over to the battle. Luke and a jawa get trampled, I lose 1 card from hand for battle damage. Next turn, he deploys luke again, says go. Ive been draining him for 7 all this time so he hasnt got much force left. maybe 10. I draw my 2 tramples, trample luke. ??? That wasnt a 6? luke lives. Damn cant count properly. I trample the palace raider and blizzard 1 runs from the crazy jawas. He drains, says go. I drain him out. Win by something<br/>
<br/>
10(+something)<br/>
<br/>
Me, Joe?, Andrew, and Ryan go 5-1. I have highest differential so i win the tourney. Me Ryan and Andrew work out a 3 way deal so i get a janus, Andrew gets 2 D* plans, and Ryan gets a rebel fleet. I forget to get back my 2 POTF from Andrew(btw i want them back) and I got watch Ryan play a game w/ Nick Burke who came after the tourney was over. Why i didnt ask. I watched Felix play his ds lose by turn 2 deck but it took him till his opponents 2nd turn to win so it was a bit to slow :) My bro comes and drives me home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Roxanne and Hyperlight, and Alex the TD.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. This takes longer to write than one of my decks!!!<br/>
15 min for this compared to 10 min for decks. This looks pretty long though. If you read this far then you need better things to do(so do I). Sorry I cant remember everyones name. BTW Steve next time don’t borrow about 15 epps from me and then dont show up at all. Rate this as low as you want to. <br/>
