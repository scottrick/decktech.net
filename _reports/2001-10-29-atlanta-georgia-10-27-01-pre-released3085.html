	I was really pumped when I heard about Reflections III pre-release near me.I printed the directions off MapQuest and off I went. I had a few tense moments on the highway when I thought I had passed the exit, but I didn’t, MapQuest’s directions are just shroud in ambiguity. I got there early, as I always do, to play some pickup games, around 10:30. Guess what? No-one was there! So I drove to McDonalds’ to get a Mr. Pibb, and I went back. By that time, some kids from Savannah were there and I played a quick game with him. (His TR is: http://decktech.net/swccg/treports/reportdetail.php3?deck=3082). He had his Watto deck versus my RST and I lost my Deactivate the Shield Generator right off the top for that bluffing shiznap. I was screwed then, but I only lost by seven. Then more and more showed and I saw Paul Myers and Landon Sommer. Paul and I tried to play a quick game, but Stephen Michael kicked us out of the gaming room because we were about to begin! I paid my twenty bucks and bought four packs of R3 at $3.99 a pack. Significant pulls included Jedi Obi, HOT Leia, EJP Lando Foil, and Queen’s Royal Starship Foil.  I had shifted around my work schedule, figuring on starting at 11:30 and playing four rounds, finishing around 4:00. Boy was I wrong! We started at 12:00, drafted and built decks for an hour or so. I was chosen to be light, so I whipped out my LS locations and sat down to draft. I was at a table with the two kids from Savannah, I played one of them earlier (see above), and a really weird collector person. He was pretty freaky! The DS player to my left (his right) opened a pack and Qui Gon Jinn AI Foil was staring back at him. He was pretty mad he had to pass that to me, but I was enthrolled. I did pull two Yoda’s (R3), new Chewie, Falcon combo, and some combat jank. Before we get into the games, here’s my deck:<br/>

<br/>
On to the games!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS (duh!) vs. Some person’s Tatooine Aliens<br/>
<br/>
	Sorry guys, I’m really bad with names. In fact, I forgot the next game too! Oh well, there’s nothing YOU can do about it! lol. Anyways, he starts Jabba’s Palace. I grab Quiggy with my opening hand and Yoda. He grabs a site with JP and saves. I drop Quiggy to the Outskirts (bad move, I should’ve put him at JP) and Yoda to the Naboo: TPGC. Lord Maul comes and kills Yoda, and he drains for a bundle the whole game. Qui God lives forever, but eventually dies. I really didn’t do to much in this game.<br/>
<br/>
	FL 0 (-7)<br/>
<br/>
	Highs: Quiggy and Yoda<br/>
	Lows: Maul, Jabba’s Palace, forgetting names. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: vs. Tatooine Aliens (again!)<br/>
<br/>
	He starts Jabba’s Palace, another one!, and pulls a site and drops two TIEs to his Bespin: Cloud City. I got nothing in my hand except Falcon and Surprise Assault. So, I drop the Falcon to beat up his TIE’s, and get this, I draw two zeroes! He loses the TIE’s. Anyway, I forget to pay for the Falcon and it gets POOPed. He drops two more TIEs to CC and says go. I have no clue what to do, I try and use Tatooine: City Outskirts game text, but no one is there.  He drains with the two TIEs and I play Surprise Assault. He’s like, !@@#$%%^^&amp;**%#@#$#% and get this, I draw two zeroes! Again! I lose two. The game goes downhill from there.<br/>
<br/>
	FL 0 (-14)<br/>
	      0 (-21)<br/>
<br/>
	Highs: none<br/>
	Lows: did you read the game?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
		    Lunch Break:<br/>
<br/>
I run to Blimpies and grab a sub and I sit down with Paul and Landon and eat. My game lasted a really short time, so I go into the store and watch this freaking hillarious movie about all the times Galatic Quest has been on TV. It shows the store owner looking like a fool, and is good to bring my spirits up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: vs. Mike Kesslings Tatooine<br/>
<br/>
	He starts Jabba’s Palace. Anyway, he looks sort of ticked that he’s playing a scrub, and he comes off as a loser. I drop Quiggy and some scrubs and he whips my @$$ around. I have Yoda in my hand, but I can’t find Naboo: TPCG. I say a curseword and he’s like, ’Quite a mouth?’.  Oh well. He drains for a bunch, and Aurra Sing with rifle hits the table. I lose like the scrub I am.<br/>
<br/>
	FL 0 (-17)<br/>
	      0 (-38)<br/>
<br/>
	Highs: none<br/>
	Lows: I’m probably going to get a low rating from Mr. Troop 1023 himself. Who the @#$% cares?<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: vs. Joseph? kid from Savannah that I drafted with’s Tatooine.<br/>
<br/>
	Now here’s something different, he starts with the Audience Chamber. I drop my Worrt and eat several of his guys, Han, Chewie, and the Falcon is at Tatooine, Yoda is at Naboo, Quiggy is at the Audience Chamber, I have scrubs everywhere draining for bunches, I beat up some of his kids. This was a short game an I win.<br/>
<br/>
	FW 2 (+8)<br/>
	        2 (-30)<br/>
<br/>
	Highs: winning<br/>
	Lows: beating him up so fast, he didn’t get a good hand or something.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have to drop now, they want to play six rounds, and I have to be at work. Its an hour drive, so I tell Kyle (store manager/owner) that I have to, he’s sorta disappointed, but I have to go.<br/>
<br/>
