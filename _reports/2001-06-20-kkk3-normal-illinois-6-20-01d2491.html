I have no pretourney garbage so I will go straight to the games...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- My Huntdown Podracing vs. James Bottoms’ Podracing w/ numbers<br/>
<br/>
    We both got off to a slow start in the race, drawing 1’s and 2’s for destiny the first couple of turns.  I put a presence of the force at the Home 1: War Room, and put Vader there to flip.  He had 8D8, Artoo, and Threepio w/ parts showing there, and on my side there was Vader and 4-LOM with gun.  He inserted on me and then proceeded to lay down Han w/gun, Leia w/gun, Chewie, and Luke w/stick.  He shoots 4-LOM and doesn’t try to cut because he only has 4 left in his reserve.  I play I Have You Now and draw a 6, 1, and a 6.  All my destiny are +1 because of Vader so I have 24 to his 28.  I lose both and the droids are all that remain.  I win the podrace the next turn, and put vader w/stick at the war room.  James comes down with Obi w/stick to the war room, and he fights.  I cut one of the droids, play I have you now for a 2nd time, and He loses all the droids and leaves Ben by himself.  As I am activating the next turn, the insert pops but I only lose 1 because Ben is his only character.  Visage is long gone so the next few turns he drains for 1 as we both draw.  I spread out on Tatooine with Igar, Tempest 1, and Vader.  I drain him out soon after.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+25)<br/>
<br/>
Comments:  It was a long race that I won with a lucky 6 on the last draw.  It was a good game until the droids got blown up.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- My WYS beatdown vs. David Farbank’s Sabaac<br/>
<br/>
     I get an extremely slow start, not drawing a luke for several turns.  He has Lobot and Lando at the Casino, draining for 1 a turn and retreving 3 from sabacc while making me lose 1 at the same time.  I start my master beatdown plan by laying down Dash and Melas at the Casino and fighting.  I Manage to kill them both, and run to the Prison.  Farbanks thinks that he is safe, so he puts down Lando back at the casino and starts to sabaac again.  I leave my 2 guys at the Prision so that I can deploy luke for the beatdown.  I put Han with Lando and lobot at the casino, Luke at the adjacent site, battle, triple the damage, run luke run, don’t get @#$%y, smoke screen, clash Lando, and Smack Lobot for around 30 cards...game.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+35)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- My WYS Beatdown vs. Scott Komar’s crap<br/>
<br/>
     He starts with the Death Star and nothing else, so I get to go first.  I draw a Han w/gun, Luke w/stick, triple damage card, and don’t get c ocky in my opening hand.  I draw a tunnel vision on turn 2, and tunnel to get a run luke, run on turn 2.  On turn 3, he puts the Emperor and Mara Jade at the Cantina.  I deploy Han at cantina along with Leebo, and Luke at the adjacent site.  I battle, triple the damage, run luke, run and he plays force lightning on my luke.  He uses the Used text to make Luke defense value -4.  I respond by clashing mara so Luke wont die.  I miss on shooting and cutting the Emperor, play don’t get @#$%y, get 5 destiny (1 from objective, 1 from ability, 1 from Han’s text, and 2 from don’t get @#$%y)  I draw some insane number, and he owes me Palpy and 28 cards.  He b ithes and whines for the rest of his game, and I win by 30.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(+65)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4- My Huntdown Podracing vs. Scott Komar’s crap<br/>
<br/>
     Turn 1 I draw no vader, no sites, and no other characters.  He deploys random sites, and Leia to the Jabba’s Palace: Audience Chamber.  I respond with Vader and 4-LOM several turns later, and Scott draws a 7 and kills them both.  So at this point, I am down several cards, and he has Shmi and Ben draining me for 2 at a random Tat. Site.  I lay down walkers to try to knock off Shmi and Ben, but to no avail.  Jar-Jar and his breakfast come for a visit, and this is where the crap begins.  Scott leans over his reserve deck, and quickly slips a card from his hand on top of his reserve.  I catch it and call him on it.  He gets a silly grin on his face and I glare at him for a few moments.  I figure that I am going to win this game regardless, so I decide to wait until the game s end until I bring it to the TD s attention.  Random battles happen and several turns later he puts Scout luke at the Audience chamber.  Vader walks over and starts a duel, with a focused attack.  Hmmm lets draw destiny....1, 1, 4.  ACK.  So vader gets smacked for 9 cards, and I manage to peck away until he drains me out and wins by 9.<br/>
<br/>
FL 6(+56)<br/>
<br/>
Comments:  Scott is a punk and he will be addressed at the rant at the end of this report.  <br/>
<br/>
Game 5- My Huntdown Podracing vs. Geoff Snider’s Hayes pile off of decktech.  <br/>
<br/>
     Me and Geoff had played several games the night before, and I faced this deck 3 times.  He revolutions my sites, and I get aprox. 4 force for the entire game.  When I win the podrace, I know that he is going to It could be worse, so I save an Its worse and a lot of force.  He plays ICBW, I Its worse, he senses, I sense, he senses, He wins the sac war, loses no cards from the podrace, and I am screwed.  I can do nothing from this point on because Vader is stuck at a random site, Qui-gon is on the Home 1 which has a presence, so I can’t flip, and eventually my own visage kills me.  <br/>
<br/>
FL 6(+31)<br/>
<br/>
Comments:  I am just super-pissed after this game.  I knew exactly what would happen before the game started, and it did.  I got no generation, he got massive generation, he ICBW my podrace, he wins the sac war, and I lose.  Great.  This will also be addressed in the rant at the end of the report.<br/>
<br/>
I am too flustered after game 5 from the cheating in game 4 and the domination in game 5, so I drop, because geting wiped by Geoff is not what I needed in this game.  <br/>
<br/>
Final results:<br/>
<br/>
1. Geoff Snider<br/>
<br/>
2. James Bottoms<br/>
<br/>
3. Keith Brown<br/>
<br/>
4-?. Don’t recall<br/>

     I am a little disapointed in Baby Komar.  Scott, if you have to cheat to win games, why do you even play at all.  To make matters worse, you had a terrible demenor throught every game we played, and througought the entire tournament.  Im glad you won a Foiled Twilek Advisor, and I hope you are proud of what you did at the tourney.  Geoff snider, you never cease to amaze me.  You complain about having to play against stupid #’s decks, podracing, and general crap.  You are commenting about my decks and how there is no skill involved in plaing them.  Well, if you dont wanna play against it, DONT PLAY IN OUR F.UCKING SCRUB TOURNAMENTS.  You cant come in here with your 2000 rated a.ss and expect people to feel sympathy because you have to podrace while you are kicking all of our scrub a.sses anyway.  Also, I dont understand how you can live with yourself when you yell at little 4 year olds when they are running to the bathroom.  Im really glad that I have been shelling out thousands of my dollars at your store for the last 5 years, and you still can make comments about my gameplay.  Well the hell with it all, im going to Adventureland. F.UCK CYBERIA, F.UCK STARWARS, F.UCK DECKTECH, F.UCK BABY KOMAR, F.UCK GEOFF SNIDER, F.UCK EVERYTHING!!!  IM DONE WITH THIS S.HIT!!!<br/>
