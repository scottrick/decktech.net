<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well after last month’s very successful sealed deck, its time for the first constructed tourney in Findlay.  I hadn’t really tested many new decks and stay with the same ones for the 3rd tourney in a row.  I felt confident with both of them, as they were both 4-1 in tourney play and can match up well vs anything.  Liht side was HBX and dark side was big blue rumors.<br/>
<br/>
we get there and get started.  3 representatives of team BBQ BACON are in attendance, and are feeling fairly confident. pairings are announced and we play.<br/>
<br/>
1. LS vs Adam Huber SYCFA manipulator<br/>
great, game 1 and I got to play pubes.  well I play carefully since i’ playing HBX and he has like 4 monnoks.  I start by dropping ships early and draining for 1 here and there.  I get a uc spy down to his site where mara is.  We fight a few times in space, he loses his ships but doesn’t get beat down too bad.  He sets up search and destroy, and it starts to hurt.  I flip to slow his drains and boost mine.  I get down to like 10 cards and i think i’m dead, cause i have out 11 xwings and cant find all wings or pay for secret plans.  so I have to spread out and drain.  By this time search and destroy is really hurting me so I drop boussh to the forest on yavin and stop that.  without search, he cant damage me enough.  <br/>
FW 2(+10)<br/>
<br/>
2. DS vs Paul Romonaski HB/CC celebration/Ships ’n guns<br/>
well paul’s deck is similar to the QMC deck in the top 10 here but he uses hb so he doesnt need to flip to get good cc drains.  I start my setup and get out piett, merrejik and systems fast.  I start to drain and he brings some stuff to fight.  the falcon loaded with guys takes down a star destroyer and a guy.  he loses his blue 5 off the top and thats big so now he cant shoot up my capitals.  I get some big drains going and he cant seem to find celebration.  he chases me around some but he cant find order to engage either, so I just run and drain.  late-game he brings jedi luke and his stick, but igar + tempest 1 +vader have something to say about that.  from there, I drained him out.<br/>
FW 4(+20)<br/>
<br/>
3. LS vs John Nelson AOBS/bounty hunters and stuff<br/>
well he starts any methods nesecarry and grabs ig w/stickj and the jp dungeon.  i start off dropping x-wings here and there and start doing my little drains for 1 at a few systems.  he has trouble finding a site so eventually he puts potf on the cc site where xizor is, and flips.  he’s only covering 2 bg’s though, so honor slows his objective.  he brings something real goofy like mabey zuckuss piloting the space cruiser to like yavin 4 or something.  i drop some ships and battle. he gets beaten pretty bad, then I drop legendary starfighter on the falcon i think so he’s hurting.  I run out of xwings for rebel fleet, so i flip to cancel drains.  I do an all wings report in for my entire lost pile.  There isn’t much he can do, he setup way too slow to stop me. <br/>
FW 6(+52)<br/>
<br/>
4. DS vs John Nelson WYS / close air support<br/>
Well he’s running random z-95’s and close air support and rfc’s on tatooine.  it’s a deck that is becoming real popular in our area right now.  I start my setup and by turn 3 have a solid drain of 4 at tatoine.  he brings some ships here and there to fight, but they are no match for me. u3p0 visits the catina and just chills there the whole game.  i don’t attack at the tat db because he has some goofy explosive charge that will kill my guys if i win a battle there.  so i just eat his drans of 1 here and there while i drain like mad in space.  final turn he has spread really thin and has talon karrde alone at catina.  so i bring vader and tarkin and beat talon up and thats game.<br/>
FW 8(+73)<br/>
<br/>
well the tourney was a success for everyone.  prizes were good with everyone gwtting atleast 1 ds2 pack.  the winner got 4 + a touney foil. 2nd and 3rd place got a few packs each.  everyone seemed to enjoy it.<br/>
