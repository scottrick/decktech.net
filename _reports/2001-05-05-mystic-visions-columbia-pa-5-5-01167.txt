Pre-Tourney Stuff:<br>
<br>
As we last left our hero, he had just gone 4-2<br>
in his own tournament last Sunday, 4/29/01.  A<br>
few weeks ago, plans had begun for a dinner and <br>
movie night with the core of the Philly Posse.<br>
12 of us met at Outback Steakhouse at 7PM, ate<br>
The Onion, some meat, then ventured out to see <br>
The Mummy Returns.  All in all it was a fun <br>
night and it was great to see Joe Young, Livio<br>
D’Alessio, Dan Bordier, Dave Diehl and his lovely<br>
fiance, and Scott Mr. Ramapo Lingrell himself.<br>
The only tragedy was that Wojciech had an <br>
accident while meeting us and called to tell<br>
us he wouldn’t make it.  Man, that guy has some<br>
bad luck!!  I get home at about 12:45 and I <br>
decide to make new LS decks for the double header.<br>
I’m up to 3am trying to figure out what to do.<br>
I make a few interesting LS decks and decide to<br>
use Big Pete’s Revenge for both tournaments.<br>
Nathan Brown picks me up at 8:30.  We get some<br>
breakfast at the WAWA convenience store and <br>
away we go.<br>
<br>
For those of you that know me, I don’t write lengthy <br>
game details.  Reid "Voice of Law" Smith and Doug<br>
Faust seem to have photographic memories...I do not. <br>
Here are the basic summaries with a few highlights.<br>
<br/>
Tourney #1  11:30am, Director:  Mike Carr<br/>
<br/>
Decks:  Big Pete’s Revenge (DS beatdown M&amp;T)<br/>
        Bith Rocks, 2001 (insert/asteroid sanct.)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 v. Shannon Caine’s WYS/Harvest Deck<br/>
<br/>
This was the first tournament where I got to see<br/>
the new cards and objectives in full action.  I <br/>
quickly learned the danger of this combination,<br/>
and I managed to out-muscle her on Tatooine with<br/>
my onslaught of characters.  Of significant note,<br/>
4lom and toy disarmed Jedi Luke and I captured <br/>
the Lars Couple with IG88.  With her Harvest<br/>
retrieval engine out of commission, Its something <br/>
of a drain race because I did not want to engage<br/>
her smugglers in space and she did not want to<br/>
meet me on the ground.  FW by 19<br/>
<br/>
2(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 v. Jeremy Kauffman’s ISB Space/Big Blue<br/>
<br/>
My gameplan was to see if it was safe to begin <br/>
inserting things again.  Jeremy had no insert <br/>
protection from the start, so I managed to get<br/>
an early pop for 8 force with Doik Nats and <br/>
Wedge on a corvette at Clak d’or 7.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I could not get a Big One or <br/>
another Odds into my hand and I lost them to <br/>
force drains early on.  I took a chance and<br/>
put an A-wing at a sector, but he Lat Damaged<br/>
it and took Bossk in Bus to beat him up.  I<br/>
couldn’t even Lost Relay the Bus so he sets <br/>
up all these admirals and ISD’s in space and <br/>
I have no room to get other cards out.  I <br/>
basically lose all my good cards off the top<br/>
to force drains.  It could have been a lot <br/>
worse...  FL by 24<br/>
<br/>
2(-5)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 v. Mike Carr’s WYS Mains/Tat Celebration<br/>
<br/>
This was a hard-fought game.  I get enough<br/>
force generation early, but I don’t have the<br/>
characters I need to really bring on an <br/>
offensive early in the game.  We end up chasing<br/>
each other all over Tatooine and between Kashyyyk<br/>
and Tat. system, but I could never manage to <br/>
cancel his Celebration.  It probably won the game<br/>
for him.  Those added destinies with 2 smugglers<br/>
are a tough cookie to swallow.  After a pretty <br/>
good battle between ZIMH and DIPO vs. Mirax and<br/>
Dash in their ships, as well as Premiere Han in<br/>
Falcon, I was left with ZIMH only and not enough<br/>
power to make a difference.  On the ground he hits <br/>
me with a few "Artoo, IHAVBFAT" and I can’t make <br/>
a dent in his ground forces... damned droid combo!<br/>
It basically becomes a big chase-n-drain with the<br/>
Celebration making the difference.  FL by 12<br/>
<br/>
2(-17)<br/>
<br/>
Well, after some confusion with the software,<br/>
(it tried to pair Shannon and Nathan Carr with<br/>
the same allegiances they played earlier in the<br/>
tournament), I end up playing Shannon again and <br/>
we finish the tourney sans software.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 v. Shannon’s MKOS/Gallid deck<br/>
<br/>
This was interesting.  She had never, ever, seen<br/>
a Ted insert deck before.  She had no protection<br/>
whatsoever.  I get figgie dan and Tedn Nedal on a<br/>
corvette at Clak D’or 7 my second turn and in it<br/>
goes.  It pops the next turn for 8.  I get Jedi <br/>
Luke to the 2/1 desert site and pop another in <br/>
there...  2 turns later I have 15 to her 3.  <br/>
Another goes in....  I get an X-wing to the Big <br/>
One and it survives every asteroid draw, so I’m<br/>
hitting her with a drain of 3, 4 Asteroid Sanct, <br/>
and a drain of 2 at the desert.  with my Battle<br/>
Plan, she has to activate to drain, and I play<br/>
Figgie too....  I felt bad, but that’s how that<br/>
deck was supposed to work....  FW by 30.<br/>
<br/>
4(+13)<br/>
<br/>
So I finish in 5th out of 10.   Jeremy Kauffman <br/>
goes 4-0 to win by beating Drew Scott and Nathan<br/>
Brown goes 3-1 with a timed win to take 2nd.  A<br/>
buch of us are 2-2 with some differential and<br/>
Nathan Carr brings up the rear at 0-4.<br/>
<br/>
We have about 30 minutes until the next event is <br/>
scheduled.  Nathan B. and I go to get soda and <br/>
ice cream, then Shannon puts on the TD hat.<br/>
<br/>
Tourney 2  4pm   Director:  Shannon Caine<br/>
<br/>
Decks:  DS:  Big Pete’s Revenge<br/>
        LS:  Chu’s Vegas Deck (y4 start, m&amp;t)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 v. Drew Scott’s HD Beatdown.<br/>
<br/>
Probably the tightest game I played all day.  I<br/>
get trans term/ooc in my opening hand and make <br/>
him lose before cancelling it.  His next turn he<br/>
uses the DS "ounee ta" to get it back (DAMMIT!).<br/>
We basically deploy characters everywhere, using<br/>
sabers, interrupts...some mindgames, to get the <br/>
advantage.  I never get any good spaceships, so<br/>
he manages to beat Battle Order/Battle Plan <br/>
while I try to drain and deploy too.  We have a <br/>
few knock down drag out fights, but in the end<br/>
it becomes a drain race.  I can’t recall any <br/>
significant tech or moment.  It was just an <br/>
awesome game.  FL by 3.<br/>
<br/>
0(-03)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 v.  Nathan Carr’s WYS M&amp;T<br/>
<br/>
Nathan is playing a similar version of his brother’s<br/>
deck, but without the Harvest’s.  He is a young<br/>
player and seemed really hesitant to be aggressive<br/>
in his play.  He gets a few character’s down, but <br/>
I basically beat him into submission.  I somehow<br/>
manage to forget a few force drains in order to <br/>
give him the opportunity to fight me.  We have a <br/>
few minor skirmishes, but what was really cool was<br/>
he put Captain Han and Lando with gun at the 3rd <br/>
marker..he deploys a Jedi LS on Han (No Lie!!), <br/>
then he initiates against choke vader and some<br/>
bounty hunter.  He swings, draws a 0, then a <br/>
frikkin Intruder Missle to make big daddy go<br/>
bye-bye.  Later, he OCC’s my pretty good-sized<br/>
lost pile and guess what he places out of play!!<br/>
Talk about luck!!  First he hits big daddy then<br/>
he takes him out of play...  I could have ended <br/>
this game in about 20 minutes, but I wouldn’t <br/>
have traded the look on his face with that wild <br/>
swing for nothing!!  FW by 8<br/>
<br/>
2(+5)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 v. Mike Carr’s Agents of the Black Sun<br/>
<br/>
Again, new stuff for me to look at.  He was <br/>
complaining that this deck wasn’t doing well all<br/>
day for him.  We take a few turns to get some<br/>
docking bays out and get some characters in our <br/>
I get Jedi Luke to H1 DB then transit him to Tat<br/>
DB.  I keep adding characters and weapons as I <br/>
get them in my hand.  I also have Scramble on <br/>
the table, which also prevents him from drawing <br/>
destinies...  He runs away quite a bit!!  I soon<br/>
get Home 1 out to my Kessel, which he does not <br/>
like.  He Lat Damages it, I have over 7 ability,<br/>
so when he deploys Zuckuss and some oddball pilot<br/>
to Kessel I still get a destiny draw (5) and he <br/>
has to lose everything.  I get a few more ships <br/>
out and I hold Kessel and the Tat DB the whole <br/>
game, so I’m not affected by Battle Plan.  He<br/>
has AT-AT’s at Tat and he tries to trample me a<br/>
few times..he gets a few small guys but everyone <br/>
else seems to dodge those big feet.  I leave <br/>
Luke with his flashlight in the Audience Chamber<br/>
for most of the game, and when he finally comes <br/>
in for me I scurried to the JP site (or vice-<br/>
versa if necessary).  I basically manage to <br/>
out-survive him in raw charater power and I hold <br/>
onto my free drains for the rest of the game. <br/>
FW by 16<br/>
<br/>
4(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 v. Drew Scott’s Profit Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Cool....  Rematch!!  I figure this is gonna be a<br/>
big slugfest, but I underestimate the power of<br/>
artoo and threepio and "Artoo I have a..."  I<br/>
deploy Mara and Dr.E to the Chamber, as usual. I <br/>
deploy 1-2 guys down there per turn, so when he <br/>
comes with EPP Leia and Luke to free their buddy,<br/>
I draw totally a$$ destinies and he always <br/>
seemed to draw good ones when he needed them. <br/>
Mara is a machine...I manage to lose her and <br/>
redeploy her and take out all 3 of his EPP Lukes.<br/>
I manage to get rid of General Solo (placed at<br/>
start of game), but the EPP just would not go away.<br/>
He deployed 2 lando with axe’s and managed to <br/>
dispatch 2 of my choke vaders (none of which I <br/>
got in my hand until well into the game).  The<br/>
artoo/threepio card and EPP Obi sat at the 3rd <br/>
marker for the last half of the game unmolested<br/>
because I couldn’t draw destiny.  Drew did play<br/>
rather quickly, resolving actions before I had<br/>
a chance to think through my actions (5 hours <br/>
sleep sucks) and I could have sensed a few of<br/>
his interrupts...  Shame on me, I suppose...<br/>
Anyway, that tech manages to outlast me and I <br/>
was hesitant to go to space and play (silly me)<br/>
since I had Kashyyyk out early and Endor in hand, <br/>
as well as 3 starships from early-on.  I <br/>
learned a lot this game and Drew has a good <br/>
chance of placing in states in a few weeks.<br/>
I cant keep up with the Profit force loss and <br/>
drains after 3 vaders and 2 maras and a lot<br/>
of bounty hunters hit the table.  FL by 25.<br/>
<br/>
4(-4)<br/>
<br/>
Again I finish at 5th.  Drew won the tournament <br/>
going 4-0 and Mark Freer comes in 2nd 3-1.  Again<br/>
there are many of us 2-2 with close diff.  Nathan <br/>
Carr again goes 0-4, but he had a great time!!  <br/>
<br/>
Mike lets us pick, in order of our ranking, 2<br/>
rares out of his binder.  I take a TT/OOC combo <br/>
and a foil Salatious Crumb.<br/>
