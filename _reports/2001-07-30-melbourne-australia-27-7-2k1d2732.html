AKA  ’Run, Jawa, Run!’<br/>
<br/>
Not much of a preamble today.  Basically, I turned up and gave Ronnie a hand building a deck (No, Ronnie, take out the I’m With You Too, Count Me In ...).  People turned up, Terry Lyons (TD) sold me an Emperor and a Command and we started.<br/>
<br/>
Decks:  <br/>
<br/>
Dark: ISB Lock Down (twixes so you don’t get screwed by DDTA + enough jank to beat Watch Your Step)<br/>
<br/>
Light:  Hidden Base (sort of like hunter’s, but not at all.  Featuring DDTA/Legendary Starfighter and an extra system [Coruscant])<br/>
<br/>
GAME ONE Dark v Ben Tomlinson (Profit/Racing)<br/>
<br/>
So Ben starts with Profit, Racing and Seeking An Audience.  I start with ISB Battle Order, Secret Plans and OE/TINT.  I dump some twix, Twi’lek for Bad Feeling Have I then draw and say go.  Ben drops Threepio w/out clothes, uses him and sits.  I draw some cards, Twi’lek for YMSYL then say go.  Ben gets out Artoo, draws then says go.  I sit back, drop YMSYL, drop Reactor Terminal (Old-Skool!), drop a twix, feel annoyed that the Defensive Perimeter is in my used pile then say go and grab my Walker Garisson and Defensive Perimeter.  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, so as you can see, it got a bit slow.  Ben eventually won the race, making me lose 6 and retrieving 6.  He also flipped, but I deployed Daroe with an Undercover to obi-wan’s site.  Everyone else was in the audience chamber, except for Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Friend of Captain Solo who was later killed by IG-88 so I guess that that would mean also Enemy of IG-88, who went to the defensive perimeter to get killed by *Veers playing an Imperial Command.  Basically, I set up at the perimeter, Kashyyyk and Ice Plains with a POTF (also taking JP later in the game) and caused a lot of damage.  Ben did a couple to me with profit and one at the Pub because I was too stupid to move Daroe over before I Did It hit the table (which cost me the tournament- read on).<br/>
<br/>
FW 2+(20 something)<br/>
<br/>
The Good:  Go *Veers!  Go undercover Jawa!  Crack team!<br/>
The Bad:  Not moving Daroe.<br/>
The Ugly:  LOCK DOWN!<br/>
<br/>
GAME TWO Light v Stuart Jones (Brangus)<br/>
<br/>
So Stuart started with ... watto’s box (duh!) and I started with Hidden Base, Strike Planning, Squadron Assignments and Your Insight Serves Luca Well (No odds all game).  First turn I grabbed Billy D and Millennium Falcon.  "What, no Gold Squadron 1?"<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Stu won the podrace and I lost stuff.  I flipped as soon as I could, deploying my extra system- Coruscant as well.  I set up Falcon at Coruscant and some other junk at Kessel later.  Stu played his Visage and some destiny 6 schmoe with wrinkles to the Podrace Arena (he won the race, just by the way).  Stu had Bob in Ship, Zuckuss In Ship and the Bus, which was always going to be more than enough.  Zuckuss In Ship came down early because Stu didn’t like the prospect of me getting 3 extra activation off Aquaris.  Excellent.  Unfortunately, everything survived and Stu had enough brains to move Zuckuss.<br/>
<br/>
Bob and Bus went to Kessel and I came down with my one real chance at winning the game- Artoo in Ship, EPP Luke and a Cannon.  I shot down Bob, but Stu drew enough to tie with me in power, so I didn’t get to drop the Legendary Starfighter that I’d been holding in my hand all game.  Grr.  I also played an Edge with a tracked 6 that got Sensed (I didn’t have a Tunnel Vision to cancel it with).  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
FL 0(-8)<br/>
2(+15ish)<br/>
<br/>
The Good:  Great game, lots of fun.  Both of us played without making any mistakes.<br/>
The Bad:  Not much.  I lost track of Stu’s Trooper Sabbac once.<br/>
The Ugly:  Missing out on the Legendary, and the game, by one.  Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
GAME THREE Light v Adam Amy (YMSYL)<br/>
<br/>
Adam was playing the Landing deck we’d mucked around with before.  Admirals Orders are tech.  Anyhow, he started with Mob Points, so I started with DDTA. Adam tried to pull Executor, but I slapped his wrist and said ’Don’t Do That Again!,’ so Adam played Command to grab Piett with built in Merrejk with built in system.  Falcon went out to Endor early.  "What, not Gold Squadron 1?"<br/>
<br/>
Adam tried to activate more from Mob Points, but I said ’Don’t Do That Again!,’ so he grabbed his system.  I’m like ’Don’t ...’ and Adam said ’It doesn’t do that, d1ckhead.’  LOL.  So the next important thing to happen was that I counted how much Adam was going to activate and then deployed my system.  Adam dropped Chimaera, Thrawn and ... Battle Order, so he got to smack the Falcon around pretty convincingly.  D’oh.  Oh yeah, and he got Mob Points back.  I briefly considered getting Falcon back with Tibrin (for Legendary).<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I think that I tracked and used Wedge in RS1 and some other Red Squad guy with a Power Pivot to beat on the Chimaera.  Legendary Starfighter.  Finally.  The next main thing was that the Executor with Piett, Merrejk and Chiraneau went to Fondor.  I deployed my Edged/Tibrined (can’t remember which) Falcon with Captain Han and Corran to fight it.  Adam played Command to limit me to one destiny.  I said duh and Adam lost all of the pilots to my amazing manoeuvre 10 Falcon.  After this, Adam got Veers in Blizzard 1 to the Defensive Perimeter, who was hit with a Boushh then a tracked 6.  Early damage, deployment and stuff kept me down to a FW by 15 or so.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+15)<br/>
4(+30, more or less)<br/>
<br/>
The Good:  Got everything that I needed.<br/>
The Bad:  Legendary only causing 1 damage per turn.<br/>
The Ugly:  Executor and Chimara both going down.<br/>
<br/>
Lunch was provided courtesy of Hungry Jacks today.  There was no in-flight movie, so back to our regularly scheduled programming.<br/>
<br/>
GAME FOUR Dark v Sean Mackin (Hidden Base)<br/>
<br/>
Sean started with Squadron Assignments, Strike Planning and something else.  Originality plus.  Sean came out quickly with General Afro, Wedge and some @#$% of Wedges.  I got Security Precautions first turn with YCHF (’What?  Who plays that?!’  ’That’s pretty tough, Sean, I’m probably the only person here playing it’).  Anyhow, Sean flipped and I set up YMSYL.  I also set up Search and Destroy.  Executor, Chimaera/Thrawn, Zuckuss, Bus and Dengar in Ship all hit the table, allowing me not only to probe, but to hold off a system or two to drain at!<br/>
<br/>
There wasn’t really much more to it than that.  Fast direct damage combined with Battle Order was pretty much all there was to it.<br/>
<br/>
FW2(+20??)<br/>
6(+50??)<br/>
<br/>
The Good: Won, total domination.<br/>
The Bad:  I suppose losing to Kessel drain a few times.<br/>
The Ugly:  I lost the same agent 4 or 5 times to the same drain.<br/>
<br/>
GAME FIVE Light v Ronnie Wilcox (BHBM)<br/>
<br/>
There wasn’t much to this one either.  As Ronnie put it, this deck was built to beat Hunt Down and BHBM.  He was playing BHBM.  I dropped my systems and paid to drain.  Stick Luke got dragged over to the Throne Room (seeing as there was no way any drains were getting through).  I lost the duel a few times before setting up 2 sixes in a row and tracking them.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+16)<br/>
8(+something, didn’t take notes, can’t remember)<br/>
<br/>
The Good:  Won.<br/>
The Bad:  There was nothing in it.<br/>
The Ugly:  Take Your Father’s Place.  Man that’s U-G-L-Y.<br/>
<br/>
GAME SIX Dark v Ronnie Wilcox (War Room/Racing/Beatdown)<br/>
<br/>
I had helped Ronnie to build his deck this morning, and it was major beats.  I had no doubts in Ronnie’s ability to end the game in one beatdown if given the chance.  Here’s a summary of the game:<br/>
<br/>
Me:  Twi’lek.  Bad Feeling Have I.  Twix.  Draw.<br/>
Ronnie:  3P0.  Use 3P0.  Draw.<br/>
Me:  Twix.  Twi’lek.  Draw.<br/>
Ronnie:  Use 3P0.  Twix.  Draw.<br/>
Me:  Twi’lek.  Twix.  Reactor Terminal.  Draw.<br/>
Him:  Etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I finally played YMSYL and dropped Vader and a Walker containing Tarkin, Veers and some forfeit schmoes and flipped.  I also dropped CHYBC.  Ronnie kept trying to set up his crap.  He also dropped Qui-Gon and stick to the Third Marker and the Fourth Marker.  I moved over to the Fourth Marker.  It was looking tight as Ronnie had a huge hand, but realistically nowhere or enough force to set up a beatdown.  Ronnie played the shields.  I took a risk and deployed Chimaera/Thrawn/Ozzel to Kashyyyk (I Did It/Beggar was preventing me to save up to drop more in one turn and I couldn’t find the Death Star to have somewhere safe to drop ships then move).  Ronnie checked his destinies with Seeking An Audience and they were like 7, 2, 4, 5, 5 or something, so he let me go for a turn.  Next turn, I dropped POTF on the Mountains, Bus, Zuckuss and some scrub to Kashyyyk and moved over to the Mountains.  <br/>
<br/>
Ronnie dropped Obi-Wan to the Podrace Arena.  I responded with an empty walker carrying 5-D6.  That was pretty much game.  I wasn’t about to be beaten down, Ronnie was locked down by ISB and CHYBC and I was causing damage.  I dumped my hand except for an Imperial Command and a Trample and sat for like 10 turns with a 6 on top.  Ronnie eventually fought me with Qui-Gon and Lando, but lost both and I got to lose an agent to retrieve.<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
The Good:  ISB strikes back!<br/>
The Bad:  S-L-O-W<br/>
The Ugly:  LOCK DOWN!<br/>
<br/>
So I finished on 10 (+74).  Adam Amy finished on 10 (+75).  Grrr ... if only I’d remembered to move my Jawa in game one.  (Bet you never thought you’d hear a serious player say THAT!).  Everyone got some stuff, with me getting a Padme and The Shield Is Down for prizes, both of which I didn’t own.  Terry gave me a box of Tatooine commons, which I also didn’t own.  I kept on trying to get people to take I Will Find Them Quickly, Master as prizes because it had a comma in it but no-one took the grammatical bait.  Illiyana, though, put me in my place with Great Shot, Kid!, which was like 3 times as good because it has both a comma and an exclamation mark.  Damn.  Foiled again.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
<br/>
Terry for Emperors and stuff.<br/>
Ronnie for ’offering me a hand’ with my command card.<br/>
Lee for the Artoo in Ship and improving.<br/>
That damned Jawa for getting retrieved so much and going undercover.<br/>
HJ’s for taking that OLD, old $20.<br/>
Robbo for making the trip from Geelong (featuring that new-fangled ’electricity’).<br/>
John Lampe for not playing me for the 10 billionth time in a tournament ... again!<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
<br/>
Adam for edging me out by one.  Grr.<br/>
’Great Shot, Kid!’ for having such funky punctuation.<br/>
Matt because I’m pissed off at you and I can’t just beat the @#$% through you ’cause you’re my best friend (and the Victorian Tae-Kwon-Do champion and 6 foot tall, but that wouldn’t usually stop me).  So yeah, nyeh!<br/>
<br/>
Until the continentals,<br/>
