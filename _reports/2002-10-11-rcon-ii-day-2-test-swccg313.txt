So when I last left I was with Juz, Kevin Reitzel and Dan Bojonowski talking tech for today's main tournament.  I was showing Juz some sweet tech for the light side and for the dark we were discussing the DS card Put All Sections On Alert.  If you play on the D* or Executor sites, use this card.  No exception.<br>
<br>
So I get back from the hotel around 3am or so and try to get some sleep.  Because I was so nervous and excited about Saturday, I get up at 6am!  No sleep for me.<br>
<br>
Last year the room was screwed up so I needed to make sure everything was going to be ok.  I showered and got ready to go by packing up my car.  Right before I left, Bart Robinson (who crashed at my place the night before) was up so I asked him if he would help me setup, he agrees and we go on out way with a packed car to the student center.  By the way, Bart was one of the people that made this day go by like clockwork, he was helpful with everything throughout the day and I cannot thank him enough! So we start getting everything set up and we put up signs pointing everyone in the right direction so they would be able to find everything without getting lost.  I was looking for a coat rack to hang up the 50+ T-shirts I had printed up and end up 'borrowing' one from another event somewhere else...they did not need it anyway ;).  I started to wonder if I needed more tables so Bart took 5 more tables from random.rooms that would need them, oh well...I needed them more. ;)  So around 8ish in the morning people start to show up for the morning YJ event.  Among those include myself (I actually got to play!) Dan Bojonowski, Doug Faust, Kevin Reitzel, Mike Dalton and more.  Because Chris Gogolen is running the tournament, I eventually get to use his decks.  I do not play YJ so throughout the event I was able to get my butt kicked.<br>
<br>
First Game, I get paired with Dan Bojonowski and wonder if good luck is going to win me this game because my ability sure isnt.  I lose miserably, then throughout the event get a chance to lose to Kevin, Rich Haman, and Mike Dalton who spank me around like a bad player.  I had fun though and took my miserable losses well.  Before the game, I had a Obi Foil from BOfNaboo that Herren donated for prize support.  Haman and Lembo went and traded me for that one foil with about 30 rares that included mains with their respective weapons or vehicles.  That was definitely similar to the atmosphere all weekend!  Everyone was so giving with everything the whole time...thanks all!  So I take dead last place, I think and just give away my support.  Doug Faust was the highest 3-1 player since no one went undefeated and took the uncut sheet home with him.  Interesting fact about the people that stayed in my room will be mentioned later...maybe Its the accommodations ;).  <br>
<br>
So after the tournament Tom Hermely-Keen and his wife Blythe show up with the rest of the 66 people getting ready to play in the main Championship.  Blythe is saving grace #2 for the day.  She did all the computer work with the software and did it perfectly!  So Bart is helping with checking people in and getting command cards while Blythe and Rich get command cards into the computer.  I am still running around like a chicken without a head getting the finishing touches ready.  So during the main tournament I got the prizes out on the tables with the customary face down cards that were either Reflections foils or a WB card that would give you a Rcon II T-shirt.  I also had 5 posters in the back of the room for everyone to sign that I was going to give away.  After the 6th game while the final scores were being added up I had a raffle on items that included a signed Mara and her saber, Playstation, and a Jedi Powers CD game.  Rich Haman ran the tournament with me and was unbelievable in running this tournament with me!  He did great!  <br>
<br>
So during the games some amazing things happened that I wanted to let everyone know about.<br>
<br>
Justin Pakes, not playing a constructed tournament since a Melbourne one in 1998 was able to beat 2000+ rated players Ray Bordier and Brian Terwilliger in great games!  <br>
<br>
Greg Hodur and Bob Caton were able to play at the head table during the early rounds and were laughing the whole time! ;)<br>
<br>
Some good matchups early between good players were everywhere...Jonathan Chu and Wojciech Jankowski played in game 1, the Twig brothers had to play each other during the day.  Another highlight of the day was when Justin Pakes and Kevin Reitzel of decipher played Marty Terwilliger and Brian Terwilliger at the same table in game 3!   <br>
<br>
Onto the stats!<br>

So Jonathan Chu played Chris Terwilliger in the final duel (Chris was on fire all weekend going 13-1 in this and the team tournament!) and ended up losing the first game but was able to pull out the second win to get a +11 and take home the second RamapoCon II championship trophy!  Jonathan also received the Championship T-shirt, the uncut sheet of DS Premiere Rares while Chris got the Darth Vader foil and a T-shirt of his own.  Chris also gets glass along with the rest of the top 6. <br/>
<br/>
While these two were playing the final duel, a bunch of other tournaments got underway including YJ #2, Austin Powers and No Such Thing As Luck.  I ended up getting pizza for the Volunteers, Juz and Kevin and finally had a chance to eat around 6pm ;).  During the event also, Nathan Brown and Doug Faust were taking pictures like crazy for me and we were able to get pictures of the 2000+ players, Squadron Members with Kevin and Juz, and lots of pictures with me and everyone! ;) <br/>
<br/>
So Austin Powers was being run by Ted Panczyszyn and had 6 players including him.  It also had Bart Robinson, Wojciech Jankowski, Nathan Brown, Dan Bordier, and Joe Young doing pinky smirks all night and having a great time!  Dan Bordier won the event and took home a RCon II T-shirt with Nathan Brown taking second and an Austin Powers Decipher shirt.<br/>
<br/>
In the second Young Jedi Dan Bojonowski ended up beating on the rest of the competition and took 1st place with an undefeated record.  He got the Sebulba Foil and a RamapoCon II T-shirt.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Bob Caton won this tournament and before a final duel was going to happen, Bob had to leave.  Frank wanted the final duel so Juz decided to donate a DLots foil to Frank with Bob getting the DLots I had for the winner.  Both went home happy and Juz was great for his generosity.  One thing throughout the weekend was how generous and talkative Justin and Kevin were to everyone.  The great part about it is that they were just being themselves and everyone loved that they were there!  Thanks again guys!<br/>
<br/>
So after the AP, NSTAL, and YJ Tournaments were done Doug Faust got started on his booster draft sealed deck tournament.  Unfortunately time was running short since the school would not give me the room the entire time I was supposed to have it but I did manage to get some butt kissing in to get a longer time than they wanted to give me.  This worked out as the three game event was able to get finished, close but still finished ;).  Doug was telling me that this was 3 times larger than any event he had ever run but he ran everything great!  There was 36 people that showed up for the event.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the top 8 for sealed deck with the complete listing on my website this week.<br/>
<br/>
1. Chris Erwin Light 6(+38) <br/>
2. Dan Bojanowski Dark 6(+36) <br/>
3. John Lolli Dark 6(+29) <br/>
4. Andy Talaga Dark 6(+24) <br/>
5. Chris Lanci Dark 4(+35) <br/>
6. Jonathan Chu Light 4(+21) <br/>
7. Chris Terwilliger Light 4(+14) <br/>
8. Michael Dalton Dark 4(+13) <br/>
<br/>
So a great tournament by Doug and everyone seemed to have a great day of tournaments.  After, we were rushed out of the Student Center and I thanked everyone on the way out.  <br/>
<br/>
I ended up taking Juz back to the Hotel and we chatted for a while.  Found out that Kevin and Dan made a wrong turn for the hotel and ended up travelling towards Albany!  Luckily they made a u-turn and made it back about an hour or so late.<br/>
<br/>
So about the people staying in my place this weekend, out of them Doug Faust, Jon Chu and Charlie Herren...took home 2 uncut sheets and 3 pieces of glass!  Pretty amazing I thought. ;).<br/>
