<br/>
so there were 5 minnesotans qualified to play on day 2, Me, Mike Raveling, Jon Swenson, Josh Kohman and Graham Neal.  too bad Josh Grace the State champ couldn’t make it. <br/>
<br/>
 i changed my DS over to a HD force choke deck.  the idea was to sit vader and/or Empy+Janus at whatever battleground they give me and in turn give them absolutly no force, 5 vaders, 5 empys + 3 janus saw to that, for space i got zuckuss x3, 4-lom x3, guri x2 and stinger, and a bossk in his ship to boot.  <br/>
<br/>
LS was the ol’ WYS from day 1.  Stenerson wanted his JK lukes back since he was playing in day 2, so i simply borrow 3 more from brian herold and seth van winkle since they weren’t qualified for day 2.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, DS vs Scott Diehl’s RST<br/>
<br/>
well going back to day 1 this is the 3rd game in a row Scott and I have had to play each other.  I try to do as much early damage as i could, first turn vader to his rebel landing site, second turn empy to his back door, and third turn zuckuss to his endor.  i have sebulba’s racer, and the first race destiny i draw is CHYBC.  so corran horn goes to the holotheater right away and start draining for 2.  he wins the podrace, and starts to set up to blow up the bunker.  i think i’m as good as gone if he does blow up the bunker, so iggy and 4-lom goes to the bunker to try to stop them and vader follows them in.  because he gets 2 battle destinies when he initiates he clears me out, but my turn another vader + saber come out to the bunker and basically we fight over it for a few turns.  at last he totally clears me out of the bunker, and he’s got luke, han and leia in there.  my turn i topdeck yet another vader with janus, drop him at the rebel landing site, flip, move over to the bunker.  that buys me another turn but he’s like winning despite the huge drains i was putting on early.  his turn luke goes to the back door, and i have to battle han+leia and we clear each other out.  we’re each draining for like 2 a turn and he starts to set up in the bunker again so i draw up before he blows it.  loss by 12 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, LS vs Jon Swenson’s Surgeon<br/>
<br/>
last night as i was going over swenson’s deck i was advicing him to put first turn empy at the Tat. db instead of at the cantina against WYS since Jedi Luke would have to go to a db so its better to have empy at a db waiting for him.  but he doesn’t heed my advice and drops empy first turn to the cantina.  well my first turn my JK luke goes to the home 1 db.  his third turn or so he gets guri and xizor over to the D* db (another mistake, against WYS you should never deploy the D* db)  i’m already set up in space so i just move luke over to the non-unique db on tatooine so that he doesn’t stay flipped and he can’t set up his draws.  he has guri and xizor follow JK luke.  my turn chewie protector and another smuggler come out there and i battle, but i draw low and he draws high so he has to lose only a couple force while i lose the random smuggler, and JK luke and chewie goes to the tat. db, where he’s got nobody.  he doesn’t flip for the rest of the game, which means he can’t set up his draws, and he can’t track because he’s activation is pretty low, which means he’s got very few ways of killing JK luke (especially considering all the battle avoidance cards i had in my hand)  so he’s sitting there draining me for 3 and i’m sitting there draining him for 5.  his ships never came out to space to fight me.  in the end he has 3 force left and before he draws up i had 2 on the edges in my hand and i play those 4 times to boost my diff.  win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, LS vs David Irvine’s ISB Scum<br/>
<br/>
well i start battle order instead of DDTA.  i get early flip with a ship at kessel and melas on tatooine.  while his first turn he just draws, so i know he doesn’t have jabba’s palace in hand.  he doesn’t want to check his reserve with power of the hutt because if Hutt Smooch isn’t there he’s gonna have to deploy some chump to my cantina or something.  well my second turn i tunnel hoping to find a grimtaash.  its not there so i drop 3p0 and try to top deck my shocking.  my next turn i tunnel again and again no shocking there, so i keep trying to top deck it with 3p0 but to no avail.  finally on his 4th or 5th turn or so, with like 25 cards in his hand, he finally drops jabba’s palace, gets the AC, and puts enough guys out to flip.  i’ve got no drains on tatooine and he’s cancelling my drain at kessel with a ORS. (I realize now i should have never deployed kessel, just kept to tatooine because he woulda had a harder time satisfying battle plan.  well i’ve got menace fades out too so his drains in jabba’s palace are kept contained.  i’ve got a ship at tatooine with I’ll take the leader and my guys at a couple DBs so i’m getting a little damage thru.  until he comes down with like 5 ships and wreck my guy, i houjix the damage tho’.  so i’m doing minimum damage to him and he’s doing like 5 a turn to me.  until he makes the mistake of splitting his ships up and chasing after me at kessel.  so next turn i kill off all of his presence in space with some x-wing cannon/dash action, but sadly he still has the jabba’s cruiser at kessel and guri in ship at tatooine, and next turn dengar comes out, more ORSs come out to the space cruiser, and he consolidates.  so now i’m screwed and its only delaying the inevitable.  loss by 25 or so.<br/>
<br/>
the whole game coulda gone differently if i drew that damned grimtaash early!<br/>
<br/>
I think of dropping but since i don’t get to play against competition this good every day i figure i’d stick it out and just have some fun.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, DS vs Paul Maholick’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
well, i get some first turn Empy + janus action to the cantina, but i can’t draw a vader for a while, and my force choke isn’t going as well as i’d like, he’s getting some guys out in space and at the tat. db.  i can’t really make a hit on him at the tat. db so vader goes to the cantina too, but eventually some of my space buddies show up and i clear him outta space or something.  kinda hard to remember.  but he comes back with more ships and we fight back and forth.  eventually his JK luke and some smugglers come to block my drain in the cantina, but that was a mistake since i’ve been janusing for like 20 turns now, so luke gets force lightinged with a 6, and his scrub smugglers basically get beaten on.  i pull out a close win. win by 10 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, LS vs Joe Gianetti’s Brangus.<br/>
<br/>
well this game is spectacularly uneventful.  he’s playing a brangus deck where he puts brangus at the d* db, and when you go battle him he plays the damage tripler card and like 3 destiny adders to make you lose like 40 force or something.  he gets like some guys at the cantina, and brangus at the d* db.  while i flip in space and have JK luke running around on the ground.  i win the podrace.  him losing the damage tripler card, moment of triumph and lone warrier kinda clued me in to what he was doing, so brangus chases JK luke around, but i get guys at his d* db, his D*, and all over tatooine and all he can do is chase me around.  i get off some on the edges to win by even more in the end.  win by 31.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, DS vs Mike Raveling’s WYS<br/>
<br/>
well this game is very similar to game 4.  i get my guys at the cantina draining for 4, he gets his guys at the tat. db.  he controls tatooine too.  but he’s only doing 2 damage / turn and i’m doing 4, so eventually he has to deploy kessel and split his ships at both systems.  thats when zuckuss/4lom/guri all come out and we fight a little bit, but whenever he kills my guys, i’d always have another 4-lom or another guri in hand to rejoin the battle, so eventually i win control over kessel.  the game goes on like that, he tries to invade my cantina with r2+3p0 to back up some Artoo i’ve got a bad feeling action, but he backs out and retreats when i force lighting his droids.  my huge drain in the cantina does him in, but once again my force choke did not go as well as i’d liked.  win by 7 or so.<br/>
<br/>
so i end up going 4-2 in 6th place.  some how this is good enough to qualify me for day 2 of worlds, haha its like i tripped and qualified for worlds.  but oh well, thank god i’m lucky like that.<br/>
<br/>
i play in the coruscant sealed again on sunday and my cards are ass, and i go 1-2 drop.  to top it all off my cards got stolen too.  so it was just 20 bucks down the drain with nothing to show for it.<br/>
