<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">the night before:<br/>
so i rock up to adam amy’s place at about 6ish, and i find <br/>
iliyana, ronnie, leigh, adz and sean sittin round playtesting. <br/>
in particular, seeing as this is the first sanctioned <br/>
tourney since R3 came out, we were all concerned about the <br/>
effect of lightsaber combat. the following conclusions were reached:<br/>
1) dark saber combat is sexcellent<br/>
2) light saber combat gets owned<br/>
<br/>
we also discuss meta vs these things, and sean reckons that <br/>
any sort of m&amp;t will own them. i dont believe sean, cause he’s so RADIANT <br/>
(inside joke), and i play iliyana with my brand spanking new LS saber combat deck. <br/>
even though i do all the right stuff, i get raped by her, <br/>
even though she’s a chick and not actually physically <br/>
capable of rape. so i said ’FCUK’ really loudly and took <br/>
it apart to make a throneroom mains deck, with ronnie’s <br/>
most expert help. WEST SIDE.<br/>
after playing some games with my tech BHBM deck, and some <br/>
sexcellent trades with leigh (cheers mate), i go home to <br/>
finish off throneroom...and sleep at 3am.<br/>
<br/>
the day:<br/>
ok. so i wake up at like 8:30 and im fcukin cranky cos the tourney is at 9...but its all good, i arrive just in time to swap for some good stuff, and pick up a couple of tips from LUCA (the man) on how to best employ throneroom. he assures me of its most magnificent strength, so i feel a little better about playing a deck i know jack all about. grgh. so here’s what i go in with:<br/>
DS: BHBM death machine with YOUR DADDY<br/>
LS: throneroom mains<br/>
<br/>
so kev calls the first pairings:<br/>
<br/>
game1: LS vs Steve’s Watto<br/>
christ. i hate watto. luca drops by and informs me im in for a <br/>
struggle. i pull some twixes and bide my time for a bit...<br/>
he drops xizor the pornstar and watto to flip, makes me lose<br/>
force, and moves xizor over so he flips back (WTF?!) along<br/>
with a lord maul at the 3/2 place. i go..<br/>
’uhhh..okay’<br/>
and promptly drop some beasty mains to the 3/2 location to<br/>
start raping maul like the b!tch he is. i cause some massive<br/>
dam with gift of the mentor. he does the watto thing during<br/>
his turn with janus, i lose force, blah blah. he moves<br/>
janus over to join watto and co at the jankyard...at this<br/>
point, i get sick of screwing round so i load up at mos<br/>
espa with mains, and pull battle plan. no one dares come get<br/>
me, and i drain out for a win. i edge to get back 6 (phew)<br/>
FW +23<br/>
good: wow...throne room is SO good!<br/>
bad: having the biggest damn hand ever and not being able<br/>
to throw back :P<br/>
<br/>
game2: DS vs Leigh Smith’s saber combat<br/>
yeaah baby. id taken this on the night before with ronnie amd<br/>
whupped him, so i was damn confident. i was a little wary<br/>
of using the emperor too early, so i drew up a fair bit.<br/>
unfortunately, the need for cards is like the need for crystal<br/>
meth: just one hit isnt good enough. i had something like 17<br/>
cards in hand. then. (this is priceless, you will pi55 yourself)<br/>
leigh: ’how much force do you activate?’<br/>
me: (looks at twixes) ’lots’<br/>
leigh: ’okay...good’ (plays OBIWANS APPARITION on the 2/2)<br/>
me: ’hmm. interesting. you realise this says BOTH PLAYERS’<br/>
leigh: ’oh no! how much force do i activate then?’<br/>
me: ’well, i give you two icons..’<br/>
leigh: ’oh 5hit’<br/>
so. i proceed to lay down vader and the emperor with impunity<br/>
and drain like a psycho. losing force from Your Daddy, and<br/>
getting punished by the stormtrooper garrison drains, leigh<br/>
didnt stand a chance with the force choke he applied to himself.<br/>
it was so funny!!<br/>
FW +25<br/>
good: every form of force loss imaginable: your daddy, empy<br/>
with janus, s&amp;m..i mean s&amp;d...christ.<br/>
bad: well..umm. at least you know what to do next time, man.<br/>
ugly: j.lampe. cause he is. (j/k john :)<br/>
<br/>
so yeah. im in one of the top spots right now..WOO.<br/>
but guess what, i have to play the pornstar himself, ADAM.<br/>
(cue slap bass) bown chicka bown bown<br/>
<br/>
game3: LS vs Adam Amy HDADTJ choker with hallway tech<br/>
i had a deep dark sense of foreboding bout this...for those<br/>
who have been living with their cokk in their mouths for the<br/>
past couple of months, adam is the continental champ. but<br/>
he’s been feeling a little scrubby lately, and i have a lot<br/>
of confidence in my light, now i have an idea of what it <br/>
can do.<br/>
so.<br/>
adam plays operational as planned. i foolishly grab it, knowing<br/>
full well that he will abuse accelerate our plans to get mad<br/>
generation. it turns out that the blockhead hallway is the <br/>
only battleground he put out all game. adam, you dont put<br/>
out very well, mate. the emperor parked his a55 there and drained.<br/>
suicide luke came down, slashed, and died. empy came back.<br/>
yet still no sign of vader...we lost like...8 turns of Visage<br/>
before adam played a Weapon Lev to find stacked:<br/>
4x DVDLOTS<br/>
2x Janus<br/>
how pissed would you be. jeeezus.<br/>
anyway, vader finally makes an entrance and hurts me. my suicide<br/>
mains do nothing against him, and we spend a long time poking each other<br/>
with drains: i poke him for 1...he pokes me for...4. crap.<br/>
i try revo a twix to get some drainage happening, but no go.<br/>
FL -15<br/>
good: iliyana the cheerleader.<br/>
bad: losing i guess? but it was a good game.<br/>
<br/>
so yeah, we go have lunch. adam, ronnie, myself and iliyana go <br/>
out for a smoke and discuss the finer points of oral sex. i <br/>
also discover that a maul is to go to the winner of the tourney.<br/>
so adam resolves to rape everyone, but he doesnt get it up,<br/>
as you will see.<br/>
<br/>
ronnie and i are paired up next, so we take it easy, finishing<br/>
lunch and checkin out some of the very fcukworthy ladies at<br/>
Oz on collins. there was this one blonde chick who kept staring<br/>
at us, even as she was walking past us, looking back. she must<br/>
have seen how big ronnie’s chokk is, and not be able to keep<br/>
her eyes off it. fcukin pervert.<br/>
<br/>
game4: my DS vs Ronnie Wilcox’s saber combat<br/>
heh. we played this game twice the evening before, and i <br/>
kicked him real good like. but ronnie reckons he knows how<br/>
to screw BHBM with LS. we have a couple of turns just picking<br/>
up, getting cards in hand, until he plays quigon, lando and<br/>
angry chewie to the 3/2. i send a suicide vader with boba and<br/>
4-LOM to try rape them, but destinies suck and vader diess.<br/>
next turn he disarms 4lom and rapes boba for all he’s worth.<br/>
dont worry, its all good...next turn i come down with maul<br/>
and double stick to slash lando to the used, and cut quigon<br/>
to itty bitty pieces. now, ronnie cant drain at his other<br/>
site with obi and destiny 6 luke, so he puts another quigon<br/>
and combats maul. my pull 7&amp;6. mwhahahahahah. BHBM = good.<br/>
this happens like 4-5 times with my 5x destiny 7 cards and<br/>
emperors. not only that, i duel away his quigon and obi with<br/>
tat maul gametext. but finally, maul dies, and it hurts <br/>
for a little while until i send down vader with stick <br/>
to stop it. ronnie packs more jedi than i bargained for, and<br/>
vader lasts a little while in the saber combat before finally<br/>
getting nailed by a stacked 7 &amp; 6. after that, he cleans me out.<br/>
FL -5<br/>
good: holding out for a little while...<br/>
bad: playtesting against ronnie night before :P feck<br/>
ugly: the venue cleaning ladies. euughhhhhh<br/>
<br/>
so we go for another cig, and we meet these 2 trek players<br/>
outside, and one of them’s got a soulfly tee on, so i think<br/>
’cool’. we talk for a bit about Fear Factory and System Of<br/>
A Down coming out in a month or so, and we get into a debate<br/>
about how the force is nothing compared to the borg or some crap.<br/>
after a while we realise how sad we are, and go back in.<br/>
<br/>
game5: my LS vs Lee Pullen’s senate.<br/>
okay. i should have won this. i should have been on top of the<br/>
game. but i didnt. i didnt get characters quick enough, and<br/>
didnt establish a revo choke quick enough. maul makes an apperance<br/>
at his hut, and moves over to MY twix to drain. i send suicide<br/>
obi and luke to show maul the true meaning of double penetration.<br/>
mwhahaha, he dies, i save obi with resilience. he chucks out the<br/>
3/2. (what is with these people playing that damn site??) plays<br/>
lord maul and slasher vader there. okay. i activate loads <br/>
with twix and send down my own tag team of naboo quigon and <br/>
obi wan. um. we slash each other’s immune jedi, and draw destiny<br/>
so everything dies..everything diiiiieeessssss NOOOOOOOOO<br/>
i run out of mains, @#$%, i desperately use shock info and<br/>
threepio to fish some, and make some really bad play choices<br/>
like leaving a lone padme at the 3/2..ouch. beaten down on.<br/>
but i dont let him off without a fight..nooooo im too good<br/>
to compromise myself like that, and i decide to go down punching<br/>
and kicking.<br/>
<br/>
i just drew up and gave him a win of 9.<br/>
<br/>
FL -9<br/>
good: close game.<br/>
bad: doing stupid things.<br/>
<br/>
grggh...now im 2:3...im sliding badly. my scrubliness is<br/>
revealed for all of DT to see...FARKKKK...<br/>
adam also doesnt do well...he and rod lee have one force <br/>
in their life during rod’s turn, and visage is on the table.<br/>
FL -1 = P3NIS<br/>
so that puts him out of the running.<br/>
determined to do something about my diff, i psych myself up<br/>
for the next game. focusing my chi inside, i welled up all<br/>
of my mental strength and steeled myself for a game against..<br/>
<br/>
a scrub. 5hit.<br/>
<br/>
game6: my DS vs scrub ANSB<br/>
okay. in my hand are Stormtrooper Garrison and Janus.<br/>
i play empy and janus first turn to north ridge. they sit there<br/>
and drain for two. they are joined by garrison.<br/>
garrison, meet emperor<br/>
emperor, meet garrison<br/>
these two guys are best friends:<br/>
1&gt; emperor gives a force, garrison takes one<br/>
2&gt; garrison adds destiny with a leader. empy is a leader<br/>
3&gt; garrison stops leader targeting. empy is a leader<br/>
4&gt; garrison gives a whopping +2 FORCEDRAIN AT A REB BASE<br/>
<br/>
so this happy family sits at north ridge draining for 4 the<br/>
entire game. sheeite.<br/>
but then. i dont pack space. and he establishes EBO. ouch.<br/>
i drained for 7 each turn. to counter i send vader to a DB,<br/>
and the guy never plays luke (oh you scrubs who never play<br/>
luke to vaders location..you crak me up). hes also losing to<br/>
s&amp;m the entire game, and i beatdown obi and a musician with<br/>
iggy, by snaring obi. sheesh. in the end i win.<br/>
FW +14<br/>
good: kickin ass, and talkin strat with the guy afterwards.<br/>
bad: not packin space. i would have owned.<br/>
<br/>
thats it..<br/>
i dont actually have rankings for you, cause i was distracted<br/>
by this pair of REALLY fine chicks who were givin ronnie and<br/>
myself the eye...they were also touching each other on the <br/>
thighs and 5hit, and that got us excited. i wanted to pick em<br/>
up, but adam wanted a smoke and when we got back they were on<br/>
their way into the ladies toilets...who knows what arousing<br/>
sexual adventures took place inside there.<br/>
i know adam came 4th and rod won i think. leigh smith got<br/>
a foil maul in a raffle draw, and iliyana got an It Could Be<br/>
Worse foil...woooohhoooo<br/>
so now i have to pack its worse when i play iliyana cos<br/>
she’s gonna want to show off that brand spanking new sexy<br/>
tournament foil. and when she does.....mwhahaha its worse.<br/>
<br/>
so yeah, thats pretty much it.<br/>
sorry it wasnt funnier or anything, im just kinda tired.<br/>
<br/>
oh, and all you guys out there, you dont give head well enough.<br/>
your ladies are going unsatisfied. i mean, its not like it<br/>
takes a lot of effort, a little tongue work wont kill you.<br/>
<br/>
