<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">ok this is my first tourney report so bear with me. 3 o clock roll around, an i get outta class. i hurried my a.ss on over to things for thinkers to pick up my hardcore title belt that is going to be on the line for my tourney on sunday. then i hurry my a.ss over to enrique huerta’s house so they wont leave without me. its kinda weird but enrique’s house smelled like tamales. im sorry enrique, but it did. :P  anyways Justin beal is slow in gettin there, so we haveta wait for him. it was pat gimber, me and enrique sitting in his tamale smellin house, and all i could think about was why did DR. Pepper tasted so good. then enrique and i discussed the fact that HE was the tourney director, since everyone in phoenix wants to be a little b.itch and whine about decipher.<br/>
ANYWAYS beal gets there, and we all load up into the blazer. of course we dont have gas, and we still need to pick up hayes. when we reached the UofA i immediatly said that all monkies named hayes go to the back of the car. maybe i had one two-liter too many? anyways i pop the top off my third 2-liter in 3 hours. hayes gets his sasqwatch @#$% in the back and we drive. <br/>
on the way to phoenix pat gimber has the bright idea of playing his jawa deck, which is incredibly horrid. his other deck was a build the ds2 deck, which wasnt that bad. im playing my patented The Is Good In Obi, and for ds im playing my Maul on the Rocks(MotR) deck.(desert landing site, battle readiness and jabba’s palace). <br/>
<br/>
first game i play vs a hoth atat deck vs my TIGIO deck.<br/>
i dont know who the guy is, but he wasnt ready for my deck, and i rolled over him. i won by turning vader during my activate phase.<br/>
victory 24(+24)<br/>
<br/>
second game i played versus hayes WYS with my MotR deck.<br/>
this game was horrid because i couldnt shoot anyone! i had epp vader, ig w/stick, and xizor vs epp han, a RFC, and Melas in the cantina. i battled and i tried to chop melas hayes dodged, and i drew a 2 and a 5. i miss. i try to snare han with iggy. i draw a 2. i miss. he shoots xizor, and i am left sitting with 2 sniper combos in my hand. he draw a 6 and a 2 for battle destiny which clears out my charectars. i draw a 1 for battle destiny. that was pretty much game, except for the fact that he los in the wildernessed maul on the second turn as well.<br/>
loss  -7(+17)<br/>
<br/>
third game i played hayes again. i play my TIGIO deck, which should kick his senater deck’s ass. it was even all through  the game. i played epp obi 5 turns in a row at the senate and drew a seven for battle destiny for 3 of those turns. then out of no where he playes epp vader, and i had one more obi in my hand. he had two senators at the senate. i dropped obi, battled and i *thought* i had a seven stacked up. i had a 4 instead. he drew a five, and we were even in the battle. i looked at my hand and i had a bith shuffle combo, and i just about pissed myself. game was over.<br/>
loss -24(-7)<br/>
<br/>
last game i played mt MotR deck versus some guy named Webb’s revolution throne/nudj deck. he won because he revolutioned the jedi council chamber, and i didnt know that it was immune to revo. i had mara jade w/stick and dr eva combo and epp vader. he didnt mess with them since the fifth turn of the game. plus i missed always thinking with your stomach on jedi luke twice, also. he should have lost another 16 force during the game, but he cheated, and i didnt catch it.<br/>
loss -8(-15)<br/>
<br/>
on the way home, hayes made a pass at me, and i told him i didnt like weiner. plus i seem to be the only one that can laugh at homo-erotic jokes. Beal, i think, got an erection because he sure was quiet during the whole trip home. pat sat in the back because he got last. i got second to last. on the trip home we talked about how weak the new ref3 objectives were, and how they were a bunch of shyt. </font></td>
