<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So I figure I might as well just suck it up and play in a tournament again.  After all, I have to get ready for the Who Got Game? tournament next week in Phoenix (plug!!!).  I figured I might as well switch up my decks and try something new.  So I did<br/>
<br/>
for Dark - The Gambler and the Jailer <br/>
for Light - CC Celeb w/anti Drazin Tech. <br/>
<br/>
The dark deck is a version of Drazin that I really like.  I took Tim Leung's core and changed out some cards.  I wish I would have kept the Aiii, Aiii, Arrgggg in, that would have been beatings.  I added some JP Sabacc, and switched two CC sabaccs for two trooper Sabaccs, then I read the casino...doh!!! only cc sabacc.  I switched them up for anti catch card tech.  What I have noticed about this deck is it's like a popular magic archetype, the one where you just discard and discard and then beatdown.  I can't explain it in better detail.<br/>
<br/>
Game One <br/>
DS vs. Ben McDonald's HB <br/>
Ben has been coming into his own as of late, he has been winning tournaments when Jeremy or Myself aren't there.  So I get Orimaako and set up.  I quickly play two sabaccs and get rid of Coruscant and Kiffex.  NEWSFLASH!!!! - Sabbacc wrecks hidden base.  Obi comes down and beats up jabba, I draw a zero.  A couple turns and Jabba makes a reappearance and beats up obi.  I keep retreiving fears and sabaccs and I am slowly whittling him down.  He sets up in space and flips, I probe (w/ his gold leader in gold one *snicker*) I get it.  for the next couple of turns I am draining for one, and retreiving the controls for the drain at kessel and the JP audience chamber (jabba bit the dust again).  Well he forgets to drain twice and I retreive more ships (cause the controls are in my hand).  I beat him down, but time out<br/>
<br/>
Timed win by 22 <br/>
<br/>
Game Two <br/>
LS vs. Brian Garrison's Michael Girard's Drazin deck :-) <br/>
Just kidding it's his own version.  Well, the poor guy never had a chance.  I get the good obi to the carbonite chamber, drain, he loses drazin, I play out of commision...ball game!  I beat up what little he has left and free chewbacca.  TECH NOTE - most people will give a power two character because when they deploy drazin, noble sac comes out.  Well if you give them chewbacca, then you can prevent vader from showing up, trust me it works.<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 34 <br/>
<br/>
Game Three <br/>
DS vs. Robert Seymore's Friend's MWYHL <br/>
Great...just what I need.  So I start setting up and he comes down to beat up jabba again.  I have a recurring vader (got drazin set up early) for a couple turns trying to get rid of luke (stupid muppet at his hutt).  I finally got rid of him.  Well obi and luke come over to CC.  I get drazin, dannik,  prescott, vader, tarkin, jabba, fett, and lando at the prison and battle.  I lose vader and tarkin he loses both obi and luke w/stick.  I eat luke's soup and procede to get back into the game.  Here is where the tide turns.  I start with surface defense for the three effects.  Well he is down to about his last 12 or 13 force.  I am free and clear to drazin all I want.  So he starts putting back cards, I am guessing they are all 7's and you know what I was right.  I fear twice, once on my turn, once on his.  He needs to keep what he has in his hand so he loses off the top.  I play a CC sabacc, get a bionic hand.  I play a trooper sabacc, kill a card.  Well now he has no reserve deck in which to draw destiny for jedi test five.  so he waits for it to go off.  I prevent him from ever flipping and that is game.<br/>
<br/>
Full win by 20something. <br/>
<br/>
Game Four <br/>
LS vs. Shawn Dix's ISB <br/>
Well I have not faired well against Shawn in the past.  It all came down to a bad decision on my part.  I chose to beat down some ISB's instead of fortifying bespin (see Battle Plan).  He gets the planet, i have to pay to drain, he doesn't.  ball game.<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 20 something. <br/>
<br/>
It drops me bad.  So in conclusion, I need to beat Shawn Dix next week.  Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion and the tournament report from....the Who Got Game? Tournament.<br/>
