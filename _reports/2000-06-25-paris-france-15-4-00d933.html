Tournament Rapport from Paris Grand Slam( 37 players)<br/>
<br/>
Game 1	Opponent Jeróme Janitkzi rank 1655   World Finalist 1999(French)<br/>
Endor Operation with insert  Vs  Hidden Base with Mains<br/>
He started quit well and I had a poor start with just red cards on my hand. He played an insert on me in round 3 when he had 2 characters at E: Bunker (destiny 3+6). In my round a just activated 2 force when his insert hit me and made me lose 9 force. I tried to set up my system and deploy on the ground because he had played Battle Order but on round 5 another insert hit me once again on 9 force (3+3+6). I tried to deploy Tantive with Melas on his Death Star just to see him deploy DiPO and BiHT in his round and when he battled. His destinies 1+5 mine a 2 destiny. The rest of the game was his due to the fact that his inserts and battles had hurt me so much that there was not so much I could do. 	Full Loss by 25	 0(-25)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2	Opponent Sylvestre Gruszka rank 1580<br/>
Mains on Ground  Vs  Hunt Down in Space<br/>
I was in full control the whole game.<br/>
On round 1 I searched for my Sienar Fleet Systems, but I did not get my Wakeelmui on the table until half the game was played. He tried to spread out with Nabrun and I did not have any Tarkin´s order on my hand so he cancelled my Visage. But my drain on Kiffex, Tatooine and my Vader on the ground was too much for him. In the end of the game he tried to chase Vader on the ground with Chewbacca, EPP Han and EPP Leia. On the other site he had EPP Luke and EPP Obi, when Vader had nowhere to run then I took him back to my hand using the objectives gametext instead of getting a beatdown on the ground. Put him on E:Holotable and cleared that site. 			Full Win by 20	2(-5)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3	Opponent Eric Lienhard rank 1542<br/>
Hunt Down  Vs  Hidden Base with Mains<br/>
Once again a poor starting hand but the game was fair. He put up an early drain on H:Defensive P and T:Cantina. I retrieved with 2 OMDH but could not find my third. So I flipped my objective. On his round he probed the right system and I lost 8 force due to Security Precautions. I tried to stop his drains on T by going down and battle and manage to clear the surface from his characters. But my big mistake was when I put down new characters on the ground in form of Melas and Kal´Falnl C´ndros, Vader drained and then Elised him self to T. Choked Melas and Used Vaders saber and battled Kal´Falnl C´ndros. The battleloss left me with to little cards left to make something useful. So we just drained each other to the end of the game in which he won.		Full Loss by 18	2(-23)<br/>
<br/>
At this point I started to wonder of my selection of LS deck.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4	Opponent Marc Thery rank 1610<br/>
You can either profit.  Vs  Hunt Down in space<br/>
I started with Mara in J:Chamber. On round 1 I searched for Sienar found it, and saw Maras saber and deployed it on her and moved to T:Jabba´s Palace. On his third round he rescued Han making him retrieve all his lost force. With Battle Plan I play I had to pay 2 times to force drain before 2 Eloms and EPP Luke made an end of Maras drains. With Scramble on table I lost 8 force in the battle. On my round I deployed Wakeelmui and Sienar and started to retrieve on my Ties and the round after (choke)Vader with Tarkin in his T:Cantina. He deployed Master Luke and moved Arleil Schous + 1 Elom to the Cantina. In my turn I played Tatooine System, 4 Ties and First Strike and battled I tried to choke but missed my destiny was a 4 and he nothing(Vader+Tarkin). He forfeited Arleil. On his turn he deployed no new characters and started to draw cards. At that point I played my Masterful Move. In my round I battled him again choked Luke by tracking my Masterful M and battle against the Elom. And the game was mine. But not with so much only 11.	Full Win by 11	4(-12)<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 	Opponent Richard Andichon rank 1780<br/>
Hidden Base X-Wing swarm with insert  Vs  Hunt Down in Space<br/>
Both of us had no good hand so just players drew cards. He did not get any systems in his hand and I could not find my Wakeelmui(Sienar was on my starthand). In my round 3 I deployed a Dreadnought and 2 Ties on his Tatooine and started to drain. Next round 2 more Ties and a move to his Kashyyyk. He played X-Wings on his Rendezvous point and a Bothan Spy cancelled my Visage and then it went undercover + he deployed a droid with destiny 5 and finally an insert in my reserve deck. It hit me right away making me lose 8 force. And I just thought not another insert deck I am going to lose this. But I deployed another D + 2 Ties at Kiffex searched for my Monnok with Masterful Move and played it as lost because he had 18 cards on his hand and Yarna on the table. He lost 4 X-wings 2 X-wings Squadrons but most important for me he lost 2 inserts. The game went on he flipped and retrieved 8 cards on his X-wings making him retrieve his inserts again. I deployedWakeelmui+Sienar and 2 single Ties at to new systems and probed 4 systems in my deploy phase. I found the base and the game continued. When I got my Monnok on my hand again and he only had 3 cards on his hand once again I played it as lost and to my big luck he lost 2 inserts again. After that I drained and battled with first strike making him lose the game.  Full Win by 21	6(+9)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6	Opponent Maxime Kwasigroch rank 1579<br/>
ISB Everywhere Vs  Hidden Base with Mains<br/>
Finally a good startinghand with my HB, 2 locations on my hand looked for a system found Dagobah and Yoda´s Hut in my reservedeck. He played a fast ISB with Insurrection as the starting effect he looked for his docking bays. He flipped his objective in his second round.<br/>
I flipped my in my fourth round(all systems out). He tried to deploy at more sites and tried to keep my mains in my reserve deck by playing Scanning crew. But I played WAYTPOU at it got more and more expensive for him to play them. After a while I took control over his CC sites and he tried to probe and made it a successful probe. But at that point EPP Obi was standing against a lonely ISB agent and Twaas Khaa in the same situation. First battle with TK retrieve due to his First Strike. He lost his agent and he played no Ghhk. And then Obi battled, retrieved, cut and destiny making him lose the game. I did not manage to make a single retrieve with OMDH.			Full Win by 7	8(+16)<br/>
<br/>
In total it could have been worse. Overall we did not have a clue what kind of decks they would play in France. Our big mistake was that we did not have anything in our decks against insert.<br/>
 I finished in 8:th place and Jesper in 1:th place just 4 cards behind me.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Benoit Morel that made this weekend to such a nice one.<br/>
