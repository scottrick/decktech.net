<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Finally the report can come to fruition. Much as the flower spews forth the pollen, so shall my keyboard be the bearer of the events that transpired on the 26th. And then we'll laugh, make merry and have sex with the virgins.<br/>
Now that I've got your attention, I'll begin...<br/>
My dark deck has already been completed prior to the night before the tournament. I missed out on practice and I was disappointed with my LS profit from last week so I reflect on what would be strong in the current environment. I am thinking revolutions, Big Time. So I start talking to a memebr on here and we formulate a tight deck. I then spend 2 hours mulling it over, making my changes and modifying it to fit my area. Ironically the finished product didn't even have revos in it. It went instead for high destiny TR with dejeriks.<br/>
So the next day I arrive on the scene at the new store. the place is big, spacious, clean and smells of paint thinner...ahh. Definately a hobbie place that gets my approval. All of us players sit around waiting for everyone else. Oh wait, nobody else is coming. 9 players. Well it'll be fun anyway, despite the showing of only one scrub. Later right after our first game begins, a second scrub makes and appearance. Silently I thank the country scrubs come from for sending so many of thier population to America. Seriously though the idea of a nation of scrubs is kinda scary. That'd mean there's a whole race of inexperienced players out there...shudder. I should just get to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 VS Matt "Phobos" Berta (1733)<br/>
His LS Rops killer Vs My Endor Ops<br/>
<br/>
Matt is our state champ. I think I beat him once or twice we we were both starting out in SW and where as I went of to make decks that were fun but not winable, he went for the decks that win. I have since learned the error of my ways and am paying back the gaming community a little every week. He starts the DB's and I start with an Ephant Mon in the bunker and toss down Perimeter Patrol. Eloms won't be hurt much by it but I don't care. (Side note: Eloms are a spelling error to Elmo. Creepy...) He has got Cap. Han at the Home 1 db and his hand is getting big, like in Everlong by FooFighters video. I have a Mara in my hand and want to spy-slash him so bad but hold out because I sense a dreaded barrier. Instead I wait for the Catina, then I slap down the Emperor and a back up scrub, figuring I can snag a drain on the ground while my Rumors are getting me some footing in space. His eloms and a Luke come to visit the emperor, but he doesn't have enough to battle. I send down Mara, yup she got barriered, then a Vader in the hopes to even the odds. I leave the 3 there and await a battle. Sure enough devoid of eloms, he battles. I want to Have Luke Now but he senses by destiny adder. In the end I lose Mara and vader, he loses some furry things. Then he moves Captain Han, who has since been backed up by eloms to join Liea and moves the remaining eloms to join Luke. Luckily that means I can move the emperor to the docking bay he just vacated. Had he moved Liea instead, I would have lost this badly.<br/>
I drain a little, he drains a little. He has more life force but I am getting an edge. The comes Herc Seff to negate the Emperor's drains and Han and Liea move to Endor.(free DB transit my ass! The Db moving to should be incorporated no matter what free transit means. Damn rebel docking bays.) I send Vader down to battle (with my I have you now back in hand) He is barriered and I meekly retreat to the orbiting ships. (Vader can't move but Matt and I miss this) Matt then puts the two in the falcon and sends them up to chase Vader. Vader uses the force to Laterly Damage the Falcon and bossk along with a dreadnaught come to join the fun. Bossk is barriered. (Damn, where's my friggin grabber?) I battle and despite the effects of No Try, he senses my Have you now.  I lose a little, he loses Liea. (damn destiny) He decides to run to kassyyk to cancel the damage but has a bad draw. I can't find another space force to severely hurt him and we go time in a drain race but not before he utilzies a wind chime to retrieve 6.<br/>
Time loss by 10<br/>
The Good: Lateral Damage. When has it failed the DS?<br/>
The Bad: Eloms in the Cantina. Free DB Transit...to MY Endor!!!WTF?<br/>
The Ugly: Eloms. Furry birds on Steroids always scare me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: VS Noah "Not my Name" Singer (1651)<br/>
His Court VS The new DRTR (Sweet incorporating my initials into the deck title...new possibilities practically explode within my mind. Wait that's the speed...)<br/>
<br/>
Getting the jump from the get go is so nice with this deck. First turn Obi-wan deploys to the Court and chills. He then runs up against a girl named Jade. They battle. Noah's high desiny clears Obi and Mara too is lost in the struggle. But hey that's aight, Jedi Luke with his saber will take his place. Luke is kicking at the dust in the floor and getting some backup from a couple eloms and Orrimarrko when 4-lom, Jodo, Dengar and Bane show up. They battle and Dengar can't hit nothing. Noah's draws were bad, mine were better. I take out Dengar &amp; Jodo from attrition and lose orrimarko and a furry bird. My turn comes around and despite Jedi Luke's manners, he really was Sorry about the Mess. (Great title for a porno. BTW am I pulling a pop-up video thing here or what?) 4-lom was pretty sorry about it too and a swift battle with Liea and a Skywalkers sends Noah packing half his deck into the lost pile. Han shows up late game and helps those twins clean up tatoooine super fast.<br/>
Full Win by 39<br/>
Currently 2(+29)<br/>
The Good: Everything. My Draws.<br/>
The Bad: I lost Obi-wan to a high destiny.<br/>
The Ugly: Luke's Mess. If I have to go into detail about it, then you're better off not picturing it the way I am...<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: VS Matt Berta (Again!)<br/>
DS Hunt Down VS The DR-TR<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, this being a small turnout it makes sense I'd play Matt again. At least this will be the last time. eventully I will play Noah again and my third opponent twice. I played 6 games against 3 guys. It felt morelike practice than a turny but hey it's all good.<br/>
I first turn Terminate the Visage Transmission and start digging for activation. Where are those 6 other locations in this deck? For that matter where are the Lieas? oh they'll show up later. The emperor decides to visit the farm and he wants to do some farming but Obi-wan won't let him. Doh, my 5 Vs. his 6 destiny. That's an ouch. Ok well, Jedi Luke and saber worked for me last time. So I send down the boy to his farm and he scares off old and wrinkly (Hey, get out of my corn field, old man!) Next turn Luke decides to have a go at his fields but wait, that boy is thinking with his stomach. I try to sense it but Matt alters. i grab the alter but don't have a second sense to save luke from going missing. Damn. I don't even have characters or force in my hand to form a search party. I decide to send up the falcon and Han with a pilot to do some hurt to his dreadnaughts but Zuckus appears and my reacting spiral is sensed (I figured it would be.) I lose the ship and crew and spend the rest of my time trying to cover his drains. Damn, where is liea and my activation? Ahh, here she comes...and goes right into my lost pile along with 3 sites ff the top of reserve. Who shuffled this thing? i take a look around and smack the nearest Bith. Damn aliens can't even shuffle right. Matt drains me and Luke can project a skywlaker to block a drain on endor. Damn.<br/>
Full Loss by 30<br/>
Currently 2(-1)<br/>
The Good: Smacking the Bith next to me. It feels good to be a bully.<br/>
The Bad: Luke? Luuuuke??? Liea? Lieaaaaaa? Force? Forc---You get the idea.<br/>
The Ugly: Biths. They look like a penis. uhh. You know Bith is one letter shy of Bitch. So either I was smacking a penis or smackin up a Bitch... I hope the latter.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Vs Jeff Lavigne (1737)<br/>
Elom profit vs My Endor ops<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, mini-Lavigne. The game starts off right. I get my Endor Kasshyyk Boost and he starts losing early. Jedi Luke, Uh-oh and Boshuda set up camp and he loses force while I set up in space more along with developing a ground force (which doesn't really happen) He prepares to flip and I let him. But before he des he looks once, looks twice, counts the force and retrieves without paying for Secret Plans! Oh he loses the retrieval and I take the lead. It soon becomes a race and I make a mistake of letting him drain at the chamber, despite Bo Shuda! Dang. His profit appears to get a boost with tessek but some Imps tear into the eloms exacting revenge for thier similarities to elmo. I streak ahead and pull through.<br/>
Full Win by 8<br/>
Currently 4(+7)<br/>
The Good: Endor it's a big planet. Lavigne pulling a scrub mistake. I guess we know where he's from. Scrubvania.<br/>
The Bad: Dang I use to have Bo shda out all the time and I forgot about the drain stoppage. My bad.<br/>
The Ugly: Eloms don't get any uglier but there'sa reeason why their card picture shows so little of them. Thier hideous!<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: VS Noah Singer (yet again)<br/>
MWYHL Vs the Sanctuary Moon of Endor<br/>
<br/>
Early I was thinking about packing DS dagobah just to screw MWYHL but then found out the obj. prevents coversion. Damn. Oh well I guess I'll go back to basics. Second turn I drain for 4 at kashyyyk. Noah laughs and loses 2. No seriously, dude. Rumors. He does a double take and apologizes. I won't get another big drain as the next turn he completes test 1 but I continue to chip away at his life force. He decides to assign Cap. Han to the falcon and goes up against some of my space. I let him and he loses 2 force. I was saved from his destiyn draw of 1 and continue to drain, as well as building my fleet. The next turn he decides to stop by Endor with the falcon again. I grin, Lateral Damage, drop the fleet, battle and cause heavy damage. Noah loses a load of cards and relies on jedi luke to do his thing on Endor. Igar, tempest 1, 4-Lom and vader say otherwise. Vader gets clashed, 4-lom is hit and Noah loses a scrub. he decides he'll leave endor, then come back and battle but I have You now and Vader make destiny 7 and I finsish the last of his resistence, winning the game.<br/>
Full win by 28<br/>
Currently 6 (+35)<br/>
The Good: Must I point out the lateral damage again? Of course, it never gets enough praise.<br/>
The Bad: Test 1...wait, it really didn't hurt, just slowed me down.<br/>
The Ugly: Yoda. I hate to say it but wrinkly green muppets don't get chicks. Well maybe if he pays 'em or they're the chicks that are into old men...hmm (note to self: start to use Yoda-inverted speach around all my lady friends.)<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Vs Jeff Lavigne (yup, again.)<br/>
His DS2 Construction Vs the DR-TR<br/>
<br/>
Well at least me and Jeff play quick. We finsihed our last game in ten minutes even though it was a close game. He decides he'll build the Death Star, I decide I'll build activation and drain at the Death Star. Who'll mess with Super Falcon? I send the falcon in and replace it with the Liberty and Wedge at the system. Space force 5 comes down and beats up wedge and his ship. But the Bacta tank aids Wedge and Liberty is too cool so it stays in my life force. He then sends that spy Mara to scope out ben's hut. I can't afford to lose 4 a turn so I send down a party of my own. He wisely does not hit obi-wan and I leave the jedi alone and toss Wedge to the tank. A pounding happens severly as Blizzard 2 and tarkin visit vader at the hut. Ben gets smacked and I lose 17. Ouch. but better for me as Ben can now be deployed to the forest, Projection to the hut, orrimarko and crew to Endor DB. I blow up the Death Star in a hail of fire and the super falcon escapes to Endor to be greeted not by the Alliance but by some friggin Imps! He decides my three destiny to his raw power is more than enough. So he battles. Spiral reacts and Skywalkers is back and better to have. 5 destinies cuts his fleet in half with 20 attrition. I lose Liea to the tank and next turn put her at the farm. His entire crew is stuck on tatooine and I had a glimpse at his deck. No nabruns. My ground crew is draining for 3 and I divide my space crew to block drains and chase imps as well as drain for 2. It becomes clear and the mini-Lavigne pulls a manly riot and demands i battle his scrub with my elmo/Orrimarko pack. I can only comply.<br/>
Full win by 6<br/>
Ending at 8 (+41)<br/>
The Good: Tell me blowing up the Death Star isn't good and I'll smack you like a little Bith. Take that anyway you want.<br/>
The Bad: Ben having to get beat down for 17 force. It ended up being better for me but it hurt.<br/>
The Ugly: Orrimarrko. His action figure was called Prune Face. How facist is that? I hate to bag on my own guy Dressellians are tight but that eye badge really doesn't do much for you guy. I mean in a galaxy of technology and nobody will get this guy a glass eye? WTF?<br/>
<br/>
So the tournament ends and I come in 4th, right below Tim Guzman, Kris Lavigne and Matt Berta, who despite 2 timed wins and a loss won due to his high differential. And what a loss his one loss was. Speeders tore into Mara and kris drew a 7 to convert Vader, ending the game. I can only applaud a game like that.<br/>
Props to Chris Hines for picking a sweet spot to play cards. I dig the carpet too.<br/>
Not so pros to Kris for leaving mamba wrappers on the carpet. Mothatron strikes again.<br/>
And so that's that. I will be soon posting my DS deck and I encourage ya'll to review. i'd like to thank Jeebs for his ehlp on my LS and I'd like to shame the devil. Shame on you devil. Bad devil, bad!<br/>
