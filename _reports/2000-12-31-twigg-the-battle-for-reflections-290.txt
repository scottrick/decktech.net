<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well, the Gamers Guild in Clifton Park NY was named the Retailer of the year, as well as home of the 2000 World Champ, 2000 World Team Champs, and  NY’s SW and YJ State Champs.  With the help of my dad (biggest twigg - aka Marty) we got maad support, even reflections 2.  Now, at the bottom of the TR will be some spoilers, so enjoy, but read the TR as well!!!!<br>

<br>
&lt;i&gt; Decks: &lt;/i&gt;<br>
&lt;b&gt; Light-&lt;/b&gt; EBO, Baraguains, and Missles...<br>
&lt;b&gt; Dark-&lt;/b&gt; Hunt Down Surprise!<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 1 Light vs Todd Schnitzer’s Skum<br>
<br>
I set up EBO pretty fast, and he sets up his skum drains.  The baraguians are retrieving machines and my missles are bouncing in and out of my lost pile.  Meanwhile my b wings are holding space with barriers in hand... and he plays no ships.  Mid late game I’m losing virtually no force and draining for 9 in space (@ yavin, hoth, and sullust).  A late surprise assault did him in.  FW +31<br>
<br>
2 (+31)<br>
<br>
Good - baraguains working like a charm and him missing a critical hidden weapons!<br>
<br>
Bad - none<br>
<br>
Ugly - him not playing ANY space<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2 Dark vs Jonny Chu’s X-Wing Swarm<br>
<br>
Well Hunt Down Surprise is the Twigg Hunt Down Odds deck - o - death.  Undefeated and just a machine to handle.  Only playing 9 charachters, my red selection is the best the dark side has to offer.  Ok against Chu he ditched insights for honor, and I was very happy ;-).  Vader, Empy and and Terk Mor destiny draw GAVE AWAY the odds.  Jon looked at me and said CRAP!  In space he is draining me and I set up my mega odds and insert.  Meanwhile I’m draiing for 1 or 2, he’s canceling w/ rebel fleet.  He activates, the odds never pops.  So he retrieves with 6 wings on the table to get his insights back, (nice play!)  So with a little luk, he gets insights on the table w/o an insert popping at all.  Brian is very sad (especially when i could have dropped coward that turn and didn’t!!!!).  So I set up my dueling destinies and I’m waiting for the mains, since visage is hurting him.  The game is close by this point, each with like 15-20 life left.  He drains me at 3 systems in space (still unflipped) and i loose 1 at corlag, 1 at kessel, and the counter assault his endor drain for 16 damage!!!  A few turns later, Visage ends the game.  FW +19<br>
<br>
4 (+50)<br>
<br>
Good - Beating the best Xwing deck on the planet<br>
<br/>
Bad - Odds NOT WORKING<br/>
<br/>
Ugly - Endor will never be the same...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Light vs Art Wright’s Hunt Down Duel<br/>
<br/>
Art had just beaten Chris, so I had to get revenge. (Last week Art beat Matt "The World" Sokol).  But I had faith in my light.  He sets up dockingbays and such and I get ebo out, V E R Y slowly...  Im taking early Visage damage, termintate it once.  He gets it back, senses my second trans, but I get him with the 3rd.  ;-)  Then Vader and Dengar and Mara w/ stik invade Hoth, and He’s looking to cancel my ebo.  Fig Dan and Baraguians are keeping me in the game with lots of retrieval despite Secret Plans on the table.  In space I get drains off and Battle Order is keeping him at bay.  But then he gets janus to a db and gets around order.  I never deployed Luke or Obi in fear of the duel.  No dueling protection.  Just big destinies.  So I pay to drain, and start to hammer away at him in space w/ weapons and Huge destinies.  Late game Boush kills Mara and Obi slaughters Janus to finish the game off.  FW +23<br/>
<br/>
6 (+73)<br/>
<br/>
Good - Beating an up and comming player and dammit i love those b wings.<br/>
<br/>
Bad - Paying for all my drains slowed me down.  Not getting Ebo fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
Ugly - r e t r i e v a l . . . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Dark vs Dan Sokol’s Y4 Main’s<br/>
<br/>
Dan saw my game w/ chu and knew inserts were comming.  So I figured he’d start insights.  He didn’t.  So I charged right fo the inserts, only popping once, but got him for 7.  Visage ate away at us both and a timely placement of Battle PLan maid the visage damage big.  Dan is returning to the game from a small haitus of having a life! and learned an important sw lesson all over again.  DONT LOOSE OFF THE TOP.  When Kessel flopped into his lost pile, we each knew the game shifted to my favor.  Vader found his way to Obi and Dueled him out of the game.  After counting about 4 ships that he lost, i fugured i’d be in the clear so I dropped caridia with zuck in mist hunter and then, the executor.  Visgae ate away some more and in the end, the odds and duel made the difference.  FW +8<br/>
<br/>
8 (+81)<br/>
<br/>
Good - Dueling and winning... Dan is a good player.<br/>
<br/>
Bad - PLaying a tight game w/ a friend isn’t always ez...<br/>
<br/>
Ugly - Kessel off the top.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Light vs Mike Panayotou’s Big Blue Space<br/>
<br/>
I get ebo, VERY fast.  Empy hits the db, and starships appear in space.  We play cat n’ mouse a bit, while a bwing packin a missle drains for 2 at alderaan for the entire game, (woo-hoo!).  The baraguians are making his drains do me no damage, and we chase each other around.  I blow up the Devastator and a Dreadnaught (props to mike, we had a miscommunication and he was kool about me fixing the mistake.  Pure sportsmanship... i hooked him up w/ a R1 pack...)  In late game he drops EPP vader to the 4th marker to solidfy decree.  Luckily Epp Obi, Luke and Boush were there to rid of the sith and make mike loose 10 force as well.  A late shuffle at Alderaan and the death star put it away for my bwing deck of death!!!!  FW +31<br/>
<br/>
10 (+112)<br/>
<br/>
Good - Ebo fast is good.  I also was able to beat a really good space deck!<br/>
<br/>
Bad - The miscommunication...<br/>
<br/>
Ugly - once again... r e t r i e v a l!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;i&gt;<br/>
So at this point the tourney is a lock, I win, woo-hoo!!  And so I’m guaranteed some of the good stuff, and the tourney was going fine.  But i realized I hadn’t played someone yet, and well, I was due...<br/>
&lt;/i&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Little Twigg’s Y4 Main’s<br/>
<br/>
Well let me start off by saying this game was horrible!!!! (chris is smiling over my shoulder as I type this!!!)  He knew my tricks, he knew my secrets, and he knew my deck card for card.  Well needless to say, no odds, no nothing.  I tried the duling thing but Obi and Luke wussed out and sat at the Home One DB ALL GAME!!!.  During the game the emperor got his @#$% kicked and the executor was dropped like a bad habit.  Well hmm... REALLY not much to tell.  We chased each other around and, I lost!  FL -10<br/>
<br/>
10 (+102)<br/>
<br/>
Good - NONE<br/>
<br/>
Bad - No odds, no dueling...<br/>
<br/>
Ugly - I LOST BECAUSE OF THE RULES!!!  HOME ONE DB IS A GAY CARD.  WHY CANT I MOVE THERE (terok mor and a pof occupied it do I could try and move vader over, but noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...)<br/>
<br/>
