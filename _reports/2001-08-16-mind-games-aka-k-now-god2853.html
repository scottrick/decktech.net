<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">another tournament at mind games, run by yours truly! i still havent gotten prize support from decipher, so props go to everyone who showed up for no prize support.<br/>
<br/>
so im sittin at mind games around 300, trying to figure out what the heck to play. i took my closed EPI dark deck (senate/if the trace was correct) and tried to make it good for constructed. after a half hour of sleeving/desleeving, i give up and decide to make phobos podracing/hologram/hunt down. light side, i decide to play podracing profit. id been toying with it since the denver open when i saw bigfatcoolguywhosenameicantremeber playing it. shockingly enuf, it is very very similar to the podprofit deck in the top ten.<br/>
<br/>
ten people show up, an epic turnout for slc. after about 5 minutes of me screamin tryin to get people to fill out the damn command cards, we get started.<br/>
<br/>
GAME ONE.<br/>
my ls vs greg ashbys maulish hunt down.<br/>
greg is always fun to play cuz he is so laid back. he starts the destiny 5 podracer (?!) and starts to race. early game is quite boring, i win the race and TT visage. he puts vader w/ls at ds db and i put luke w/ls in front of him. i have run whiny @#$% run, courage and resilience in my hand. he duels, wins and i resilience. this is the first time he has seen that card, and he is in shock. i gently assure him that yeah, it is that good. then we fight, we cut each other and i lose a couple. he gets vader to the palace and i stick some bush in vaders face. i spring han w/chewie protector,luke w/ls and ax lando. greg deploys maul w/ls and mara w/ls to the audience chamber and moves vader over. i break leias cover and move her to the arena for profit damage. my chamber crew then play tag w/the ds beater crew, me running back and forth between the ac and palace. at this point, it is obvious that i will drain him out,so i try to track for on the edge. i try trackin from the top instead of the bottom like i normally do, and i fuk it up. luke dies. aint no thang tho, cuz i finally i get quigon w/ls and first strike. i fight w/lando,han,chewie and qui. i exclude mara, cut both jedi, too close for comfort maul, etc etc and kill him w/battle damage.<br/>
FW +18<br/>
props: greg for bein cool to play even when hes gettin worked by profit.<br/>
slops: luke falling over the edge. dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
GAME TOO.<br/>
my ds vs zachs sorta hidden mains.<br/>
zach starts a horde of combo effects. at this point im praying he is flippin hb, cuz i have maul, his ship and sec precautions in my opening hand. i get the holotable out and race (he has no racer). he tries to TT, but i have holonet. he deploys melas to the home1 db. i get greedy and deploy mara there. he barriers, so i have to back her up w/vader w/ls. on his turn he drops obi (no circle)and jedi luke(no obsession). he fights, i cut luke, he cuts vader, obi misses mara, he cleans me off the db and loses melas for the phat dstiny i drew. on my next turn i win the podrace, retrieve my lost pile and watch his other jedi luke go to tthe lost pile. so now that the game is firmly in my grasp, i lose to visage off the top. vader w/ls. duh. his turn, he drains me for 1, lose another to visage. he draws an ooc. 1 in 3 chance to get vader. if he does, it will be a long game. he does. lucky mother@#$%er. so i settle in and start draining at the holotable. i get the uc spy droid to quigons loc to block the drain, i get visage goin again and squeak out the win by 6. jeez.<br/>
FW +24<br/>
props: winning w/o vader.<br/>
slops: having to win w/o vader.<br/>
<br/>
GAME THREE<br/>
my ds vs jakes rtp.<br/>
i love playin jake. he beat me at states, so i had to get him back. he starts echo base garrison. i have no alter but i am praying for an emperor in my opening hand ( i have 3). yay! i got one. i drop him to the yavin 4 db (since rtp gives away so much force). we both lose one from visage and i say go. after i recirculate, i go get a force lightning. jake sets up the lift tube hoo ha, and gets 8d8 from reserve and plops him in front of the emperor. i zap him. jake is like "really?" and i say yeah, droids are ability zero. and so 8d8 begins to get buried in the lost pile. muahahah. we race w/some varied shenanigans, but i win in the end. i had some fairly low destinies stacked on my racer, so they go to the top of my reserve deck at the end of my turn ( i had activated/drawn everything). i draw some and finally get a circle and focused. in my brightness and wisdom, i try to circle obi. we tie cuz im an idiot, despite drawing an extra destiny. duh. at any rate, im winning the drain/survive visage damage race, so i sit back and win by 8.<br/>
FW +32<br/>
props: teaching 8d8 a lesson. hee hee.<br/>
slops: not circling obi. duh, i suck.<br/>
<br/>
GAME FO.<br/>
my ls vs caseys maulish hunt down.<br/>
this game was horrible. i mean it. i had beaten casey earlier this week w/it, and at the time i said "well, i beat you tonite, but ill lose on wednesday." nobody told me i am a prophet. jeez. anyways, i get monnocked 2nd turn used, lose quigon,i did it, and lando w/ax, i lose the race, fail to hack choke vader like 5 different times, qui gon loses the duel to maul, and im pretty sure luke gets turned to end the game. ugh. however, if nathan loses big, casey has a good chance of taking first, so i let him put cards back in his deck before i draw up. he is rated way higher than me, so i wont hurt me too bad.<br/>
FL -3.<br/>
props: caseys deck for being superior to mine.<br/>
slops: my epp guys for never hitting vader, despite having really good destiny.<br/>
<br/>
nathan ends up wiping the floor with jason to win the tournament undefeated at like +100 or some @#$%. im runnin the store, and its like 5 till 10. im sposed to go to a movie w/my girlfriend at 1000 down the street. after i finally kick everyone out at like 1015, i go over to the theater. the fukin doors are locked. i pound and scream, to no avail. so star wars costs me yet again. star wars strikes back, lol.<br/>
