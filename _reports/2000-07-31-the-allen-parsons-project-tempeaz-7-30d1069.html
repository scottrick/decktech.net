<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So I haven't written in awhile.  I wanted to wait and see what DSII brought to the tournament scene.  I went to Origins, did "alright", my buddy Joe Alread won so that was cool.  We did some Older Code stuff and that was neat.  I'll be going to Gencon, and yes Mark...I will have my "tech" outfit on yet again.<br/>
<br/>
So I go to this tournament on Sunday, Scot Vales is the director and the scoring "for extra prize support" is a scenario type thingy.  I didn't build these, but I still did well cause I brought good decks.<br/>
<br/>
DS - The Allen Parsons Project - Thats right, it's my eeeevvviiilll plan *pinky smirk*.  It starts Endor ops, pulls Moff Girard, DSII, and Perimeter Patrol.  It sets up in three turns guarenteed, and less if you get sectors in your opening hand.  The rest is just good beats.<br/>
<br/>
LS - EBO - My old ebo/spy deck, with DSII stuff added (mainly wedge/ship).  I use Ishi Tibs/Bothan Spys to set up ebo.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1  "The Project" vs. Aaron McCormick's LS Tatooine stuff <br/>
He goes Lando via strike planning, show you lando to get the falcon.  Great, so I stall with two ships at DSII for two turns.  Then drop at the Tatooine system and remind him of the force loss he'll be taking.  So he drops General Han on the falcon and moves to tatooine.  At the tatooine system I have a dreadnought, ozzel, the emp's shield/sword.  I initiate, I retreive one, you lose one.  I draw two destinies.  He's like why do you get two, I'm like, read the text on the second DSII sector The Capacitators.  He's like damn, ok, I'll lost both characters.  I lose on of the tie squads.  Next couple turns is him drawing and me draining/TTO damage.  then I drop vader/stick to a random tatooine site, Tempest one/Igar to a different one, and the Emperor to the Forest clearing on endor.  Well, his jaw drops and tries to chase to no avail.<br/>
FW by +20something<br/>
<br/>
Highs - That's Things Operational by Third turn <br/>
Lows - Early ships to DSII<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 EBO vs. Andrew Emmott's SYCFA "Big Blue"<br/>
I set up by fourth turn, but the problem is he has battle plan and something special planned out and that is costing me a lot of force.  He is guarding the death star docking bay with igar/tempest one.  I get ballsy and throw an ishi tib w/two xwing back up to the north ridge.  Phew, now I can drain.  He has three/four ships out chasing my starfighters around.  I pick and choose my battles.  The turning point in the game is where we are both draining for a few and he has the executor, two mofos, the chimarea, and the dominator at Hoth.  I have the liberty, three xwings, capt han/falcon, and gold leader in gold one.  well I drop a lone bothan to the ds war room (he has no cards in hand).  His turn we still sit at hoth (he is afraid of out of nowhere???) and he moves igar to the war room.  This is my chance, I recirculate a destiny 5 and activate on my turn.  I drop two bothans to tempest one, initiate, and draw the five, then move the lone one in front of igar to join their buddies.  well now he doesn't have battle order fulfilled so he has to pay to drain.  I eventually fight him and draw two destiny fives (I was tracking 7's but he wouldn't battle me) and dropped some of that tonage from hoth.<br/>
FW +8<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Beating on Tempest one with two bothans<br/>
Lows - having to face bigger ships<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 "The Project" vs. Ben Wehunt's Tatooine stuff<br/>
SEE GAME TWO...it's the exact same thing.<br/>
FW +20something<br/>
Highs - The deck is a MACHINE!!!!<br/>
Lows - Stupid Calrissian and his stupid ship.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 EBO vs. Felipe's Court deck<br/>
First turn Boushh to the AC covered the drain and me having to have a character on tatooine.  He just stacked musicians in the AC all game.  I drained in space for a bunch.<br/>
FW +30something<br/>
Highs - Draining for 12 in space<br/>
Lows - not very interactive.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 "The Project" vs. Dan McGrath's Profit deck<br/>
Well Dan just moved here to Phoenix from Joe Alread's neck of the woods in the midwest.  I reminded him that playing styles out here are different then he is used to, he said he heard about that somewhere.  I start Mara in the AC (mental note, add miiyoom onith to deck).  I set up third turn, back up mara with Vader/stick, tarkin, and ig-88.  He tries to knock me out of the AC with some characters, but they get captured, shot, canceled...you know the drill.  This game saw me draining for a good amount in space with some good ships and TTOing at Sullest for two a turn.  He played Honor of the Jedi, I ghawfed at it, considering I was occupying like four/five battlegrounds at the time. :-)<br/>
FW +20something<br/>
Highs - Playing someone new...and of course...THE MACHINE<br/>
Lows - beating someone new, I hope i didn't discourage him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 EBO vs. Dan McGrath's Hunt Down Executor deck<br/>
I set up fourth turn and got a bothan/undercover to cancel visage.  He drops the executor hoth with some mofos, I go and battle, make him lose some mofos and run away.  Next turn I come back with Home one, Liberty, Wedge/ship, Gold leader in Gold one, and some xwings.  We scrimmage, I lose the liberty to the used pile he loses some stuff.  I go Capt.han/falcon, he goes crap.  I clear away some more rubble.  He can't run away, the parsec is too far.  Turn after, I go BOOM!!!!!!! the executor goes, my bothan, five sites, and one emperor (at the docking bay for activation) go buh bye.  I drain him out.<br/>
Highs - Blowing the crap out of Das Boot.<br/>
Lows - beating on Dan McGrath again.<br/>
<br/>
well I got first, no one was ahead of me with their modified scenario points. So I took the tournament, not to many ratings points though.<br/>
