<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok there was this tournament right and it was run by kev the td with the vd at australia on collins. Now i havent taken notes so dont blame me if its short cause i didnt plan on writing one and now im bored so im doing it cause.<br/>
<br/>
Pre tourny stuff:<br/>
Well I am thinking what to play so i post my bastardized cct to see what people think and then I think of some tech to make ral ops playable since i only ever used a stupid version and now im not a scrub so I know how to play it.  So I call Luca and tell him my plans and then over the phone we alter it so bad it becomes a crazy deck and he wants me to keep the tech secret so I havent posted it but im sure someone out there can figure it out ;) &lt;--is this symbol geeky or what??? So for dark I have my Ralops deck which is atsts and tramples oh and this is the first tourny where i used my tramples!!! yay me!!! For light i use my bastardized throne room mains and modify it a bit so it has sites to drain at.  Any way on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My light Vs bye?<br/>
Wtf i get stooged completly with the bye of course I start the norm and sack insights to get honor and for the first 400  turns he does nothing so I win by 1. What a close game phew.<br/>
The good: 2 victory points<br/>
The Bad: the bye<br/>
the ugly: Watching sir robbo’s and donald’s game<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Ralops Vs i think his name is steve or micheal? aitc(jawas).<br/>
Well I flip turn 2 so that means he doesnt have any drains anywhere even though he had tessek out.  He drops all these effects to make his jawas forfiet nine and starts noble sacrificing them to get force back. I drop vader for a suicide run and the battle destiny of 6 + 4 with ralops takes out a total of three jawas. I drop the at-st and sim. Use trample and squish jawa. Janus up another trample and squish more.  The rest of the game is the same and I keep suiciding stuff and retriving with first strike and I win by 31.<br/>
The Good: No ounee ta, flipping turn two<br/>
The bad: No ounee ta, I wanted to see how my deck works against it with my tech and he didnt have it.<br/>
The Ugly: Trample, After his effort to get jawas to forfiet nine they were useless cause i stepped on ’em<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My ralops Vs Lee Pullens Profit<br/>
Well this game was the same and i got ralops flipped turn 3 he got his han released turn 2 and he got me a couple of cards with profit damage and his drain of 2 until i flipped and set up decree. After that I was draining for like four a turn in space and ground. I put a choke vader down to kill ben and han. Vader strangles han ben bites it. he flips back and cant do anything of course i forgot to get 2 back and him lose two doh. he comes to me with epp leia and master luke I react and luke goes.<br/>
I fill up the site with a couple of guys and hit luke for that and a bit more eventually draining and winning by something like 24.<br/>
The good: No space from him means im getting decree and battle order/plan easy!!, No ounee ta<br/>
The bad:Flipping turn three and taking damage from a force drain, No ounee ta<br/>
The ugly:Visage as my destiny plus ralops bonus equals 1 destiny of 11!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My ls VS geelong kids Court<br/>
I get it all set up and put obi and mirax at a tat site so I dont lose force and then he comes down with a bounty and snoova and jodo with tra@#$%s stun rifle. He battles captures obi. so now hes like power ten and a destiny to my two so I’ll take one destiny’s damage + 1 but no he decides that capturing is more fun so he uses the rifle and grabs her stays at the site I come down with luke, the lars, leia and another scrub or something clear the site rescue the crew and then i drop like han chewie and take over the audience chamber. I cycle a throw me another charge and dont find a automated weapon so I almost cry.  I then use on/off the edge and harvest once and I have no lost pile I drain him out and get him for 38<br/>
The good: Not having to bother tracking<br/>
The bad: low destiny draws<br/>
The ugly: the bruses this kid put on his friends leg what a kunt!<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My ls vs Rods hd<br/>
well i know his playing odds so I dont start yisyw cause i know he will whinge even though thats my normal start with the new version.  So i play bad and let him win by 26<br/>
The good bad and ugly: couldnt even be bothered with my light deck anyway we played this game again after as a friendly and I beat him!<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My ralops vs rods ebox<br/>
Well ralops kills ebo and thats what happened but i played a little bad and only won by 14 but basically what happened was thrawn  in chimera took out about ten x wings single handedly he couldnt draw more than 5 attrition so it always stayed cause I lost damage from my hand. He tried to use out of nowhere but I had imp command in my hand and laffed! <br/>
I copped a drain of like two or something but it was too little too late.<br/>
The good: Thrawn in chimera = too good. no ounee ta no characters?<br/>
The bad: no ounee ta,not botherin to get decree working<br/>
The ugly: i drew a 6 and a 7 as my destiny plus 4 and he didnt have immunity that turn so he lost five x wings!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So yeah robbo wins the tourny me rod and robbo each go 5-1 and my diff is the same as rods so that made me third and him second cause i lost to him the first time round (that and the fact the software from decipher is crap) so I did get stooged from the bye cause i woulda won and got some points like even 1 woulda put me second. but revenge was there cause in the r2 packs rod got (and some other players) there was no foil so :P(another geeky symbol).<br/>
