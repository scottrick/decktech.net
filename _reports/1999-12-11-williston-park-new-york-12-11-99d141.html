<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, this was going to be my very first tournament. I was very excited but my decks were horrible. My Tosche Mains deck had 1 Obi. I got there about an hour early and the first thing I did was buy a pack of ECC. I got the IG-88, Dengar in Punishing One, Crush the Rebellion one. Then I traded Star Destroyer!, Threepio, Vader's Lightsaber, Captain Han (I pulled it in one of my boosters from the ECC pack), Thunderflare, T-47 Battle Formation, my IG-88 with Riot Gun, and Dengar in Punishing One. I picked up much needed Blizzard 2, Orrimaarko, Taempest Scout 6, 2 EPP Obi's, and a Coruscant Imperial Square. Eight players showed up for the tournament. I got matched up in my 1st game shortly with Matt Ehrhart.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My ISB/IAO Vs. Matt's X-wing Hidden Base:<br/>
I started with Coruscant: Imperial Square and IAO. I flipped 2nd turn. Amazingly, none of the players who attended this tournament were aware of ISB/IAO. Matt told me I needed 4 ISB agents but I showed him ISB text and nobody knew that Snowtrooper Officers were ISB agents. I got a decent drain going for about 2 turns until he got Rebel Fleet out and flipped. I never drew any of my 4 Dreadnaughts. He got out Draw Their Fire and beatdown on some of my ISB guys at Hoth Docking Bay. I couldn't use Ghhhk because of Draw Their Fire. Then he just cancelled my drains at the rest of the game while draining me for about 7 or 8 a turn. <br/>
Full loss 0(-29)<br/>
Highlights: Flipping 2nd turn and having everyone not believing that controlling 2 Rebel Base locations flipped objective<br/>
Lowlights: Too many to say<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Tosche Mains Vs. ?'s Endor Operations<br/>
I got out Obi turn 1 to Hut and moved him over. I deployed some ability 2 Rebels to that site. I drain for 1 my next turn. Then he deploys Blizzard 2 with DS-61-3, Tempest 1 with DS-61-4, Blizzard Walker with Officer Evax. He beat down but Insurrection was out so it wasn't so bad. He moved them over to Hut. He also deployed U-3PO to Tosche Station so I couldn't drain there. Then on Endor I deployed some ability 2 guys to Ancient Forest and Backdoor but there were adjacent to Forest which he had Expand the Empire'd. He fought me with some scout walkers and I lose. I get Orrimaarko out to Backdoor with Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith. I battle and win and he loses 2 for Orrimaarko's text. Then he gets Grand Moff Tarkin to Backdoor and he beats down on my lone guy. Then he gets Presence of the Force to Hut and he's draining like 6 a turn. All this time I deployed 2 Medium Bulk Freighters and Tantive to Endor and he had Avenger, Devstator, and a pilot on one of them. He wins. I lose by 21.<br/>
Full loss 0(-50)<br/>
Highlights: Not letting him flip<br/>
Lowlights: Getting beatdown by walkers on Tatooine <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Tosche Mains Vs. Bill's Carbon Freezing<br/>
This was by far my worst loss. He starts All Wrapped Up and I give him Beezer to start. He get Djas Puhr with Dengar's Modified Riot Gun or something and Binders. I send Commander Vanden Willard and Luitenant Greeve out to Security Tower. He uses Riot Gun to capture and uses All Wrapped Up to capture Greeve and he's got 3 captives now and moves to Carbonite Chamber. I get Tantive IV and a Medium Bulk Freighter with Hobbie in it to Bespin. I also deploy Back Door. He gets ome Ugnaughts out and Freezes 2 of the captives in one turn so I lose 16. Then he gets EPP Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin to Back Door. I send EPP Luke on Puhr and 3 Ugnaughts but I miss Puhr and captures Luke.  He sends a Lambda Shuttle and a Bossk in Hound's Tooth to Bespin but I win. His turn, he freezes Luke! Then he deploys Interrogation Room and a Death Squadron Star Destroyer. He moves his guys over to Interrogation Room. I deploy another Medium Bulk Freighter to Bespin and battle again. I win again but his next turn he drained for 15 from the 4 unique Rebel captives at Interrogation Room! I lost by 21 again.<br/>
Full loss 0(-71)<br/>
Highlights: Controlling Space<br/>
Lowlights: Having all my guys including Luke get captured and frozen, being drained by 15, and no getting an Obi out.<br/>
<br/>
Now a really funny thing happened. In the game right next to me, this kid drained or something with 10 characters. Tthen his opponent played Suprise Assault and drew 70. The kid had to lose 48! That sure beat me getting drained by 15.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My ISB/IAO Vs. Morgan's B-wing/Corvette/Main deck or something<br/>
I start my usual and he starts Hut and gets Cantina from Careful Planning. I flip second turn again and once again have an opponent who didn't know ISB/IAO combo or know that Snowtrooper Officers were ISB agents. I get alot of ISB guys out and spread and drain. I'm making him lose 6 or 7 to drains for like 4 or 5 turns. I had a few battles. I had a ISB dude at Cantina with Brangus Glee and he dropped EPP Han, ECC Lando, and EPP Leia. He beatdown so I lost alot. He deployed a B-wing and Corvette to Kessel and had some ships at Kiffex. At Kessel, I deployed 2 Dreadnaughts, one with DS-61-4 on it and beatdown. I also deployed Blizzard 2 with Bossk and Blizzard Scout 1 and battled at Hut where he had Chewbacca and EPP Obi I think. I reacted with Tempest Scout 6 and won. At Port Town District I also deployed Tempest 1 with Igar and beatdown EPP Luke. I just drained him out. I win my first tournament game by 8.<br/>
Full Win 2(-63)<br/>
Highlights: Having another opponents who never heard of IAO/ISB and didn't know Snowtrooper Officers were ISB agents, winning my 1st tourney game, and winning alot of battles.<br/>
Lowlights: None<br/>
<br/>
Well I finished 7th out of 8. The kid who got Suprise Assault'd came last. Matt Ehrhart won. In prize support, I got Noble Sacrifice, Cantina, Ds-61-3, 2 Corvettes, and an Alter. At the end I traded a Wokling, Docking and Repair Facilities, an R2-D2, a Deactivate the Shield Generator, and Haven for a Dreadnaught, Tatooine Celebration, Lateral Damage, General McQuarrie, and another Noble Sacrifice. It was a great tournament for my first time. I guess my ISB deck wasn't something played alot in my area.  </font></td>
