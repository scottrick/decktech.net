<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Ah, Oklahoma.  Land of short red hills, casinos in the middle of nowhere, and nice card shop owners.  I didn't originally plan on going to this, but Mike called me personally to ask if I wanted to go, and I didn't really have anything else serious happening that weekend, so I said sure.  We knew we'd have at least 12 from Texas: Me, Michael Richards, Jim Sharp, Jacob Mayer and Cole Mayer from DFW; JW Millet and Bob... I mean Toby Gibbs from Team Stephenville;  and Thomas Whaley, Olaf Schroeder, Thomas Schroeder, Matthew Perry, and Christopher Perry from the Houston area.  We were expecting somewhere around 5 Oklahoma peeps, but only Stanton Lackey "had the guts" to come.  Mike, Jim, Thomas, JW, Toby and I met up at Mike's place around 8:30.  I rode with JW and Toby to even out the gas money, though this meant I had to crawl into the back of his 2-door and lay across it (crawling in/out was much more uncomfortable than laying there, despite the car being extremely vertically challenged).  We were running a little behind schedule, got somewhat lost in Edmond trying to find the place, and were desperate to eat before embarking on a full state tournament without a break, so we stopped at Wendy's anyway and walked in 50-60 minutes late as if it were nothing (well... it's a Mike Richards tournament, so...).<br>
<br>
As far as the decks I brought, I saw no reason to change my DS (EO Space/SDs), since it was 8-1 and I fixed the problems exposed in the 1 loss.  For the LS, I basically flipped a bunch of coins to choose between like 6 decks I was considering, and I ended up with MBO simply because it looked fun, and I was expecting a lot of SYCFA considering the spoiler with "Alderaan (Blown Away)" might make people nervous about playing it later, which turned out to be a pretty good call (of course, now we know it's not much of a speed bump).<br>
<br>
Game 1 - MBO vs. Thomas Schroeder's Watto<br>
<br>
His setup was pretty standard, and as usual he was immediately draining away, though I was able to throw 3 guys at my swamp on Yavin and keep it the rest of the game to avoid S&amp;D damage.  Sadly, my Advance Preparations (V) were stuck together in my force pile for like 4 extra turns, so even without any resistance from him in space I didn't blow the D* until turn 7 or so, but after that I pretty much just started retrieving like mad.  I don't think he deployed any other locations, so the maximum he activated was 8 a turn, which wasn't enough to both drain AND deploy anything.  I drain him out not too long after to win by 25.<br>

Man, I hate Watto...<br>
<br>
Game 2 - EO Big Blue Derdram vs. Christopher Perry's LS Senate<br>
<br>
He started Squassin, so I figured he'd bring some Senate craziness in space, but he only put a senator on an effect maybe 4 times (though no battles happened to modify destinies).  He puts out Naboo and a forest there w/Qui-Gon EPP and Yoda MoFo, to which I throw out U-3PO, having already seen him lose a Sorry About the Mess.  Basically he was draining at Naboo and the Senate (with Mantellian Savrip out and Lateral Damage immunity on both ships, I couldn't realistically fight him), while I was draining for 10 at Sullust/Kessel/Endor with him usually canceling one of those.  Eventually he started moving his ships over, but all I really had to do was move those ships away and drain him out pretty quickly, as he could never find his many Amidalas to cancel them.<br>

Game 3 - MBO vs. JW Millet's SYCFA uhhhhh..... something<br/>
<br/>
Uh oh, Asphalizo.  His face after seeing my objective was priceless.  I think he started Mob. Pts. Combo, Combat Response (what?), and Crossfire (V).  I flipped without much trouble, but couldn't find a Rebel Tech (V) or Advance Preparation (V) to get the D* stuff out, so he had time to get Vader EPP + Saber 4 with cannons down to protect it with the Superlaser watching over them, so I moved my fleet over and sat there.  I didn't explicitly say that I moved Luke+Ship and Dash+Ship outside the Nebulon-B, so after he passes on his turn, I add a few more capitals, battle, he shoots it with the Superlaser and Relentless Pursuits it, making me lose 7 cards off the table.  Ok, that was stupid.  He loses Vader, but fortifies next turn with Dr. E &amp; Ponda Baba aboard Saber 4 along with Baron+Saber 1+Cannons, tossing Crossfire (V) to draw 3 destinies to try to overflow my lonely Spiral, but alas, I had a Houjix.  I notice that essentially he's got 2 TIEs stuck at the D*, and I've got another Luke+R2-D2 in Red 5 in hand, so I basically just stay away, draining him for 1 each at Yavin IV and Endor, with Padme (V) pinging him, while he has Sidious w/lightsaber sitting at my docking bay, though I cancelled that drain every other turn with Rebel Tech (V) + Entrenchment.  A crazy thing started happening... he played out 4 Imperial Propagandas (V) to reduce the damage, and added Presence of the Force and After Her! to BOTH Yavin IV and Endor, so if I drained there, I would eat massive damage, and I didn't have nearly enough Controls to cancel those AND the Senses I knew he was holding, having seen those earlier.  Luckily, I'm still doing Padme (V) damage, retrieving with Luke and the occasional Flash, and he's not doing any net damage.  Neither of us really had any other actions (other than putting the Rebel Techs in used pile and searching for them) for the last 10+ turns or so.  My other Rebel Tech was in the bottom of my force pile, and once I got that back in my reserve deck, it was pretty much over, since he would be doing zero damage and I could retrieve my whole lost pile, so the game ended there.  If he had started moving the D* to come fight me, as soon as those TIEs had moved, I would've immediately zoomed over and done the Attack Run as planned, since I eventually retrieved the torpedoes.<br/>

Game 4 - EO Big Blue Derdram vs.  Matthew Perry's TIGIH Wookiee Madness<br/>
<br/>
Normally TIGIH is not a matchup I want to see with this deck, since I can't deploy Ominous Rumors pretty much ever (unless I capture Luke 2nd turn), but once he starts putting out non-unique Wookiees, I realize this isn't a very serious deck.  Luke sat in the Hut the whole game with his saber, a Portable Scanner, a Mercenary Armor and a Lightsaber Proficiency.  He failed a deck pull, so I got to see a whole bunch of Wookiee helpers (a ton of Wookiee Strangles), which I thought was pretty cool.  The game was fairly non-eventful, with me paying 9 to drain for 8 in space, and him paying 9-12 to drain for 3-7 on the ground (once he got Midge out).  He topdecked Bargaining Table early, which was nice.  I notice he has just Wuta and a Wookiee at the Great Forest, so I throw down just Veers and Motti and draw a 6 to clear the site.  Now I satisfy BO and Imperial Decree, so his drains are dead, so he moves some more guys over, I drop Vader, draw high again, and he loses everything again.  I drain him out the next turn.<br/>

Game 5 - MBO vs. Jim Sharp's Naboo CR(V)<br/>
<br/>
He started Mob Pts. combo, Crossfire (V), IAO combo, the 3/2 site and the DB, so I'm getting a lot of force, but he has plenty to plop down Vader first turn and start draining like crazy.  He adds some other DBs later on and drops mains there to activate and drain even more.  I'm eating a lot of damage pretty fast, but I had no resistance in blowing up the D*, so he takes the hit of 14 and I start retrieving.  He had plenty of activation to plop down Executor+Thrawn to back-up ZIMH and Bossk in Hounds Tooth, so we fight a little and I have to lose Luke, but not much else, and he can't make it to Endor, so I still have a decent space presence.  Sadly, since I'm eating free drains of about 9 a turn, and I was already down near the low-teens, I couldn't retrieve fast enough to keep up, so I did as much damage as I could.<br/>

Not packing the Do Or Do Not shield (Wise Advice helped, but he still canceled like 7 cards).<br/>
Retrieving key cards with Advance Preparation (V) doesn't help much when you forget to track where they are to draw them.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - EO Big Blue Derdram vs. Jim Sharp's HB Corvettes/Cannons<br/>
<br/>
Everyone played the other side against their current opponent, with our game determining one finalist, and JW/Olaf's game determining the other (at least until we found out much later about a typo giving Olaf an extra 2 VP).  Certainly an interesting matchup, considering I have plenty of space to fight him with.  I do my usual start and draw up and find 4 SDs, and another 3 the next turn.  He throws out Dantooine, Naboo, Chandrila, Coruscant (SE), Corellia, and converts my Kessel (HMMMMMM....).  He does the usual Luke + Baragwin stuff and keeps away from my fleet, so after he flips I'm not doing any damage.  He keeps one corvette at Coruscant, and we argue about whether or not "If Rebels control" is referring to the type (Rebel characters) or a characteristic (referring to starships), and Mike rules that I have to face the +2 deploy (and yes, they now know that they were wrong).  So I invade Coruscant with 3 SDs for cheap, he barriers one, Lateral Damage his, battle, he reacts with Spiral, he misses his shot since I had CEC suspended and replaced his AO, and he loses everything plus 6.  I start moving my ships down the spaceline and start probing.  I'm pretty sure it's Kessel, since he keeps mentioning other planets and he replaced mine for no reason, but he's got multiple ships there and I have to wait until my fleet can get there.  I finally get there, with 3 SDs (and Accuser in hand), and he flees, I probe, and I can finally start doing damage again.  I deploy the Accuser alone to Corellia to suspend CEC again and spread out a bit, drawing up and finding Devastator and Avenger.  He moves a corvette+cannon over to block my drain there thinking none of the 3 cards in my hand were ships.  I add the 2 SDs, battle, he shoots Devastator easily (his AO was back out) but doesn't have a Power Pivot, I draw a 6, and he loses everything plus 11.  He's getting pretty low on force at this point, so he plops down Qui-Gon EPP against my Vader EPP+Ozzel+Veers sitting at the platform.  I barrier him, but don't have anyone else in my hand to fortify them with, so I just let them sit there.  He's starting to eat drains of about 8 a turn, so he doesn't have much time and battles me there anyway, swings at Vader and misses, I swing at Qui-Gon and draw abnormally high and hit, so he loses Qui-Gon plus 6.  I drain him out the next turn.<br/>

So I actually start feeling kinda bad at this point, because a final confrontation is a lot more fun when you're watching it than playing in it, and it would be my first time.  We wait for JW/Olaf's game to end, which strangely enough ended in a 31-20 timed win for JW.  Stanton apparently offered up some sweet cards as prize support (since there was none initially besides the bye), and I got my choice of 5 of the 20 cards, and I was able to get a P-60 Foil, Choke Vader, Yoda MoFo, Maul YA, and Obi JK (the Obi being the only card of those that I had already).<br/>
<br/>
JW says he's going to Worlds no matter what happens, and I start wondering whether or not I'm "sure" I'm going.  I think a while about whether or not I want to concede, since planning to go to Worlds, taking off work and such seems like a big bother, having never been to Worlds.  I ask if I can think about it while we head to eat at Mazzio's (we were already at that store for an hour longer than they were open, we would've played the finals while everyone else ate).  Jim, Mike and Thomas say stuff like "if there's a 60% chance you could go, I'd take the bye", and I realize that if I have the bye, I would certainly do anything possible to make the time to be there, so when we get out of the car, I bring my cards with me, and JW's face gets scrunched up.  He knows my MBO, without me making that stupid mistake, would easily crush his SYCFA, and his TRM has almost no chance to win by much against my EO (he's played against it twice before with mains decks and lost), so he says there wouldn't really be much point in us playing, and concedes.  So I'm the OK State champion and feel bad about it, for sorta kinda leading JW on into thinking I might give him the bye.  <br/>
