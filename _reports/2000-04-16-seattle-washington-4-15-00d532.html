<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I've decided to name this tourney report 'Keith HATES Kessel Run' You'll find out why later.<br/>
Anyway, I've been playing Speeder Ops since the Grand Slam in December (the deck only lost<br/>
3 times). I wanted a new deck for states next week and I decided to bring<br/>
a experimental Falke-style Hidden Base to this tourney to see how it does.<br/>
My dark deck was decided weeks ago. A 'Teacher' style Hunt Down that starts<br/>
IAO and the only locations are the starting ones, E:DB, a DS:DB with the main<br/>
power coming from BO and CHYBC! I also packed it full of anti-main interrupts.<br/>
My deck choices are as follows: LS-A Falke-Hidden base<br/>
							  : DS-A 'Teacher' Anti-main Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
Game 1-My LS V.S. Cory Pritchard's DS cheap character swarm?<br/>
I start HB stuff and Haven (So I can concentrate force use on my characters).<br/>
He starts Endor:Forest Clearing<br/>
His first turn he deploys a Imperial Squad Leader alone to the Clearing. It's<br/>
now that he tells me this is his first tourney. My opening hand has no ships<br/>
but it has EPP Obi, Melas, and DTF. Short on force I just dump Melas and DTF <br/>
battle and clear the site out, I draw EPP Leia and say go.He drops two more<br/>
sites. Lt. Comm. Arden goes to one and some of those pilots from Dagobah to <br/>
Melas's site. He battles, I lose Melas he loses a one of the pilots leaving him<br/>
with no destiny draw, and says go. I drop EPP Obi to the Dagobah guys battle, clear<br/>
the site. I draw some ships and say go. (I've been dropping systems every turn).<br/>
He drains, draws his whole force pile and says go. I drop my last system, Falcon<br/>
with Capt. Hand and Wedge to Coruscant. EPP Leia and Webb go to Arden. Battle, he<br/>
draw a site, Arden and two more. I flip and it's his turn. He drops some more<br/>
cheap imperials and some Ties armed with canons to some system, and says go.<br/>
I want to win by a lot (cause I'm mean) so I signal for Kessel Run, deploy it and<br/>
Target Han at Coruscant. Since I have a big hand and no Traffic Control, I move<br/>
Webb to the scrub imperials and say go. His turn he battles and I lose Webb and 4<br/>
more, all from my hand leaving me with 9 cards in lost pile and 3 in my hand.<br/>
As I complete the Kessel Run I drain while he doesn't (HB). I complete the run<br/>
for a 8 force retrieval and drains win it from there.<br/>
FW +37<br/>
<br/>
The Good:Having a fun relaxing first game.<br/>
The Bad: My LS wasn't working the way it was supposed to,so<br/>
now I have little faith in it. (Good thing I played a newbie)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2--My DS V.S. Doug Talyor's Throne Room X-Wings.<br/>
He starts normal Throne Room, I start HD stuff and Crush.<br/>
Doug is an awesome guy and he's high up the decipher ladder, so he's got a 'bounty' on him<br/>
or something. What that basically means is if I beat him I get 3 packs of Reflections.<br/>
So now there's extra pressure:) His first turn he looks for a Nudj, and finds none!<br/>
I go through his deck and see x-wings, a few EPPs and no SA. Doug drops a Nudj and draws.<br/>
We both lose to Visage. My opening hand rocks. Since I started Crush I wasn't<br/>
sure if I was going to be able to draw my 2 locations, they're both there, as well as Bubo!<br/>
I drop my two sites and Bubo to the farm. The Nudj is eaten, move Bubo to the<br/>
swamp and draw Vader, ZiMH and BiHT. Cool. Doug drops Hoth <br/>
command center and Incom Cor.. Melas and a Bothan Spy cancel Visage.<br/>
I Twi'Lek for CHYBC, deploy it, draw both my walkers and say go. Doug drops <br/>
Coruscant, two X-wings, and Oola.She has to die! Is my first thought. Doug<br/>
moves his alien crew to the Executor DB, trying to get to the DS:DB. My turn, I<br/>
drop Vader and flip, drop Blizzard 2 and Ozzel to the DB. I battle, the spy and<br/>
Ozzel die. I move Vader to the Executor. Doug drains and moves all his people to<br/>
DS:DB. I deploy Tempest 1 with Arnet, and another Visage.Battle with Arnet, all<br/>
of Doug's alien crew dies. I save force and say go. Doug drains and draws. I have<br/>
enough force, down comes ZiMH and BiHT to Coruscant (at -2 each)! Battle, I draw<br/>
a 6 and 5, Doug plays Organized attack, loses the two wings and some more. On his<br/>
next turn Doug draws, then 'Terminates' Visage. My turn Mara goes to the Farm<br/>
to drain and I draw two dreadnaughts and a couple of pilots. Doug deploys 3 more X-wings<br/>
and says go. I drain and battle the X-wings, retrieving the Visage with a First Strike.<br/>
I draw high, Doug loses everything. His next turn he drops Tantive 4 and EPP Han, mutters<br/>
about some plan and says go. I activate to the retrieved Visage, drain, deploy a dreadnaught<br/>
and DS-61-3. Battle, draw the Visage and a 1, Doug loses everything again and yet<br/>
more cards. From here on out I drain him to death.<br/>
FW+26<br/>
<br/>
The Good:Playing Doug, (he's a great guy) locking him up everywhere, and<br/>
getting 3 Reflections packs (they weren't great).<br/>
The Bad:Beating a friend, just seeing Oola hit the table bugs me.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3--My DS V.S. Douglas Harvilla's Profit Mains.<br/>
Doug starts Profit stuff (with EPP Han I might add) and Goo Nee Tay.<br/>
I start HD stuff, IAO and Mara alone in the chamber.<br/>
My opening hand has no Vader but it's all good. I drop the<br/>
Executor DB, Mara's Saber and move out of the chamber. I draw Vader and a<br/>
DLOTS. Doug drops KFC to the chamber and says go. I drain, then he frees Han.<br/>
I'm thinking 'This is too easy.' (I've been screwed by Doug before so now I'm<br/>
cautious). I drop DLOTS, battle. choke KFC and Han dies. the Obj. flips. I draw and<br/>
Doug loses to Visage. His turn he deploys the Entrance Cavern with Orimaarko and<br/>
Yoxgit there. then he deploys Uncontrollable Fury on Vader! ARRGHH! He draws and says go.<br/>
I drain with Mara, drop a walker and a pilot to the Entrance caver, battle and I draw low.<br/>
Doug loses Yoxgit and I lose the pilot. Vader moves over and I lose 2. Doug Deploys<br/>
Master Luke, flips the obj. battles and kills Mara, moves Orrimaarko and says go. I<br/>
drop a pilot to the walker, return Vader to my hand getting rid of fury and say go.<br/>
Doug deploys Boushh, cancels Visage, then drops Ben Kenobi with stick and EPP Han,<br/>
flipping his Obj. and moves everyone to the same site. I drop CHYBC so Boushh can't<br/>
drain, then drop Tarkin and DS-61-2 to Mos Eisely. Doug makes me lose to the Obj. drops ECC<br/>
Chewie then spreads out, with Luke and Orrimaarko at one site, Ben, Han, and Chewie go to<br/>
another. I have a DLOTS in hand and his stick, but can't decide what to do. I decide to wait<br/>
a turn and drop Mara to Boushh. Since I'm ahead Doug at this poing, I lose 2 to deploy Visage, <br/>
then battle, getting retrieval from his DTF and my FS. I play Put all Sections on Alert, and Leia<br/>
can't draw destiny. Doug Smoke Screens or something, but Mara is gone first, Visage dies, and so<br/>
does Leia. From here Doug and I are racing, but I'm barely winning since Mara drained for a lot<br/>
early on. Doug eventually spreads to Mos Eisely with Ben and Han. I finally drop DLOTS and saber,<br/>
battle, choke Han, Ben is lost. The game is mine from here on out. With me draining and him not, I<br/>
take the game by a measly 6.<br/>
FW+6<br/>
<br/>
The Good:Beating one the best local players, cutting it close was very suspensful!<br/>
<br/>
The Bad:Uncontrollable Fury, the Visage re-deployment not working.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4--My LS V.S. Charles Hickey's RallOps.<br/>
I start HB with Haven<br/>
Hickey starts Raltiir and Security Precautions<br/>
This game wen rather slow, me setting up while Hickey does likewise. He flips with<br/>
Arden, DS-61-2, and an At-ST pilot. I don't remember too much detail about this game but <br/>
here are the highlights:I flipped his Obj. back several times, making good use of shuttleing.<br/>
Hickey dropped a bunch of ships to probe and drained me for 6 in space at one point. <br/>
I canceled Search and Destory by battleting Arden with Orrimaarko at the swamp.<br/>
Charles battled against Capt. Han in the Falcon and Tantive with ZiMH and Devastator. I<br/>
reacted with the spiral, winning the battle and killing devastator, then I deployed Legendary<br/>
Starfighter on the Falcon. I emptied the Falcon, and Charles ahd to lose two for the<br/>
rest of the game!<br/>
Charles deployed AAA, and I end up losing like 8 cards to it.<br/>
Charles out-played me, and when he probed my base (Endor) I lost.<br/>
<br/>
FL-14<br/>
<br/>
The Good:Flipping his Obj. back like 7 times, and the empty Falcon<br/>
slowly poking him.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad: Raltiir adding to his destiny, AAA.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5--LS V.S. Ghery Petit's HD on Endor<br/>
Ghery starts Security Precautions<br/>
I start my normal stuff<br/>
<br/>
Trans term first turn, then Ghery draws. I get a system and deploy Tatooine.<br/>
Draw Falcon, Melas, and Kessel Run. Ghery drops Vader and Mara to a Ewok<br/>
Village, draws. I drop more systems, more ships and draw 2 Trans. Term, cool.<br/>
Ghery pays 3 to my Battle Planto drain, then drops Back Door, Jabba there and bunch<br/>
of deploying moving goes on, by the end of his turn he has Tarkin,Vader, and<br/>
Davin Felth at the Ewok place, with Jabba and Mara at Back door. I drop the last<br/>
of my systems, EPP Obi and Jeroen Webb go pay Jabba/Mara a visit, while EPP Luke in<br/>
Falcon goes to Coruscant, jacking up deployment.Obi battles, hits Jabba, then gets<br/>
'beaten' by Mara. I lose by a bunch but luckily I have a Houjix in hand and use it for<br/>
my own battle. On his turn I flip, cancel another Visage. He deploys Search and Destroy, and I'm<br/>
afraid. But he forgets it's there and moves everyone over to Obi's site in an effort to get him<br/>
off Endor, and cancels his own SAD! He groans, and draws. Right now I am causing his imperials<br/>
to come out for more, but Luke can't drain because the HD is flipped!! ARRGH! Oh well. I spred thing,<br/>
just waiting for a ship beatdown (that never comes) and get set up for Kessel Run. Ghery deploys Visage,<br/>
I cancel (with my 3rd Trans. Term, hell yeah)! Ghery finally deploys a ship (DSSD) to Tattoine and probes,<br/>
nope. I drop Falcon, Capt.Han, and Chewie to the DSSD. Battle, he loses the ship and 2 more.<br/>
Melas is 1 turn away from completing the Run.Ghery drops ZiMH to Endor and probes, getting the<br/>
base. I lose 8 force, then he draws. I drop some ships, battle and he loses Zuckuss and 1 more, I<br/>
complete the Kessel Run and retrieve the lost 8 from SP.Ghery can finally drain me and he's down to six<br/>
cards. I have one car left in hand, Wedge, and DTF is out. I drain Ghery down to one, then Wedge and battle,<br/>
retrieving my 1 and he loses his last card.<br/>
<br/>
FW+11<br/>
<br/>
The Good: The canceled Search and Destroy, the battle with the Falcon, completing the Kessel Run.<br/>
<br/>
The Bad: Having to Houjix on my own battle, him finding my Hidden base on<br/>
his 2nd probe.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6--My DS V.S. Peter Sundholm's HB Freighter captains Kesse Run<br/>
All I'm going to say about this game is that I think the Freigter Captain/<br/>
Y3 transport lockout is very cheap and not fun to play :P<br/>
<br/>
FL-30<br/>
<br/>
That's it, hope you enjoyed it, and my Dark deck now has a secret plans:)<br/>
