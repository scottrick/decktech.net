<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Day 2’s Report I was going to put with this one, but it was just to long...so I will do that<br/>
one later.<br/>
<br/>
I did Copy and paste from Word So I hope every looks fine.<br/>
<br/>
Pre Tourney Crap:<br/>
<br/>
Preparing for Decipher Con, wasn’t as good as it was last year for me.  For some reason<br/>
this year I didn’t have as much time to do everything I wanted to do like, try every deck<br/>
Idea, and stuff like that.  Either way I was ready and I made time to practice with the local<br/>
hit squad.  This report will be Day 1 at worlds, and how I did in that, and sometime in the<br/>
next few days, I will post my Day 2 report.  <br/>
<br/>
First the trip down was uneventful, I flew down on Delta with Avery Poliak, who plays<br/>
YJ, and is good at it, in fact he ended up a finalist in that, and I was meeting up with Chris<br/>
Hines, Mat Berta, and Patrick Hines, oh and Ted Hansen....oh and Brad Bedlion...I think<br/>
thats everyone who stayed with us.  Anyway we got there on Wednesday with a few<br/>
meeting up a little later.  We rested more that day than we did this whole trip, because for<br/>
some reason after Thursday, sleep was not an option.  I did some final testing of the decks<br/>
I decided to go with and played.  On the dark side I played BHBM...because it just kicks<br/>
@ss, and on the light side I played direct damage MWYHL, because that beats ties and<br/>
Raltiir which I thought I was going to see.  Now on to the tournament.  I would like to<br/>
warn you all that I did not take any notes at all.  My mind was occupied, because getting<br/>
into the event took forever, and starting later than we were supposed to really screwed<br/>
things up, so my motivation to take notes, and all that went down, so I guess I am trying<br/>
to say, that the details to some of these games are going to suck, because I really<br/>
remember nothing from some of them.  Although I know I had fun.<br/>
<br/>
Last Open Day 1: Top 38 make it.....<br/>
<br/>
Well it starts by everyone noticing how many good players were in this, I mean there was<br/>
a lot.  I saw many top players. I still felt good, but everyone was little frustrated from the<br/>
late start.  For me it kind of throws me off, but anyway forget that, and on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs Steve Baroni’s BHBM deck. Rating 1837<br/>
<br/>
I think this guys is from Albany, because he said both of his decks were made by Brian<br/>
Twigg, and how he and his bother helped him out and gave him some pointers and stuff. <br/>
Well it turns out that he plays very well and makes some really good decisions at time.  At<br/>
one point he gets out the Responsibility of Command on Captain Han and Much Anger in<br/>
Him.  That hurt alot, After I finally grabbed his Projective Telepathy, My Anger fear’s<br/>
starting hitting him, and then I was tracking an It Could Be worse, and finally to top it off,<br/>
Earlier in this game, I did beat up on some ships, with Super Falcon and I Know, which<br/>
gave me Legendary Starfighter, this was just eating away his deck, while I am just trying<br/>
to hold on.  I was only losing force from Much anger in him, because I was preventing all<br/>
other force lose, and he was losing from Legendary, and his Objective, and late game<br/>
Anger fear’s.  I drew my On the Edge toward the end...(YES)...and decided to fail the<br/>
attempt on Han just so I can get rid of Much Anger in Him. and then that did him in. <br/>
Somehow I turn his control of the game around and won.  <br/>
Full Win by 3<br/>
Total: 2(+3)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: I guess killing my own Han to win the game.<br/>
Lowlights: Getting smack around in the beginning of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Dark Side vs Steve Baroni’s Hidden Base no Flip<br/>
<br/>
Well with 170 people here I have to play the same person again, can you believe that? I<br/>
wasn’t worried because I had a feeling I knew what to expect.  As it turned out I didn’t<br/>
know everything, but I was in control of the game.  I won a major battle, and he was<br/>
doing things to keep it close.  He gives me Luke so I move Vader to the Emperor’s site,<br/>
and start Dueling.  I easily have 3 Battlegrounds so when I win he loses 3 force, and I won<br/>
alot with my destiny’s.  Some of the details are not here, but I do know I won by 17.<br/>
Full Win by 17<br/>
Total: 4(+20)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: My dark beats any kind of Hidden Base which is cool.<br/>
Lowlights: Players the same person twice in a row.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs Justin Desai’s Ralltiir Rating 1796<br/>
<br/>
I really remember nothing from this game, just that he had every Counter to what I could<br/>
do, he cancels fury on Vader, he cancels Anger Fear’s, he did everything he needed to do<br/>
to win.  I lost by 11<br/>
Full Loss by 11<br/>
Total: 4(+9)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:???I don’t remember<br/>
Lows: Well I lost to Ralltiir,and this deck wasn’t supposed to lose to that...oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs Jason Dennee MWYHL Rating 1856<br/>
<br/>
This is another game I remember very little from.  I do know his deck was very close to<br/>
what I was playing, on my light side.  I play with only 2 Projective Telepathy, and I could<br/>
draw any of them early which hurt a couple of times.  Then when Legendary hit the table,<br/>
I knew it was going to be tough to win.  Finally Jedi Luke comes down, and that did it for<br/>
me. <br/>
Full Loss by 6<br/>
Total: 4(+3)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well I am still positive?...<br/>
Lows: I could have beat this deck I am sure of it.<br/>
<br/>
Well finally this is the mid way point, and Talking to some of the other Vegas people we<br/>
are not all kicking major but.  I know there is still a chance, but there was little space for<br/>
error.  I was feeling a down, and so was Ted, and Matt so what better way than to take a<br/>
trip to the bar.  We buy are drinks and get back to the games.  Which we had plenty of<br/>
time between games to do.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My LS vs Jeff Field’s Huntdown Rating 1931<br/>
<br/>
Well I have played Jeff Field before this only once, and I won so that...in a weird way<br/>
helps when coming into a game.  He had nothing for Anger Fear so that hurts him a bit,<br/>
and suicide Obi hurts him also.  He gets some good Drains going however on Endor.  I<br/>
have Twass Complete Jedi Test 1 and put some POAS’s down to reduce those and things<br/>
start to shift in my favor.  He had 3 battle grounds pretty early so Visage didn’t hurt him,<br/>
but it did me.  He grabs my it could be worse early as well.  Soon after I set up a Drain at<br/>
Kessel with Super Falcon, (not Leia) and that does him in.  He did Duel Obi and won, so<br/>
that kept it close.<br/>
Full Win by 13<br/>
Total: 6(+16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well I did win, and it was always fun to play Jeff<br/>
Lows: Obi lost a duel :(<br/>
<br/>
Now I start thinking that stopping for a drink was a good Idea, and so did my friends since<br/>
they all won one too.  I was a little worried about my Dif, and if it was enough to make it. <br/>
well....<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My DS vs Daniel Spaid’s Deck? Rating 1724<br/>
<br/>
I don’t remember much, just that I controlled the game.  He gave me Luke very early, so<br/>
from the beginning I had to lose a force every turn, which doesn’t’ matter really in this<br/>
deck.  I do my stuff and win.<br/>
Full Win by 18<br/>
Total: 8(+34)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Hey I made it...WAIT we still have 2 more games<br/>
Lows: We still have 2 more, and it about 11:30 Now...oh well.<br/>
<br/>
You know the funny thing is I remember last year in the Wild Card event after 6 games I<br/>
was in 2nd place, with Brian Twigg in 1st.  If it was only 6 games both of us would have<br/>
been in it.  Now its that all over again, so that kind of freaks me out I am worried, but this<br/>
time it will be different.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: My LS vs Chris Twigg BHBM deck. Rating 2190<br/>
<br/>
Well I have already played this deck when I played Steve Baroni, so I knew what to<br/>
expect.  He did much better, and I never got out Legendary Starfighter, he had control of<br/>
the game, and I just remembered we didn’t stop for Juri Juice before this game.<br/>
Full Loss by 15<br/>
Total:8(+19)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Ahhh..  there was something ask me later.<br/>
Lows: I forgot to make him lose force from Anger Fear twice...what is up with that?  He<br/>
had plenty of cards in hand anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Must have drink that is why...so we get it and move on.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8: My DS vs Michael...??? forgot oopps. He was playing EBO<br/>
<br/>
Well I knew this deck beats EBO, but even more so if this is Baragins. and it was.  I<br/>
started Secret Plans, and made a mistake this game.  I didn’t start Insig Rebellion, which I<br/>
was supposed to.  You know it was 2:00 AM after all, and my opponent was nice enough<br/>
to say go get it, because it was supposed to be there anyway.  If he wanted to he could<br/>
have placed my objective OOP, but I had a sorry draw with the Emperor in my hand so It<br/>
would have helped me better with it OOP anyway.  I wasn’t worry since I knew what he<br/>
was playing.  When he puts Luke in Space I was happy, he loses 3 force hehehe.  His big<br/>
Drains, hurt a little, but his retrieval is stopped with the Coward card.<br/>
Full Win by 16<br/>
Total: 10(+35)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Yes I win...now I made it.<br/>
Lows: I did make some mistakes I shouldn’t have.<br/>
<br/>
So the top 38 make it, and we started with 170, and I ended up in 34 place.  Thats good I<br/>
did it, and I am happy.  Time for bed.<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
The bar <br/>
My opponents<br/>
Tattooine for kicking butt<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
The DQ’s<br/>
Such a late start...dam that sucked.<br/>
Having such low dif<br/>
<br/>
Well overall I still had a really good time, even if it did take 16 hours to play 8 games.  My<br/>
Day 2 report will be tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this far if you did,<br/>
