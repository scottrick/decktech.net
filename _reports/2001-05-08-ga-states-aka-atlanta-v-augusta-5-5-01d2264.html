Well my sister deleted the first copy so heres the second!  Sorry its late.  Well, it all starts when there is a local at the Book Exchange run by Landon Sommer, so I firgured Id go and take a court deck with like a couple JPs, started Mob Pts., No Bargain, and POTH.  For LS I played my Raider deck which is based off the Lewis one but has evolved into a better thing I believe.  It&amp;#8217;s lost the entire Harvest package, and it&amp;#8217;s now got Red 10/Thereon, RS1/Wedge, On the Edge x2, X-wing Cannon, Kessel, Bo Shuda,A Few Maneuvers, Darklighter Spin, a Tripler, EPP Han, and some other changes for my playing style.  I go to Jims on Friday night for &amp;#8220;playtesting&amp;#8221;, which means I get denied games and have fun watching ;) just kidding.  But I actually didnt get to play a single game since noone would ever play me but we do go to Waffle House at 12:00 as has been the tradition for us.  It gives us the tech and is the key to success.  Its our Brownie if you will.  I get to sleep late which is not good.  So I end up winning the tourney going 6-0 for the Dark side Sense Foil, and also beating Art Rhodes w/ the Raider deck(8-0 now) but mainly cuz of luck.  I&amp;#8217;ve got a week till states and I know for Dark side I&amp;#8217;ll be playing Agents of BS cuz that deck is hot!!  Dropped Main Course for PASOAlert cuz everyone knows the decklist and I figure that card will catch em off guard, put in S&amp;D for cheese of all sorts, and make some other small changes, but mainly keeping the deck solid(thanks for the 2 Emps Landon!).  For Light Side I&amp;#8217;m playing my infamous Raider deck but decide to go thru the Meta.  I end up dropping Aim High for a third Luke(AOBS), adding the Trippler and a Blast the Door Kid thanks to some advise from some friends(thanks!).  We are gonna test the Friday before at my house from 4:30-11 which is good.  I actually get to play some solid games and get to play against Landons Profit with my Agents deck.  Plans come through and 5 of us and Jims dad end up making the drive up to the WarRoom for the event.  I was looking forward to this event a ton because I missed states last year.  I get there and the event starts at 1:00 instead of 12.  BUT, all 5 of us(me, Nick, Carmine, Landon, and Jim) walk to Wendys for some food.  We end up talking about how high the caliber of players there are.  We figure its gonna be hard to get an easy match-up because there are so many straight up good players in the area.  We also mention that we are gonna have to play each other at some point.  So we head and back and get the first pairings!  By the way, my rating going in is 1873, I hope to get into the 1900 range after this tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My Raider Deck vs. Landon sUmmers(1590) Profit Beats<br/>
<br/>
He is running a really cool deck he made the night before and I think it was originally constructed by TJ Holman or Art or somebody.  I start IAO, MP, and Crush as I did all day, and also started EPP Fett and Dengar in the AC.  First turn, I drop a Vigo to Cor: DB and move Xizor there, and let Landon go.  His turn he activates, gets Undreworld Contacts, drops it and draws all.  My turn I get the Monnok and Play it netting all 3 of his Harvests and 2 Take me to Jabbas(huge!).  I put the Empy to JP for and move Xizor and Vigo to the DS:DB with a PASOA in my hand.  His turn plays C/TV, a twix or too, and draws some.  My turn I drain 2, 2, and do 2 Objective Damage.  Drop Guri to the Chamber along with ECC-4Lom.  His turn he drops EPP Leia to the DS:DB and battles, I wait on PASOA, he shoots Xizor, and draws no destiny.  I draw decent so he loses Leia and 3.  He then plays OOC on my 3-card lost pile and gets the monnok leaving Xizor on top.  I drain, and play No Escape to get Xizor back and drop him and pass.  His turn he wants the beats so he drops Artoo in the Chamber, Beggar, along with EPP Luke and First Strike, battles plays the doubler and the Artoo card denying me of destinies.  He hits Dengar first and plays Blast Prof. To make him immediately lost.  I shoot Luke with a tracked 5, and draw no destiny.  I lose like 4Lom, Fett, and 2 overflow.  My turn, Z in MH goes to Kuat with a P of the F. and Battle Order.  I drop Djas and First Strike to join Guri in the AC, battle the Artoo combo retrieving 2 and making him lose 2, killing the droid.  And I sit there doing damage to him while he draws.  His Last turn he drops Lando w/ Ax to my Vigo and Xizor but he immediately meets a Set for Stun.  My turn I damage him to 1, flip back to the 0-side, and slowly put my hand into used pile one turn at a time thanks to Concentraion.  Putting me at 2(+32)  (He told me yesterday that he wishes he had thrown this game to me by 16 or more so I coulda been in the confrontation, which I suppose is true).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My Dark Surgeon vs. Stephen Michaels (1941) AOBS Manipulator<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty good match-up due to the fact that I have 3 Lukes, little did I know that Luke would never even hit the table in this game!  He starts IAO, MP, and Crush while I start Insurrection, SA, and Squadron Ass.  His first turn, he puts out Rendilii, Cor.:DB w/ a Vigo, Secret Plans, and moves Xizor over.  I activate, and then he starts with the Dangerous Times and I can only laugh as I have no grabber but I do have a Visored Vision and play it as much as possible.  I got one of the worst hands yet!  ALL red except for the Outrider and Kessel!  So I get the &lt;&gt;:DB and put Dash in ship there for 3 and move up, and draw.  His turn he Monnoks netting jack and decides to go for the early punch.  He plops down Z in MH and 4Lom to Tatooine and battles.  I reduce his power to 0 but he draws a 3 and 2.  I lose Dash and he loses a card.  He moves Xizor and Vigo over to the DS:DB and this is really bad for me, cuz he now has a drain of 4 to my 0 and 1 objective damage too.  My turn I Tunnel for my X-wing Cannon, and down comes Mr. Antilles in his ship, I also throw Mirax in the empty Outrider, Melas goes to the Tat:DB, I battle and shoot down the ship with a 4.  His turn he pulls CC:DB and puts the Emperor there with like Jodo Kast and a Vigoand Prescence.  This is getting worse and worse!  Now in damage I&amp;#8217;m down 9-2 with no Lukes in hand.  My turn, I&amp;#8217;ve still got that C/TV in my lost pile and so I decide it&amp;#8217;s time to find one of my last 2 lukes since one went off the top early and all I find is Battle Plan.  I drain for 2 and he loses off top of reserve and it&amp;#8217;s Z in MH and 4-LOM which were his 2nd copies.  I plop Battle Plan down and throw a Raider to the &lt;&gt;:DB and Mirax into Celebration somewhere in there.   I Drop it and I&amp;#8217;ll Take the Leader, evening it up a little.  His turn, he starts paying for battle plan and drops Ree-Yees(WTF?) to the DS:DB, 4-Lom to my Tat.DB, and brings over Xizor and Jodo Kast. He hits me with a 2nd monnok still netting nothing, and then, get this, he plays ENDOR OCCUPATION to cancel my Celebration.  But he does this in his draw phase and I know I&amp;#8217;ve got a 3 on top so I on the Edge for 2, retrieving Celebration.  My Turn I activate, mirax the celebration into hand, and then finish activating.  I drain for 3, Melas starts running away and I play On the Edge with the Jedi Luke I put under 1 turn ago.  Apparently, he thought I was spreading out my force pile so I could track it, though I was clearly Miraxing it and then simply activating it to the top each turn.  He finds Omni Box so then I can&amp;#8217;t play my Edges anymore since Jedi Luke is floating around and A Few Maneuvers is in the lost pile.  I drop Kessel and move Mirax over there.  We both have a couple cards left now.  His turn he drains at 1 location, and drops Stinger in front of Mirax, and drops Iggy to capture my lone raider.  I actiavate, celebrate a couple, and Drain for a couple bringing him down to 3, and kill stinger, and pass to him.  He spends all 6 to drain bringing me down to 6, and knocked off the ground now though.  But he has no counter for the Kessel drain, so I spend 3 to drain him for three and win narrowly by 6 in a great game, he has great sportsmanship and I&amp;#8217;m glad I got to play him.  A really nice guy.  I&amp;#8217;m now at 4(+38)<br/>
<br/>
So the TD comes up to me and asks me to stop stacking my force pile, which is fine by me.  It&amp;#8217;s just what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing ever since I started playing 5 years ago.  But I am sure I can remember not to for 4 more games (hopefully 6 &amp;#61514;<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
<br/>
My AOBS vs. Remaining Anonymous QMC<br/>
<br/>
Well, let me start off by saying this is the most annoying game I&amp;#8217;ve ever had to play in.  I&amp;#8217;ll try not to bash this guy(try really hard that is) and describe the entire game as descriptively as I can for you.  I start the Regular stuff while he starts Leias Hutt as his CC:BG and Bespin, accompanied by Battle Plan, Insights, and Strike Planning.  My starting hand looks good, with a Stinger and Emperor, and Z in MH, Vigo, that aint bad.  My turn starts, I drop Kuat, Cor.:DB with a Vigo, move Xizor over, and draw for the Guri that should be in my force pile, I also run into Fett in Slave and Lateral Damage.  In my activate phase, he had pulled Gen. Calrissian, and Madine while losing Insight for Launching the Assault.  His turn he activates 5, gets a QMC site for 1 force(the site where you can cancel drains, a Â½), drops LTAssault on Bespin and Pulls the Home One.  His draw phase, he now has 11 cards in hand, he draws 1(12), draws another(13), draws another(14), and before he picks up his last force I tell him I have an action.  I use Crush to pull Evader/Monnok at which he then tries to put 2 cards back onto his force pile without me seeing it.  But I did see it, and I tell him he already looked at both cards, and that he is certainly allowed to back up one action and put down one card.  He knows  he is at fault and doesn&amp;#8217;t bother calling the TD, he then says, &amp;#8220;Dude, I stopped playing for one year, just let me put the 2 cards back.&amp;#8221;  He continuously pleads with me, and when he realizes this won&amp;#8217;t work, he tries to intimidate me.  He starts calling me prick, @#$%, and cussing me out.  He then says: &amp;#8220;Ill see you in the parking lot after the game then.&amp;#8221;  This has gone on for 5-10 minutes now and its only his first turn of the game, Ive not returned any remarks or anything.  So I play the monnok used and start my turn while he cusses at me because I don&amp;#8217;t feel like calling the TD over and wasting more time.  I activate, pull DS:DB, drop Emperor and Dengar to his CC:site with a Prescence of the Force and move Xizor and Vigo over for the flip.  His turn, he activates 7, pulls Bespin:CC, and draws 4 saving some.  My turn I am activating a ton, do my drains and Obj. Damage, and deploy Stinger and Guri, Fett in Slave 1, and Z in MH all to Bespin to satisfy his Battle Plan.  I drop Djas to the DS:DB and draw some, saving 1 for Barrier.  His turn, he drops the Home One for 12, Hashn and Thaneespi for 1 force, and Protcector for 5.  I barriered the Home One so he can&amp;#8217;t battle.  During his draw phase I play Set for stun on his Hashn, and draw a tracked Lightning.  My turn, I drop a Vigo onto Z in MH, Lateral Damage to Coruscant, and Battle him.  I draw decently, while he draws a 1, I have power of 22 to his 1. I am now getting revenge.  He loses Chewie, Thaneespi, and 10 more off the top. Ive already stacked my entire deck (spend 3 to play twilek, Used Lightning, and then put a 5 back with objective).  His turn, he decides to try an attack on Empy and Dengar since they are draining for 3.  But he only puts down EPP Obi, he battles, and I play the used version of Lightning, while Dengar hits Obi with a 5.  I draw a 5 &amp; 5 for BD, while he draws a 1.  He loses Obi and 11, and draws whats left.  On my turn, I just drain and do nothing.  His turn,  he throws down EPP Luke and like Gen. Crix against my Xizor and Vigo, he kills them and luckily Out of Commisions my Xizor.  But by this time, he&amp;#8217;s down by about 30 force, I&amp;#8217;m draining 3 at the CC Site and 2 at Bespin, while establishes his first drain of 1.  I win by 24.<br/>
<br/>
  After the game, he proceeds to go around telling everyone about how I am the biggest @#$% ever, he makes me out to be the biggest cheater ever and even complains to the assistant TD.  This is ridiculous.  The Assistant TD calls me over, I tell him that he is mad because I played Monnok at an inoppurtune time for him, and the TD tells me to watch what I&amp;#8217;m doing because this is the 2nd opponent to report me for jack @#$%.  Well that&amp;#8217;s just absolutely great, I then ask the Assistant TD to watch my next game cause I haven&amp;#8217;t done anything illegal.  He kindly accepts and pulls up a chair up next tome to watch me play Adam Drake who is 3-0 so far.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My LS Raiders vs. Adam Drakes(1802) Agents Manipulator<br/>
<br/>
His deck is just like Stephens.  I have an awesome hand:  Jedi Luke, Raider/Craft, Wedge, and I&amp;#8217;ll Take the Leader.  He pulls Cor. DB and Rendili, lays them down, and moves Xizor over.  I activate, he plays Dangerous Time, I drop Wedge and Ship and Cannons to the &lt;&gt; DB for 4, and a Craft/Raider their too.  Pull Kessel, and Wedge flies up to the system(I forget to actually flip it).  His turn, he activates 3 more than he shouls and I tell him it.  He says my Obj. wasn&amp;#8217;t flipped in his activate phase and the TD tells me he&amp;#8217;s right.  I ask the TD if I can at least flip as an action after he activates from the Cor.DB, which keeps him from activating 2 at Coruscant, he tells me no.  That sucks big time.  So he drops the Emperor to the Cantina and moves Xivor inside.  My turn,  I drop my AO, draw some and save 3 for cannons(did this every turn for the rest of game).  I happened to draw into EPP Luke and Battle Plan.  His turn, he drops a POTF on the Cantina, with Djas, and moves Xizor inside.  My turn, I drop Jedi Luke to Tatooine DB with a Raider, flipping him back, drop Battle Plan and draw Tunnel Vision, he plays Visored Vision naming portal and finds one.  I notice the top card on my Used Pile is On the Edge so it dies for the 1 force(goody!) and let him go.  He activates, drops Dengar to Cantina, Iggy with Gun to Tatooine DB and he gets barriered, then he moves over Iggy w/ Gun.  Fine with me so I play A few Maneuvers in his draw phase.  My turn, he plays Dangerous Time&amp;#8230;I play Tunnel vision to get Celebration, and then shuffle my force pile ;) I then play Visored Vision and get one Dangerous time ;) he then plays Voyeour and getss my Visored Vision &amp;#61514; WTF is this?  Its like when Dagobah first got released LOL.  I drop Celebration, On the edge for 5, and decide I must battle his Djas and Iggy.  I drop a Raider+Craft to join my Jedi Luke and Raider.  I battle and he plays JTWY(with Iggy) and draws 3 destiny totaling 9.  I draw enough to kill both and some.  He drains on his turn and draws up so I cant play any more edges or use Celebration.  I win by 24.<br/>
<br/>
Now Im 4-0 and in first place&amp;#8230;WTF?  I am like a complete scrub(1873 going in), but oh well.  Now on to game 5.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
My LS Raiders vs. John Stacks(1900) HD Mains, no duel<br/>
<br/>
This should be easy for my deck, but that plan changes as soon as I draw my hand.  I get like no TT/OOC and Dash, the rest is red.  His turn, he drops Cor.DB, Mara and stick to my Tat.DB, and Rendili and passes.  My turn I activate, drop Dash and Outrider to my &lt;&gt;DB, pull Kessel, and fly Dash up, draw 4 getting a Control/TV.  His turn(lets not forget he activates a million per turn b/c Im not flipped) he drops DLOTS to the Cantina and the CC:DB, flips, and moves Mara in.  My turn, Tunnel for Battle Plan, and see a TT/OOC, but I need a DB for activation and flip, so I drop a Raider/Craft to my TatDB and flip, so I draw the rest and luckily get to Terminate Visage.  His turn, he drops Emperor to Cantina, Tempest 1 infront of my Raider, DLOTS gets his stick(ouch), and he moves out.  My turn, Ive got to go for it now.  I play that last Tunnel OOP and get Blast the Door Kid(thanks Hayes!) and drop Protector in front of DLOTS and Tempest 1 with my raider/craft.  Battle, exclude Vader, and draw 3 destiny&amp;#8230;that&amp;#8217;s Tempest 1 and 9.  WOULDA been 18 if I had the doubler, but I didn&amp;#8217;t.  I move away Chewie to CCDB, Raider to my &lt;&gt;DB, and draw up some goodies.  His turn, he drops Evazan Combo and EPP Fett to the CCDB.  Battles and draws a 4 to send Chewie from forfeit 10-0.  Great, that&amp;#8217;s chewie and 8m DLOTS goes into Cantina.  My turn, I put EPP Han in Falcon to Kessel to even out this freaking damage thing, and I can&amp;#8217;t kill Vader now that hes back inside&amp;#8230;so I drop Luke and Raider to my &lt;&gt;DB.  His turn, he drops Chimaera(barrier) and then Z in MH to my kessel.  Shoot, My turn, I drop I&amp;#8217;ll Take the leader, and move Dash over, and Han to Tatooine.  So I get a drain for 3 at kessel every other turn.  I have some drains on ground but he blocks the majority of them with a large crew.  So&amp;#8230;I end up losing On the Edge off the top and playing it to get 4 back.  I chase him in space while he chases me on the ground.  He has a drain of 3 in the Cantina that I must block cuz I have 2 force left and so does he.  So I land Falcon move Han in(1 force), move a Raider on craft in front of Empy at Tat.DB(free), move Outrider w/ Dash and a Raider in front of Z in MH at Kessel since Chimaera died the turn before(1 force), and give him the &lt;&gt;DB since he has EPP Fett, Evazan Combo, and Tempest 1.  His turn, he activates 1 and leaves one in reserve.  He drains me for 1 dropping me to 1, He cant move Zuckuss or I win, but if Zuckuss stays I battle him and kill him for win.  So he kills Han and draws a Tarkin.  On my turn, I drain him for one with Luke on the DS:DB and battle Zuckuss, sure enoguh, he draws Tarkin and has Power reduced by 10 leaving(Dash/my AO) him with 1.  So he loses Zuckuss, 3, and the game.  WHEW!  I ran away quickly cause I hate playing in games so close!  LOL, I win the game by 1 force.  Guess what that one card was&amp;#8230;?  My Japanese On the Edge!  Shoot.(John wrote the same game with more detail&amp;#8230;his UserID is Stack, check his TR if you want).<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I am 5-0 and still in first place.  I must be dreaming or lucky cuz I am in first with 10(+85).  But now I get paired with Commieboy, so this should be exciting since Ive never gotten to play him before and he is a high-rated player and a solid one at that.  Did I mention the entire room cheared for Charlie and 2 people told me good luck?  It was pretty darn funny!<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
My AOBS vs. Charlie Herrens(2087) WYS Winkelhaus Style aka my deck is better than his<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I suppose this match-up is in my favor, but not really since he has 3 Lukes, and easy drain on 3 at Kessel.  I get pretty bad hand&amp;#8230;NO Empys, no vigos, no P of the F.  My turn, I pull Monnok, drop Kuat, , and start looking through my deck for a Cor.DB, also checking if I activated my Emperor But the TD tells me to continue on with my Deploy phase&amp;#8230;?  That stinks, I had barely gotten thru once but he saw me put the DB out.  Anyway, I move Xizor over and do draw an Empy and a Vigo, better!  His turn, Dash and Outrider go to Tatooine and he draws some.  My turn, I Monnok him for 2 EPP Lukes and see EPP Han, Chewie, Tripler, Power Pivot, which is bad, and I get Xizor and Empy and Vigo all to the DS:DB.  Well, he drains for 1, puts out Battle Plan, and puts Mirax in Falcon to Tatooine.  So I decide not to lose to beatdown, so I drop more stuff to DS:DB which was probably Mistake #1, playing too defensive, and I put a POTF to my DS:DB.  His turn, he puts Luke, Han, Chewie, and Mirax(moved) into the Cantina, Dash goes to Kessel.  So my turn I drain and move Empy, Dengar, Guri, EPP Fett over to Tat.DB.  Leaving Xizor, Vigo, and Djas at my DS:DB.  I don&amp;#8217;t want to move inside since I know hell battle, hit Guri and Proficiency her to my Lost pile and draw at least 3 destiny.  He goes, drains at Kessel and Cantina, Drops his AO(ITTL), and moves Chewie over(lightninged), moves Mirax over and embarks her into Falcon and takes off to Tatooine.  My turn, I drop Stinger and Zuckuss to Tatooine and kill Mirax with attrition, and throw a Prescence on the TatooineDB.  His turn, he drains me, and drops ECC Lando(barrier), Talon Karde, and a RFC to ym DS:DB.  My turn, I move Dengar and Fett over dropping 4Lom also.  This is way too defensive, I don&amp;#8217;t even know why I am played so defensive in this game(he had already lost Triple, RLR, and Beggar).  So we continue draining and stuff, but I cant move Empy in to the Cantina to Lightning cuz of his game text(which I am scrub and forget), and cant take a crew in their either cuz theyre all at the DSDB.  So he runs Talon and drew over to the &lt;&gt;DB and I cant do jack now except pay 6 to drain for 4 each turn at both DBs since he cleared me off Tatooine.  Well, hes got Kessel, Cantina, and a couple Control/TVs in his lost pile and this puts him ahead in the damage race.  He finally drains, and then uses his Draw their Fire twice retrieving 2, and making me lose my last 2.  These extra 2 put him up for a win at 9 force.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Monnok<br/>
Lows: Playing way too defesive even though it was a beatdown deck, I kept on forgetting the Emps game text because I am a scrub.  Oh well, I missed confrontation cuz of it.<br/>

Charlie beats Mike in the final while we go eat at Applebees.  We get home at 1:00 and Im working at 11 in the morning which is not good LOL.  So,. It was a great trip and I don&amp;#8217;t regret going.  It was funning seeing Team Atlanta and Art with his Ghetto Bandana!<br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Charlie for winning it.  (Wish I coulda played against your DS though, especially if it was the same as Drakes and Michaels)<br/>
Landon, Carmine, Jim, and Nick for actually coming up and playing, I was impressed at their performance.<br/>
Kevin for running a good tourney.<br/>
The assistant TD who watched Game 4, I cant remember his name but he was nice!<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
For the Raider deck for scaring me in Games 2&amp;5!  Its 11-0 though.  Dead with Tatooine Expansion.<br/>
Me, for letting the final be consisted of 2 team-Atlanta members.<br/>
All the people who thought I was a cheater based off misinterpreted lies.<br/>
The guy in Game 3, for giving me an unpleasant experience to say the least&amp;#8230;oh yeah, and blasting my reputation afterwards?  That too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just tried to delete all those apostophy thingies, hope I got em all.  I KNOW I&amp;#8217;ll see everybody at the Atlanta DPC, but I HOPE to see some Atlanta guys make the drive down for the AugustaCon on June 2nd and 3rd(dmail me).  Itll be a blast, and that&amp;#8217;s just about it.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.<br/>
