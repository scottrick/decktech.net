<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">we have renamed columbus to be Origins Ohio.  columbus is g@y.  the only reason we go there is because of origins, therefore it will forever be known as origins.  thank you.<br/>
<br/>
i’m really kinda disoriented right now, as far as what to use for SW decks for the open...but i just decide to use the decks that i’ve been messing around with for the last couple weeks because i know i can play them well...so there’s no last minute indecision on what to play.  light side, for the first time ever i go with Hayes Pile ’cause it’s great meta against all the dark side jizz out there that people think can get around WYS.  dark side i go with SYCFA start and a large (or fairly large) space package to drain with chiraneau etc.  it’s basically the same thing as Hunter’s Retardasaurus, but minus the ISB start and the ORS’s (so, imp. command x5 and piett/merrejk/thrawn/chiraneau), and vader/maul/sticks/emperor to make a ground appearance and maybe set up a largely unexpected drain.<br/>
<br/>
friday morning we turn in the decklists and start around 11am (i think it may have been 10:30, but it was still way earlier than i expected).  if i forget anyone’s names, sorry.  i was tired.  i don’t remember my dif. for most of the games, but i remember AROUND what it was.<br/>
<br/>
round 1 LS vs. Guy’s SYCFA flip<br/>
don’t do that again + shocking every turn can really screw up a mob points/merrejk start, but this guy forgets to use his SYCFA text to look for a Dstar site and wastes his piett text, etc.  i’m draining at 3 death star sites after he loses CHYBC off the top to a drain, and it’s pretty much game after i alter the lat. damage on the falcon and fight the avenger off the Dstar wystem.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+26) ??<br/>
<br/>
round 2 DS vs. guy from new york’s WYS harvest.<br/>
i get off to a good start even though DDTagain is out, but he’s draining with Jluke in the cantina for 3 (paying 3 for battle order).  i get the spacefleet up and running and play overwhelmed on his ships at tatooine.  he goes for a larger drain at kessel, and i chase him there.  i can’t draw any jedi to fight luke indoors, so i have to keep sucking the drain of three...icky bad.  he harvests, and harvests again...and harvests AGAIN a 3rd time before i can grab it, and this esentially costs me the game because he gets all his pilots back which he’d lost to drains and battles.  the Black Sun AO helps me chase him around in space with Zuckuss and Guri pretty well, but i lose alot to attrition eventually and can’t push him out of space.  i think at one point he uses squad ass. to check his deck and i see 2x harves...so i draw up my last 5 before he can harvest anymore (i’m losing to my own battle order at this point).  good game, though.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+16) ??<br/>
<br/>
round 3 LS vs. guy w/I’m Sorry TDIGWATT<br/>
i start Scrambled/battle plan/DTF against this because i think it’ll be a dark deal deck, but when he activates BEFORE looking for CC locations, i know i have this one in the bag.  there’s one large throwdown with everyone at the carbonite chamber after i play beggar (which is still kinda risky because All Too Easy might get played), but i end up on top and winning the drain race after controlling bespin w/chewie and leia in falcon + monk on tatooine.  he played a Restraining bolt on 3p0.  blah.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+34) ??<br/>
<br/>
round 4 DS vs. john yost’s EBOX<br/>
i think i have this one in the bag going into the game because he’s not restricting my activation...+ i can chase him with my BSun AO *AND* i’m running dengar/zuckuss.  i take over my endor early and then get out chiraneau. i don’t fear the beatdown too much becuase 8 cards in hand can’t do too much AND he’s +1 to deploy.  sure enough, i weather a couple battles pretty well at LS coruscant, and then he spreads out to 7 systems to drain after dropping jedi luke to hold the 4th marker against battle order.  i send Arica to fight luke (in hopes of drawing a 4 to knock him off the site) but i draw a 3 and have to suck a drain of 9 for a turn.  ick.  i eventually chase him around enough and throw down bossk and fett to fight other xwings...so pretty soon he’s only draing for 1 at the 4th marker.  he retrieves 6 from All Wings, but my drain of 8 or 9 is hurting him alot.  i think i won by 18<br/>
<br/>
6 (+52) ??<br/>
<br/>
round 5 LS vs. steven turner’s You may start your landing<br/>
the pile was made to beat this deck.  i cannot lose...and yet for some odd reason i play the first 10 turns or so just...INCREDIBLY badly.  basically i force choke the hell out of him with 2x revo. and battle plan.  he gets out 3x 1/0 docking bay and is able to save enough to put out Lord Vader w/stick at the 3rd marker.  i suck a drain of 3 for like 3 turns, and i STILL cannot find the right cards with 3po to get rid of vader.  i have to use Gift lost to get qui-gon’s stick and finally cut the sith.  he comes back with some more guys about 3 turns later.  maul and emperor and blizzard 2 w/ ozzel are playing cat and mouse between the 5th and 3rd markers w/qui-gon and chewie protector, and i’m tracking It Could Be Worse with 3po every turn.  i get out the monk and 2 other dudes on tatooine to drain him consistently for 2/turn.  he fights me and kills the wookie on hoth, which unfortunately puts Imp.Decree into effect so he can still only drain me for 3 (which i stop with ICBW), and i lose 1 for 3 turns to YMSYLanding because of blizzard 2.  he eventually can’t drain because of battle plan, so i win by 9.  i apologized to him for being a bad player and drawing the game out for such a long time, but he says "that’s okay, ’cause that’s how decks like that work."  the highlight of this game was cancelling Ommni Box with It’s a Hit.  heh.<br/>
<br/>
8 (+61)<br/>
<br/>
game 6 DS vs. Kim Katon’s Test to 6 podracing stuff.<br/>
going into this matchup i’m pretty sure it’s an auto-loss, but i think i might help my dif by draining alot early.  i get the full blown start with Exec.Docking bay + Merrejk/Piett + war room + kashyyyk + bad feeling have i.  she plays it real cool with the testing...i don’t know why.  podracing is just the g@yest way of insuring that you don’t lose any cards while testing.  blah.  she tests a bit, i lose 6 to racing, but not before i grab ICBWorse.  maul and emperor are draining at the podrace arena, and u3po + arica are sitting at both my Dstar sites to stop qui-gon from draining (i can’t save force to move 1 back and forth because of ’i did it’).  JScoutluke comes to the arena to fight, but for some VERY odd reason, kim decides to cut Maul and NOT the emperor (since her destiny was so high, i was sure she could Off both of them in one battle).  i miss my swing at luke, but draw a 5 for destiny and she draws a 2, so it’s 16 to 8.  luke dies, and the emperor gets reinforced by guri and chiraneau.  i’ve got godherdt + thrawn + merrejk and piett on the executor/chimaera, and i’m using the Bsun AO to shuffly Fett back and forth to avoid any kind of beats (i’m draining for 5 at 3 systems and 1 at the podrace arena).  then kim is like "goddammit" or something like that as she realizes that she forgot to get the 4th test back from the lost pile after completing test 3...and she can’t flip and win the game...  WHOOPS!  i kinda felt bad, but i freakin’ HATE damned jedi testing non-interactive CR@P like this.  i play the game to PLAY and NOT sit around with my thumb up my @ss.  no offense, but games like this usually suck for me.  she draws up and i think i won by 20.  not sure though.<br/>
<br/>
10 (+76)  ??  <br/>
<br/>
at this point i’ve pretty much had enough of playing.  i don’t much like the podracing decks i’m seeing, and i’m not in the mood to loose to another silly boring Non-interactive deck...but i’m in the top 4...me, TJ, Klammrodt, and some other guy who i didn’t recognize.  i’m like "uhm...okay...if i win this next game, then i FOR SURE have to play against a g@y deck" so ...whatever.  i decide to play at least one more game and then see how things are going.<br/>
<br/>
game 7 DS vs. Alex Klammrodt’s QMC thing<br/>
i’ve seen this deck before and i know it pretty much works the same way as WYS space works (with power pivot, etc) and i think i’m pretty capable of handling it as long as i can fight him out of space.  i am totally wrong!  icky bad for me!  i am a bad player for two reasons:  1)  i had no idea that Ten Numb was 1st runner up for title of SUPERSTAR.  he has some g@y text that says you get +48 to hit with a 7-destiny butt-missile.  2)  i had no idea that Power Pivot had ’dark strike’ text....maybe because noone had ever power-pivoted my star destroyers after hitting them before!  weird.  so i am a champ and draw up before he can retrieve his entire deck.  i lose like a bum.  i lose by 30!!!  whoa.  this is NOT something that happens to me.  blah.<br/>
<br/>
10 (+46)<br/>
<br/>
at this point i have other things to take care of, and so i drop.  klammrodt joins team DQ because of a decklist misprint or some jizz like that, but not before i’ve turned in my score card.  well...i guess that would suck to get a game loss for that, so i say nothing.  he owned me anyways.<br/>
<br/>
i come back to the con room around 11 or something and find out that clint vs. tj resulted in ClintHays: breadgame champ.  woohoo.  what a freaking anti-climactic tournament.  i’m SOO glad that non-interactive decks are popular and i’m SOO glad that everyone is g@y.  blah.<br/>
