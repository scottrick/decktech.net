by Martin Akesson<br/>
<br/>
This weekend was dedicated to swccg. Friday at four pm me, Patrek Wallgren, Erik Hansson and Emil Magnusson met at the police station in Vasteras. Henke Tranberg from Eskilstuna picked us up with a rented van and we drove to Eskilstuna to pick up more players. One of the players from northern sweden had missed his flight like 4 times, so we couldn&amp;#8217;t leave before seven something. The bus trip was pure fun, it was like a 7-hour drive with uncomfortable seats and Ricky Martin on the radio. We arrived in Lund (very southern sweden) at one. The first tournament on the Sunday would be the young jedi championships, and since me and patrek only have one of each YJ decks together we had to built two more with the rare cards we borrowed from other players (thanks Henke for that) and we had to write decklists before it was time to sleep. At three o&amp;#8217;clock some drunk maniac came and knocked on the door, and on all windows for like 20 minutes, but we had orders to let no one in.<br/>
<br/>
At Saturday morning we bought the usual convention-breakfast (a loaf and a liter of milk) and Patrek and me tossed coins about who would get to use use the good YJ decks and who would get the bad. I won that toss. I ended up finishing 5th or 6th, and Patrek placed second last (hehe). The winner used the Tank deck and the padme/amidala deck. Anyway, lets go on to the real tournament. I was quite well-prepared, me and Patrek had been playtesting more than ever before. We used almost exact copies of decks. The dark deck differed at one card, and the light in like 4 or something.<br/>

I have put in masterful move, monnok, dark maneuvers and dengar in poo in the dark deck, otherwise it&amp;#8217;s the same as the one I have posted. The light deck is just a throneroom deck similar to the ones used by clint hays and cammie boy, except that i use more grapplers and obi wan with saber. 33 players showed up for the championships, which was good, and the biggest tourney here since the regional. It was also a team-tournament at the same time, so my team consisted of Erik Hansson Patrek Wallgren Emil Magnusson and me. We had got some merchandise from McDonalds the day before, so we called our team &amp;#8220;Mayor McCheese&amp;#8221; and we played with Indian feathers and a bib with a hamburger-guy on it. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
I play Dark Vs Jonas Anehamre<br/>
<br/>
I was quite glad that I got to play dark in this game since I know that Jonas is a good player. He started hidden base/wise advise and I started bad feeling have i. I got a fair draw, and flipped quite soon. Jonas played the Falke deck with some modifications, which was good since I know how to play against this deck. I had a constant drain on the ground, and I monnoked first used and then lost to see what he had on his hand (he had punch it and i know). At this time, the falcon with captain han was at kessel, so Ideployed some ships there and battled. He played I know, but coulnd&amp;#8217;t find leia in his reserve deck, and he played punch it. I drew 2 destinys (2 tracked 6&amp;#8217;s) and he had to loose everything, while I lost some 2/2 pilots to attrition. He got out the falcon again i think, plus a few other ships and started to drain for a little somewhere else. In the end he had to flip, cause he coulndt stand my raltiir drains, and then i probed and found his hidden base and that was game. <br/>
<br/>
FW +10 (i think)<br/>
<br/>
After the first game, all members of our team had won their games, but since i had won with so little I got to play the next game against a player down in the field.<br/>
<br/>
game 2<br/>
Light vs Henke Tranberg<br/>
<br/>
He started endor opperations and arrest order. This game was quite easy, He didn&amp;#8217;t get much activation at all, and I revolved the bunker. I got almost all my effects out, and I had plenty of activation. I got my characters to endor and drained and battled him there. He had biker scouts, and at one point he had that anoying &amp;#8220;draw one and subtract from attrition guy&amp;#8221; in a temest scout so i coulnt hit him, and he always drew 5 or 6 for destiny, so I didn&amp;#8217;t get rid of his characters untill i was able to get all my mains togeather. My permanent weapons were a bit to much for his biker scouts, and i sensed and grappled his destiny-adding interrupt. Henke was playing his decks mostly for fun i think (he had a blow-up-the-bunker-deck for light). I win by 30<br/>
<br/>
FW +30<br/>
4 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
game 3<br/>
Light vs Erik Hansson<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, a teammate already! I know pretty much all of his deck, and it would be a tough matchup. He was playing musicians with the court objective, and I knew I had to get a good draw to be able to win. The key is guarding the AC with as many characters as possible, but the first turn I saw that I had 3 locations in my force pile so I just drew and lost to the objective. He deploys Jabba and Boelo to AC and draws. I deploy boushh, he plays none shall pass, but i choose to sense instead of loosing to the objective. He deploys 4LOM I think, and then draws. I deploy some mains and battle and we end up loosing all our characters there. The game went on in the same style, Have characters there, he deploys some guys, battles and retrieves 3 while I loose some charatcters. But in the end he starts to run out of characters and decides to go to yavin to drain. I drain him at AC and he looses to his objective, I revolve the yavin locations, and in the end i beat up umpas-stay with taws. A close game I happened to win.<br/>
<br/>
FW +10<br/>
6 (+55)<br/>
<br/>
Now Im the highest or second highest, and I get to play dark against Yuri Mori.<br/>
<br/>
Yuri starts HB, which is fine with me. I almost know he plays the same deck as he did at our tournament 2 weeks ago, so I start with arrest order. I flip fast, and when I see him deploying torryn to a starship I go for Vesden with the objective. The next turn he inserts. I activate 4, and deploy Vesden to a AT-ST, and spread out to increase my destines. He deploys Obi-Wan to where Vesden is, but I barrier him. In My turn I search for vader, deploy him along with 2 AT-STs and battle him. He moves Vesden away with obi-wan. He has to loose Obi-Wan and 11 more cards. The next turn the odds appears and he has to loose 2 cards from it I think (he has artoo undercover and Wedge in play). I go for some starships. and set up a drain in space, and deploy battle order. He cant do much now, no drains, and no odds, and not to much force left. I probe his system, and he has to loose some more force. He makes a kessel run for 4 cards, but it makes no bigger difference. Win by 27 I think.<br/>
<br/>
FW +27<br/>
8 (+85)<br/>
<br/>
There are now 2 undefeated players left, Emil Wallin and me. My next game is against him. I play dark, and he plays hidden base. I start bad feeling have i. He turns out to be playing with B-wings, missiles, and x-wing cannons. He drains me at kessel and I drain at raltiir. I don&amp;#8217;t feel like going to kessel, so i put up my forces on Kashyyyk to get around battle plan, and each turn i deploy some ships there and soon my whole fleet is concentrated there. I drain for 4 (some undercovers at raltiir) and he drains for 2. Fine with me. In the end he has no choice but to come to kashyyk, and I deploy Vader and Tarkin to Boba Fett. He shoots with the X-wing cannon, i play dark maneuvers. He shots at bossk in tooth, I cancel with Vader/Tarkin. He has to loose all his ships there, and from there on it was game. Emil told me he had forgotten to put up Yavin on his decklist, so he only had 4 battlegronds and he coulnt flip his objective. That might have made a difference, but on the other hand we forgot that he only could drain for one without having flipped his objective so i guess it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter..<br/>
<br/>
FW +10 (???)<br/>
10 (+95)<br/>
<br/>
Final game against Patrek Wallgren. I play throne room, he plays my raltiir deck. I know he should win. His differential is only +60, and there is another player with 8 (+87) so if I loose with less than 17 im in the final. If the other player loose and I loose I will play Patrek Wallgren in the final, and that is what I hope of. Not much to tell about this game, he trampled Han and Lando, beat me off everywhere I went. I had an activation-advantage in the beginning though, which made him loose some cards to drains. FL &amp;#8211;7<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;7<br/>
10 (+88)<br/>
<br/>
Patrik Sandberg (the other player) wins his game, so Patrek Wallgren places 3rd and I got to play the final VS Patrik Sandberg. Our team, Mayor McCheese wins the team-thing, so we get a EJP pack each. Erik Hansson had 8 points and Emil had 6.<br/>
<br/>
Final<br/>
<br/>
I start with light side. He starts endor objective. I get a huge start, and in the third round or something I activate 15 force to his about 8. I get my mains to Endor, and he has to deploy endor sites to gain force generation, and i get somewhere to drain. He don&amp;#8217;t do much in the beginning, and I can draw all my effects, characters and senses. I monnok him lost for 2 alters. He puts some starships to endor, and deploys kashyykk. I deploy spiral with some pilots to kashyyyk. I drain for much more, so he has to come over to kashyyyk. I run away to endor and he looses to order to engage. I keep moving away from his starfleet. He deploys Tarkin and Vader to my lone luke, but I clash Vader, hit tarkin, and play smoke screen an he has to loose 6 cards. From thereon his vader had to run, and he löoses from order to engage. Order to engage and drains becomes his death, FW +22<br/>
<br/>
Now I play the raltiir deck. I know loosing with more than 22 is kind of hard to do with that deck, specially if he plays HB (4th hidden base I face today). I set up the drain and flip. he plays with raltiir captains and unique starfighters. I monnok him for 2 X-wing cannons, and after that can easily keep a planet for battle order and drain. He cant hardly drain anything, and I alter his kessel run. Eventually I probe his system, and win by 17. <br/>
<br/>
So I win the Swedish championships, I get about $180 to use for the trip to Belgium this summer and sometime I will also get some special price from decipher. Anyone know what it is? After this I played a friendly game with Magnus Larsson, and then we went out to look for someplace to eat pizza and have some beers, but unfortunately we coulndt find anything (it was about 1am) so we just had another meal at McDonalds (you cant order beer at McDonalds in sweeden, that only works in Paris).<br/>
<br/>
On the Sunday we played in a sealed deck tournament with 2 reflections, 4 premiere and the sealed box cards. I got bib fortuna, attack run and some other junk cards, but I had the imperial holotable and molator so I managed to win 4 out of 5 games. I could not compare to some other guys that got like Jabba, bossk in bus and such and I ended up like 5th or something. But I had a 7-hour-drive to look forward to, so it made no difference. We discussed the weekend on the way home, and this time I listened to Deftones and Sublime, quite much better than gay Ricki Martin. This weekend was really fun, and I am really looking forward to the Grand Slam in Gothenburg and the European championshops. I hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
props goes to:<br/>
<br/>
Magnus Larsson who directed the tournament. He is one of the very best players here, but he rarely gets to play in major events. Reeeeespect.<br/>
<br/>
Erik Hansson and Patrek Wallgren&amp;#8211; for being team members and helping with playtesting and such<br/>
<br/>
Emil Magnusson and Henke Tranberg &amp;#8211; for being funny, lending me YJ cards and being a teammember.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else who made this weekend great.<br/>
