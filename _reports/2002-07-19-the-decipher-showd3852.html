<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This looks like no time for D <br/>
So everyone just follow me <br/>
Cause we need a little contreversy<br/>
It feel so empty without swccg<br/>
<br/>
I’ve created a monster<br/>
Cause nobody wants to see combat no more<br/>
They want dek, I’m Madd teck<br/>
So if u want tek this is what i’ll give ya <br/>
A dvdlots a saber mixed with a snipa<br/>
Some  vodka to jump start ur deck quicka<br/>
than a scrub beat down to a hos-pital<br/>
by my forces when he’s not cooperating<br/>
when Evazans rocking the table when he’s operating<br/>
Its time to improve so stop debating <br/>
Cause I’m on the carpet and ovulating<br/>
I know you’ve got a deck Mr. Hunter<br/>
but my methods are ready to take u over<br/>
So the DPC can’t @#$% with me<br/>
and D is free so lets be seen <br/>
They try to shut us down with tcg<br/>
but it feels so empty withou ccg<br/>
So come and trip<br/>
Dark Deal on ur lips<br/>
@#$% that HD on your lips<br/>
and some on your kids <br/>
and get ready this @#$%’s about to get heavy<br/>
they just settled all their lawsuits<br/>
FUKK YOU WARREN<br/>
<br/>
This looks like no time for D <br/>
So everyone just follow me <br/>
Cause we need a little contreversy<br/>
It feel so empty without swccg<br/>
<br/>
Little rebellions, kids feeling tragic<br/>
embarrassed their friends still play magic<br/>
they start feelin nostalgic til someone comes on a mission and starts acting eccentric<br/>
Visage, tunnel vision, visored vision, time for revolution , fukking your activation <br/>
a rebel , just let me dark dissension and ask that everyone listen<br/>
Cause its a disaster such a catastrophe for you to be missin <br/>
Welll its back nanananannananan<br/>
Fix your radio free decipher and tune it in <br/>
and then I’m going to enter in <br/>
endin up under thier skin like a splinter<br/>
The center of attention back for the summer <br/>
Its interesting, the best thing since wrestling, no investing<br/>
and ur tek starts nesting<br/>
Testing, attention please<br/>
Never bring MWYHL to a dpc <br/>
Here’s my ten cents even though the cards are free<br/>
a nuisance? who’s cent ? a @#$%ty company’s<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This looks like no time for D <br/>
So everyone just follow me <br/>
Cause we need a little contreversy<br/>
It feel so empty without swccg<br/>
<br/>
A tisket a tasket<br/>
I go tit for tat with <br/>
warren holland<br/>
whos talking this @#$% that @#$%<br/>
Rich Garfield, you could get ur @#$% killed<br/>
worse than those little young jedi bastards<br/>
and Decipher , you can get stomped by Wizards<br/>
You 6 year olds , you’re too old, its over<br/>
nobody plays lotr any mo<br/>
so lets go<br/>
Just give us the signal and we’ll be there with a fist full of insults, we been dope<br/>
suspencil with a pencil ever since D turned itself into a symbol (knife slice)<br/>
But sometimes the @#$% just seems <br/>
everybody only wants to discuss D <br/>
So this must mean D’s disgusting<br/>
but its just me , swccg still obscene<br/>
No its not the first king of contreversy don’t aska <br/>
Its the worst thing since Shannon Baska <br/>
to do @#$% quality so selfishly <br/>
and used it to get wealthy (hey hey)<br/>
Here’s a concept that works<br/>
10000 other card games emerge <br/>
but without ccg in the sea it’ll be some empty without thee<br/>
<br/>
This looks like no time for D <br/>
So everyone just follow me <br/>
Cause we need a little contreversy<br/>
It feel so empty without swccg<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way , don’t @#$%ing ask what I was on when I decided to write this. <br/>
