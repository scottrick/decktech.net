<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Well, since no one seems to be posting any of these, I thought I would.<br>
<br>
Please note, normally I am a Tournament Director.  I have played in a total of 3 tournaments.  First was unsanctioned, which I went 3 and 1 and won by differential.  Second was PA States 2000 which I went an outstanding 1 and 5.  Third was a Sealed Deck tournament, which I went 4 and 0 and won by differential.<br>
<br>
Anyways.  I was woefully underprepared for this tournament.  In my area there is one other person who plays - my brother.  My future wife also plays, but she lives an hour and a half away, meaning the occasional weekend where we are not planning our wedding we get to play.  So that leaves myself and my brother to play.  So after one attempt at a game where we got 4 phone calls and finally gave up, he decided that he needed to play no others. Which left me with 0 play test time for my decks.<br>
<br>
Went to the tournament (2 hours away), and I directed a regular swiss tournament first.  This tournament lasted 4 games and ended up with Jeremy Kauffman winning undefeated.<br>
<br>
Second tournament started an hour later.  So after giving out prize support for the earlier tournament I sat down with my decks.  My light was definitively There Is Good In Him with Launching the @#$%ault.  No thought as to otherwise with that.  As of the night before I was undecided between<br>
using Bring Him Before Me or Endor Ops for my dark side.  BHBM had the nice destiny adder portion, but Endor Ops could let me get Perimeter Patrol to hurt my opponent from deploying to Endor.  Decisions decisions.  So last<br>
minute I decided to go Endor Ops.  BIG MISTAKE.<br>
<br>
So the tournament started.  Jason McSherry director.<br>
<br>
Game 1 - My Endor Ops vs Drew Scott’s Rebel Strike Team<br>
<br>
This game started out badly.  First I found out that I had 61 cards in my deck, meaning one had to go.  Bye Bye Death Star II Docking Bay.  So after getting my deck down to 60 cards, we started, deployed our stuff and drew our hand.  Next thing I know, Free Ride.  So long to Tempest Scout 6.  Not a problem.  But it had shook me because I had lost what was going to be a major portion of my first turn deploy.  So I forget using You Cannot Hide Forever to get Perimeter Patrol first turn and draw to replenish my hand. Of<br>
course, nothing but red.  So I am still stuck with an unpiloted AT ST, Commander Igar, and a Biker Scout Trooper.  His first turn he draws General Crix using Strike Planning, and deploys him and Chewie to the Landing Site.<br>
Draws Colonel Cracken into hand using Crix.  From there it went down hill.  After taking over my bunker with Lieutenant Blount and planting charges, he pulls a 6 to blow the bunker.  I held Endor for the entire game with Baron Soontir Fel, and actually knocked out a scrub 2/2 character using Gall and a Scout Blaster.  But in the end, thanks to Insertion Planning and General Solo and Chewie of Kashyyk, I could not make him lose to attrition at all.<br>
It went so so poorly.<br>
<br>
FL (-28)<br>
<br>
Highlights:  Held Endor with Fel; Prevented Tempest Scout 6 from deploying as a react the entire game<br>
Lowlights:  The Bunker being blown; forgetting Perimeter Patrol; Playing like a complete idiot; Forgetting to get Tempest Scout 6 back from him at the end of the game (he returned it when he played his deck next time); Finding out that someone was playing with Han’s Heavy Blaster Pistol and<br>
Blizzard 2<br>
<br/>
Game 2 - My There Is Good In Him vs Nathan Carr’s Bring Him Before Me<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this is my brother.  And at this point, I am not sure he has gotten the point of needing to play test your decks before you play a tournament (he forgot to place a Daughter of Skywalker or even a trainable Skywalker in his Mind What You Have Learned deck and forgot a Carbon Freezing in his<br/>
Carbon Chamber Testing deck).  But I figured this deck he would remember enough of seeing as how he had play testing against one before the last tournament in August.  The game started out as normal with the Emperor coming out along with Gall and the Emperor’s Power.  First turn I get Rebel<br/>
Landing Site into hand, deploy that, and move Luke to the Landing Site.  First draw into hand got me Colonel Cracken and Chewbacca’s Bowcaster. Unfortunately for me he had gotten Lord Vader in his first hand.  His turn he deploys Vader to the Death Star II Docking Bay, moves him to the Endor: Docking Bay and captures Luke.  My turn I play Strike Planning to get Crix, deploy him to the Endor: Docking Bay, deploy CoK from reserve deck, deploy<br/>
Colonel Cracken and Chewie’s Bowcaster from hand and initiate battle.  Vader is holding his saber, so I figure at this point in the game I have no chance of actually hitting Vader with Chewie’s Bowcaster, but tried it anyways.<br/>
Lucky me, drew a 6 and 3, barely hitting Lord Vader.  Luke is free.  The game went downhill for my brother after that.<br/>
<br/>
FW (+25)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Taking out Lord Vader with Chewie’s Bowcaster<br/>
Lowlights:  Watching my brother give up the game after losing Lord Vader<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My Endor Ops vs Wesley Payne’s There Is Good In Him Deck<br/>
<br/>
I knew that I was dead the moment I saw what deck he was playing.  Partially because I knew he was playing straight ground, and partially because I knew my Endor Ops deck was so horrible after the first outing.  But got beyond<br/>
that and started the game.  This time I got a better hand (Lord Vader first turn), but played just as poorly.  First turn got Igar down to the Bunker, deployed Perimeter Patrol and let it be his turn.  Next turn he saves force,<br/>
but I fail to make any note of this because I am thinking too much of how to deploy Lord Vader to the Bunker in a couple of turns to frustrate him over the inability to turn Vader.  Big mistake (again).  Next turn he deploys Home One: Docking Bay and places Crix there.  Out comes Cracken to the Bunker.  He loses one force, and I figure I am safe.  I really need to read my cards better in the future.  I forgot the wonderful "Control" part of the<br/>
game text of Perimeter Patrol.  Bad for me, good for him.  Daughter, Solo, and Yutanai come down and whup up on poor old Igar.  The game of course went down hill from there.  The only shining point was he failed to convert Vader<br/>
twice, and when he finally had enough stacked on I Feel The Conflict, I initiated battle and lost Vader.<br/>
<br/>
FL (-15)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Preventing him from crossing Vader<br/>
Lowlights:  Completely screwing up the entire game<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - My There Is Good In Him vs Shannon Caine’s Endor Operations<br/>
<br/>
This is my future wife.  So I have to be careful in the way I play (as anyone with a significant other who plays SWCCG as well).  Game went pretty well though.  Blue 5 took out Saber 2, and I just dominated in space.  No Launching the @#$%ault this game, but she never really had anything on the<br/>
ground for long without getting beaten off the ground.<br/>
<br/>
FW ( +19)<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Not drawing any battle destiny and still taking out Saber 2; her taking the game as well as she did<br/>
Lowlights:  Not much<br/>
<br/>
So I finish the tournament in 6th with a 4(+1) record.  Jeremy Kauffman went undefeated again to win the tournament.  Overall a fun game.  Some things I<br/>
noticed however:<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, Dark Side could do very little on Endor (ground).  Had I gone Bring Him Before Me and space with the ISDs I probably would have done better.<br/>
<br/>
Light Side is incredibly powerful on the ground in this scenario.<br/>
<br/>
My Kingdom for a Sense.<br/>
<br/>
Why were the two Tala pilots named after drugs? (Think about it...)<br/>
<br/>
All in all a fun game, but I think swiss is still better.  And as I have asked many many a time - What is the prize support for this tournament? <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
