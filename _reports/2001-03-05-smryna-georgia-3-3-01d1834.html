<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Time comes Thursday and I hadn’t been thinking about decks for the tourney.  I knew I needed to improve my Huntdown deck meaning I had to throw out some characters for imp decree and Imp decree.  For LS I decided to have fun with a RTP but I forgot to add in fallen portals.  The deck has mad destiny and recyciling cards.<br/>
<br/>
The day before my tourney I asked my friend Robert if I could borrow his Jedi Luke and he agrees.  So I am thrilled and I exchange a JK luke for a EPP one and took out another card to throw in his saber.  <br/>
<br/>
The day of the tourney it rains and Robert shows up because he didn’t want to play Lacross in the rain.  So I have to give him his Luke back so I fix my decks.  Before the tourney i trade for a Order to Engage , my 3rd Mara and my 2nd DVDLOTs and I tweak my DS deck and LS deck.  I play a fun game with Will Raiman.  He was stesting his HB Mains and he seemed to get the right cards at the right times and beat me like a red headed step child. But onto the games. We have 10 people today.  My rating (finaly updated) going into this tourney was 1558.<br/>

Game 1<br/>
<br/>
My HD dueler vs. Will Raiman’s MWYHL test to 6 training DoS rating = 1800’s<br/>
<br/>
Well I wasn’t happy playing him in the tourney but I was glad that he was playing MWYHL.  Ussally he beats me with his MWYHL but that was when I was playing court. I started No Escape (because I knew he plays with Honor) IAO and Mob points.  He starts Wise Advice, The Way of things, and Battle plan. First turn I grab Cardia and a &lt;&gt; Docking bay dropping it to Cardia.  I drop DVDLOTs to the &lt;&gt; Docking bay for the first turn flip. He loses to Visage all game I don’t.  His turn he grabs some sites and drops yoda with backpack to yoda’s hutt and draws his remaing force.  During my turn I grab a DB and drop Mara wiith saber to Tatoine Docking bay.  I draw the rest after deploying Search and destroy. He deploy DoS and a site and Jedi Test 1. Also he gives the back pack to DoS and yoda jumps in.  He draws the rest and loses to both Visage and S&amp;A.  My turn I drain for 3 using 6 force but still drop Zuckuss in ship to Cardia.  I draw a few and say go.  histurn completes test 1 and deplyos test 2. Also he deploy’s EPP Luke and EPP han to Mara’s site. .  I slash luke but he slashes mara but misses.  His destiny is low so I lose Mara  but he loses it all. S&amp;D is canceled My turn i drain for 2 and drop Mara , First strike and Igar to Tatoine Docking bay and I draw a few saving a barrier in my hand.<br/>
He completes test 2 and then completes test 3.<br/>
He drops Home One to zuckuss and battles but he doesint draw a destiny he is imune but I just lose zuckuss. My turn I drop Chimera and thrawn to battle the homeone. I smash it drawing a 6 and a 5.  HE ops to lose Home One.  His force loss is adding up.  he completes test 4 and I am drawing madly for CHYBC and get it .  The next turn after he starts test 5.  My drains and Visage where him down.<br/>

Austin and I have been playtesting Via the net and chatting by net.  He ussally doesn’t come because he can’t get a ride from Dalonega but this time he did. He started No bargain Power of the Hutt and a third effect (I can’t Remember)  I start Squadron Assignments, Menace Fades and Stagin Area’s.  He is amazed in what I am playing.  His turn he grabs a JP site using Jabba’s Palace Game text.  He deploys the AC and grabs SE jabba using the gametext and drops the sail barge using power and grabbed the sailbarge’s site using it’s game text.  My turn I activate and tunnel for 8d8 and lift tube.  I use Lift turn escape that is in my hand to get another lift tube.  I drop 8d8 and a lift tube to yavin 4 db. Also 1 lift tube goes to DS docking bay.  I move 8d5 to the detention block.  His turn he drops the Skrilling rep to AC . Boleo to Sail barge and a few skrilling to the lower passages which he grabs using the JP. He flips and moves boleo over and draws some.  My I activate and attempt to free leia.  So I missed.  Leia styed ther all game.  (I have awesome destiny in this deck) I drop Han to Lower passages and shoot a skillign after battling .  I play Slight weapons malfunctions to give me a destiny.  he loses another skilling.  (I am so stupid for doing this.)  HE drops Galid and 7 skillings with a merc pilot and beats me up for 30 force and it was game. <br/>

He starts Kessel , preped defeses with subjigated planet, anti sac combo, andmob points.<br/>
I knew this game would be fun but then he said he didn’t have a Yavin in his deck so he can’t bomb me.  He drosp some ties with pilots to Endor and gets Rendli with mob points.  My turn I set up my transit system and drop kiffex and get 8d8 to the prison and draw getting a wedge into my hand.  His turn he drains me and drops some ties with ships.  My turn I free leia and drain for 4! I drop wedge in ship to Endor.  I battle he tries to talon roll wedge but hurts him self more and loses.  i draw a 6 for destiny.  He loses this remaining tie in with pilot and 1 force.  I move leia to the Warroom and flip. and draw a few.  his turn he drains me for 2. My turn I drain and drip corran horn to detention block and luke to DSII docking bay along with Order to Engage.  His turn he drains and drops a Tie in ship to kessel (its the one that when forfeited all attrition and BD against him is canceled) and he draws.  I drain for 6 and drop Home one with Ackbar and battle.  He loses some force and i clear the site.  I move the home one to Kashykk. His turn he drains for 1 and drops a tie and such.
