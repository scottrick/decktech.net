<blockquote><font class="bfont">                       Pre-Tourny<br>
<br>
It all started a few months ago when Kris Earle<br>
mentioned something about having a mini "con" sometime<br>
in the summer. The battle of the Klans was to be the<br>
big constructed tournament, and I instantly wanted to<br>
go. So after convincing my dad to drive 1 1/2 hours up<br>
to boxboro, and then wait there 6 hours as we played,<br>
I started to get ready. There was a Friday night<br>
tourny the day before, so I decided to go to that to<br>
test my decks. I had a HD racing with mad 7’s, but I<br>
knew everyone would expect HD racing, so I didn’t want<br>
to play it. I built a Brangus deck for dark, and after<br>
playing a total of 0 games with it, I took it to the<br>
tourny. For light I had QMC. As we are going to the<br>
tourny, I am looking for a denny’s so I can get a<br>
Brownie for the next day, but I can’t find a single<br>
denny’s anywhere in the town. So I have to go without<br>
the Brownie. <br>
My rating going in is 1806, which is down 83 points<br>
because I went 3-3 twice in two tournaments, so I’m<br>
trying to get some rating points back. On to the<br>
games.<br>
                    First Tourny<br>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Nick Ares (1568) RST Boomrace<br/>
I know I will win because I can loop my podrace<br/>
collisions and have no chance of loosing the race.<br/>
First turn I Masterful Move for the table, drop that<br/>
and the war room, and then drop Janus to his landing<br/>
site. He pulls crix and general han with strike<br/>
planning, signals for the shield is down, and deploys<br/>
crix and kensaric to Janus’ site, but doesn’t have<br/>
force to battle. My turn I drop Brangus to the war<br/>
room and epp vader with janus and battle. I clear the<br/>
site and lose vader, who is exchanged with a DB. He<br/>
just draws some. I drop epp vader again, myoom onith<br/>
to the conferance room, and Image of the Dark Lord to<br/>
the table. I have a 24 total on the podrace, and he<br/>
has very little due to collisions. He plays a step<br/>
backwards to send a five to my used pile, but If I<br/>
draw a six next turn (which is very possible because<br/>
of the multiple sixes in the deck) I win. On his turn<br/>
he drops the bunker, the epic event, and a buttload of<br/>
scouts to the landing site. He also drops Caldera<br/>
Righim, who says I have to have less than 8 ability to<br/>
battle. Then he moves everybody except caldera and a<br/>
scrub into the bunker. During his draw phase, I try to<br/>
sfs caldera, but miss. Brangus gets it back and I do<br/>
it again, this time getting him. So on my turn I draw<br/>
a six to win the podrace, and beat down his scrub for<br/>
about ten. Then he loses 11 to the podrace, while I<br/>
retrieve my lost pile. I just made him lose 21 force<br/>
in one turn, and I drain him out soon after. He never<br/>
blew the bunker.<br/>
FW +29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning<br/>
Lows: Beating on a scrub<br/>
<br/>
2 +29<br/>
At this point there is another player that just played<br/>
dark and one by 29. So I could play either my brother<br/>
or michael sanzo. I play michael sanzo.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Michael Sanzo (1436) Endor Ops racing<br/>
This was a very uneventful game. I fliped fast, put a<br/>
guy at each site, includin pucimer, held on to evasion<br/>
cards in case he came to cloud city, put a crapload of<br/>
ships at the system, and set up celebration. He won<br/>
the podrace but I just retrieved it all. We never<br/>
battled the whole game and there was nothing he could<br/>
do.<br/>
FW + 30’s<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning<br/>
Lows: Beating on a scrub. This place is full of<br/>
scrubs.<br/>
<br/>
4 +60’s<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Karl Sundberg (1841) Profit<br/>
I don’t start aliens because I don’t want to get beat<br/>
down. First turn I Masterful Move for the table and<br/>
twilek for No Escape because Battle Order is one of<br/>
the 3 cards I spent to twilek. Then I drop brangus to<br/>
the war room and let him go. He drops Jedi Luke with<br/>
stick to the chamber, and adds obiwans journal which<br/>
let’s his characters with sabers cancel weapon destiny<br/>
draws. He also drops naked threepio and starts using<br/>
him. on my turn i put holonet transmission at the<br/>
table and drop janus at jabbas palace because i hold<br/>
barrier and wookie kiss. I ask him how many cards are<br/>
in his hand, and he says twelve. I have a masterful<br/>
move that i can play to get monnok, and then i can<br/>
podracer collision a card back to his hand so he will<br/>
have thirteen cards and i can monnok him. This plan<br/>
goes wrong when he senses my masterful move. on his<br/>
turn he drops qui-gon with stick who i wookie kiss.<br/>
that gets sensed so i barrier him. that goes through,<br/>
but then he drops epp leia, battles and plays run luke<br/>
run. He smacks janus for eight cards, and i had to use<br/>
a start your engines to get a good destiny. on my turn<br/>
i twilek for do or do not, and he has no sense in his<br/>
hand so it goes through. on my turn  i win the race,<br/>
but don;t even retreive my whole lost pile because he<br/>
beat down janus so bad.i draw and get epp vader and<br/>
iggy. on his turn he moves qui-gon into the chamberand<br/>
free’s han. on my turn i drop vader and iggy to the<br/>
chamber, battle and shoot at han. at this point there<br/>
is like one destiny in my deck that will miss han, and<br/>
i draw... a 1. so instead of flipping his objective<br/>
for the rest of the game, and being able to swing and<br/>
hit qui gon and clearing the site, i have to swing at<br/>
han. han is hit and qui gon misses iggy, but han hits<br/>
him.  he plays were you looking for me to add a<br/>
destiny, and i lose everyone but brangus gets back<br/>
iggy.  on his turn he drops another han, this time<br/>
with luke so luke can cancel iggy’s shot with obiwans<br/>
journal. I have to draw for two turns to get another<br/>
character, which means i have to eat eight damage a<br/>
turn for two turns. so i finally drop vader and iggy<br/>
to han’s site and battle. he wisely doesn’t cancel<br/>
vaders swing, so iggy can’t capture han, but at least<br/>
han is dead. he hits iggy, so i lose everyone, but get<br/>
back vader with brangus because iggy is useless with<br/>
luke around. Next turn he drops a third han to lukes<br/>
site. I drop vader and battle. I draw a six for my<br/>
first destiny to hit han, and he cancels.  then i draw<br/>
another six so han is hit. vader dies, han dies, luke<br/>
lives. He has no more hans so he starts moving in to<br/>
the death star. I have very few characters left. I<br/>
search my reserve deck and see my two remaning<br/>
characters there, maul and emperor. so my plan is to<br/>
lose off the top from his drains and get one of them,<br/>
hopefully maul. so when he drains emperor goes off the<br/>
top so i have to settle for him. I brangus emperor<br/>
into hand and deploy him into an unoccupied tatooine<br/>
site.  He now has control of two death star sites, and<br/>
is draining for four. I try to counter assault twass,<br/>
lando and and some other guy, but he senses, and since<br/>
i don’t occupy 3 BG honor stops him from losing 2<br/>
force to do or do not. He then moves a bunch of guys<br/>
to branguses site.  I elis brangus out of the death<br/>
star and on to tatooine, so i am now draing for a<br/>
total of three. I have 5 life force and he is draining<br/>
for four. I have a counter assault somewher in my<br/>
deck, and if it is the first card i draw, i win<br/>
because he has superlow power at one site and i have<br/>
superhigh destiny. i activate 2 cards, and draw one.<br/>
it is not counter assault, so i lose, but not before<br/>
brining him dowen to 5 differential.<br/>
FL -5<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none really<br/>
lows: Iggy missing han<br/>

4 +50’s<br/>
<br/>
                    The Calzone<br/>
<br/>
The calzone deserves it’s own section. My brother ordered a calzone fromsome itialon resteraunt, and the thing is huge. It comes in a large pizza box, and it barely fits even when they put it from corner to corner. It is over one foot long, and about 8 inches wide. It is huge. And my brother ate it all.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Tom Holligworth (1731) syc podracing<br/>
Tom is my brother and i never lose this matchup. I<br/>
flip fast and control the the system easily, he<br/>
doesn’t even try to come there because he knows Ten<br/>
Numb will kill him. I drop celebration on the third or<br/>
fourth turn. He takes a long time to finish the race,<br/>
and when he does i just edge back all the damage. He<br/>
tries to deploy maul on a ship to cancel my<br/>
celebration (i had no one of ability &gt;3) but he had 1<br/>
to little force to do it so the celbration stays. next<br/>
turn i drop corran on the falcon so maul won’t be able<br/>
to cancel celebration.  He deploys dominator with<br/>
chiraneu and thrawn aboard, but ten numb blow that out<br/>
of the sky. I end up with very few cards in my lost<br/>
pile.<br/>
FW +28<br/>

Highs: Ten Numb is God<br/>
Lows: none<br/>

I take second with Karl Sundberg being the only<br/>

                    Post Tourny<br/>
<br/>
As we are leaving the tourny, I see a dennys and want<br/>
to get the brownie for the tournament the next day,<br/>
but my mom says we are in the wrong lane and she<br/>
doesn’t want to turn around, so even though i found a<br/>
dennys, I couldn’t get the brownie. So I go back to my<br/>
house and get some sleep.<br/>
<br/>
                        Pre Tourny<br/>
<br/>
Wake up and go on the hour and a half drive to boxboro. Along the way ilisten to Rage Against the Machine (Tech stolen fromAndy Klema.) When we get to the tourny there is a<br/>
piece of paper in the lobby (it was held at a hotel)<br/>
saying that the tournament is in the cotillion room.<br/>
SO after consulting the map we find the room and go<br/>
in. We immediatley see Brentson who is making a new<br/>
dark deck (big mistake) and say hi. Then we go talk to<br/>
Kris and get signed up. When we get back over to where<br/>
brentson is we see andy klema and cody dicara there,<br/>
so that seems to be where everyone from CT is. Cody is<br/>
also building a new dark deck, and i hear him ask<br/>
someone for a rancor, so i know he is playing a court<br/>
capturing deck. Normally i would think that this would<br/>
be a bad deck, but just 2 weeksd before i saw steve<br/>
baroni wrecking brentson with a court capturing deck,<br/>
and cody is using a decklist to make it, so i figure<br/>
that is what he is using. I don’t know how my QMC will<br/>
do against it, because scum is bad for QMC. Brentson<br/>
finishes making his deck and asks me if i want to<br/>
play. So we go into the other room, because the main<br/>
room was to crowded, and play a game. I wrck him with<br/>
my QMC the first game, but the second game he beat me.<br/>
 Then a couple of people come in and say it is time to<br/>
start.<br/>
                The Battle of the Klans<br/>
<br/>
This is how it works. There are three captains, who<br/>
were Steve Brentson, Justin Desai, and Rick Gaudioso<br/>
for us. The TD then takes three cardswith different<br/>
destiny numbers and each captain picks one. Whoever<br/>
got the highest number picks first, and then the<br/>
second highest and then the lowest. Then the captains<br/>
just keep picking until everyone has been chosen. For<br/>
us Desai chose first, then Brentson, then Gaudioso.<br/>
Then at the end you add up your total score and<br/>
whichever team has the highest wins. I was on<br/>
Brentson’s Team. Our Team Consisted of the following<br/>
players (In order chosen)<br/>
Steve Brentson (2068)<br/>
Michael Schiemer (1887)<br/>
Brian Hollingworth (ME) (1806)<br/>
Tom Hollignworth (1731)<br/>
Frank Conaci (1746)<br/>
Jared Greenwald (1445)<br/>
Danny Felton (1376)<br/>
I think there were others but i’m not sure who.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Brian Cieszynski (1774) TIGIH<br/>
This could be a problem. while i don’t take battle<br/>
damage at the DS, I do lose battles. So i have to hope<br/>
he doesn’t have to many spies  to beat on brangus.<br/>
First turn i MM for the table and put brangus at the<br/>
conference room. He doesn’t drain at chief chirpas hut<br/>
and moves luke to the landing site. next turn i drop<br/>
image of the dark lord on the table and draw, getting<br/>
another brangus and emperor. he drops a spy to<br/>
brangus’ site, then adds leia. I think i’m okay<br/>
because i have a posoa to stop leia from drawing<br/>
destiny and i should draw high enough to win the<br/>
battle. but then he adds chewie protector and he will<br/>
get destiny anyways, so i don’t play pasoa. he<br/>
battles, i lose brangus and a card to i feel the<br/>
conflict.he loses the spy. next turn i drop emperor<br/>
and brangus to the war room, and pull a force<br/>
lightning to zap any spies he puts down. I also win<br/>
the podrace, retriveing my lost pile which had two ds<br/>
docking bays in it. on his turn he nabruns luke to the<br/>
emperor, so i have to lose force to his objective. He also deploys bens hut, ben with his stick, and lando with vibrator, and moves them to the podrace arena. on my turn i can either drop epp vader and iggy to bens site, or to palpy’s site. either way i lose two force a turn, to the drain or the objective. i decide to go to bens site. i deploy there but don’t battle because i have a wookie kiss and barrier in hand and saved four force, so i was hoping he would deploy a charcter that i could barrier and them wookie kiss the next one. but them he activates all his force, leaving none in the reserve, so i know he isn’t going to battle, so i play monnok lost. I get 2 qui-gons, 2 qui-gons saber, and 3 sense, which he couldn’t play because he had no reserve. Sweet. He still has a home one, a twix, and 2 other cards, i forget what they were but they didn’t get played so they don’t matter. I ask him to count his life force, and he doesn’t have enough to deploy home one, so i lose my lateral damage and 2 ships from hand. He just moves ben and lando away to the hut. Now i have one DB in hand but i can’t find the other one. I’ve been trying to track where the DB could possibly be, but it keeps eluding me. So this turn i don’t activate at all, just drain and search for the DB, which i finally find. I also deploy battle order to slow down his draining. He ust pays to drain at the conference room and bens hut. I pay to drain at the holotable and the podrace arena, but i have to lose to his objective, so i’m behind in the drain race, but i have much more life force due to the podrace. Still, i want to drain more so i add janus to the emperor’s site, then move emperor, janus and brangus to the DS DB. He again just drains, but draws a couple this turn and moves leia and chewie to the war room. on my turn i drain and move emperor’s whole site to the endor DB. on his turn he doesn’t drain, but plays nabrun on bens site to the endor DB. This takes up all his force and he can’t battle. on my turn i activate all but one. i then search for a force lightning to see what the destiny is. it is a one, so i can play the elis in my hand and still drain. so i pay six to drain at the holotable and the podrace arena, then elis vader and iggy over. since i have no destiny left i don’t battle. i no longer have to lose to his objective because vader has luke. on his turn he runs away ben and lando and moves leia and chewie over to the DS DB. I drain for 2 and one on my turn thanks to janus. on his turnhe moves everybody over to the endor DB. I play force lightning used on ben, then battle. i hit lando. he hits iggy. I capture ben with iggy, but send ben to the used pile because i know iggy will be lost. he excludes janus. he hits brangus. i draw a six. he draws a 3. the only people i don’t have hit are emperor, vader and janus. janus is excluded so i can’t forfiet him. emperor is immune, but i don’t want to lose vader because then i would have to lose to his objective again. he loses everyone but leia. he activates 5, drops corran and battles. he shoots at janus but misses. i hit corran and clear the site, with me losing janus. then i drain him out.<br/>
FW +11<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The God Monnok<br/>
Lows: Taking forever to find my second DB<br/>
<br/>
2 +11<br/>
I go talk to brentson and he says he lost with his dark to justin desai. my brother won, frank won, danny won, and michael lost.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Rick Gaudioso (1770) BHBM<br/>
He was just talking to one of his teamates before this match and he said his deck was undefeated, so i thought this would be a hard game. But Rick doesn’t get to play much so he may not have seen QMC before. anyways, he starts IAO, Mob. points, and anti-sac. so i don’t bother starting anti-sac, i just start Menace fades. first turn he drops emperor and janus to the DS:II DB. I get a site and drop wedge in ship saving one bluffing the barrier. It works because he drops zuckass in ship and bossk in ship to rendilliinstead of Bespin. then he deploys the endor DB and moves emperor and janus there. on my turn i deploy a site from hand and deck, leia and Qui gon with stick to flip. I have celebration in hand but i don’t want to deploy it because all i have at the system is wedge. on his turn he drains and the first card off the top is blue squadron 5. That sucks, i was counting on ten numb to kick him out of space. he adds 4-LOM to zuckass, but still doesn’t move to bespin. on my turn i drain and add elyk rue in ship to bespin, but still don’t deploy celabration because i am scared that maul will come and cancel it. he drops maul on a dreadnaught, and moves bossk and zuckass over to bespin. so on my turn, i drop the AO that let’s me redraw starship weapon destiny, Han and corran in falcon, and put two intruder missles on the falcon because i lost ten numb’s ship. i also put x-wing cannons on wedge. i battle, shoot down zuckass, hit the dreadnaught, and cancel one of his destinies. i draw my two, but since intruder missiles don’t make it forfiet 0 he only has to lose the dreadnaught, and bossk stays. i lose corran now that maul is gone. on his turn he drops mara in some ship and battles. the falcon shoots its other missle and mara’s ship dies. I clear the system but have to lose han to attrition. i finally deploy celebration and track one of the missles and play off the edge for 6 a few times before draining him out.<br/>
FW +30<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning<br/>
Lows: losing ten numb’s ship off the top.<br/>
<br/>
4 +41<br/>
<br/>
Steve won, Frank lost, Michael won (i think), Danny lost, and my brother lost a true tie because he had more cards in his lost pile.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Andy Klema (1925) MKOS mains<br/>
Before this game he tells me he made this deck not expecting to see QMC, and that I would win. well I didn’t know if he was trying to trick me, so i just palyed normaly. he set up in the cahmber, but his drains were squat because of menace fades. I got wedge in ship, elyk rue in ship, han in ship, and ten numb in ship with two missles. I was also holding a power pivot. so i had the system. I dropped celebration and some people on Cloud city to flip. With pucimer, my drains got to about eight a turn and he couldn’t take it. but he knew that I would just run away if you tried to fight me on cloud city, so he just tried to do damage. He dropped chimaera and thrawn at tatooine and put down occupation. I moved over ten numb and the falcon to tatooine, so he put maul on the chimaera so I couldn’t battle. In my control pahse I try to sorry about the mess the chimaera, but I miss. then I use keeping the empire out forever to get corran, drop him on the falcon, and battle. I hit the chimarae, and draw 2 destiny. He loses everything, I lose corran. I canceled his occupation, but i stay at tatooine to drain. I drain him out soon after, but not before retriveing with off the edge.<br/>
FW +29<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Everything<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
6 +70<br/>
<br/>
Steve won, my brother won, Michael won (I think), i don’t know about anyone else.<br/>
Cody Dicara was the only other undefeated, and he also just played light so I can’t play him. He has 20 more diff than me so I need to win by alot if I want to win. We were only playing 4 games because there was a sealed deck and an iron man after this and they thought everyone would drop to play in them. Which was realy stupid because only about 4 people played int those tournaments.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Michael Rodriguez (1556) WYS Beatdown<br/>
I got a first turn brangus, and second turn I got down the Holotable with Image of the Dark lord. On his second turn I got to verify his deck and I used podracer collision to place out of play his tripler. So I screwed his whole strategy right there. He had Wedge in ship and Mirax in ship at kessel with a cannon on wedge, so i played overload on the cannon, and dropped zuckass and fett and a lateral damage on red squadron 1 to beat on them. I drew a 5 so he lost mirax. next turn he tried to deploy dash in ship to his generic DB for -2, and then fly up, but i barriered the ship and beat on dash with epp vader next turn. I won the race, then he killed vader with 2 smugglers, but they both died to attrition and a swing. Brangus got vader back, and i played sfs on o smuggler that was at the cantina, and tried to beat on the remaining sumggler with vader, but he played dodge. He tried to deploy han to the smuggler’s location, but han kissed chewie. Iggy killed that smuggler, and eventually i killed wedge in space and drained him out.<br/>
FW +25<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Placing his trippler OOP<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
8 +95<br/>
<br/>
Cody won by 7, so he was 2 differential ahead of me and won the tournament. Brentson’s dark lost again, this time to andy klema, who was playing non interactive dagobah podracing shiz. Everyone on my team exept me and my brother lost that round, so Team Desai came from behind and beat us, even though we were ahead going into the last game. Here are the Team standings:<br/>
Team Desai 43 +???<br/>
Team Brentson 35+ ???<br/>
Team Gaudioso ??????<br/>
<br/>
Individually, Cody Dicara was 8 +97 while I was 8 +95, I don’t know who was after that. Our team each got a pack of JP, and a JK starter for our 2nd place finish. After the tourney i played Brentson again and beat him again. His dark really sucked.<br/>
