<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay here is the TR the Saturday tournament at Outpost 2000 in Brooklyn Center, sorry this is really late, and some of the details are now sketchy but here goes.  for LS I was playing Profit, and DS was the new Lightsaber combat.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS vs. John Chalgren and his no R3 WYS<br/>
 Really a short game, I have no space so I gave him the kessel and tatooine drains while he fortified them heavily and I built up on Naboo at 2 sites with Dark Jedi.  he put out battel plan but it really hurt him more than me, the only time he came to the ground combos of Vader IG 4-lom Mara and Aura beat him down and taught him a lesson, game was never really in doubt for me.<br/>
FW by 19(or so I’m trying to remember the numbers close)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs Graham the Anal Marauder Neal and his Mkos<br/>
  This game ended in 1 battle but I try for the long form.  He built up a cache of aliens in the audience chamber, I put down leia rebel princess and free Han move out to Jabbas Palace, spend a turn loading up guys them move in to take him on.  He moves everyone but Gaylid and Mosep away from the Audience chamber to try and out drain me, I swap RP leia for Leia and her dildo, and proceed to beat he tar out of those 2 butt-buddies (gaylid and mosep, not Graham and Kohmann) I start to total and Graham just says it’s over and flips his deck. he was probably right.<br/>
FW by about 25<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my DS vs. Kohmann and his LS lightsaber combat.<br/>
  I really wanted to play this game it seemed like a really fun matchup and it was we fought over naboo with Jedi and Dark Jedi going Mano a Mano (again just like Kohmann and Graham) and in the end my 7’s were higher than his 6’s and my 2 copies of Blow Parried trumped his no copies of Strike Blocked.  The play of the game for me was when I looked in my reserve deck and say a saber and 2 7’s i dueled with maul strikes and killed Qui-gon and then moved maul to the same site as obi, used my other maul strikes to pull that nasty 1 from the deck and combatted with the 2 7’s to kill obi.  All in all a very fun game and so far I’m of to a god start.<br/>
FW by about 25<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my LS vs. Andy Newton and his Hunt-Down<br/>
  Okay this game kinda worried me, since andy is a good opponent and he really knows how to play huntdown.  But (and sorry but this game is a little sketchy) my qui-gon killing vader, and leia shooting her own father and then SatmBPing him to save herself, plus andy’s lack of a Vaders Ob to duel his misbehaveing smart alecky son did him in.<br/>
FW by about 20<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my LS vs Jim Li and his Watto deck<br/>
	Oaky really short and swet I got nothing going early and then it was over.  Jim got his big guys out quick to flip and make me lose cards by the handful, and I got jack.  A terrible match-up and Jim made the most of it.  He played well, I never got what I needed when I needed. GOD game JIm<br/>
FL by about 25<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my DS vs. Herb and his random 7’s jedi training.<br/>
  This was the only gaem where I lost a lightsaber ombat, that is wrong, but maul and his 2 headed-stick of death, combined with the generator cre gaemtext made short work of most of his characters (some of them twice) and his big guns fell to the wrath of my pissed off bounty hunters and droids, plus my steady plink drains and his mistake of deploying Jedi Luke to tatooine did him in.<br/>
FW by about 20<br/>
<br/>
Oaky so I took 2nd this tourney to Jim who went 6-0 I got the random foil a DS alter to go with the Sense I won a while ago, soon my whole deck will be shiny hahahahahahaha.<br/>
