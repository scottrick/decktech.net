<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Back a month before Origins over i finish 5 and miss the final after game 6:( Iam really disapointed and iam tired of playing and i dont think i will go to gencon...but Maxim told me we can stay at Gary's room and the fly ticket is not that expensiv so i built a few deck and change my mind.<br/>
One week before i decide its time to playtest even if i dont want to...i play 2 game with my EBO against Ralop and beat it twice but i dont like starting with only 1 effect so i drop this deck, i also got a TSGIH speeder beat w super falcon and 9 sense with 5 obi i win 5 game with it and lost 1 top tie but<br/>
i figure that i only win with it because dont know on to play against it so i drop this deck also, so i got my MWYHL deck but my destiny is crap so i took out the epp luke for jedi luke and i took out the blue crap and keeps only 2 falcon i add more AFA and rebel barrier(HUGEEEEE!!!! CARD)<br/>
for DS i only have a BHBM because i taught nobody will play it( man was i wrong)and i go 10-0 with it but Dom ask me if i have play against profit with it and i say <br/>
Me       -yes and i won easily.<br/>
Decktech -what kind of profit?<br/>
Me       -a pro@#$% with premiere han and wait until you got 10 card in lost<br/>
Decktech -well maybe you better test against a tuboprofit<br/>
me       -oh yeah that true i forgot about this deck.<br/>
and he beet me 2 out of 3 with and iam really upset. Its too late to built another deck and i like BHBM but i want to win against profit because i think it will be HUGE. At milwaakee i met Gary and is mate(he always call people like that:) Bruce we talk about tech and he think my LS = @#$% but i told him its solid like a rock and i fear nobody wiht it. So he ask me if i want to play with it and i say yes but he want to gamble a little and the winner pay for the beer( since i LOVE beer and i also love to gamble) i say yes and we play he beet the crap out of me in the first match and i beet the crap out of him in the second match so we go into match number 3....and its a really close game and he finally beet me by 6( i think) so i have to pay for the beer( big deal).<br/>
After the match he told me my deck is better than he tought but its still @#$% for him...and we leave the hotel for the con. Friday is the big day for Maxim 'Burnt toast' Briand he really want to do well for once(he got 1700 rating and he never did better than a 4-2 in local tourney, he is a ok player)and he take my LS and Gary DS, during the day i was looking at Gary's game he played like 20 game in the day against anybody who want to play him and he win like 17-18 out of 20 game he is a robot i beat 100$ on it:)<br/>
After 8 games Max is the only undefeated and iam really surprise about it and he is really excited about it since it is is best tourney EVER. So we go celebrated and have fun. We get back to the hotel at 12:00 and i want to change my deck but iam tired so i go sleep.<br/>
I wake up at 7:00 and change a few card in my deck and iam ready to kick ass.<br/>
<br/>
1-game DS vs Eric Beach LS profit with alien<br/>
when he flip is starting stuff i go oh no not profit i have a weakness against this deck<br/>
but after he retrieve 10 i eat han with bubo and i was already set on the board draining for 5 and him for 0 so even if he retrieve 10 i was leading the game and beat him by 18 i think<br/>
2+18<br/>
<br/>
2-game LS vs Dan Bojo...(sorry dan i cant remember how to spell your name:( DS ralop<br/>
he beat the crap out of me in the first few turn and he also start with resistanse so AFA dont hurt that much<br/>
and when i set up my falcon on D* to drain and i track my few maneuver for retreival he put come here on table so i dont think i can win this match since he got too many stuff on ralthir<br/>
but i still play the game and after a few turn too my big surprise i succed to clear the ralthir:db but like a scrub a forgot to move the falcon to ralthir too flip him back( that was game)<br/>
and we time the game he count is card 16 i count mine 15:( DOH! time lost<br/>
0-16<br/>
2+2<br/>
<br/>
after that i dont think i have still a chance but...you never know<br/>
<br/>
3-game DS vs Scott Boehler(sp?) EBO<br/>
i got some crappy draw he deploy ebo late so its ok for me iam drainning for 4 and him 0 but instead of going for the drain race( he would have won it easily) he try to fight me but i win al the fight and he lose<br/>
by 22 iam not sure<br/>
4+24<br/>
<br/>
4-game LS vs Brian Cieszynski DS BHBM<br/>
i beatdown him for 12 and he beat down me for 10 but he drain for 0 and i drain for 2 at kessel( he got decree)+he lose one for is obj<br/>
AFA is huge and i retrieve a few win by 16 <br/>
6+40<br/>
<br/>
5-game LS vs Jonathan Carbone Ralop<br/>
i get control of ralir early and i crush every thing he trow at me then i set the super falcon at kessel AFA hurt alot + OTE i retrieve 10 with on the edge<br/>
win it by 32<br/>
8+72<br/>
<br/>
6-game DS vs Steven Lewis LS TSGIH speeder/x-wing beat<br/>
iam happy about the match up since he got a weakness against my obj<br/>
1 turn deploy papatine and +1drain concelor to endor:db<br/>
so he activate crap i stay inside to prevent beat down and in space i got a huge fleet + barrier<br/>
so i win by 15<br/>
10+87<br/>
<br/>
WOOHOO iam first and i play steven again<br/>
<br/>
1-game DS vs Steven LS<br/>

2+19<br/>
<br/>
2-game LS vs Steven DS<br/>
