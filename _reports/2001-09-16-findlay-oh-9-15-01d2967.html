<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well since may i’ve played in exactly 1 sw tourney and that was at origins.  so then this coruscant stuff comes out so everyone is all into sw again.  then dan (the td) decides to start running tourneys again since his new job he doesn’ have to work on saturdays.  well i wasn’t sure what to do for decks.  ls i had :wys but that new retrevial card hurts it, the pile which is jizz, and a dagobah test 6 deck.  i didn’t think any of them really looked all that strong so i switched to a qmc deck thats like every qmc ever made.  i play a few pickup games and i win by a lot so i decide on that for my ls.  for dark i had a senator deck but it looked weak so i played brangus/racing and that stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
anyway we had 8 people so we’re sanctioned which is cool.<br/>
<br/>
game 1 my dark vs shea’s dagobah clouds/podrace<br/>
well his decks are all piles but this one was actually a decent idea.  i win the race cause he’s not playing racing interrupts i guess.  brangus comes out and does his thing.  i deploy come here you big coward and his deck is screwed.  i use vader every turn for suicide runs, including on yoda (who was at the podrace arena with a gas miner because of encampment). well sometime duriing the game i say something along the lines of "haha i killed yoda" or something and shea decides he’s had enough. he grabs my hands and dam near bends my emperor (hes lucky he didnt).  he tells me to stop talking about yoda so i’m like whatever.  so then i’m pissed so i decide to be a @#$% hole and i fly maul in his ship to dagobah and lock the shaft in on son of skywalker.  not much else happened, chybc killed him. <br/>
fw 2 +23<br/>
good-win<br/>
bad-i was assualted<br/>
<br/>
2 vs dans hunt down db duel<br/>
he does a lot of fast damage but i’m playing qmc so it doesnt matter.  he duels luke so i lose my 5 force.  i flip 3rd turn and then spread out a guy at each site.  i setup celebration and start off the edging.  he moves luke and vader to a cc site for a big drain, when i bring out the coolest talz ever.  yes folks caldera righam stood toe to toe with darth vader and his converted son, and there isn’t a thing they can do about it.  and to think i almost put quigon in instead.  well his deck is good but i had too mch retrevial and my drains were too big. <br/>
fw 4 +44<br/>
good-never underestimate the power of a talz<br/>
bad-i lost a duel<br/>
<br/>
3. vs joeys ls senator <br/>
well i helped joey build his decks and he’s a really good player even though this is his first constructed tourney.<br/>
his deck is senate and mains/toys on the ground.  i win the race fast.  my small fleet of characters wpies out most of his, but dr e gets buried which hurt me.  i setup the shaft but he has honor so it only does 2 damage.  i setup a drain at his naboo plains with emperor and janus.  he keeps draining me though and its a close game.  finally i get to 3 bg’s then drop aaa so he loses 6 a turn.  that was the game winner. <br/>
fw 6 +58<br/>
<br/>
4 vs joeys watto<br/>
he has watto mains and raacing.  i win the race but it takes a while.  he flips fast and does big drains, but forgets about the use or lose 2 on his objective a few times. i beat on him in space at bespin, but stay to cc on ground.  he attacks me there and i run away a while then setup a beatdown there.  he doesnt have any way to stop my drains or retrevial though, so i win.  <br/>
fw 8 +81<br/>
<br/>
so i win and take the icbw foil (which i traded for a maul and destroyer droid later)<br/>
