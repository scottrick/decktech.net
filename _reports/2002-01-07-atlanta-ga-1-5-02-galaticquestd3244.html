Okay, for the past while I’ve been trying to organize GA tourneys through my group website, Dagobah Region Gamers (decktech.net/69), Damian Loback pumps us up to go out to Buford, GA on the 5 of January. Guess what, he doesn’t even show! Anyways, going back a week, I am in Augusta, GA at my cousin’s house (mist _hunter) to play some and have a good time for a week. On Wednesday we’re set to go to Book Exchange to play with Paul Myers and Landon Sommer and some other of Augusta’s finest. Guess what, on Wednesday it snows a shi.tload. We still head out to BE and we playa coupla games before we have to go, because the roads are icing over. Paul tromps on me with his Invasion (wtf?) and PodProfit Jank with Sabaac and inserts. I didn’t think that Invasion would ever win against QMC with mad retreival and nice drains, but I lose two sites off the top early and EPP Quigy gets raped by a coupla tanks. I had been working on this Senate beats with force choke and I had finally gotten it down to the version I had invisioned. Anyways, I head out to Galatic Quest about an hour early and trade for the QMC objective a coupla Maul Strikes and Mara’s Vibrator. Now, my decks were dam.n near perfect. I had one fear, however, for my LS. Hunt Down. Could this be foreshadowing? Read on!<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side: Senate Beats Force Choke<br/>
Light Side: Mate QMC by Winklehaus with Ten Numb Superstar and throw in a little of John Anderson coolness, and that’s what I play.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My DS vs. Chris Simmons (1677) Profit <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I’m pretty confident with my dark deck because I had been working with Senate since Coruscant came out and I had finally morphed it into the solid deck it is now. I was also pleased to see that he didn’t race because Paul Myers owned me with his PodProfit the previous week. I start with Mara and Dr. E and Ponda Baba, hoping that Mara will pull her saber first turn. I considered starting with Xizor, but I figured that these two were stronger. I get an awesome hand that included DM, YA, Blizzard 4, Yeb Yeb, and Senate Hovercam (yes, Senate Hovercam). I throw down Maul to his site, use TPM to pull Lott Dod and flip. Blizzard 4 goes down (also at Tat: DSL) and I pull a free Lord Vader. I pull Executor Docking Bay with Begin Landing Your Troops and I play Maul Strikes (Also in hand) to grab Maul’s Saber and move both to Tat: JP. I POOP Blizzard 4 and pass to Chris. He drops down Artoo and I almost shi.t in my pants because I thought he was playing numbers and I didn’t put in the shield. Luckily, he plays A Gift and moves Artoo inside. He plays the Cantina and says go. The next couple of turns are sorta boring; I Elis Vader (now with his stick) into the Cantina and drain for a bundle at his sites. He really doesn’t deploy too many characters. Now, I put down Fett on Crack to back Vader up. On his turn he deploys the old slave Leia and Obi Wan (Tat) and battles. He plays Strangle (wtf?) and ends up killing Fett, releasing Leia and retreiving 5. It doesn’t matter because I rape Obi Wan and drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
FW +16<br/>
2 (+16)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning. Knowing that the first turn win will really help in the confidence game.<br/>
Lows: A Gift doing -1 to my drains with aliens (read Xizor and Mara).<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My LS vs. Stephen Michael (1826) Maul Hunt Down with Deep Hatred<br/>
<br/>
Oh crap. QMC has one real bad matchup and that would be Hunt Down. Especially in the hands of a good player. I get a really crappy draw with almost all red and the old skool Falcon. He throws down Janus and Empy first turn to the 3/2 location (opening hand). He plays Dark Rage to grab Deep Hatred. He passes to me. I throw down the Falcon and draw some. I get shi.tty stuff, again. I eventually get EPP Luke out and really nothing else. He drains for a lot at the 3/2 place. He throws down Zuckuss In Ship in front of Falcon and kills the Cap’n. Zuckuss moves to CC. Now comes the TURN, he plays Stormtrooper Garrison, Fett on Crack, EPP Vader, and EPP Maul (foil for anyone that cares). He initiates against Luke. I have no escape cards. I miss the swing at Vader and, as expected, I lose a lot. However, I do Resilliance Luke back. Looking through my hand I find, to my dismay, a Houjix combo. Anyways, I play Luke again (figuring, why not go out in battle), he plays Vader’s Obsession and I cancel with Resilliance (I pack 3, btw). He kicks Lukes a.ss, but I kill Fett (I think). He draws like a hundred desiny and I Houjix. When I draw a few I grab another Luke and some more red, but still no escape cards (there are 6 in the deck! 4 Paths and 2 Dodges). He drains, I throw down Luke again (I have a few cards left, I know I’ll lose so why not have some fun). He Obsessions and I lose 15 instead of crossing Luke. I don’t have any in reserve so I don’t battle, only pick up the remaining force. He says, "Wait! I have an action!" He plays Defensive Fire to put my last card back and I lose it to a drain.<br/>
<br/>
FL -28<br/>
2 (-12)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: After my draw I knew that this was a bad game so we were able to laugh at everything.<br/>
Lows: None really, although I lost it was fun losing.<br/>
<br/>
Lunch Break:<br/>
<br/>
At least that game was fast, so I can grab lunch at the wonderful house of conisseurs that serves delectible delights that is Subway. My total for a Turkey sub, a large Coke, and a bag of greasy potato chips was $5.50. I give her exact change and she insists on giving me a dollar back. Tech! I start a game with this kid that hasn’t played since Dagobah, but we have to stop because the pairings are announced.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Joshua Gruver (1737) AoBS<br/>
<br/>
I knew this was going to be a good game, in my favor. I got an awesome draw; Falcon, DSII Wedge, EPP Luke, and Melas. Probably some escape cards in there as well. I’m not sure the exact order in which these events happened, but I do know that by the 4th turn I had 4 CC sites (all occupied) CC (with Wedge and Elyhk Rue) and Bespin (with Dash and Cap’n Han). He has lotsa bounty hunters and everything and we have a few skirmi...I mean battles ;). Snoova is da shi.t because he captures EPP Obi and EPP Quiggy! How the hel.l does that happen? I suicide a few guys and I Path Luke (all four in hand by turn 3) around keeping his objective flipped. He’s playing some crazy battle droid mess so my force drains (except Melas’) are all -1. Anyways, He plays Omni Box right before I play Off The Edge, screwing my tracked 7, so I retrieve 3. CC Celebration comes out late, but it really helps. I had like 5 cards in lost at the end of the game, but midgame there was like 20. I take the win, throwing me back to posititive dif.<br/>
<br/>
FW +23<br/>
<br/>
4 (+11)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Good game, took a long time to play though. It went back and forth who the victor was going to be several times, and I enjoy games like that.<br/>
Lows: None.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs. Stephen Michael (1826) QMC<br/>
<br/>
In some extradorainary gain of skills I whip Stephen’s as.s and beat him by 30. Actually, he wanted to play in the LotR tourney and told me that there was no way I was ever going to take first from him because he was 6(+81). He wants to drop and give me a win of 30. I say, okay, thats cool. Solidly putting me in second place.<br/>
<br/>
FW +30<br/>
<br/>
6 (+41)<br/>
<br/>
So I finish at second place, right behind Stephen. I grab the supercool (sic) Alter (DS) tourney foil and two packs of Theed. Dissapointing, actually, I pull Naboo Celebration and some stupid rare droid. I try and start another game with that Dagobah guy, but I have to go.<br/>
<br/>
Top 2:<br/>
<br/>
Stephen Michael 6 (+51)<br/>
John Anderson (me) 6 (+41)<br/>
<br/>
I’m not sure of the rest because I had to go before the other games finished. I’m really considering getting into LotR competitively. I picked up a deluxe starter while I was there for 15 bucks and in my pack I pull the Rare Frodo. Pretty cool. The game itself is really well balanced, especially the Twillight Pool. It’s are really cool mecahnic. Also, I need something to spend my hard earned money on, since Star Wars lost their liscence. I think I have a while before I get the cards to go to a tourney, however. <br/>
<br/>
