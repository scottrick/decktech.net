<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I just pasted this from Word...so however it comes it comes.<br/>
<br/>
Well I really wanted to write this report sooner, so everything was still fresh in my mind,<br/>
but that just wasn&amp;#8217;t meant to be.  I was burnt, and needed some good relax time.  Anyway,<br/>
since I was unable to make Origins, I was really looking forward to this one.  And as it<br/>
turns out this is going to be my only Major Convention this year, except Dcon.  Past years<br/>
I was able to make much more.  Wow I just don&amp;#8217;t have the money I used to have<br/>
anymore.  Now this report will be broken up starting with Pre-Tourney stuff, then actual<br/>
games, and then After Tourney stuff.  So depending one what you want to read, skip to<br/>
whatever part.  But note, that I do read a lot of your reports, so go ahead and take the<br/>
time to read mine. :)<br/>
<br/>
Pre-Tourney stuff:<br/>
<br/>
Well this trip starts off with only ME and Shane Watner, as for sure people to go.  Dan<br/>
Christy was going to go, but ended up not to, and then we got Matt Berta to go, and Ted<br/>
Hansen.  My goal was to have at least for in my car, and I got that.  Me, Ted, Shane, and<br/>
Matt.  Other Vegas players were going, but not with us, like Chris Hines, Brad Bedlion,<br/>
and Robert Corbett.  Still others, but not sure on names.  Now the four of us in my car<br/>
were always playtesting, and trying new things out, and pretty much was ready.  I<br/>
probably was the only one who didn&amp;#8217;t test as much as I would have liked.  I am not sure<br/>
why, but it seems like after every year that goes by, I get less, and less time to play this<br/>
game, that I like so much.  Maybe because my kids are getting older every year, and they<br/>
need my time.  Still to young to get this game.  But I wasn&amp;#8217;t worried, even with a bad<br/>
deck, I should be ok... well its a nice thought :)  We leave Vegas around 3:00 PM maybe<br/>
later on Thursday.  So that pretty much means our fun starts Friday.  Well not<br/>
exactly...Ted decides it is a good Idea to stop and get some beer while we test some<br/>
decks.  Of course for those that know me, drinking is always a part of the fun.  So we get<br/>
our 18 pack.  I only ended up having 7 beers in 3 hours, and sleeping at 2:30 in the<br/>
morning.  Probably not the best decision before an Open, but what can I say, I might have<br/>
a problem? :)  So Friday morning comes around and Shane Watner is really the only one<br/>
completely ready, since he was smart enough to have only 1 drink and sleep at<br/>
12:00midnight.  And he even did his decklist the night before, wow...  So I write that out<br/>
quickly, and we head on down.  Some funny sh it happened, but for some reason I am<br/>
unable to relate it...getting old I guess.  Anyway the decks I went with were WYS<br/>
beatdown, with no Podracing(because I hate racing, and I wanted to show I could win<br/>
without it). And a Killer Huntdown old school, that kind of relies on luck, but when you<br/>
get locations it is Fast and Furious.  Thanks Alex for the help with that deck. Mr. Avatar<br/>
himself pretty much help with my Darkside decision, and dispite it losing, I still think it<br/>
was a good decision.  So here is a break down of what my group was playing.<br/>
<br/>
Me Tim Guzman: LS WYS DS Old school HD<br/>
Shane Watner: LS MWYHL Racing DS HD Racing<br/>
Matt Berta: LS Hayes Pile DS HD Racing..<br/>
Ted Hansen: LS HB flip DS ISB with Frostbite(teched out)<br/>
<br/>
Now I suppose I will go on to the games<br/>
<br/>
Game1: My LS Vs Erik Stepnitz Tie deck...Rating 1433<br/>
<br/>
This poor kid.  I wonder what keeps kids like this playing.  I respect him for that.  Anyway<br/>
he starts with the TIE system...(I am not going to try to spell it when I am typing so fast)<br/>
and start with Twilek and Siennar fleet.  To make a short story shorter, I drew Dodge in<br/>
my open hand so I wanted a quick start so I put a scrub down in cantina to drain, and he<br/>
never battle him, in fact at one point he puts Merrik at my docking bay, and says...get this<br/>
he says..I could get my system with this guy, and now what happens...he starts drawing.  I<br/>
almost starting laughing out loud right then but I control myself.  I was like cool, that guy<br/>
gets system, but for some reason you didn&amp;#8217;t get system, but oh well do you mind if I<br/>
deploy these couple of guys, and kick Meijirks @ss.  Well anyway I finish the game with<br/>
no cards in lost pile thanks to Celebrate, and 4 cards in hand.  Full Win by 41.<br/>
Total: 2(+41)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well it was an easy win, but I really didn&amp;#8217;t want a big win at first.<br/>
Lows: I just r aped a kid, I should be ashamed of that...hope it doesn&amp;#8217;t happen to me.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in my group wins except Shane.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My DS vs Caleb Smith&amp;#8217;s WYS Racing.... Rating 1876<br/>
<br/>
Well I kind of remember Caleb from Vegas DPC, and we did talk over Dmail, so he is<br/>
cool, and he is a good player for being kind of new to the game with only like 70 tourney<br/>
games under his belt...or something like that?  Anyway he played pretty good during this<br/>
game, but made a mistake at the start, when he pulled his podracing stuff, he didn&amp;#8217;t put his<br/>
starting interrupt back into his deck, and we he drew his hand, he loved it to much for my<br/>
taste, so the judge ruled that he needed to put the interrupt back in his deck, and redraw. <br/>
Sorry Caleb, I still feel bad about that, but an open is an open... He still play good, but<br/>
with what I was going with, he had a small chance to win it overall.  I was draining at  a<br/>
endor site, and cloud city site, and had Visage killing him every turn, I lost the race of<br/>
course without a racing, but I didn&amp;#8217;t care.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t retrieve because of the plans, and<br/>
things look good for me.  I get a Full win by 18.<br/>
Total: 4(+59)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Well I did enjoy playing Caleb he was a cool opponent, and being at the top table<br/>
after one game was cool too.<br/>
Lows: Making him draw a new hand for his honest mistake...sorry, however I will do it<br/>
again... :)<br/>
<br/>
Only two games go by, and I am told there is 6 more...oh boy...something I didn&amp;#8217;t mention<br/>
is that I had a serious HEADACHE.  I thought I was going to cry at time.  Here I am, in<br/>
the TOP spot, granted only 2 games went by, but I didn&amp;#8217;t feel good, and I was wondering<br/>
if I should get more sleep.  I am not really the type to drop out so I don&amp;#8217;t, but I had a<br/>
migraine, that felt like my head was going to explode.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 MY LS vs Joseph Floyd&amp;#8217;s Brangus with Numbers, racing...Rating ????	<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn&amp;#8217;t get his rating, but he is from San Diego, for those that care to look.  He<br/>
pretty much had my number in the past winning against me at past ComicCon games. <br/>
When I saw the Superstar on this site I really wasn&amp;#8217;t worried about it. This guy took it to<br/>
a new level however.  But lucky for me, I had what I needed at the right time.  First on the<br/>
second or third turn, I grimtaash...I get 2 Brangus, 2 Podrace Collision, 2 DS<br/>
dockingbays, and 2 or something else.  I was only hoping for 2 Brangus&amp;#8217;, but It was a no<br/>
go.  He like that was a way to good Grimtaash, and I am thinking, that it was too much,<br/>
because then I played OOC....now you see why only 2 brangus would have been better. <br/>
Anyway he has like 10 or 11 cards in his lost pile, and I choose one.  Guess what I<br/>
grabbed...Yes I did it.  I take Brangus out of the game.  But he still plays very well, and<br/>
kills some ships in space, and hits me with numbers for 7 and the damage goes back and<br/>
forth, but I win it.  Full Win by 11<br/>
Total 6(+70)<br/>
<br/>
highs: Well still top spot on top table, and beating Brangus.<br/>
Lows: Winning by 11...Hmmmm I wondering if losing the Tat system had anything to do<br/>
with that.<br/>
<br/>
Well if I remember correctly, everyone in my group was winning, and at the start of game<br/>
4 we had 5 players from Tatooine on the top table, and 4 were from Vegas...got to love it. <br/>
OH and the four from Vegas were all in my group.  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My DS vs Paul McKelvey&amp;#8217;s WYS Racing Rating 1924<br/>
<br/>
Well I did say that my dark deck kind of relies on luck.  Pretty much if I do not find my<br/>
sites, it could be a tough game.  Well, I never met Paul before, but I will never forget this<br/>
guy, because he made me pull down my pants, and then he r aped me in front of<br/>
everybody.  I thought Maul with Saber was safe in the cantina for a turn, I was wrong.  He<br/>
drops Luke with Saber, and 2 other smugs, and hits maul, while I miss my swing and draw<br/>
a zero.  Loose maul and 11.  Now loose Race....Now Drain for three at Kessel.  Now take<br/>
it up the @ss.  I couldn&amp;#8217;t  find sh it but red cards and I couldn&amp;#8217;t do anything, but lose.. He<br/>
has no cards in his Lost pile.  I fu cking suck... Full Loss by 40...yes you see it right.<br/>
Total 6(+30)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Yea right... Ah... the pressure is off I guess?<br/>
Lows:  This deck believe it or not, could win this match up, just read game 2.<br/>
<br/>
Well this round my group was meant to lose, because we all do except Matt he gets a<br/>
Timed win.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5  My DS vs Brandon Allen&amp;#8217;s RST racing Rating 1827<br/>
<br/>
This looked like a interesting match up.  I have never really tested against this deck, but I<br/>
heard about it.  I get a decent draw, and I deploy to his landing site, and pretty much have<br/>
that the whole game.  I monnok and take key cards from his hand, and he is unable to ever<br/>
blow the bunker, however he does win the race, and I lose the race, he retrieves, and I<br/>
lose.  I am pretty control of the game at this point.  Now he is what happens.  I have<br/>
zuchuss at Endor Draining for 2 and then draining for a total of 5 or was it 4 on the<br/>
ground.  I will win as long as he doesn&amp;#8217;t beat me down.  MY headache is really pounding<br/>
in my head right now...I mean really bad...I can barely think.  I look at my hand and<br/>
decided to risk it that he doesn&amp;#8217;t have Draw their Fire in his deck.  I janus and say GO. <br/>
He drains no big deal, and then plays OOC on my lost pile, I didn&amp;#8217;t like that, but in my<br/>
mind everything was cool...He deploys Homeone, and a couple of characters, and no he<br/>
doesn&amp;#8217;t deploy Draw their fire.  I look at my lost pile and say man that OOC hurt me, but<br/>
what my dum @#$% did, and don&amp;#8217;t ask me why I just did it.  I janus back a ghhhk last turn. <br/>
Here I am worried about draw their fire, and he didn&amp;#8217;t even need it.  I just gave him the<br/>
win, because I just can&amp;#8217;t play attention to what I am doing.  Moral of the story do not<br/>
drink 7 beers the night before an open.  I lose Zuchuss and 18 force.  That is game in a<br/>
couple of turns...And I lose by 16.<br/>
Total 6(+14)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I at least know I could have beat that deck...sorry Brandon, but I think I would<br/>
have won.<br/>
Lows: I lost to myself, I hate that.<br/>
<br/>
Well I am a little down, because Now I now my chances for the final is not possible, well<br/>
it is always possible, but it is pretty slim.  I tell myself that I will not lose any more games. <br/>
Ok so do I listen...<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 MY LS vs Tim Leung&amp;#8217;s Brangus Superstar Rating 1658<br/>
<br/>
He tells me that this is pretty much Joseph&amp;#8217;s deck from early, and I am like thanks for the<br/>
info, and I play according.  And for those that played against this deck it is kind of tricky,<br/>
but it can be done, with cards like Grimtaash, and WYS... hehehe.  With a RFC abroad<br/>
Dash&amp;#8217;s ship he missed with a weapon so you got to love that.  Anyway it is getting late so<br/>
I will stop this with a FULL win by 18<br/>
Total 8(+32)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I guess my WYS doesn&amp;#8217;t lose to Brangus<br/>
Lows: However Brangus does make for a small win.<br/>
<br/>
I am still on my must win mind set, and everyone in my group is too.  Only Ted is not<br/>
doing so good this tourney.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 My DS vs Peter Nordstrom&amp;#8217;s HB Flip Mains. Rating 1834<br/>
<br/>
His deck after watching every card go to his lost pile, should have beat mine.  He had<br/>
some cool tech.  I got a really good draw, and even though he cancel Visage many times, I<br/>
kept putting it out through other means, it was great.  Early I monnok and got two Obi<br/>
with Sabers...and later in game I monnoked again and got two Luke with Sabers and two<br/>
Lost in the Wilderness.  Things were just going my way, but because he flipped HB, and I<br/>
never canceled that, he kept my dif to 17...FULL win by 17<br/>
Total 10(+49)<br/>
<br/>
highs:  I have always looked to Peter to be a very good player, so beating him was cool.<br/>
Lows:  At one point I never drain, only S&amp;D and Visage was the only damage.<br/>
<br/>
Ok so now here is the Top Table....well in my group anyway.  Matt Berta just needs to<br/>
win, and hope Alfred Dong to lose.  I just need to win, not for the final, but for glass, and<br/>
Shane just needs to win, not for final but for glass.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 MY LS vs Alan Jern&amp;#8217;s HD Racing Rating 1664.<br/>
<br/>
Wow when I came home and check this guys rating I was a little shocked, because he<br/>
played very well, not only in my game, but in all his games all day.  Good Job Alan.  When<br/>
I first saw HD with Racing, I was a little worried.  But I did test against it, and most do<br/>
not have many characters, so once he got them out that must be it.  He wins the race of<br/>
course, but never controls space, and Celebrate works the whole game, and with a good<br/>
beat down and some retrieving I am able to pull this out.  OH and he had a lot of<br/>
characters he his deck.  I have to say, with everything he was doing I was quite surprised,<br/>
and he made me actually do things out of my game plan, just to win.  Nice work Alan. <br/>
Full Win by 16<br/>
Total 12(+65)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Well I won... So I am sure I get glass.<br/>
Lows:  I might have won, but my dif really sucks.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out Shane lost his last game by 1...he should have won that, so we could have<br/>
had 3 people from Vegas to go home with Glass. And I won...so I get glass, and Matt<br/>
Won, and Alfred Lost so Matt is in the Final with Mike Girard.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the Top 8..I think<br/>
<br/>
1. Mike Girard 16(+???)<br/>
2. Matt Berta 13(+???)<br/>
3. James Lafferty12(+??)<br/>
4. Paul McKelvey12(+??)	<br/>
5. Alfred Dong 12(+??)<br/>
6. Not sure I thing Nick Boll?<br/>
7. Tim Guzman..:) ME 12(+65)<br/>
8. Not sure sorry who ever 12(+??<br/>
<br/>
13th Shane Watner..Top 5-3 player...good going Shane....Or was there one 5-3 above you<br/>
I can&amp;#8217;t remember.  It was a good tournament and if you read some of the past reports then<br/>
you know that Mike Girard Won... YES Tatooine wins, and Tatooine was in the Final,<br/>
and no Racing decks made the Final... Cool around.  <br/>
<br/>
After Tourney stuff:<br/>
<br/>
That pretty much is it... other cool stuff happen like Shane played in the DragonBall Z<br/>
National Championship, and came in 5th.  Top 4 was getting Money, to bad he missed<br/>
that, and we of course drank like fish up there, with Ted and I taking down a bottle of<br/>
Captain Morgans, oh I guess Matt had a sip of it... :) and the women at ComicCon or<br/>
some of the best in the world, far,... I mean far better than any other con out there, and I<br/>
have been to many so I know.  And Meredith Mckoy is so FINE...she plays the voice of<br/>
Android 18 on DragonBallZ or so Shane tells me.  I guess that is it...sorry for the lack of<br/>
comedy.  If you wanted that then you should read my posting about the JK tournament. <br/>
That was some of the funniest thing that happened that weekend.  First of all you know a<br/>
game must not be that good if only 12 people show up to the Open.  And when 4 gets<br/>
disqualified...what does that leave.  My gosh I could laugh about that forever...but I think<br/>
with the rumor I started and what&amp;#8217;s been on my page, that is good enough for the comedy<br/>
in that.  So funny.<br/>
<br/>
Later... <br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
Dan Bojo for running a great Open.<br/>
My car group for making the trip there and back fun.<br/>
Matt for making Top 2<br/>
Tatooine for Representing.<br/>
Girard for taking it all...and with sorry decks... :) hehe<br/>
Ted for keeping me stocked with booz<br/>
Shane for understanding<br/>
Shane for kicking A ss at DragonBallZ tourney<br/>
Shane for making the playboy chick blush<br/>
Ted for the awesome comedy <br/>
JK for producing comedy.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>
Me for losing to myself<br/>
Matt for saying some jokes the wrong way... Next time Matt get it right :)<br/>
You know Matt it an Onion.<br/>
JK for 33% of theirs Players getting disqualified.<br/>
Actually that brought about comedy so you might say that is cool.<br/>
Shane for scary that poor kid in game 8 :)<br/>
Starballz for not showing the preview movie on Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Well if you read all this junk thanks for reading.  When I write these things, and type fast,<br/>
and don&amp;#8217;t stop until I am done, so sorry for any misspelling, or grammar sh it.  Some<br/>
words were split on purpose to avoid the censor.  Until the next big tourney....<br/>
