<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I just got home, I&amp;#8217;m watching TV and have nothing better to do than write a report.  So here you go-<br/>
<br/>
It all started Thursday night.  We didn&amp;#8217;t have school Friday so I went to Matt, Pat, and Derek&amp;#8217;s house to play cards all night.  Shawn Littleton also came with me to play.  I actually didn&amp;#8217;t get home until 6 a.m.  I had a baseball game in the morning, which by the way we lost 29-0.  Yeah I know we suck. After that I went to the mall and bought a &amp;#8220;Make 7 &amp;#8211; Up yours&amp;#8221; t-@#$% that I wold wear to the tournament.  That night I playtested with Josiah, Noel, Tim, and Chris.  I actually only played like 3 games of Star Wars all night.  For some reason I was in a Young Jedi mood.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway down to the tournament-<br/>
<br/>
I played RALops and Throne room mains.  Yeah I know real original, that&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;m not gonna give decklists, I&amp;#8217;m sure you can all use your imaginations.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my RalOps vs. some kids HB deck.<br/>
<br/>
I flipped, his drain was gone, and I finised him off with a lateral damage beatdown.  I won by like 40.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Tim&amp;#8217;s TDIGWATT deck<br/>
<br/>
This stunk because I had played with him the night before.  I had helped him make the deck.  First thing I did was put the super falcon at Besbin.  I basically owned ground all game long.  In space he tried some ships and ran.  I finally got Order to engage, so he was forced to fight.  I won and then played legendary starfighter.  I won by a descent amount.  Like 25 or something.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Another one of my friends Derek.  I had also played with him on Thursday night.  He was playing RALops.<br/>
<br/>
He surprised me and didn&amp;#8217;t start crush the rebellion.  So I revoed the Rallitir system right away.  I took that and he never flipped.  Then I went to ground with EPP obi. And Kalfnl.  Then he was forced to play the D* because I was choking him pretty bad.  I then went to the D* with the super falcon and drained.  He tried to stop me from owning ground a few times, but I had put back so many 5&amp;#8217;s and was tracking so many cards that he was eliminated quickly.  I won by a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Brian Hunter&amp;#8217;s Friend.  I didn&amp;#8217;t know his name, but he was playing Sabacc against my rallops.<br/>
<br/>
This game was lame.  I flipped quickly.  Then went to space for a drain.  It was a long battle for the casino all game long.  I eventually won.  By now I am WAY out in first differential wise.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs. John Arendt&amp;#8217;s Ralops.<br/>
<br/>
This was a tough game. I got goo-ney tay, a revo on the system, and one on his Dagobah cave.  He was not activating much.  I played the super falcon at the system to prevent a flip and some guys at sites.  He was forced to play the D*.  Here was my first mistake.  I went for the drain 3 at the D*.  Then he pulled another site, put someone in front of my guys and flipped.  DAMNIT!  Why did I do that????????? Argh.  Anyway I went to plan 2. He was all over the place with reacting at-sts.  So I put mains in front of them and played Order to Engage so he would have to fight me and not &amp;#8216;react&amp;#8217;.  He had already grabbed my senses.  That didn&amp;#8217;t work.  That sneeky punk played Dark maneuvers on MY falcon and tracked it.  Then he trampled EPP luke with it.  Dammit that was annoying.  I had him losing force to Uncontrollable fury for a long time.  I did forget to make him lose to it 3 times! Dammit.  And I forgot to drain at the D* once.  I ended up losing by 7.  Great!, I lost to my own stupidity.  Well it&amp;#8217;s my own fault for not remembering things.  The other thing that got me on this game was that I had lost my legendary starfighter from my had midway from the game, and had like 2 chances later that I could have played it.  Argh.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs. yet another playtesting friend Matt.  Shows that I am playing the right people, because they are keeping up with me.  He was playing Throne room mains.  I was getting killed right away.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t thinking and didn&amp;#8217;t start Crush.  He revoed my rallitir right away.  I was getting killed.  I activated 2, and saved them.  Turn 2 he pulled a nudj, and I had pulled a &lt;&gt; site, so I activated 2 again.  At this point was starting to sweat it because he is way out activating me.  So I draw the 4 cards in my force pile.  HOLY CRAP!  I draw the Hoth: wompa cave, the dagobah cave, the D*, and the D* war room.  It was unbelievable.  I play them all.  Now I have activation.  I flip a few turns later, and then it all goes downhill for Matt.  I win by like 20.<br/>
<br/>
FINAL CONFRENTATION vs. Brian hunter.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My RALops vs. his Throne room mains.<br/>
<br/>
I can sum this whole game up in 1 turn.  He deploys Ben Kenobi, chewie, and luke to Obis hut to avoid having to pay a lot.  I have out IAO, so he nabruns over during his move phase to the &lt;&gt; Desert.  Tehehe.  I play sandwhirl.  They are all gone.  Gametime.  I win by 19<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. his Hunt down.<br/>
<br/>
Actually this one was VERY quick.  He lost 2 duels.  Vader lost to Obi, and then Mara lost to luke.  It was no good.  Actually I got lucky on the vader-obi duel.  I had EPP obi alone.  He played tarkin and EPP vader.  Then he initiates and played Circle.  Then he played focused attack.  I am screwed 3 destinies to 1. Ahhhhh.  Well I draw a 5 and he cancels it. Then I draw a 4.  Ehhh descent.  He draws a 1, then a 1, then 5- NO! cancel with glancing blow! Mwhahahaha! Vader is dead.  He loses 6.  Then we finish the battle.  I carve Tarkin and draw a 5 destiny.  Haha lose 6 more.  In the duel against luke I had a glancing blow and a courage.  It was no good for him.  I gave him the worst loss of his life.  I win by 40! YES!<br/>
<br/>
Well I had fun.  Still sitting on cloud 9 I decide to play YJ.  It is a fun game, but I am not serious about it and could care less about it.  But then something goes terribly wrong.  I win!!!!!!  Hahahaha.  It&amp;#8217;s only my 3rd YJ tourney ever. Worse yet I finish at 12(+182)  Holy crap.  I dunno.  That whole tournament was a fluke.<br/>
<br/>
So I go home happy the Colorado Star Wars and Young Jedi state champion.<br/>
<br/>
Also congrats to my friend Brad DeFruiter for winning the Star Trek state championship.  I recently quit playing trek so I did not play.  <br/>
