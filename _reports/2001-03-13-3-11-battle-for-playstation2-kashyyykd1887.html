<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Everytime i start to write one of these, i try and figure out ’where it all started.’ In this case, it was weeks ago when i found out that the long awaited Playstation2 tourney would be held during my spring break.  I made about 8 total decks for this thing, and didn’t even end up playing any of them.  The last two decks i made were TJs Skrillings and my friend steve’s Hoth Clouds.<br/>
<br/>
The tournament was last sunday, and i had Steve Baroni, Andy Klema and his friend Cody all coming to stay over (andy and cody are from CT) so we could make the trip early and playtest all night.  I had invited my friend Justin H20 Desai to stay, but he turned us down - only to find out that my 18 year old sister and her damn hot friends were all sleeping over my house that night as well after they went ’clubbin’  Many people think my sister is a POA and baroni wants her hardcore, and i think klema and cody came in their pants when they saw her, but thats a different story for a differnt day.<br/>
<br/>
Klema Baroni and Cody arrive at my house at like 5pm and we get down to business.  Baroni is playing his HD sevens that just doesnt lose and QMC Klamdrot (sp?) style.  Cody and Klema are both playing the MKOS that battles and projective telepethies, just to retrieve with scum.  Klema is playing WYS for light, and Cody is playing HDWGITM on CC.<br/>
<br/>
SO after we play for about 6 hours, we decide that we need to try this damn brownie thing.  So we go and get the brownie from this lady with 3 total teeth.  I ask for no whip cream because i hate that @#$%, and she comes with whip cream and no nuts.  I make fun of her teeth and she gives me a free brownie for @#$%ing up.  SO im thinking that is some great luck.  Because there is NO WAY IN HELL that i can take down two of those frigging disgusting brownies, i bring one home.  Klema finishes his frist (that would pay off later)  And we go home, feeling pretty sick.<br/>
<br/>
Those three homos playtested more while i hung out on my queen sized with my sisters friend who just has a sick @#$% body.  I’ll give credit to steve for looking down my sisters pajama top though, so he wasnt a total homo.  I passed out at like 230, only to wake up at 3 with a revelation of tech- I thought they smelled bad on the outside might be considered cumulative based on whether or not it is unique, and you just double tzivzits power like 9 times and make him power 186 after only like 6 turns (you drop him at the 1/0 CC site)  Then you just path him and lay a beat, granted taht can be stopped in many ways but at 3am it sounded damn funny.<br/>
<br/>
So we wake up and i play baroni with my rops and beat him down.  I really wanan play rops but skrillings is so key.  We get there after only missing one turn, and i start laying beats with my version of Falke’s Trooper Rops.  So everyone thinks im playing this, and i play the two guys who are packing AFA and projective that @#$% right out of the game.  I end up beating justin H20 desai, and Jimmy the cheater Schemer (he doesnt really cheat thats someone else you’re thinking) and my rops is looking pretty good, but i stick with skrillings b/c thats my first instinct.<br/>
<br/>
The Twiggs show up (bri told me he might come but i kept my mouth shut).  Other notables include Eric Hunter (hayes @#$%ed out and didnt come), Mike rayc Hawley, and Steve Brenston, jimmmy scheimer.  THere werent too many scrubs because of the high entrance free considering theyre giving away a PS2.  So finally, on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - Tjs skrillings vs Ben rodrigez’ PILE<br/>
Ben plays TIGIH and puts luke at the dbay, drains, ben at cloud city with like pucimer and talz and other @#$%, and then he got the downtown plaza out with lando and a talz.  Basically he heavily drains at three places.. lucky for me i play den of thieves right???? HELL NO BECAUSE IC OULDNT PULL IT.  I tried to lay one beatdown to the lone luke with mad skrillings, he tried to fallen portal 6 guys with one portal i was like check it before you wreck it dude (he always tries to do something @#$%ty adn sometimes gets away with it cause im a scrub) so anyways he outdrains me even though i put up a monster fight and only lost by 3.<br/>
0 -3<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Almost pulling it out<br/>
Lows: DEN OF @#$%ING THEIVES<br/>
<br/>
Baroni won, Cody lost, Klema lost with his Dark that doesnt lose, The twiggs and brenston all won. <br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - Hoth Clouds vs Ben’s Chirnoonoo Endor Ops<br/>
So ben is the only person i can play with diff like that, and i knew it, and im psised because i cant beat him, everytime i play i lose to him there is nothing i can do. <br/>
So you laugh at hoth clouds but i get a first turn drain of 5 just about every turn as long as i get a gas miner, a clooud car and a cloud out.  So go screw.  My drains are frigging nice, and i just keep drawing up for cloud cars, cause one turn and starts to drop vader, but then decides not to- so i know hes itching for a fight.  I get mad cloud cars and drop a gas miner outside the shield and one at the endor docking bay, im holding both a houjix adn a barrier just in case.  He drains me for 7 the next turn with all his SD’s and chirnoonoo and im hurting cause i need force to drop 9 cloud cars and lock flaps and battle.  Just like i thought he dropped vader, i let him battle and houjix ( i need to save that force)  Next turn i drain him for like 8, 4 off the top, and then locked flaps dropped 8 cloud cars battled and that was game, he had to lose 22 battle damage after vader.  Next turn i wouldve gotten drained for 10 so i pulled it off nicely.  Full win by 18<br/>
2 (15) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: beating down<br/>
Lows: No drain protection sucks, so does no retreival<br/>
<br/>
Andy and baroni won, i think cody did, the twiggs and eric hunter and brentson all won.  There are only 8 undefeated at this point i beleive.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Tjs deck vs John @#$%in mullarkeys OMDH @#$%<br/>
I @#$%ed john up the @#$% this game, i had him on the ropes he coudlnt do @#$% to me, he retrieved nine with OMDH one turn becuase i couldnt pull secret plans in time and i still smacked him.  THe only problem is i am a scrub and dont know my cards.  I pulled hut influence after he suprised assaulted me for 3 one turn, so he couldnt do that anymore.  I have him on the ropes late game and everyone is watchign this game cause im a scrub and i even hear brentson (who friggin hates me it hink) tell baroni that i won, he gave me a nod too which made me feel confident, BUT I AM A SCRUB.  Mullarky suprise assaults me in the chamber for 13 adn like a huge @#$% i lose em willingly all my friends are like staring blankly but id idnt look up cause im a douschebag.  I couldnt do anymore damage and i lose by 7 cause i suck, but not as bad as mullarkey who took advantage of my idocy<br/>
2(11)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: @#$% raping mullarkey who ididnt like to begin with<br/>
Lows: take a @#$%in’ guess<br/>
<br/>
We go to lunch and i am in dire straights, im spacing out and totally calling myself on being a good player.  Everyone had mad snowball figts at dennys, pretty much the twiggs vs. baroni i just walk through the firefight liek artoo and 3po in a new hope, totally belligerant.<br/>
<br/>
We get back and brenston is kicking everyones @#$% and we think he is going to take it, but i called that everyone is jinxing him, and it paid off.<br/>
<br/>
Game4 Hoth Clouds vs. Cody’s MKOS projectivity<br/>
Cody was afraid to play my deck, and i dont blame him, its pretty nasty when it drains.  SEcond turn i drain him for 6, and it is utter insanity.  Since we playtested all night together, he knows exactly what to do against my deck, which noone else does. COME TO THE CLOUDS.  he got me in a battle where i couldnt get a houjix or a barrier and beat me down for 5 which wasnt bad, but from there it was a drain race.  I couldnt beat down any dudes in the palace becuase he would barrier them and drop beats with some good characters.  It was a great game and a drain race, eh didnt even get scum out so couldnt retreive anything, i lost by 11.<br/>
2 (0)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: ?????<br/>
Lows: losing<br/>
<br/>
Brenston wins again, twigg wins again vs baroni this time i think.  Brenston plays Klema and Twigg has to play - actually he mightve played baroni this time but im not sure, either way, the whole tourney was paying attention to brenston vs. klema.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Tjs vs Jeremy’s RTP<br/>
Jeremy is a great guy and hes really niec and i know him from playing in kashyyyk for a few years together,  His RTP strategy is actualyl pretty cool he just needs to find out what to do after the flip besides drain for 5.  He starts only two effects, strike planning and staging areas.  Pulls crix and han first turn with strike.  Drops Crix pulls chewie.  drops Han to the Dstar deploys mercenary armor, moves han to the corridor.  I activate one, he frees leia. I activate the rest and get my guys out to the chamber and start my galid draining, and start pulling skrillings.  Lyckily i started with the Den this time and could cancel all his drains, he moves leia over, with a palce raider in a skiff, gets her to yavin and is already for the third turn flip.  I get guys out and im draining hevay and hes getting his drains cancelled.  He has chewie and han and leia at one dbay with corran and the raider in skiff at the other.  I get scum out, drop 9 raiders- he portals two but that wasnt enough to escape the beats. It lasted af ew more turns of me running with a lone skrilling while retreiving and draining.  Full win by 22<br/>
<br/>
Highs: tooling @#$% finally with the Dark<br/>
Lows: none<br/>
<br/>
KLEMA BEATS BRENSTON.  i called that one.  Twigg and Klema then play for the final.  I cant even remember who played which side, but i am pretty damn sure it was twigg playing dark against andy’s WYS.  <br/>
<br/>
My hoth clouds vs Some guys rops for game 6<br/>
<br/>
I totally dominate this game, have two projections and boushh out, and am still draining for like five, his forces are weak but i draw up too many and have fifteen in my hand!! flaps and yarna are out and hes like, how many cards.. i was like ’too many’ I have one force, and two interrupts that i can recycle that would put me at twelve hes like ’im going too.. and i say ’ i get first action dude’ i play out of commission... 13 cards.. he pulls monnok to begin his turn.. i play nar shadda, i have 3 non unique aliens, i am all pumped because one is in my hand, the other on hoth and im ’sure’ that i lost one already.. NOPE right there as i flip the deck over, its the bottom card. i retain 13 careds he monnoks my 8 cloud cars and 2 gas minesr away......... the rest of the game is me running and trying to drain and i only lose by 5.<br/>
<br/>
Highs: losing by 5<br/>
Lows: my idiocy again.<br/>
<br/>
Klema beats twigg!! it was a long game, twigg almost ahd it at one point but andy pulled it out in the end to win the playstation2, proving the brownie works.  My luck was so bad because it turns out that when i woke up, my sister and her slut friends had eaten my free brownie... that and i dont knwo my cards.  Tj was right about not knowing the deck by copying him, but its a solid deck and i wanted to try it. i cant see losing with it again... it sucks that i only play bout every 2 months on average because of wehere i go to school.<br/>
All in all the tournament was perfectly run.  THe competition was so great that a regular champ like Eric Hunter was a non factor in the game.<br/>
