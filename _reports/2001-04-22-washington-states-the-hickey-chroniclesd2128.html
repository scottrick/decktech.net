<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well kids, It’s sure been a long time since I have submitted anything, so he we are now, the day after states.  Are you ready to read my accounts of what happened?  ALRIGHT!  Here we go, form the keyboard of the man who finished in 11th place!!!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so for the weeks leading up to the state champs, I am trying out countless decks, and different strategy.  I spend some time going down to Portland with Joe Olson, to see what kinda stuff is being played there, and hanging out with Kilby, Hawkins, and Kitzman.  I learn a few tricks from the Hawk, and I get a crazy idea for a WYS deck.  So, the next few weeks, I make a WYS that just wrecks things like ISB space, and Big blue stuff.  I incorperate some more beatdown a few days before states, and test with my Teammate Derek Snook, and we decide this is the deck to play, since we can’t figure out what beats it.  For DS, I am looking for something to play Friday night after I get back from Snooks house, and I see Hoostinos Texas States huntdown.  I like it, change a couple cards in it, and I have my decks set up, and the list ready to go.  I also have 59 BIONIC HANDS inserted face up on the DS card backs, to see if I can get away with it for tomorrow.  So, her ewe are, Saturday:<br/>
<br/>
State Championships, hosted by Bob Willis at Broken Games in Lake City Washington.  Head Judge was the legendary starfighter himself, Doug "Red 4" Taylor.  Assisting Doug was Martin "Rogue 7" Norris. To be notred, this day was also Mr. Taylors 36 B-day.  Thanks for spending it with us Doug!.<br/>
<br/>
So, I get a ride up from Mike Mikaelian, and we arrive a few minutes before 11.  I start showing my DS deck backs around, and Doug says I can’t use the 59 bionic hands.  Oh well, that why I brought the White card sleaves for.  so, I star desleaving, and resleaving the deck, only to find that my cat ate Admiral Chinareu the night before, AND my hard earned Bionic hand that was with him.  Oh well, I borrow one, and I get my decks set, and the list turned in.  for the Team part, we reform Team Ewok Villag, with Mikaelian, Snook, Myself, and Eddie Turcotte.  We are also known as Team Married guys, and we have a reputation of coming in second at every team even t we play in.  So, pairings start to get announced, and I am off to the races:<br/>
<br/>
LS:  My own Worst Enemy<br/>
DS:  Mutha Fukus forgot about Dr.E<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  LS vs. James Johnson CCT/jabbas prize<br/>
Okay, I see CCT and I think, hey, I lose Han, and Han buddy cards, this sucks.  So, I jump early to space, and he deploys Search and destroy with just IG-88 out, and I tell him okay, then I tell him his card in canceled.  I get my hand set up, and he has iggy escorting han Over towards the Palace, but I drop artoo &amp; Threepio,a nd jump iggy.  Wedge sacrifices himself to save his correlian buddy.  so, I gain control, have Talon and mirax at &lt;&gt;Docking bay, and Han at Docking bay 94, and Luke in the cantina.  He drops Bane and Jodo kast on han and battles.  I tripple the eventual damage, run luke Over, Swing and hit, Shoot and hit, and platy Don’t get @#$%y.  I win the battle by around 10, so he loses his guys and 30 more.  The game was over before han had to be forfited.<br/>
FW + 24<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Worked like a charm<br/>
Lows:  He didn’t activate turn one, but deploys all his sites.  A low for him.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  DS vs. Doug Harvillas WYS thing<br/>
So, I get to play Doug.  Cool.  I know at this game that whoever wins will probably be in the final, so to me it was a final.  So, game starts off pretty normal, and I am a little eager to jump on Doug.  He has Dash and Melas at Kessel, and I set for stun Dash.  I deploy Chimarea, Thrawn, and Chinareau and battle.  I get a couple low flips, but he has to lose Melas, and like 3 more.  Now what I realize is this, I should Stunned Melas, and that way, he couldn’t reduce my power on the next turn. But instead, he deployed Dash, and Theron in Red 10, and I got power pivoted anyway on his next turn, resulting in my stuff dying.  Funny thing is, If I waited maybe one more tuen, I coulda Lateral Damamged him, then dropped my stuff, oh well.  So, we are trading equal drains, and I track a 6 with masterful move.  I also dump a 5 back with Janus, and I end up activating to the 5, and battle Jedi Luke with Mara.  Well, something I forgot, Luke is immune to 6 when alone.  And to think, I coulda put back a 7 with Janus instead.  Mara now lives to his low flip.  On his turn came the cou de gras, He moved chewie over, deploy Lando, battles, and MAra dies, along with my deck.  Doug wins by 7 to my dumb mistake.<br/>
FL by 7<br/>
2+17<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Doug, great match dude<br/>
Lows:  Stupid destiny 5, and Mara not dying to attrition.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  DS agasint Michael Portman WYS (another one?)<br/>
Well, I sit at my stuff, draining and Visaging him, Holoneting his TT’eds all the time.  We are trading some drains, cause I know not to really come over to Tatooine unless I am REALLY set up.  Thrawn makes appearence, and I get bigger drains then him.  DS wins by 14, after cancelling TT’ed 3 times.<br/>
FW 14<br/>
4+31<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  LS vs. Chris Wirfs huntdown numbers deck<br/>
Chris flashes hunt, and the game begins.  Chris decides not to have us lose to Visage, so I agree.  in hindsight, I shoulda reminded him, so thatway I knew what was coming... (his deck was quite themed)  well, I get out Melas and Dash out, and he get emperor to the executor DB with a POTF.  His turn, drain for on, and I remind him he has to pay three, and his objective is then OOP.  He decides not to drain.  Well, Tech more and Vader come out, and I get inserted on.  He has 13, I have 5.  Not a lucrative proposal.  so, I activate all I can, and Tunnel vision for Jedi Luke, and deploy him down.  so, now we are 11 to 13, so I lose 2 a pop.  well, at this point, he can’t jump me, and brings vader over, and I get @#$%ey.  well, alot of dudes dies to cover 17 attrition.  Luke lives, for now.  So, his next turn, Vader comes down after Luke, and I play an interupt from lost pile, looking for my dodge.  That’s funny, it’s not there.  Where did it go?  Uh-oh, what other "just" actions do I have.  Oh, is that a trippler I see?  Why yes, it is.  Well, guess what happens.  Luke loses to his father by 13, so what should be Luke and 4, is now Luke and 30 cards.  So, I lose 30 cards and I have ONE left!  Not even enough to drain for 3 at Kessel.  So, My deck loses to itself, proving that the name my own worst enemy was truthful.  in hindsight, I shoulda just let him drian on the executor, lose a force, put his Objective oop, go to space, and win it there.  I had the capabilities, and the game was mine on more turn (just drew into Begger, Han, han trippler, and run luke in the lsot with don’t get @#$%ey)  Oh well, it was fun losing to the player with no hands as we think of them. <br/>
FL by 26<br/>
4(+5)<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Enjoyable game, good opponent, me so dumb :-)<br/>
Lows:  I had an internal Brain Processer error... oops :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, I am now out of it, so let’s jsut see if I can salvage a mediocre 4-2, or scrub and go 3-3...  "please don’t let me pull a Sagan, please, please, please!!!""""<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  LS vs. DJ Peralta’s TDIGWALT<br/>
What gives, an entire tourny with NO Bring Him, MKOS, or ISB space?  okay, sure.  I get Dash and melas to Bespin, and he then get’s Ddeal going.  I get a couple smuggs down on Tattoine, and I only get drains for 1,1,1, which he pays 9 force for.  My turn, I drain him for free, and get some more stuff set up.  He brings over some beats with DB transit, and my control phase, I Sorry the mess mara, and Drop Han and battle.  I have Luke, Han, Smuggler dude, and paly Don;t get @#$%y.  I get 5 flips to his nothing.  Game ends, and I never had to go to Cloud City.<br/>
FW by 22<br/>
6 +27)<br/>
Highs:  Deck worked perfect against something it wasn’t built to play against.<br/>
Lows:  Menace Fades sucks, huh DJ.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  DS vs. Zach Jones WYS "What, three of these damn decks, and no MKOS or BHBM ALL DAY?<br/>
Well, Zach is doing the Kessel run deck, and has some good drains going in space, but MY ground drains are equally good.  I have visage, and he can’t stop it.  MAra take sout two Lukes, and Vader sits with his saber ath Docking bay 94, cause all his good stuff was committed to space.  I start Janusing EVERY TURN lookign for Chimarea, and I finally get it.  I Drop Chimaear, Thrawn, Something Special planned, and Secret plans, LAteral Damamge Han in Falcon, and whoop up on him all nice, nice.  I take Over Kessel, I drasin for free, and Talon Karrde throws himself to the mercy of Zuckus to end the game.<br/>
FW by 13<br/>
8 (+40)<br/>
<br/>
So, I finish 4-2, good enought to take 11th place at States.  MY DS deck lost to a bad play on my part, and getting impatient, and the LS lost due to a user malfunction.  Both decks could have gone 3-0, but not today :-) <br/>
<br/>
We are standing around, waiting for everything to be announced in pairings and such, and Snook ask me how much these Foild Japanese Vaders are going for.  I tell him, and he’s thinking if he wants it, or if he wants to give it away.  I look around, and I see Chris Turcotte (eddies son) and I ask him if he has a foil Vader.  His reply, in the best honesty of a 9 year old is "No, I don’t, but if I did, my dad would trade me ALOT of suff for it"  SO I tell Snook, and he gives him the Vader, and Chris , eyes beaming, says thanks, and gives Derek a GIANT Hug around the Leg.  It as th emost precious moment I’ve seen at a SW tourny.  That is the reason I think I still play this game.  So, Doug is doing announcements, and we find out now is his Birthday, so I lead the room in a B-day song, and we all get to eat cake while the final duel is happening.  While the final Duel i sgoing on, 3 dudes and I go outside to play card wars.  Card was is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
You take a card, hold it lengthwise by the corners, and your opponent takes a card, and comes down, trying to slice yours in half.  You take turns, each time you are sliced at, you give them your most vulnerble side.  So, I bust out with the Commons and crap, and My Relentless persuit has a good showing, but then gets taken down by a Jawa.  In revenge, I smash a lift tube on the Jawa, only to have the Lift tube get cut in have on MY attack!  That’s a tough Jawa.  So the Jawa finally dies, but I am losing resourses quick.  Then I bust out the WB Untinni!  This is the untinni from hell man, it kicks some serious butt, but finally it does break apart.  so now I get tricky, I bust out a foil X-wing Assault Squadron.  The X-wings are just SLICING through my opponents, then Keegan ask for a shot at it.  so, my foil card, almost Undamaged goes against his CC sabbac.  Well, he brings down the sabbac, and all I can say is, the sabbac hand played perfect, and the defeated X-wing Squadron died a horrible death, right down the middle.  Oh, The agony.   I go back inside to watcht the final.<br/>
<br/>
Harvilla plays DS hunt agasint Nicks HBX.  Dougs biggest misplay, he canceled Civil disorder, but didn’y remove it from table.  It cost him the game.  Nick wins by 11<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, Nick gets a great jump, Doug makes a great push back, but doug gets to 11 card sleft, with no borad control, and send sacrificial Chewie and Mirax in front of Vader... The game ends there.<br/>
<br/>
So, The one person I personaly have not cared for much, wins Washington States, but he played his heart out, and I was the first besides Harvilla to Offer him congrats, and I hope this is a start to a time of Peace Mr. Jones.  Congrats dude, you earned it.<br/>
