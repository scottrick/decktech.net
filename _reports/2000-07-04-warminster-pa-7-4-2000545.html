<br>
Well this was great fun!!  Another Holiday Barbeque/Tournament Combo!!!  It was an intimate gathering with SM Dave Diehl and his gracious fiancee cooking and making us feel at home.  Joe Young arrives at 12:30 and we pair off&amp;#8230;.<br>
<br>
My Decks:  Same as the weekend pretty much.  I took out 2 Organized Attack out of my LS EBO deck and added 2 Grimtaaash to help with Oola and eliminating any surprises.  My Set Course/Manip deck remained intact from Sunday&amp;#8217;s tourney.<br>
<br>
Game 1:  DS v. Joe (surname escapes me)  MWYHL deck<br>
<br>
Joe is a local guy that shows up sometimes with some really weird decks.  We took our time for the first few turns to set stuff up, then I deployed Bossk in Buss to Endor System.  Within 3 turns I beat up DOS and the muppet and ruled the swampland.  I maintained my drains in space before he put down some Tatooine sites and speeders and pilots and stuff.  Mara Jade pays a visit and since I am tracking  Torture and Masterful Move, there is no survival for them.  FW by 20.  2(20)<br>
<br>
In the interim:  Ray Bordier (PA state Champ, Coruscant 1999 champ, DBZ expert) shows up and Joe (the guy I just played) decides to play other games during the picnic.  Ray joins the tournament to prevent us from managing a bye.<br>
<br>
<br>
Game 2:  LS v. Joe Young&amp;#8216;s Rallops deck<br>
<br>
I hate Rallops.  Please refer to every other report I have written about playing Rallops.  I get my EBO out on turn 2, I get to Raltiir and control the system for most of the game, but he goes to Hoth after I&amp;#8217;ve deployed or lost my EPP&amp;#8217;s to set up Imperial Decree.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t get any big ships out until after he flips and works Decree.  He nails me with the added 4 attrition a few times and thins out my space power in about 3 turns, plus the ground drains on Raltiir.  I was able to hold a Raltiir site for a turn to flip it back, but he deployed Darth Vader and schmacked EPP obi into oblivion.  FL by 24.  2(-4)<br>
<br>
Game 3:  LS v. Jon Faust (Doug&amp;#8217;s Brother) TIE/Sienar deck<br>
<br>
A neat deck.  He is using TIE Vanguards in addition to the assortment of TIE&amp;#8217;s to deploy as a react if I bring on the ruckuss.  I get EBO out and in space by turn 3.  He is canceling 1 drain of 5 per turn with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet, but otherwise it is a slow start.  We fight a few times.  He is playing Tallon Roll&amp;#8217;s and he gets 2 of my x-wings (one of which would have tied if I remembered that Incom Corp was on the table..DOH!!) , and I get him after tracking a 6 later in the game (Obisidian 1, I think..).  After a few small space skirmishes deploy Kiffex and Kessel and it is all over.  FW by 8-10 or so&amp;#8230;.  4(+ a little).<br>
<br>
Game 4:  DS v. Bob Caton&amp;#8217;s (Kim&amp;#8217;s Dad) EBO deck<br>
<br>
This was an interesting matchup!!  He is playing Hoth Troopers and the interrupt that lets you deploy them from your reserve deck to get EBO out quick.  It takes him about 6 turns to deploy it, and I have Mara and Vader under the shield hunting for rebels.  I manage to manip some stuff out of his hand, but I never get my BH ships out to face his ships nor do I activate enough force to get an ISD out there too.  I can&amp;#8217;t keep up with the battles in space and he drains me out despite my domination of Echo Base.  FL by not too much. <br>
<br>
I finish the day 2-2, 4(-6).  I have no complaints especially since I double booked for the day and had to get to another party too!!  Thanks for the burgers, Dave, I&amp;#8217;ll see you in Ohio!!!<br>
<br>
This Saturday I go to Cedar Grove for more pre-Origins fun!!  I cant wait!!!<br>
