<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, this is the repost of my tournament report that got lost when decktech had itâ€™s little problem.  If you missed it the first time around, then I hope you enjoy.  If you have read it already, then please take a few seconds to go ahead and repost your review.  Thanks.  :)<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so after ripping the Brangus stuff out of Prodigy, I went ahead and modified it to be an improved version of the original Scum 2k deck. I playtested it, along with Hunt Down, and discovered that although the Scum deck can win with some consistency, it still isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as easy as winning with Hunt Down. But I have played a WHOLE lot of Hunt Down lately, so I decide to play the Scum deck, just for variety, even though Hunt Down is better. For light, I decide to give the Hidden Mains/On &amp; off the edge deck another run. I had been up until about 5am, and sleep through my alarm. I spontaneously wake up 20 minutes after the alarm. Mike doesn&amp;#8217;t wake up until a couple hours after THAT, so he isn&amp;#8217;t in the Jeep as we head to Parker...The Littleton Crew for today consists of Randy, Van, and myself. So the decks are: <br/>
<br/>
Me: Hidden Mains done RIGHT and Scum 2k <br/>
Van: Hidden Mains done RIGHT and Hunt Down done RIGHT <br/>
Randy: EBO done RIGHT and the ISB/walker/sandwhirl deck <br/>
<br/>
Turnout today is about the same as the last couple of weeks. We have 15 or 16 again. And we&amp;#8217;re off to the races. <br/>
<br/>
Game One: Scum 2k vs. Randy Scott&amp;#8217;s EBO done RIGHT <br/>
I start Resistance as one of my 3, just in case. I get JP in opening hand, so my deck is off to a pretty quick start. I drop the usual suspects (like Gailid, Boelo, Mosep, Jabba) into the audience chamber, and deploy Hutt influence from reserve deck. I also get a couple of guys at the lower passages, so I can drain 4 from reserve. But Randy gets all the critical elements out of his deck without mosep being a factor. So he goes ahead and starts setting up ebo, while trying to deploy boussh to the chamber. But she gets denied by None shall pass. Ephant Mon in the Chamber prevents her from going to that site next turn. Mara Jade has run in under the shield. Epp Luke comes down, but gets barriered. Jade runs further under the shield. I deploy S&amp;D to speed things along, while getting drained for 2 a turn at hoth. Boussh deploys to JP itself, breaks cover, and battles Djas puhr. They kill each other. Tk-422 deploys to Mara Jade&amp;#8217;s site, but gets snipered. I deploy a mini-fleet of bounty hunters in space (like zuckuss and dengar) to kill off a few x-wings, retrieving some force in the process via Scum &amp; Villainy/First Strike. The drains plus the direct damage pile up real fast, and Randy succumbs before he can really get going. Full win by 29. <br/>
2: (+29) <br/>
<br/>
After one game, and a win by 29, I am in 4th place, since there were other wins by 31, 35, and 37 this round. <br/>
<br/>
Game Two: Hidden Mains done RIGHT vs. Mark Ponting <br/>
Mark&amp;#8217;s deck is very innovative. He starts with Endor Ops, and is playing ominous rumors. He uses Mob. Points to pull wakeelmui, and has a tie swarm going. But his ties are well complemented by capital starships as well, affording him excellent mobility. To further ensure space superiority, he uses cannons on his tie interceptors, and plays some admirals to pilot the capital ships, backed up by imperial command. On turn one, he puts Piett in the bunker, after using imperial command to get him from reserve. Piett, in turn, goes and gets merrejk, to help Mark get his systems on table. Meanwhile, I drop Jedi Luke to the endor docking bay, with anakin&amp;#8217;s lightsaber. I have both falcons in hand, so I drop one to the endor docking bay to prevent them from being monnoked. A hoard of interceptors, (one armed with the cannon), deploy to Endor. So taking off to endor after getting leia and han in the falcon is not going to be a good idea after all. I get Ben Kenobi to the Tatooine docking bay, so that I can drain for 4. I take the 2-point drain at endor once, and then he deploys Chiraneau to the docking bay (keeping me from controlling any endor locations, so he can deploy ominous rumors) I barrier Chiraneau, to keep him from running into the bunker. Ominous Rumors gets deployed. I put Epp Leia down with Luke, and give Chiraneau a horrendous beating, but Mark just ghhhks the damage. I put Home One (with KFC piloting) at sullust, which puts menace fades in effect. this keeps the drain at endor to only 2 instead of 4. The drain at the docking bays is really starting to hurt him, so Mark deploys Vader, Tarkin, and ozzel to the endor docking bay. The Jedi Luke of death looks at his opposition and says "Somebody better call my mama, to come pick me up, cause I&amp;#8217;m &amp;#8217;bout to KILL somebody up in here!" mark initiates the battle. Fallen Portal kills Tarkin (the cheese that goes CRUNCH!) Leia shoots Ozzel, and vader gets hit with anakin&amp;#8217;s saber. All 3 of Mark&amp;#8217;s characters go down, and I forfeit the landed falcon. So now I can actually deploy the Cap&amp;#8217;n Han/Falcon combo that is in my hand, and only need to get rid of leia, so that I can deploy the one in my hand. I use on the edge to kill her, and put the super falcon in space. Mara Jade (lightsaber in hand) is next to try her luck against the Jedi Luke of death. But alas, I forgot to take the 2nd fallen portal out of my deck before the tourney, like I had planned to. So I have it in hand, and the cheese that goes CRUNCH claims another victim. The Chimaera helps the ties move around, but they prove unable to withstand the might of the super falcon/home one duo. Full win by 18. <br/>
4: (+47) <br/>
<br/>
Lunch today is pizza again. And again, it does not disappoint. Mike shows up during game 2. After waking up a couple hours late, he drove himself to the tourney, and will join the fray in Game 3. Mike&amp;#8217;s decks: <br/>
Hunt Down and Hidden Mains done WRONG. (Mike&amp;#8217;s light deck is akin to what Van and I are playing, but Mike does not own a few of the cards. worse yet, he built the deck at 6 in the morning, and has not played it before) <br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Scum 2K vs. Van&amp;#8217;s Hidden Mains done RIGHT <br/>
This time I don&amp;#8217;t get JP in opening draw. But I have it by third turn, so that isn&amp;#8217;t too bad. By the time I get the audience chamber down, I have boelo, ephant mon, and bib fortuna in my hand. Hmmm, gotta love that Power of the Hutt card...Anyway, I put Jabba, Ephant Mon, Boelo, and Gailid into the chamber. Van draws a bunch of cards, so I play the used monnok to slow him down a bit. Epp Obi shows up, hacks Gailid, but gets his destiny canceled by Boelo. So gailid and obi are the only casualties. On my next turn, I deploy the second Gailid. Van gets the super falcon into space, while I outdrain him (slightly) on the ground. then Van draws a bunch of cards again. So I masterful move to get the monnok back, and play it lost this time. I kill a pair of jedi lukes, and a pair of on the edges. not bad. Ben Kenobi (holding obi&amp;#8217;s saber) comes to the Tatooine docking bay (where I cannot play None shall Pass), and then steps over to take control of JP, which puts Menace Fades into effect. Van can now drain 4 to my 2, which is no good. I count off the masterful move, and bring EJP Dengar/Dr. Evazan to JP, to off the old man. I initiate, and retrieve 3, Van loses one. But he plays fallen portal and kills dengar, leaving Dr. E to battle Mr. Kenobi. so I use projective telepathy to cancel the battle, and evazan runs off. I have to eat the 4/2 drain race for a while. Another suicide epp comes to the chamber, killing Gailid again, just in case I can get around menace fades later. I get Mara Jade to the tatooine docking bay, with her saber, to even the drain at 4 apiece. I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to space, but not where the falcon is. I put 4-Lom w/ rifle at Ben&amp;#8217;s site, along with 3 other fools. So now Kenobi has a choice. Battle 4-Lom and his cronies, knowing that his immunity will get canceled, and he will die. Or, move over to the entrance cavern, which is not a battle ground site, and hence, cannot be used for menace fades. Or, move over in front of mara jade. He chooses door #3. but Mara Jade snipers him, and with menace fades out of effect, I am back in business. Orrimaarko comes to the cc db for a couple of off the edges, retrieving 10 force, but eventually the drains in the palace prove to be too much. Full win by 20. <br/>
6: (+67) <br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Hidden Mains done RIGHT vs. Josh Bader <br/>
Josh is running My Kind of Scum, and ephant mon is the rep. So it&amp;#8217;s another one of these chevin decks. He gets Jabba&amp;#8217;s Sail Barge, puts it at JP, and uses it to put out the passenger deck. Right off the bat (turn two), Josh drops presence of the force on the chamber, along with Scum &amp; Villainy, Mighty Jabba, and Boelo. I deploy Ben Kenobi to the Audience chamber. But Josh has the none shall pass in his 3 card hand, so Ben bounces back to my hand. I draw a few and let Josh go. He puts a mercenary pilot and epp fett on the sail barge, to have 2 battle destiny. Jabba and Boelo get reinforced by Bib Fortuna and a Chevin. So now, Boelo can cancel my destiny, and since Bib is a leader, Mighty Jabba will add a destiny. And if I can somehow get battle destiny past Boelo, the Chevin can automatically cover all the attrition. Not cool. But I have the goods in my hand, so I know I can handle it, if I can just get Ben into that chamber. Josh draws 7 or 8 cards, and lets me go. I deploy Ben Kenobi to the Audience Chamber....no response. sweet. Ben gets a huge grin on his face and says "Somebody better call my mama, to come pick me up, cause I&amp;#8217;m &amp;#8217;bout to KILL somebody up in here!" I put the saber on Ben and deploy epp luke and Lando w/ Axe to the chamber as well. I then use Clash of sabers to exclude Bib fortuna. I initiate the battle. Lando uses his Vibro Axe to take Boelo out of the fight. Luke swings and hits the chevin, Ben swings and hits Jabba. lando adds a battle destiny, and it is a bloody mess in the Audience Chamber. I forfeit luke to cover the attrition, and Ben revives him. On Josh&amp;#8217;s turn, Bib is still Clashed. He backs up Boelo with Ephant Mon and a couple more chevins. Then he puts a Stun Blaster on Boelo (of all things!), and battles me. Boelo shoots Lando, putting him back in my hand. And I won&amp;#8217;t be able to redeploy him there, because of Ephant Mon. On top of all this, Lando was the one adding a battle destiny for me, so this time, when I draw only one, Boelo cancels it. But I hit both ephant mon and boelo with the 2 lightsabers. hehe. I forfeit luke again, and Ben revives him again. epp fett steps into the chamber to give the two chevins a hand. On my turn, Lando w/ Axe deploys again, along with Lt. Blount. I try to exclude fett with the axe, but no dice. I try to hit fett with a saber, but no dice. So I go ahead and whack a chevin with my other saber. Fett shoots Lando. I draw 2 battle destiny, and it is high enough to clear the chamber (except for Bib fortuna, of course) I lose Lando since he was hit, and lose blount for attrition. Ben revives Lando. Ben and Lando go out to JP to visit the merc pilot on the sail barge. Epp Luke stays in the chamber with Bib Fortuna, who finally recovers from the clash. Gailid deploys to the passenger deck, making the sail barge immune to attrition. A chevin hops on board the sail barge as well. Bib Fortuna leaves the chamber, so I pay the 4 to cancel scum &amp; villainy. Luke drains for 3 in the chamber (gotta love POTF) I battle at JP, and Lando excludes the mercenary pilot. hehe. I draw massive battle destiny again, so even though the barge is immune to attrition, he has to lose it anyway. this also causes the merc pilot to die, because although he was excluded, he was still on the barge. It also destroys the passenger deck, killing Gailid. Big fun. I use on the edges to retrieve my lost pile, and win by 34. <br/>
8: (+101) <br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Hidden Mains done RIGHT vs. Van Melancon <br/>
Van has been using Hunt Down for a while, but had not been using dueling, in favor of extra beatdown cards. This week, he switches to a dueling version, which makes his deck pretty similar to Hunt Down done RIGHT. There are a few differences, of course, to reflect van&amp;#8217;s playing style, but you get the idea. First characters are ozzel and janus to the executor db for activation, but pretty soon, he deploys Mara Jade to the death star docking bay, with her saber, to set up an early drain of 2. I put tawss khaa at the home one docking bay for extra activation. Janus and ozzel move over to back up mara jade, and they are joined by a blizzard walker as well. I put epp luke at the cc docking bay, and deploy han on the falcon in space. this gets menace fades going, dropping the drain at the death star db from 3 to 1. So i sit back and wait for bad things to happen to me. Vader deploys to the death star docking bay, and the whole crew transits over to luke. During my control phase, i play sorry about the mess and kill mara jade. Van disarms epp luke. uh-oh. Vader&amp;#8217;s Obsession. I play courage of a skywalker. Vader loses the duel, and gets placed out of play. Van loses 9 force and the game. I transit my disarmed luke away. I get Ben Kenobi on the table, with his lightsaber, to establish a respectable ground force. Zuckuss in Mist Hunter comes to space, but Han by himself is no match, even on the falcon, so I don&amp;#8217;t chase zuckuss down. But Boba Fett in Slave I ends up deploying against the falcon next turn anyway, after sim aloo checks to make sure it is safe. We both draw pretty low, and I lose a couple of cards to battle damage. On my turn, I deploy Home One. Captain Han explains that somebody should call his mama, to come pick him up, cause he is about to KILL somebody up in here! I battle Slave I with Home One and the falcon. I draw a pair of 6&amp;#8217;s for battle destiny, while Fett draws a one. Van loses Slave I for four. After that, he has about 12 life force left. But that is not enough to cover the battle damage, so he dies on the spot. Full win by 27. <br/>
10: (+128) <br/>
<br/>
Game 6: Scum 2K vs. Josh Bader <br/>
Josh is playing Agents in the Court. A couple of turns into the game, he uses insurrection to look for a docking bay, but does not find one. So I get to look through his reserve deck, and I&amp;#8217;m trying to tell ya, it was a Palace Raider BONANZA in there. And plenty of racing skiffs too. and fallen portals, and all that fun stuff. So now I have an idea of what I&amp;#8217;m dealing with. He puts Lando w/ Vibro Axe at the tatooine db, along with a racing skiff, driven by wedge. I deploy Jabba into Josh&amp;#8217;s Audience chamber, drop S&amp;V, and start throwing down the crew. Gailid, Boelo, and Ephant Mon. I get Jabba&amp;#8217;s Palace out, and put Mara Jade at the Hutt Trade Route, with her saber. This allows me to pull the Lower Passage from reserve. I put Bane malar at that one, since I just saw how little capacity his deck has to fight at interior locations. Mara Jade steps over to jabba&amp;#8217;s palace, setting up a total drain of 8. Josh deploys Jedi Luke to the Lower passages, but because of Bad Feeling, he costs TEN. I have no none shall passes or imperial barriers in hand, so Luke is good to go. But after Josh pays to initiate a battle, he has only one force left, so Projective Telepathy takes care of that. He uses his one force to move the racing skiff (with wedge and lando), in front of mara jade. So now, after blocking two of my drains, I only drain for 3. During my control phase, mara jade snipers Lando. I drop dr. evazan, ejp dengar, epp fett and iggy w/ riot gun alongside Bane Malar, deploy first strike, and battle luke. I retrieve 3, he loses one. I lose bane to the attrition. Mara battles wedge. I retrieve bane, josh loses one. he plays fallen portal, but Jade dodges, and wedge dies. Jedi Luke survived the battle, so Josh battles me back on his turn. Luke does not survive this time. Nothing else of interest happens for the remainder of the game. I just sit and drain him out. Full win by 27. <br/>
<br/>
I finish at 12: (+155) <br/>
<br/>
There are no 5-1 players. Van goes 4-2, losing only those 2 games to me, and takes 2nd place. Josh also goes 4-2, also losing only to me. Mike only played 4 games, but went 3-1 in those games. Randy finished at only 3-3. So the Littleton crew combines for 16 wins, and 6 losses, with 3 of the losses being to me. better than a 2 to 1 win/loss ratio for the crew today, so that&amp;#8217;s cool. <br/>
<br/>
Props: <br/>
Can you guess? Yep, that&amp;#8217;s right. To Van, for driving. <br/>
To Mara Jade, for being such an excellent sniper. (Han, Ben AND Lando, all in the same day, not too shabby!) <br/>
To the pizza, and we all know why. <br/>
To Fallen Portal, for finally doing something worthwhile. <br/>
To me, for not opening my DSII packs. <br/>
To Van, for starting no escape against me, preventing the Honor of the Jedi fiasco we had last week. <br/>
To epp luke, for winning epic duels against Vader for me, 2 weeks in a row (and disarmed both times, no less) <br/>
To Ice Heart, for giving me a good rating on this tournament report, (I hope! hehe) even though I did not play Hunt Down. I&amp;#8217;m sure she&amp;#8217;ll be upset but...come on! it wasn&amp;#8217;t my fault! it was an accident! I didn&amp;#8217;t mean to not play Hunt Down...it just happened! Can you forgive me? :) <br/>
<br/>
Slops: <br/>
To Power of the Hutt, for not doing a damn thing, when I get Bib, Ephant Mon, and Boelo in my hand all the time. <br/>
To me, for sleeping 20 minutes past my alarm. <br/>
To Mike, for sleeping 2 hours later than I did! :) <br/>
To Josh, for playing stun blasters. heh-heh. <br/>
To Randy, for falling over backwards in his chair. hahaha! <br/>
And most importantly, to the dark side, for failing to call: <br/>
1) Jedi Luke&amp;#8217;s mama <br/>
2) Ben Kenobi&amp;#8217;s mama <br/>
3) Captain Han Solo&amp;#8217;s mama, <br/>
allowing all 3 of them to KILL somebody up in here! <br/>
<br/>
That&amp;#8217;s all for this week.  See you next time. <br/>
