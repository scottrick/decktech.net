<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well my goal was to be 1800 by the end of the year.  And the end of the year is here.  And I’m 1765.  Crunch time.  I figure this Chase the Cans tourny is my last chance to hit 1800 this year. <br/>
<br/>
Pre-tourny:<br/>
For darkside, lightsaber combat has been working well.  I made it the day after it came out, and I like it a lot.  I’m much to lazy to make another dark deck right now.  I don’t consider it too cheesy because I made it RIGHT after it came out, so I didn’t copy it... and besides... my lightside deck is.....<br/>
Rescue the Princess.   Yeah, you all laughed at it, spit on it, and maybe even kicked it a few times.  But it was damn good then, and even better now.  It’s perfect in this meta, where all dark decks revolve around big guys with sabers.  Richard and I both developed this idea together (kinda like the lightsaber combat) so we both decide to play it in this tourny (kinda like the lightsaber combat).<br/>
<br/>
I go to a party and end up crashing at Chad’s on Friday night.  I’m at his house, and it’s like 3... 3:30... and I’m winding down, doing a little hackey-sack, playin Super-Smash Bros, about to go to bed.  All of a sudden, Gary discovers that the DSS satellite hookup gets like 10 porn channels.  So I get to bed like 5, maybe 5:30.  I wake up at 7.  Yeah, 1.5, maybe 2 hours sleep.  I had to wake up to go to Quick Recall, it’s some dumb school competition, you don’t wanna ask.  So I get out of that at like 11, and spend an hour making Rescue the Princess.  Don’t test it cause I’m too lazy.  I used to play it back in the day when NO ONE played it so I still have an idea how it goes.  Richard shows up, we round out the rough spots in our decks, and pick up Tony, then head out for Lexington.  It’s about an hour away, since all of us live in Southern Indiana.<br/>
<br/>
Tourny:<br/>
We get there just a hair late (Lexington’s streets SUCK.  The roads change names every other block), but we called them on the cell phone and told &amp;#8216;em we’d be late so they’re waiting on us to begin.  We fill out command cards and they pair us up immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My RTP vs Matt Clemans (1763) Droid Invasion<br/>
I give him mad props for playing the new objective RIGHT after it came out.  Love it when people got the balls to do that.  Clemans is the "Decipher’s Best" at this tourny.  That means that while our cans are each worth one pack at the end, his are worth two.  So I’m pumped and ready to beat him and get me extra packs.<br/>
I get no Lift Tube or Lift Tube Escape in my opening hand ( I don’t get one in my hand the entire tourny despite playing 3 Tubes, and 1 Escape).  So flipping is slow.  He gets Maul w/ double, 2 droids, and a Neimodian to the throne room for the flip.  All the sudden he’s draining for 4 at the Throne Room, and 2 at the system.  Grrrrr.  I free Leia, retrieve 4, drain for 4.  I have to beat up some people to make it to the War Room.  I play Skywalkers to add 2 destiny.  I end up killing like 5 destroyer droids and he forgets to put them on droid racks.  HUGE.  I flip.  I think I Nabrun EPP Han and Leia to his Throne Room.  I put down Enhanced QuiGon.  I put down Lando.  Initiate.  I get lotsa power, swing, shoot, and draw 4 destiny which are 6, 6, 5, 5.  All his characters are out of play.  From there I basically put out of play anything he put down, and took over ground completely.  He drew up before I could get a Death Star Plans off (Grrr at no Lift Tubes).<br/>
FW by 23<br/>
2(+23)<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS Combat vs Tony Harpers (1590) MWHYL Beatdown/Space Drain<br/>
Tony is one of my playtesting buddies.  I play him ALL the time.  He knows my deck, I’ve never seen his.  But I know my deck, and he doesn’t really know his yet.  He is pretty much as good as me or Richard.  This is only his 3rd or 4th tourny though, so he gained 90 points in 2 or 3 tournies.  So I set up the ground drain, hitting him for 2 at each of my sites.  He Mindful of the Future’s for Kessel and puts Wedge plus some peeps there, and Ric Olie at my Rendili.  I get Sidious and IG- 88 at his Cantina.  From there it was a drain race.  I played Ebb of Battle on his Kessel drain (tech).  Really, I was hitting him for 6 from turn 3 or 4, so he never had time to get a beatdown prepared.  I just hit him too fast, too hard for his deck to recover.<br/>
FW by 20ish<br/>
4(+40 something)<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS Combat vs Johnathan Wilkersons (1880) QMC<br/>
I know this game could very well decide the tourny.  We both start the usual things, and get off to tentative starts, not wanting to screw ourselves over on turn 2.  I eventually get Vader and Sidious on Naboo draining and force him to deploy to CC to do damage.  Mara and Maul make runs on his peeps, but he fights me off and flips.  I put Maul down on Naboo to reinforce, then go back after him.  He puts Qui-Gon on CC (mistake) luckily.  Now he only has 2 CC sites to drain at, plus the system.  IG-88 and Boba clear a site, but Boba dies.  IG-88 captures Corran Horn and usually keeps his site clear.  So he’s down to the system and 1 site to drain at.  He’s retrieving two a turn with Celebration.  I am draining for 4.  He gets out Pucumir... I begin to worry.  I try beatdowns, and even sense Path, but he Dodges the battle.  Grrrrr.  I dig hard and find my Masterful Move/Endor Occupation finally.  He gets out Battle Plan.  So I am paying to drain for 4.  He is draining for 3, sometimes 2 when I kill Pucumir (two or three times).  I am able to pay for my drain of 4 one last time and barely finish him off.<br/>

6(+50ish)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My RTP vs Matt Kleinerts (1660) BHBM<br/>
Kleinert is good.  He is rated 100 points less than me, and yet I have never beat him in a tourny.  He is my arch-nemesis of sorts.  If I win this, I basically win the tourny.  If I lose, I have to count on Wilkerson beating Richard.  He played this same deck and beat me by one card, so now is my revenge time.  I have a hard time flipping (no Lift Tubes), and he gets Maul, IG-88, Dr.E, and P- 60 to the War Room.  I start hurting.  I miss the first attempt to free.  Grrrr.  I finally free her and face the problem of flipping.  I have EPP Obi and EPP Luke at the DB’s.  He comes down with P-59 and Mara.  I let him battle, counting on my Resiliences, and saving my Narrow Escape for Leia.  He gets Luke with attrition, and puts him out of play with Sidious.  Yes, but we don’t realize Luke isn’t a jedi till much later.  I remind him to lose 2 for the sense he played during the battle, and 2 in overflow.  He battles Obi, gets him with attrition, and puts him out of play.  During this battle, I ask if he lost 4 total, or just 2 for the sense, and forgot to lose 2 in overflow.  He says he thinks he lost 4.  I ask him to check his lost pile.  He says that even if he didn’t lose the 4, he won’t now because it is too late, even though I specifically reminded him to lose the force.  We both become an@l players at this point.<br/>
I get Leia in there for the flip.  He battles, expecting me to play Narrow Escape.  I decide not to.  He tries to shoot Leia with IG-88, I play Dodge.  I shoot with Han, expecting to play Blaster Prof, to make Dr.E lost.  I miss.  I have to play Blaster Prof just to hit Dr. E.  GRRRRR.  However, in his haste, Kleinert forgot to leave extra destiny, because he expected me to Narrow Escape the battle.  Hehe.  I draw a 6 and a 5.  I have to lose 3 in overflow, but he has to lose Dr.E, P-59, and Maul out of play.  I move them out and take on Vader.  Vader goes bye bye.  Enhanced Qui starts making runs.  He puts down U-3PO to fight my Leia enhanced drains.  I start splitting my people up to keep draining.  I get off a Death Star Plans with 8D8, and retrieve like 10.  He realizes I’m killing him and he draws up.<br/>
FW by 20 something.<br/>
8(+70ish)<br/>
<br/>
I WIN THE TOURNY!  Sweet-ass.  I figure that with this win, I will break 1800.  I get 9 packs from my cans, and everyone gets an extra pack.  I draw Sidious and Enhanced Qui (my third, but no Mauls).  I also get an Insurrection foil.  Party, bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Props: <br/>
Tony and Richard for helping me playtest for the tourny.<br/>
Richard for driving.<br/>
Kleinert, sorry we got all an@l in our game man, but the tourny was on the line for me.<br/>
Stiv for running it like a champ.<br/>
The store owner for hosting, and being cool as hell.<br/>
Decipher for sending lots of support.<br/>
The dude who threw away a dozen yellow roses and lots of purple lilies at Krogers.  I scavenged them and scored MEGA bonus points with my chick.<br/>
<br/>
Slops:  <br/>
Frankie, the number one slops receiver of all time.  This tourny was over 4 hours away from him and I am still giving him slops.<br/>
Eric "YOYO" Bailey for giving Tony the idea for a MWYHL deck that failed Tony.  What were you thinking copying a deck from duck-boy Tony? (Just messing with Eric, no offense Tony)<br/>
<br/>
Adios all, thanks for reading.<br/>
