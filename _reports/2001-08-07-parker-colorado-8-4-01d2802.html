===============<br/>
Last tournaments i was at was the WCQ weekend where i managed to show my Scrubocity and win a total of 6 games out of 20ish games or so, so I figured coruscant might be nice i have two boxes pre-ordered and i’ll wait to go to a tourney till then.  I hear it is post-poned a week so i figure to hell with waiting and go to this tourney.  I call my friends Jakob, and Cody to see if they’ll come but neither of them can make it.  Friday night comes along and i realize i don’t have a ride up there so i call my grandma she says to call her at 9 am to see how she feels.  I end up staying up till 6 am and fall asleep.  10:30 comes along and my grandma calls saying she’ll bring me and thats cool so i go get ready see the time and think I’ll be late to the 12 o’clock starting time.  I count my decks real quick and only have 59 dark side cards.  Assuming i got all the key cards i grab the first DS card i see.  Set For Stun....ok that works.  I get to the Tourney with 10 minuted to spare and register and wait.<br/>
<br/>
Decks<br/>
==============<br/>
LS-Hidden Base Flip Podrace w/Squad Assign.<br/>
DS-CCT mains with the Prize(non-playtested and i plan to lose 2 with it)<br/>
<br/>
So i go buy my juice and pairings are called.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS vs Bob Pieron’s Court<br/>
Hmm...court? Court to me is an Auto win i don’t lose to court.  So we get started and he gets Gallid out early and gets a few drains going but not much.  I drop a system and pull from my deck and squadassign for Wedge RSL in Red Squad 1 with X-Wing cannons a power pivot and Darklighter spin in hand i save 3 and let him go.  He drops IG in ship and Zuckuss in ship to take out Wedge.  I shoot Zuckuss with the cannons and he looks at the weapon not believing he’d be lost just like that but he was and he thinks the battles over because IG has no presence i point out that IG can initiate so the battle is not over and we Draw Destiny i get a 5 and he gets a 3 Wedge lives.  I drop a few more systems and save three for wedge.  His turn we draw for race and i win the race and retrieve while he loses.  I drop a Forest with Obi and Stick to tibrin play I did  it retrieve 4 more and search for my last system.  Its not there.  His turn he drains me for 5 and i play On the Edge with a tracked Six.  My turn i look for sullust not there so i know its in the three i saved so i drop Gold Squad 1 with Nien and Gen Cal to endor and draw the three cards hoping my Darklighter Spin and Power pivot could save wedge if needed.  His turn he drains some more and doesn’t attack wedge.  On my turn i finally flip move Wedge to Kessel and let him go.  His turn i cancel his 2 big drains and lose 1.  I drain him for 5 drop jek an Hobbie to sullust and let him go.  At this point i am drainging 6 a turn and he’s got me for 1 and i retrieve one with i did it.  He drops Hutt influence so i can’t Cancel his drains but he is low on force and i win.  FW(2 +14)<br/>
<br/>
I walk arround for a while and go buy another Juice as the Pairings are called.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS vs Patrick Ortiz’ something or another<br/>
<br/>
This is wear i get scared i look through my DS for the first time in a week since i made it and i go to grab my starting stuff.  I grab all the Objective stuff and the prize and three effects and as i’m looking through their is no Prepaired defences oh @#$%%^ #^$#^ )&amp;^*&amp;$ $#^$! !$#^&amp;@% %^@#^&amp;.  OK so i put the effects away and we start.  I activate drop a docking bay save a few and draw the rest.  He drops Hoth Echo Med Lab Yavin 4 and a X-wing.  I look at the table and i just wish  i had a space card but then see a few force saved, maybe a spiral and out of nowhere.  So i drop Mara To the medlab and get her stick on her drop a docking bay draw 1 and let him go.  He drops another ship and draws a few.  I drop some effects that i normally like to have after i drained for 3 at the med lab drop 4-Lom to the prison pull Audience Chamber from the deck move 4-Lom with the prize to the Docking bay and let him  go.  He drops another system with some ships and lets me go.  I drop Lord vader with stick to CC docking bay transit 4-lom to tat and draw one  its Xizor.  He Drains me for 2 and drops another system with a few more x-wings.  I Pull Mighty Jabba with audience chamber drop xizor and move 4-Lom  over and flip.  He Drains me for three and lets me go.  I drain him for 6 retrieve one. and draw two looking for a ship.  He sees the difference in whats going on and draws up. FW(4 +43)<br/>
<br/>
Lunch Break now, i go to the Gas Station across the street and buy a hot Dog come back buy a juice and just wait for the next game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs Chris Fanchi’ Hidden Base<br/>
So i’m like Chris who just because i don’t wanna play him he is rated 1900 and my DS is messed up so i know i am gonna lose.  He sets up fast and i draw to look for some ships.  This game is pretty uneventful till i get most of my ships save force and play first strike and initiate anywhere i can possibly initiate at.  He loses some force and i retrive but lose most of that do to battle damage.  He flips and cancels everything so i’m in  trouble and some point in the game he asks me something and i respond with more or less which sendshim laughing up a storm i guess it was really funny maybe  you had to be there. so he has me locked down to 1 force and i can’t do anything he considers just retrieveing everything and i’m like come on just be nice and drain me out.  So he did. FL (4 +19)<br/>
<br/>
so i just go straight on to the next game<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS vs Stan Kwok’s MKOS<br/>
Well i guess he just moved to Colorado before the game we talked and all and he seemed pretty cool so we play and I initiate the race he stalls me but thats ok i guess well he is playing the Jawa’s so any force i save is taken which isn’t good for me i get a slow start so finally i flip but i can’t cancel his drains due to hutt influence and he is draining away at me but i got EPP Luke in hand and an on the edge and the race will end this turn so i can track a six on there and get inot it well we draw i get 2 6’s and he gets a nine which puts us boith at 28 #@# $%^# ok so that sucks i activate and draw looking for a step backwords or a possible neck and neck and find nothing i was pretty sure i took neck and neck outta the deck though...had i had someone at tibrin it woulda probably changed the whole game but he drains me out FL(4 -2)<br/>
<br/>
So i go and talk to Scott the TD and i’m like....you know what I know why i lost the last two,  I forgot to buy a juice right before the game.  So i go and Buy one and play the next one.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 LS vs Jerry Heind BHBM his way<br/>
BHBM against my HB i should have this in the bag.  We start and i get a hand of 8 red cards....well maybe this will be a bit tougher.  So i put out systems and draw for 2 turns when he gets Vader out so i give him EPP luke and Get a ship to Endor. He drops some endor sites to drain at an he has Djas Puhr at one.  I have Corran Horn Tawass Khaa nien Numb and Gen Cal all in hand and he plays Scanning crew. Anybody but Corran please anybody but corran..sure enough he grabed Corran...ok thats alright but i can’t track him with threepio this early well i can but it will take two -three turns to get him so i blindly play threepio and get the tank  So i drop Tawass to Djas and Igar.  I initiate predict i win and draw a 6 so i have twelve he draws a 1 and then Emp powers for another and gets a 5 and we tie.  He loses Igar and Tawass Goes to the tank.and i lose one.  Next turn i get Corran and Drop him and Tawass to Djass initiate predict i win draw a 6 and he draws enough to kill us both so i retrieve on put Tawass in the tank and lose corran.  then i track the Six and edge wedge to get corran back in the deck.  He Tries to duel luke i get a 5 and a 6 he gets a 5 and a 3.  I get Honor out and Cancel his two drains with the objective so i lose nothing.  He Duels luke wins i lose 1 he then plays i am your father on luke.  So i lose two a turn but i quickly out drain him and win the race play i did it and get obi to the forest.  FW(6 +25)<br/>
<br/>
So i talk with Scott a bit more and then buy a juice and head into the final game<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS vs Lee Marino Agents in the Court <br/>

So we Start and I draw my 1st turn he drops a few Chadra Fans to the Cloud City Chamber and Converts it i attack the three with Mara he has Kabe in the chamber and i manage to take to chadra fans wit hme and lose mara. He drains and drops mor CHsdra’s to the Chamber i drop lord vader and he gets beat up. He puts two Florn Lamproids at the chamber and i drop Arica to block the drain.
