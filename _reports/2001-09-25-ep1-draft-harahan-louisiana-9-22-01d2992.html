<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">alright, so this is my first TR, so be nice. I’ll start now.<br/>
Friday night, I got o hang with Freddy and Kevin, two of my friends I play with. We played our decks and talked about what we should draft. I doled out my wisdom on sealed decks, as I have read SO Many reports and that makes me a Drafting God. Right. <br/>
Saturday morning I get up at like 6:00 to help Kevin mow his chruch’s lawn so he can come to the tourney. Ugh. We got to the Lewzworld Comix at around 10:30, he opens at whenever he gets there, so we went and bought some packs on Endor at a newstand up the street. I pulled a DOS! pretty cool! Anyways, so we are waiting outside for Lewie to show. It’s me, Kevin, Freddy and Dough, the NO Posse fa show! Um, right. So Lewie finally shows and everyone else drags in. There was like 10, I think, including the State Champ Rob. I don’t know anyone’s first name, so sue me. Alright.<br/>
We start drafting. It was gonna be 5 Coruscant packs and 1 Tat, cause we all hate Tat small cards. Lewie doesn’t have enough Coruscant, so we get 2 Tat. Crap. <br/>
Kevin, Dough, Me, this guy and this guy Chuck end up LS<br/>
Rob, Eric, Freddy, Matt and Daniel end up DS<br/>
I open my first Tat(we wanna get this outta the way) and staring me in the face? Sebulba AI. I was so pissed, I really like the pic on that card. Anyways, so I take an Eopie, cause I have visions on Queenie and an Eopie being unstoppable. I’ll spare the individual packs, but here are the power cards:<br/>
<br/>
Queen Amidala, Ruler of Naboo<br/>
Supreme Chancellor Valoruum<br/>
Yarua(death kill man)<br/>
Mas Amedda<br/>
Stay Here Where its Safe x 5<br/>
Rebel Artillery <br/>
Credits Will Do Fine<br/>
Losing Track<br/>
Eventually You’ll Lose<br/>
<br/>
oh yeah, best of all, I only ended up with 1 rule card. SWEET!<br/>
I had this sweet tech going on with losing track and eventually you’ll lose, setting them up a crap destiny and setting up a six for me. No one pulled a Maul or a Qui-Gon.<br/>
This one guy pulled a Padme AI, another Padme and a Padawan Learner. Figured he had, one, right? Nope. On to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
my LS Political Beatdown(or something) vs. Freddy’s DS Politics<br/>
i got the slave quarters, so I started that and Mindful of the Furture with Security Control so my senators won’t all die. Freddy starts a Political Effect with Neimoidian Advisor, which I know now that you can’t do. I pretty much drained him at the Naboo Battle Plains the whole game uncontested. He had the senate, but that didn’t matter. I tracked the seven with Stay Here Where it’s safe to make Yarua power 12, immune &lt;7. Thought he had for a little while there when he played 2 Droid Strfighters to a system, but I dropped a republic cruiser and a Lieutenent Williams and then I had that 2 drain for the rest of the game. <br/>
FW +8<br/>
<br/>
highs: beating freddy out of the gate<br/>
lows: beating freddy out of the gate, losing diff to a gameplay mistake<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
my LS Political Beatdown vs. Eric’s Podracing Battledroids<br/>
<br/>
got Queenie in my first hand, along with Rebel Artillery, a gun and a handmaiden. I though I had this DOWN. Aparently Eric drafted like 10 Battle Droid Guns, cause his destinies were ridiculous. He got pissed about me draining with Credit’s will do fine and taking cards he couldn’t retrieve, but it didn’t matter. The podrace did me in(even without Watto’s box) and he spanked me.<br/>
L -11<br/>
+2(-3)<br/>
<br/>
highs: ummm, making eric mad?<br/>
lows: queenie getting shot wile she had 6 defense value<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
my LS Political Beatdown vs. Daniel’s My Lord Deck<br/>
<br/>
don’t remember a lot here, just that I must have played Stay Here about 75 times. I felt kinda bad beating on Daniel, but he had just slaughtered Kevin badly so it was revenge time. I drained at the marketplace and retrieved a lot, used my Losing Track tech to set up 6’s and basically played mean. <br/>
FW +22<br/>
+4(+19)<br/>
<br/>
highs: this game won the Qui for me<br/>
lows: having to spank Daniel that bad<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
my LS Politics vs. Robs Chock Fest<br/>
<br/>
this was the best game I played all day. I have never beaten Rob, ever, and I came really close this time. In fact, I would have one but I left a wussy guy alone and he got killed pretty bad with a tracked 6. Rob complimented me on the Losing Track/Eventually You’ll lose combo. It was a cool game, and I am kinda glad that I lost to Rob, cause if I had beat him, he wouldn’t have gotten the Maul w/ Saber. You’re welcome.<br/>
L -6<br/>
+4(+13)<br/>
<br/>
well, here were the standings for LS<br/>
<br/>
1) me 4(+13)<br/>
2)the guy I didn’t know 2(?)<br/>
3)Kevin<br/>
4) Chuck( id unno how)<br/>
5) Dough<br/>
<br/>
so I won the Qui-Gon with Lightsaber for being top LS player. SWEET. Now I just hafta wait for it to get here, which, knowing Decipher, might be a long while. Thanks for reading. On to the obligatory Props, Slops etc.<br/>
