<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, this is the only chance I’ll have to write this thing anytime soon, so I must do it now.  However, I’m tired, so I’m just gonna phone this one in.<br/>
<br/>
~12 people.  No Garrett, no Grace, but Jim Li’s back from school.<br/>
<br/>
I have the same decks from states.  Grace’s TIGIH and my Bloody BHBM &lt;Jedi mind trick&gt;You will rate this deck&lt;/Jedi mind trick&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Game1: vs. Jim Li’s MKOS<br/>
<br/>
Jim does the usual setup for the first few turns, as Luke drains away happily.  I have a feeling he has a monnok, so I try to keep my hand size at 12, but on his turn I searched for lando, and he used MM to grab monnok and play it used.  He didn’t get Lando, but he did get the endor system.  He gets a bit of a beatdown crew onboard the sailbarge at the exterior palace site.  I put my docking bay next door and throw a few guys there.  He eventually tries for a beatdown, but a falling door takes out the merc pilot and boelo.  He gets no destiny cuz half of his remaining characters there are droids.  I am stoopid, so I play insertion planning anyway.  He gets the gaylid drain going, but I have every effect in my deck deployed (including Menace Fades) and cuz there was no system for a long time, he lost bossk and zuckuss.  Lando in gold 1 went to endor and I always controlled a site or two.  He could drain for 1, but he’d have to pay 3, so he usually didn’t.  Xizor in Viagra tried to take out my Lando (enhanced with I’ll take the leader).  He used MKOS and myo to cancel the 6 I drew for destiny, so I had to lose 3.  Next turn Nein Nunb joined Lando, and Xizor went down in a ball of crap (not flaming cuz Xizor’s not gay).  We had a few battles on the ground.  He won the first few, I won the last few.  I had air superiority, and owned every site but the AC.  Time was running out, but it was clear I would win, so Jim threw down a merc pilot vs. my beat squad and ended it.<br/>

Highs: an intense game<br/>
Jim for not playing for a timed loss.<br/>
Lows: ...<br/>

Game 2 vs. Mike Raveling’s Euro WYS<br/>
<br/>
My deck owns WYS.  I get big E into hand, palpy to the tat:db, bad feeling have I out, and force lighting into hand.  He deploys kessel and mirax in skate there.  I know the beatdown capabilities of his deck, so I deploy Vader, veers, and sim aloo to the db.  Oh wait, I forgot.  My deck only owns American WYS decks.  He gets out beggar and I help him to drain me for 3 every turn.  A few times I leave about 4 force to see if he’ll use it all up to deploy a squad, but he doesn’t, so I decide to save up a couple turns to deploy the ex and an admiral.  Then he decides to use it all.  I’ve moved my guys into the cantina for some dumb reason, so I now activate 3 less.  I never have nearly enough to get out the ex and lat damage, so I pretty much give up.  I deploy and move just a guy or two for him to pound, but somehow I managed to choke/trample han every time, and he had to settle for just draining me out instead of a game-ending battle.<br/>

FL by lots<br/>

Highs: it looked good in the beginning<br/>
Lows: beggar.  Die, beggar, die.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Jerry Flynn’s HD no duel<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty good match up.  It could go either way. Vader takes luke on turn 2.  Janus is there too.  I deploy the back door with madine/blunt and back them up little by little.  I’m hoping he battles me with vader so i can portal him and get back luke or make him lose more.  He actually runs away a couple times, probably cuz he knows my plan.  He eventually gives lord vader his saber, but I have Insight out.  He feels safe, so we have a big fat battle.  I draw a blind 6 to squish vader, and he loses a couple characters and empy gets luke.  I think he played i have you now that battle, but he drew 1-1.  I drew a 6 for bd also.  He has battle plan out, so zuckuss goes to rendili.  I get endor and gold 1 out next turn, free from the asssucker.  I edge lando (just edged leia to death so she wouldn’t get gang probed).  I manage to win 3 ground battles, drawing 6s left and right.  He has zuckuss, empy and janus on table to my captured luke, lando in gold1 and that’s it.  I check destinies 5-6-5, drop obi, and wipe out his site.  Visage eats us (me) most of the game, as it took me forever to get a TT/OOC.  He gets out vader to take back luke.  I duel, and from the 8 cards in reserve, i get a 6.  I win.<br/>

<br/>
Highs: turning vader for the first time with this deck.<br/>
all my beautiful 6s<br/>
Lows: not finding TT<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: vs. Jim Li’s random Profit<br/>
<br/>
He starts jedi pack han, so I know there’ll be some gay OTE/bo shuda crap going  on this game, but I start xizor and jabba anyway cuz they’re cool.  I have both emperors in hand, so I deploy one to JP first turn.  He has Master luke and luke’s saber opening hand.  Gay.  He barely misses the chop on empy, but i draw 0 and he gets a good destiny, so i lose palpy.  I deploy palpy and janus at ccdb.  (FAST FORWARD CUZ I’M TIRED)  OTE is eating me cuz of a beat squad he keeps chasing me with.  I’ve been draining for 4-6 each turn, so it’s close.  I’ve managed to trample away several characters and monnok both his On the Edges.  He tries to Harvest, but I cancel it with my lone sense.  I have pretty much all my characters on the table, so I can chase him with big guns and still drain elsewhere.  I track my 6s like mad at the end, and after running away from like 4 battles with various battle-cancelling interrupts, he finally runs out of them, and I kill most of his guys.<br/>
