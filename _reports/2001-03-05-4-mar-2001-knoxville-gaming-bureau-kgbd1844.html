<br/>
One of my roommate (Matt Mathison)’s friends from high school (Ravi Pentapaty) came up from GA Tech for the weekend to visit but he didn’t want to play because he hasn’t touched Star Wars cards in about a year, but with enough peer pressure we convinced him to play. Matt rebuilt his jawa deck for Ravi to play and Sander Hartledge lent Ravi his monkey tie deck (which sucks) to play. That night, despite not having a decent light side built yet, we all decided to get plastered at a friend’s (John Camp) girlfriend’s apartment. Towards one o’clock Matt, Ravi, and Sander kind of slip out while I’m not paying attention and so I’m sitting there still mostly sober with a super drunk John and his girlfriend. I end up being trapped there for like half an hour until my girlfriend shows up to release me. When I get back to my room, Matt, Ravi, and Sander are watching Empire and doing random @#$%. I decide I’m not in a clear enough frame of mind to build my light side, so I just go to my girlfriends room and forget about it. Sunday morning Matt calls me and tells me to get ready so we can go to eat before the tournament, so I take a shower and rush down to my room and build an iffy-at-best Ewoks-Agents deck in 10 minutes. I just pray that it doesn’t get completely destroyed and my dark side should help me out enough to come out 2 and 2. Anyway, off we go to the tournament.<br/>
<br/>
16 People show up on this fine rainy @#$%-ass day to play. I’ve brought my "Expanded Court" deck and Ewok Agents deck.<br/>

<br/>
My (1448) Expanded Court of the Vile Matt Mathison vs. Gregg Garris&amp;#8217; (1843) Spies and Mains<br/>
<br/>
I’m not sure whether or not this guy is any good because I haven’t ever seen him at a tournament before. Come to think of it, I hadn’t seen over half the people that were at the tournament today before. It has to be due to the fact that this is the first tournament I’ve played in since early December. So this guy is playing something that I cannot even now figure out was the main focus. All I know is that he started Massassi War Room and he had a lot of mains and spies / undercovers. After setting up my Audience. Chamber w/ Mighty Jabba, Gailid, Big-Green-Head, and Elephant Man and S&amp;V, I wait for him to move b/c I’ve got a fukking beat down crew from hell sitting in my hand. He deploys scout Luke w/ Luke’s Saber and Han w/ Han gun to the cantina, so I respond next turn w/ Boba w/ Boba gun, Bossk w/ Bossk gun, and 4LOM and initiate. I retrieve from scum and he "narrowly escapes". Well @#$%, at this point I’ve got a weaker beat down squad sitting in my hand but they’ll have to wait. Next turn he deploys Fake Han in Fake Falcon to Kiffix to drain me for the rest of the game... why didn’t I even think to try and put a stop to that? I can pull my damned ships from RESERVE! IDIOT! Ok, he also throws Boushh down in the cantina to stop my drain for next turn. Eventually he gets Obi w/ lasersword and someone else I don&amp;#8217;t remember down to the Pit of Cancun and I put down Jodo Kast on the sail barge w/ someone else I don&amp;#8217;t remember. We chase each other around a bit, him putting down undercover spies to block drains until I throw down the sarlaac at the pit w/ only Obi sitting there. I attempt to eat him, and wouldn’t you know it, I miss. Fukk. So next turn I finally get to butt smooch Boushh and I run her over to the sarlaac, and this time he gets a snack. Last ditch effort to reduce differential. It works pretty well. <br/>
Full Loss &amp;#8211;4<br/>

Highs: Fairing well against a 1800+ player in my first game since before christmas<br/>
Lows: Losing. Losing sucks (and not doing anything about his space)<br/>
<br/>
+GAME 2+<br/>
<br/>
My Expanded Court of the Vile Matt Mathison vs. David Woods&amp;#8217; (1567) Profit<br/>
<br/>
It&amp;#8217;s been a while since the last time I played, and last tournament I was in, David was playing the same deck (or so I thought) Last time I played David he was a pushover, so no worries. Bad Mistake. Underestimating David threw me off of my game. Last time I played him, this deck was ass. It was worse than ass. I could beat it twice while I was fukking asleep. But then he turned it into a profit deck that is playable. I started Mighty Jabba and Gailid (b/c I was thinking &amp;#8220;I can pull Elephant Man and Boelo with the Power of the Butt&amp;#8221;). DAMMIT!!! I forgot to start Ephant to block Artoo and a gift!!! DAMMIT!!! Ok, no prob. I butt smooch him on turn 4 or so, I wasn&amp;#8217;t draining much anyway (or battling for that matter) b/c he had to save up force like a champ to deploy past no bargain. Eventually he gets a beats crew out but by that time I have a better one. We battle back and forth for a while (and being off of my game I forget to cancel his destinies w/ Boelo and add with IG!!!) and then time is called. It took him so long to get past my unfriendly deploy to JP that neither of us had lost much life force (and what he lost he retrieved when he freed Han).<br/>

Highs: Nothing<br/>
Lows: NOT BEATING DAVID WOODS! AARGH! I HATE TIMED OUT GAMES!<br/>
<br/>
+GAME 3+<br/>
<br/>
My Ewok Agents vs. Ravi Pentapaty&amp;#8217;s (1487) playing Sander&amp;#8217;s Sucky Ties<br/>
<br/>
On the way down to the tournament Sander told me that this deck only had 4 characters in it, 2 copies each of Xizor and Palpy. So I already know what to do, kind of. I AM playing a deck I built in 10 minutes right before the tournament. First turn He puts Xizor at the DS Docking bay and puts out Wakeelmui. I get out my Landing Platform, Crix, Wicket, Bargaining Table, and Bo Shuda. I don&amp;#8217;t have a second thought about leaving Crix alone b/c all that can come and get me is Xizor and He already deployed so he can&amp;#8217;t move and battle on the same turn and I can destroy him with an @#$% load of sentries if he tries. He does some more random tie @#$% and drains for one. I block. I drain for one and get Wuta, and Kazaak out to the Platform and use Wuta to start pulling sites. I get Tessek out on turn 3 so I&amp;#8217;m draining for 3, 4, and 4, and he blocks one of the fours. He loses a lot of sites from reserve, so he can&amp;#8217;t spread and drain. His next turn he occupies his 3rd battleground and resistance takes effect. So now I&amp;#8217;m only draining for 2 at each site, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter b/c each turn I pull a site and drop a sentry for free to it from bargaining table. The turn before he dies he attempts short-range fighters and pulls 4. Thanks to the ignorance of Sander, it fails. He has like 20 Ties on the table, but there are so many different kinds in the deck that there are no more than 3 of any kind. HA! So, I use Nar Shaddaa and retrieve my lost pile (he&amp;#8217;s only been draining for like 3 a turn as opposed to my 12) and drain him to death.<br/>

Highs: seeing that my Ewok Agents CAN work, and well<br/>
Lows: having to beat Ravi<br/>

<br/>
My Expanded Court of the Vile Matt Mathison vs. Eric Erwin&amp;#8217;s (1810) Watch Your Step<br/>
<br/>
Great, I get to play Grady&amp;#8217;s other 1800+ chum. I setup my Audience chamber and sat back to respond. He deployed Han and the Falcon to Kiffex (I think) and I put up Zuckuss in Zuckuss Ship and Guri in the Stinger and battled. He reacted with Leia using I Know and forfeited another Leia from his hand using Mantillian Savrip (I&amp;#8217;ve grown to hate this card) and I lost Zuckuss. Next turn he attempted to Battle Guri not realizing that I had no presence. He put Corran Horny and a couple other tools in the Cantina. I put Jabba&amp;#8217;s Space Cruiser and my FOIL Outer Rim Scout (I&amp;#8217;m slightly proud of it) along with the virago up there and took on the falcon again. He forfeited using Mantillian Savrip again and I lost the virago and ORS. So he couldn&amp;#8217;t battle me again. I did similar things at the cantina the next 3 or so turns leaving no ability behind for him to battle. Battle and Retrieve. Battle and Retrieve. Unfortunately, even though he couldn&amp;#8217;t bring the beats down on me, he had big unblocked drains so he eventually withers me down to nothing. <br/>

<br/>
Highs: Playing exceptionally well against another high ranked player<br/>
Lows: Losing Again<br/>

Final Standings<br/>
1&gt;	Grady Hutchins<br/>
2&gt;	Brandon Ruck<br/>
3&gt;	Matt Mathison (way to go)<br/>
4&gt;	Gregg Garris<br/>
5&gt;	Eric Erwin<br/>
That&amp;#8217;s all I remember. Actually I only remembered the top 3 and I yanked 4 &amp; 5 from Grady&amp;#8217;s TR.<br/>
I don&amp;#8217;t remember exactly what place I finished, but it was bad. I finished one below Sander.<br/>
<br/>
Prize Support:<br/>
Japanese foil Imperial Walker<br/>
Virago<br/>
Stinger<br/>
Counter Surprise Assault<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing about the prize support is Matt and I went cheap @#$% and bought special ed for our entry fee when everyone else bought Reflections 2. Out of the two SE packs came a baby Jabba and a Counter Surprise Assault. I picked up the CSA and Matt got the baby Jabba and we both got 3 other cards (Matt picked up a chicken-chokin&amp;#8217; Vader) so we came out with what we bought plus MORE! SCORE! <br/>
<br/>
Props:<br/>
	-Matt for finishing 3rd and scoring a DLOTS<br/>
	-Matt for finally beating Ruck<br/>
	-Ravi for playing despite his year-long lull<br/>
Slops:<br/>
-John Camp for getting so drunk he threw up all over himself and passed out naked in a fetal position on his girlfriend&amp;#8217;s couch and being found by her roommate and most importantly missing the tournament.<br/>
	-Sander for playing assbad<br/>
	-Sander for building Ravi a sucky tie deck<br/>
	-Matt for not fully explaining the mechanics of a jawa deck to Ravi<br/>
<br/>
Please be gentle with your rating, I&amp;#8217;m new at this.<br/>
