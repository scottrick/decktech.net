<br/>
OK, I was debating whether I wanted to write a tourney<br/>
report which is why I waited a few days before submitting. <br/>
Ive been rebuffed at numerous regionals in the past and<br/>
always finish with a 4-2 record and in about 25-30th place. <br/>
This year, I was determined to do much better.  I was going<br/>
to make new decks based on DSII objectives, but realized<br/>
that I didnt know enough about the cards to make it<br/>
smooth and effective.  So I tweaked my ralltiir ops deck<br/>
that I had been running for weeks and made some subtle<br/>
changes to my baragwin ebo deck that Ive running almost<br/>
since 3rd Anthology was released (Trust me only stole the<br/>
Ishi Tib idea from decktech).<br/>
<br/>
I was suppose to carpool from Lincoln with some other<br/>
guys, but they lost my phone number so they couldnt reach<br/>
me.  I drove down by myself and got there plenty early.  I<br/>
needed to trade for a few cards.  I got there and traded for<br/>
the cards I needed and then waited for a while because the<br/>
young jedi tournament run overtime.  I looked around and<br/>
quickly saw that I was right to assume that all the big guns<br/>
would be in attendance.  We started the first game over an<br/>
hour late so it was going to be a long day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My LS Vs  Eric Gonzalez space fleet<br/>
<br/>
This guy is a local player whose been playing Pokemon<br/>
instead of SW for a while.  I start MPG and A New Secret<br/>
Base, he starts secret plans, Something Special Planned for<br/>
them and some other effect with DS Throne Room.<br/>
<br/>
The first few turns consisted of us drawing up and<br/>
deploying locations, but he was playing scanning crews, so<br/>
my Leias and Capt Hans were going away..  I deploy all<br/>
my hoth sites and start fishing for systems and next turn he<br/>
deploys a tie and pilot to Rendili.  My turn, I deploy a<br/>
baragwin  and draw getting Squadron Assignments.  He<br/>
drains, I lose a weapon and retrieve.  He deploys kiffex, a<br/>
SD, and Chrineau and another pilot to Kiffex.  I deploy<br/>
squadron assignments, show Red 5 and get Luke, deploy to<br/>
Kiffex.  He deploys another star destroyer and battles, I<br/>
hyper escape away to DSII.  when I drain, he reacts with<br/>
Emperors Sword, I deploy more  and battle, he loses ship +<br/>
some.  This is what the rest of the game consisted of, he<br/>
would deploy and battle, I would draw insane destiny and<br/>
he would lose a ton, I would use baragwins to cover the<br/>
drains I couldnt get to and drain him for the rest.<br/>
<br/>
FW 33 <br/>
2(+33)<br/>
<br/>
highs- winning big<br/>
lows-instead of the easy first game making me calm, it<br/>
made me more nervous<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My DS  Vs Kai Wilkens There is good in<br/>
him/scouts<br/>
<br/>
I start Mob points, Imperial Arrest Order, and Combat<br/>
Response.  He starts Strike Planning, Your Insight Serves<br/>
You Well, and Staging Areas<br/>
<br/>
My starting hand is horrible, no imperial commands, no<br/>
ozzel or piett.  I get a raltiir site, get exec docking bay and<br/>
deploy a at-st pilot and draw.  He gets Madine and Gen<br/>
Solo, deploys Madine and a scout to Endor DB.  I still have<br/>
nothing, deploy another docking bay and site, draw.  He<br/>
drains me for 2 and deploys more scouts including Midge.<br/>
<br/>
I still dont have what I need so I deploy Tempest Scout 1<br/>
and AT-ST pilot and move to <br/>
Endor DB.  I have two tramples and Tempest Scout 6 in my<br/>
hand so I figure Im safe.  He deploys another scout, then<br/>
Chewie (scout) and Gen Solo and Beezer (doh).  I attempt<br/>
to trample Beezer so I can react.  I draw a 1.  I attempt to<br/>
trample Chewie to decrease his power, I draw a 0.  He<br/>
battles and plays Life Debt.  I lose like 7 off the top.  I<br/>
should have flipped and just taken the drains.  Hes now<br/>
draining me for a lot and I get ops flipped but too late.  I<br/>
dont have the characters.  At one point I could have<br/>
deployed Vader/Tarkin to spaceport docking bay with a<br/>
tracked 6, but he seemed confident and I thought he had a<br/>
surprise.  I deployed them to his bunker and he plays Blast<br/>
the Door Kid.  Thats what he was relying on, but the<br/>
Spaceport docking bay isnt interior.  I would have<br/>
destroyed most of his force and been able block other<br/>
drains.  It was not to be.<br/>
<br/>
FL -17<br/>
2(+16)<br/>
<br/>
highs-whittling it down to a 17 point win<br/>
lows-losing<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS Vs a Endor Local Uprising start<br/>
<br/>
I start same, he starts staging areas, Your Insight, and<br/>
something else<br/>
Im worried about my dark deck after my beating last round<br/>
<br/>
I get a great opening hand, Imperial command for Piett, use<br/>
him to get Igar, and deploy Piett to Exec DB.  I go get<br/>
Fondor with Mobilization Points (yeah, I know fondor isnt<br/>
listed, I grabbed the wrong system that morning, but<br/>
nobody noticed, including me, until game 6).  I know I can<br/>
flip second turn.  Then he deploys three twix sites from<br/>
hand and deploys Lando and Gold Squad 1, I Imperial<br/>
Barrier.  What a load of crap, any other start for him and I<br/>
would be golden.  I draw up a turn to get some more<br/>
protection for the flip.  <br/>
He moves Lando over and now has Neim Nub on board.  I<br/>
deploy a starfighter and pilot, deploy to the other sites and<br/>
then transit from the docking bays and flip.  The rest of the<br/>
game was hard fought  because he kept deploy mains to<br/>
raltiir and flipping it back repeatedly,  I would kick them<br/>
off, but it took a while.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 8<br/>
 4 (+24)<br/>
<br/>
highs-winning<br/>
lows-winning by so little<br/>
<br/>
we take a lunch break now and I swear, some local guys<br/>
ask me if Im going to drop out.  I cant believe it.  I only<br/>
have 1 loss so I still have a small chance and dropping out<br/>
is for punks.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  My LS Vs Frank Morgans Ralltiir Ops<br/>
<br/>
This is not the player I wanted to face, I needed to win the<br/>
rest and win big<br/>
He starts Imperial decree, Something Special Planned and<br/>
something else, I start same<br/>
<br/>
Ive played this deck before at the Worlds Wildcard last<br/>
year.  He beat me then, but I know his game.  He has<br/>
boatloads of systems to get tons of activation.  Were both<br/>
activating insane amounts by turn 4.  I get EBO and<br/>
baragwins running.  I get Falcon, Capt Han and Leia to<br/>
Ralltiir against his SD with pilots.   He deploys Executor<br/>
and lots of pilots.  and battles.  I play out of nowhere so I<br/>
draw 4 destiny.  I draw 15 total, not that great given my<br/>
average destiny.  He loses three pilots, I lose everything to<br/>
attrition.  He spreads out.  I deploy Capt Han, Falcon, and<br/>
Leia again next turn to his SD with pilots.  I battle, he<br/>
reacts with SD.  I draw a 7, 5, 5.  He loses everything but<br/>
an SD, Im immune.<br/>
The rest of the game was him running away from me.  He<br/>
flipped Ralltiir briefly, but I came down with Obi and Luke<br/>
and controlled ralltiir for the rest of the game.  <br/>
<br/>
FW 25<br/>
6 (+49)<br/>
<br/>
highs-beating Frank Morgan and getting a good differential<br/>
lows-none<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  My LS Vs Tim Schartz ?  Ralltiir Ops<br/>
<br/>
He starts same as Frank, I start same.<br/>
<br/>
He had apparently never seen the baragwin thing before,<br/>
because he was really impressed by all those destiny 7s. <br/>
This game was very similar to my game with Frank.  Hed<br/>
flip ralltiir, Id flip it back.  Id battle him in space and he<br/>
would lose lots to attrition.  at the end, I should have<br/>
retrieved before I battled, but I had only tracked my<br/>
destinies towards to bottom so I ended the game<br/>
accidentally.<br/>
<br/>
FW 20<br/>
8 (+69)<br/>
<br/>
highs-going 3-0 with my LS<br/>
lows-winning by less than I could have<br/>
Game 6: My DS Vs some guys Hidden Base (I should<br/>
remember his name, but I was so nervous by now that it<br/>
escapes me)<br/>
<br/>
I start same, he starts HB and Haven.  By this point, I was<br/>
at the fourth game from the top.  I knew I needed to win big<br/>
if I had a prayer of getting in the final confrontation.<br/>
He deploys ships fast and moves to Endor for drain.  I<br/>
deploy DB, some characters and try to get Fondor (this is<br/>
when I realize my mistake).  so I draw the rest.  He drains, I<br/>
take it.  Next turn I flip.  From here it was just a matter of<br/>
whittling down his forces.  I had Search and Destroy going<br/>
and eventually trampled his spy Han and Leia.  He got a<br/>
few drains in at kessel, but they didnt hurt me that much.  I<br/>
was really stressed out by the end.<br/>
<br/>
FW 20<br/>
10 (+89)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I leave and start talking to the players above me when they<br/>
finish.  It looks like I leapfrogged them all and were<br/>
waiting for the final game which times out.  I know the<br/>
tourney director, but he wont tell me the losers<br/>
differential.  I had to wait through 78 placings before they<br/>
announced that the final confrontation would be between<br/>
me and Joshua Smith.  I couldnt believe it, I was so happy<br/>
to get here that I didnt care whether I won or lost.  <br/>
<br/>
He chooses DS first because he was first place.<br/>
<br/>
He starts Bring him Before me and some junk including<br/>
Mobilization Points and Battle Plan.  I start same<br/>
<br/>
He deploys the Emperor to Tat. DB first turn.  I deploy<br/>
sites and a baragwin.  he deploys Vader and stick to 4th<br/>
marker.  Next turn I deploy Luke w/stick from reserve and<br/>
obi w/stick to Emperor.  I battle trusting my high destiny.  I<br/>
miss with the first saber, but hit with the second and draw a<br/>
five, he draws a 1.  He loses 10 off the top including his<br/>
other emperor.  That really was the game.  He deployed<br/>
more on the ground and eventually captured Luke and<br/>
circled obi, but that just hurt him with the flip side of his<br/>
objective.  I drained him in space and won.<br/>
<br/>
FW 24<br/>
2(+24)<br/>
<br/>
OK, all I have to do is lose by less than that.<br/>
<br/>
I start same for DS, he starts  HB, strike planning, and<br/>
something else.  <br/>
He deploys fast to Rendezvous Point and moves to Endor. <br/>
I do my same mojo with db and characters and then draw. <br/>
He moves to raltiir with some ships after deploying his own<br/>
ralltiir.  I deploy a starfighter and stuff to ralltiir and flip. <br/>
Then shuttle starfighter down.  He deploys more in space.  I<br/>
get search and destroy.  Then I start coming to space with<br/>
my small fleet including Baron and his buds in the Onyxs. <br/>
He deploys a cloud and flips raltiir back.  I flip it back next<br/>
turn, but move my baron and another pilot in onyx to<br/>
clouds to do it.  This was really the only mistake I made<br/>
this game, Wedge/ship had a xwing laser cannon and I<br/>
forgot that I was maneuver -2 in the clouds,  He deploys<br/>
another starfighter and tries to eliminate the Baron...he<br/>
draws a 1.  Yes, My baron has a gun and I quickly<br/>
eliminate wedge and then beat down on his remaining fleet. <br/>
At this point he tells the TD he only has 16 cards remaining<br/>
and no retrieval.  He concedes.  And I win the regional!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I get my chance at worlds!!!!!!<br/>
