<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Veez finally wins his first Damn tournament<br>
<br>
Pre Tourney stuff<br>
<br>
Well it has been a while since I played any real SWCCG at all, like two months or so. I see a tournament at the regular place in Mansfield OH. I email my friend Jamie and ask if he is up for the tourney. He gets back to me on Friday and we are go for the tourney. I put together two new decks for the first time in 4 months for dark; I’ve been going for about a year with good ol WYS but finally put it aside for something new. For light I had a pretty standard QMC, perhaps a little stronger in space than most. For dark I put together a nifty Senate TIEs deck, but I kinda bypassed the need for characters for Battle Order/Plan, which hurt the balance of the deck, but didn’t stop it. Anyways we got there a bit early and Jamie tried to put together an interesting CCT deck, only problem is he never found a copy of the Objective in time. Anyways on to the games...<br>
<br>
Game 1 vs. Ryan Patterson’s (1628) BHBM<br>
<br>
It was an interesting matchup that never really got rolling for Ryan. He’s the local TD and member of Shadow Squad and is a pretty good player on the side. He set up the first few turns with Palpy and Sideous at the Throne Room and D* II db waiting for me to make a move. I wasn’t finding my ground pounders but set up in the sky with Super Wedge in RS1 and Red 8 with its matching dude. After a while I finally set up on the ground with Lando on crack and EPP Leia at her hut. He went for a space strike with Zuckuss in MH and Bossk and the Bus, but the Bus hit a Rebel Barrier. Zuck went ahead and attacked anyways with the help of the Emperors Power, only for me to flip a 6 for my destiny added to power along with Wedge nixing one of his. That left the Bus there for the next turn. I squassined with R2inRed 5 but only the farmboy was available. Red squad laid it into Bossk but the farmboy was stuck in the stars. So Vader camped out at the Endor DB and hit me for Your Destiny for the rest of the game, but I soon found Honor of the Jedi to cut the pain there. I just drained and retrieved the rest of the way finishing with a strike on Sideous thanks to Corran and EPP Obi.<br>

FW by 25 - 2(+25)<br>
<br>
Game 2 vs. Ken Cross (1648) QMC <br>
<br>
This was an interesting game as two new decks went at it. I set up in the Senate with Tikes and the other blockade senator dude while he pulled sites and drew. I set up over Bespin with a Dreadnought and two Interceptors while spreading a draining a bit in other places. He finally put the Falcon with Melas driving up at Bespin only to flip, then retreat back to Bespin CC sector. We just kept pinging and setting up for a while till he made a move. He put a Red guy and ship up there with Cannons (¿Red 8 maybe?) Wedge and Dash on the Outrider and Capn Han and Melas on the Falcon, and started Celebration moving his ships up to staredown with mine. Luckily I had some nastiness up my sleeve as well. I dropped a cannon on each TIE, prayed for good destiny and started a fight. I used the super text on Interceptors to fire twice to blow all of his ships away and take over the system for good. We kept drainin each other, me with the advantage with my senators and U-3P0 doing some blocking action along with Imp Decree to keep him in check. I got him down by a lot as time expired and he was nice enough to draw up his last 3. Thanks Ken<br>

FW by 26 - 4(+51)<br>
<br>
At this point some guys dropped so they could start the regular LOTR tourney on time, so the pairing were a bit screwy<br>
<br>
Game 3 vs. Michael Rhodebeck (1650) TDIGWATT<br>
<br>
Now this was gonna be interesting. I set up quick in space with Farmboy and his good ship and droid, soon followed by Super Wedge in RS1. That was enough, as he never did come after me in space. I did an ol skool flip putting out Lando and sending Luke down to his Bespin CC sector. He let loose his mains led by Maul and his double whammy stick to give chase to my fellows. Pucmir came out and hid in the Upper Plaza corridor for most of the game to up the damage. He gave chase but Barriers and Paths gave me the advantage. I finally got an opening when a Stormtrooper Garrison moved in to go after Pucimir. Suddenly EPP Leia, Chewie Protector and Bren crashed the party an applied some big smack (too bad I missed the shot or it might have been game). Meanwhile Celebration was up and running and Lando and EPP Obi were leading the DS forces around in merry chase. Between V-Luke, and Celebration, I finished with no cards in the lost pile and finally wore him down for the win.<br>
<br>
FW by 32 - 6(+83)<br>
<br>
Game 4 vs. Michael Rhodebeck (1650) HB and toys<br>
<br>
He started HB, another toughie for my deck. I had all the Senators I needed in my hand so Lott conducted the Senate with Tikkes with no problems. I set up and waited for his fleet. He set up the Cantina shuffle in the early going with Mindful of the Futures and set up Qui Gon and EPP Luke doing the moves. He popped out about six systems and I put out a few, so there was a large spaceline on the table. Finally he put sent some guys to Coruscant (Rl-inR1 and Dash in the Outrider) only to be greeted by one of the Emperors squads and All Power to Weps. I got him out of there, but he started goin after my guys elsewhere and the Radiant 7 proved to be a pain with its armor along with some Barrier abuse on his part. I chased and he flipped and I started probin. It took a while but I finally tracked down his base, while blocking his drain with the senators and Dreaded Imp Starfleet. My drains (and a bit of direct damage from the Naboo Senator) finally were getting through but time was soon called and I pulled it out. <br/>

TW by 19 - 7(+102)<br/>
<br/>
That was enough for first place as I think there were no other undefeateds on the day. A most excellent day! I almost forgot my tourney foil and packs but remembered before we got far. Now time for some props and slops.<br/>
<br/>
Props <br/>
<br/>
To Jamie for driving down, giving me a few cards I needed and all the tech ideas.<br/>
