Game 1<br/>
<br/>
DS vs. can&amp;#8217;t remember TIGIH matching pilots<br/>
<br/>
I start no bargain, power of the hut, and I think secret plans.  He starts strike planning, squadron assignments, and I think staging areas.  First turn I grab a site, draw.  First turn he moves luke then deploys kessel and some pilot. ouch.  Second turn I grab a site, draw.  He drains for 5, deploys kiffex and some pilot and draws. Things are not looking good.  I set up scum, presence of the force, mosep, gallid, boelo etc in chamber, m. jabba at jp.  I draw and get u3po, awesome.  He forgets to drain, deploys endor and gen. cal., then leia to jabba&amp;#8217;s site, which gets none shall pass.  I drain, deploy u3p0 to luke’s site, which stops his drain for the rest of the game, I set up search and destroy, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it was this turn or not but I deploy bossk and zuckuss to kessel, he doesn&amp;#8217;t have 7 abil, so I eliminate him, then move to endor and kill gen. cal..  He drains, deploys leia to jabba’s site, I none shall pass, the gen. han to luke’s site to stop s+d.  He eventually kills jabba but shortly after I finally get completely set up in the palace, and he&amp;#8217;s only draining for 2 at kiffex, so I win.  He might have won had he not forgotten to force drain a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
highs: nothing spectacular, except maybe u-3p0 surviving.<br/>
lows:  1st turn kessel, 2nd turn kiffex.<br/>

Game 2<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. Eric Olsen&amp;#8217;s matching ties/tie swarm<br/>
<br/>
I start Squad assignments, insurrection, and I think staging areas.  He starts combat response, mp, and I can&amp;#8217;t remember, he doesn&amp;#8217;t play syc but starts kuat and pulls wakeelmui to get a fair amount of force.  He draws first turn, as do I.  2nd turn the baron in saber 1 and a tie interceptor comes to tant.  I drop chewie at cantina a raltiir Capt. to the db to flip.  Third turn he drains then deploys a matching guy to kyshyyk I think.  I drain and either this turn or the next he loses dreaded imp starfleet off the top.  I set up Capt. han, melas on falcon at kessel and move the Capt. to cantina.  He drains and I think just draws.  I drain, deploy outrider, I&amp;#8217;ll take the leader, and move him to wakeelmui, he gravity shadow but misses.  He deploys merrijk and pulls kessel which cuts my drain to two, then he comes to beet me down at wakeelmui but I barrier the emps sword, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t have enough force to do any thing else but he lateral damages the outrider and lets me go.  The rest of the game consists of a few space battles.  He eventually killed dash with a gravity shadow, which sucked.  I decide to move the falcon to kysshyk to block his drain.  He spends a bunch of force to come beet me down, lateral damage&amp;#8217;s me and deploys a tie cannon, so I&amp;#8217;m scared.  He initiates, I lose one off the top to first strike&amp;#8230;it&amp;#8217;s hyperescape!  So I escape to tantooine, and get rid of lateral damage.  He was pretty mad, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there was another in my lost pile, and at the very least I had a houjix in my hand.  I tamed tantooine with the falcon, and set up celebration, and he just picks up.   He didn&amp;#8217;t have oppressive enforcement, something special, or secret plans, so I retrieved 17 from on the edge during the game.<br/>
<br/>
highs: hyperescape is awesome.<br/>
lows: gravity shadow.<br/>

FW(+10)<br/>

Game 3<br/>
<br/>
LS vs. Scott S. mkos<br/>
<br/>
I start menace fades, insurrection, and sqaud assignments.  He starts no bargain, something special, and power of the hutt.  Pulls site, draws, as do i.  Pulls site draws, as do i.  Sets up gallid etc. at ac.  I set up Capt. han at kessel, and 2 r.f. Capt. at the cantina, and deploy mos eisly.  So gallid is useless, he drains and beets me up at the cantina, for the next couple of turns we duke it out over the cantina and mos eisly, he wins.  I set up I&amp;#8217;ll take the leader, and luke and two captains at a spaceport db at kessel.  We&amp;#8217;re both draining but he brings his guys over to the space port, where I eventually kill them, he doesn&amp;#8217;t have scum out and by this time most of his guys are dead, so I come back to tant, use effective repairs out of the lost pile to retrieve tant. celeb, which I thought was going to be useless.  He never comes to space, and I eventually get battle order out.  I&amp;#8217;ve been draining for four in space most of the game, but occasionally he cancels the drain at kessel with his rep.  I retrieve 10 with on the edge, a few more with celebration, and menace fades lets me out drain him.<br/>
<br/>
highs:  no space battles and no scum until very late game.  watching these wimpy smugglers take out bounty hunters.<br/>
lows:  losing control of tant. early game.<br/>
<br/>
FW(+15ish)<br/>

Game 4<br/>
<br/>
DS vs. Steve Kupermen&amp;#8217;s I Hate Scum deck<br/>
<br/>
He starts obi&amp;#8217;s hut, so I have no idea what he&amp;#8217;s doing so my third effect is secret plans.  The bloody bastard starts careful planning to convert my jp.  This wasn&amp;#8217;t even a game because he got goo nee tay out first turn and never gave me more than two force so I was activating 5 for the first half of the game and 7 the rest.  He took over his ac with ben and scrubs, I try pitiful attempts to get him out but to no avail.  I attempt to catch some his people in a sandwhirl, but fail.  He&amp;#8217;s playing sac, which is quite a surprise, so none shall pass and all that stuff doesn&amp;#8217;t work.  Obi&amp;#8217;s hut is in between the desert and jp so he has a place to deploy and move.  Some how he only wins by 27. <br/>
<br/>
highs: I think I killed a bomar monk.<br/>
lows: careful planning.<br/>

Game 5<br/>
<br/>
DS vs I can&amp;#8217;t remember chu&amp;#8217;s x-wings<br/>
<br/>
I start no bargain, power, and cannot hide.  He starts strike planning, wa/dodn and insight.  I pull sites and draw for the next couple turns, he signal&amp;#8217;s for an undercover so I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure its not numbers so I ditch cannot hide to pull s+d.  Mosep made him lose S-foils off the top, and secret plans prevented All Wings.  Hutt influence and Ephant mon won the game because he couldn&amp;#8217;t cancel or deploy a spy to the ac where I had a presence of the force.  I eventually went to space and knocked off most of his drains except kessel, which I probed the first turn he flipped and ghhked next turn.  The hb was kessel, which I knew because I&amp;#8217;ve played with chu&amp;#8217;s xwings before and this was it card for card.  I out drain him and s+d does its job.<br/>
<br/>
highs: good match up for me, and I knew his deck well.  mosep.<br/>
lows: none, it was just a typical mkos vs. hb game.<br/>
<br/>
FW(+20ish)<br/>

<br/>
Game 6<br/>
<br/>
LS vs Mark&amp;#8217;s hd<br/>
<br/>
I start insurrection, squad, and battle plan.  He starts iao, mp, and crush the rebellion.  He gets vader down to cc db 2nd turn.  I think I flip 3rd turn, controlling kessel and cantina and deploy mos eisly.  We battle a lot on the ground, I would have spanked him except he canceled clash with crush, and had guri.  I didn&amp;#8217;t want luke anywhere near vader who he brought over to the cantina because he had reactor terminal out.  Basically I set up celebration with luke at the tant db, a bunch of scrubs at mos eisly battling emp, guri, and sim. He leaves vader and tarkin in cantina and drains me for three most the game, but I got battle plan out and celebration makes most of it up.  He came to space once with zuckuss but dash/outrider with Capt. han and melas (who was barriered but able to apply ability against zuckess&amp;#8217;s game text.) in the falcon showed him whose boss, I think he had to lose 10 force.  He had no retrieval stoppers so I got 15 from on the edge.<br/>
<br/>
highs: beeting zuckuss bad.  no retrieval stoppers.<br/>
lows: guri.<br/>
FW(15ish)<br/>

10(48)<br/>
<br/>
Steve Kuperman and I are the only one&amp;#8217;s 5-1, but he has a way higher differential because he played 3 scum decks with his deck.  He metad really well.  So I finish second which isn&amp;#8217;t bad considering I haven&amp;#8217;t played in a tournament in almost 3 months.  I&amp;#8217;d like to thank ron, eric, and al for transpiration, and eric for the r.f. captains.<br/>
