<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">well today i walked outside and just sh1t my pants.  it’s SOOOO freakin’ cold in illinois right now, and since i’m a real pu$$y when it comes to driving in bad weather, i’m staying in my cozy apartment and watching movie after movie after movie.  so a couple of weeks ago, we were supposed to have a tournament here in hell...but NOOOO, someone had to go and schedule an L5R tournament the same day!  dammit.  so we only got like 6 people.  we sat and played a few games...and that was it.  nothin’ special...but i got a chance to play for the first time since i’ve come back from the phoenix mega-slam thingy.<br/>
<br/>
game 1: my LS (yes i finally broke down and xerox’d a deck from clint’s page) EBO "deadbolt" vs. Dave’s SYCFA "i’ll blow up your sh1t" deck.<br/>
<br/>
i got out ebo on like...turn 3 with Haven at hoth, and even though he STARTED with "something special planned for them" i still finished at +34.  the pivotal moment in the game was when Luke/Obi/cracken came to the DS warroom to shoot some Gunners so he couldn’t blow up alderaan...and after that, i had to put orrimarko, luke, and ben at the DS docking bay so he couldn’t occupy a battleground site (orrimarko is cool for this since he gets around the SYCFA battle damage clause).  ben kept coming back...and coming back...and coming back due to Figrin/Draw their Fire/Ketwol stuff.  whoa, this deck is fun to play!<br/>
<br/>
game 2: my DS Ralltir Overseeing it personally deck vs. Dave’s MB-ops (massassi base ops)<br/>
<br/>
this guy is actually planning on blowing up the death star!!!  he starts getting stuff out (like sites) and i just take my time and flip on like turn 4 or 5.  the emperor comes down to the swamp or wherever and starts overseeing things...and i have Bad Feeling out, so noone big is hitting the table.  5 turns later and he’s down to about 10 cards...all of a sudden BOOM and i lost like 14 to him blowing up the LS death star...WTF!  why?  because he drew 2x Star Destroyer for his destiny.  i guess if you pack 3x traffic control, then you’re gonna stack SOMETHING.<br/>
so i win by like 20<br/>
<br/>
game 3: LS vs. ANOTHER dave’s Huntdown manipulator<br/>
<br/>
this guy hasn’t played in like a year...but for some reason he has like this good deck (he’s actually a VERY good player from back in the day).  so i’m looking at my opening hand, and out of the 7 cards (8 if you count ANSB itself) in the deck that can go get ANSB there are 0.  screw this, so i start digging around for stuff using Strike Planning...and i FINALLY draw a signal on like turn 4 or something. WTF!  that SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. so anyhoo...i’m losing a buttload of force (from 2 drains of 1 + visage) and i can’t really do anything about it right away ’cause i’m not really generating any force.  so i decide to try and at least even up the force loss and drop EBO + put ships at endor and hoth...and he’s paying for his own Battle Order. so i start to catch up, but he keeps playing FEAR!!! fear, man...it’s NOT good for me at this point since i got such a slow start.  so after not doing jack for like the first 6 turns or so, i’ve finally got him down to about 13 force and i’m at about 8...he plays secret plans, and i’m only able to retrieve 4 from OTE, + i’m having to pay for drains.  i think i might actually eek it out, but i make a slight mistake and think "well if he’s playing with Limited Resources, which i’m sure he is, then i shouldn’t drop below 2 cards in my hand."  GUESS WHAT!!! i didn’t play too much SWCCG back in the day when LIMITED F UCKING RESOURCES WAS POPULAR and somehow i forget that it’s "2 or less" not "less than 2."  F U C K me.  so that’s game.<br/>
<br/>
game 4 my DS vs. Dave’s MWYHL counterassault/manipulator/retrieval deck<br/>
<br/>
dave starts training Shasa Tiel....whoa that’s a new one, and he insists on looking through my force pile every turn.  AFA is insterted, but i’m in luck today and it doesn’t come up for awhile.  i really have to use what i’ve drawn in my first 12 cards or so, and when he loses a Dagobah site off the top, i know i’ve won it because to train Shasa Tiel AT ALL you need all 5 dagobah sites + yoda, and if he HAD played with the other cards to facilitate training, he would’ve deployed them by now.  i go about fortifying on ralltir so that his counterassaults (i saw his hand with a Monnok) won’t hurt me.  mara w/stick is draining for 3, Lord Vader is draining for 3, and the emperor is draining for 2 (overseeing things personally)...and i grab his visored vision, grab his Off the Edge (which he was playing with Artoo at the CC:dbay) and i cancel his AFA’s with Proj.Telepathy...and noone ever comes to ralltir, and noone bothers bossk/fett at Kashyyyk.  nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
so out of 6 people playing, i go 3-1 and only play 2 different people...with a dif of 70 or so.  woopadeedoo.<br/>
<br/>
so now it’s like 4am...and i’m reading the Community Buzz boards...and it’s still the same old sh1t.  faramir is busy being a busybody, some dude named testicle is being an a$$, and matt is just trying to keep law and order.  WTF, man...isn’t decktech supposed to be about THE GAME?  why is it about knockin’ other people?  why is it about getting all your buddies to give someone 1/2 stars on everything?  why is it about going by some random secret name?  play the game...enjoy Reflections 2...make new decks...<br/>

i don’t believe in magic, i don’t believe in i-ching, i don’t believe in bible, i don’t believe in tarot, i don’t believe in hitler, i don’t believe in jesus, i don’t believe in kennedy, i don’t believe in buddha, i don’t believe in mantra, i don’t believe in gita, i don’t believe in yoga, i don’t believe in kings, i don’t believe in elvis, i don’t believe in zimmerman, i don’t believe in beatles, i just believe in me, yoko and me, and that’s reality<br/>
<br/>
those are the words of a man who was shot 20 years ago.  he died for what he believed in.  he lived and died for peace.  how many of you would do the same?  he was willing to overlook everything in his life because all he cared about was his love for his wife and his music.  someone shot him for...well...no real reason i guess.<br/>
<br/>
let’s not be ignorant fools this year.  let’s not let our indulgences get the better of us.  let’s try to understand and learn from each other.<br/>
<br/>
have a happy holiday season, and for those of you who DO believe, merry christmas, happy channukah (sp?), and be safe.  <br/>
