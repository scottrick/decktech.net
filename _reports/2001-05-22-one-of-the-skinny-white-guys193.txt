<blockquote><font class="bfont"> ignore the last one please.<br>
i made a mistake.<br>
<br>
im not going to go over any pre-tourney stuff, since everything was pretty uneventful. i will, however, post the email i sent to the decipher listserve so everyone can see my predictions. as posted on friday morning, here it is:<br>
&lt;BEGIN EMAIL&gt;<br>
<br>
i like what mike dalton did for Nj states, so i thought i would make some predictions of my own. player: odds: <br>
aaron moore 2 to 1 <br>
ben young 3 to 1 <br>
kevin elia 3 to 1 <br>
cameron coiner 5 to 1 <br>
scott swallow 12 to 1 <br>
jon westergaurd 20 to 1 <br>
anyone else 50 to 1 <br>
heres why i think these make sense: <br>
aaron moore is a really great player. his rating is over 2000, he consistently wins almost everything he plays in, and finished second last year. i think hes going to take it just because he has proven himself to be one of the best and can take on everyone. <br>
<br>
ben young won last year, and is still a major power in our area. currently the highest rated player in maryland, i certainly expect him to make a good showing. his only weakness is he is somewhat predictable. <br>
<br>
kevin elia(me!!!) is a slacker. his rating dropped almost 100 points since february, but only because i was trying out alot of bad decks, and playing in alot of unfamiliar areas. anyone who is from MD should know me by reputation alone, and also know my deck history. i tend to play some really good deck for a long time, until i scrub out with it. last year at states, after screwing himself early, he only ended up getting 5th. the best weapon he has is his WINNING OVERALL TRACK RECORD AGAINST EVERYONE IN THE STATE except aaron moore, who he is 1-1 against. <br>
<br>
cameron coiner is a great creator of ideas, master of tech, and all around good guy. he didnt play from august 2000 to february 2001, which will most likely prove to be his downfall. i believe he has major control over just about everyone else, save kevin and ben. <br>
<br>
scott swallow, who is fairly low rated, is also underrated, can prove quite a challenge. so long as he doesnâ€™t get caught cheating, he can do some high-level damage. <br>
<br>
jon rounds out the top 6, because he can suprise you and pull out alot of close games. his only trouble is he has no dark side deck worth playing too much, so he needs to pull out alot of his close games and get a huge diff in the others. <br>
<br>
as i see it, the only 4 worth watching are ben, me, aaron, and cameron, simply because we form a brick wall in our area. <br>
<br/>
as for the final confrontation, my ACTUAL prediction is aaron moore vs kevin elia, with aaron probably pulling it out. the tournament is tommorrow, so i hope everyone looks out for some tourney reports on decktech. <br/>

<br/>
so there it is.<br/>
<br/>
game 1: my wys vs cameron coiners hunt down<br/>
	i start regular stuff, he starts regular stuff. he gets a first turn vader to cantina. i lose to visage. my turn i sack insight to get honor of the jedi, so i dont have to lose to visage. on my second turn, i realize that he never actually flipped his objective, so i drop luke in r2 in red 5 to kessel. make him lose 1 to visage. told you he was out of touch. anyway, after making him lose to visage for a few turns, and him trying to talon roll luke only to tie and then get beat down, he starts running low. he finally kills off luke and then i play jedi luke to some docking bay. he gets no escape out, but its too late and his visage just cant hurt me enough. in the end i kill the emperor and janus in the cantina, and drain him out. <br/>
<br/>
full win +14<br/>
2 (+14)<br/>
<br/>
round 1 in review:<br/>
	ben, me, aaron, and brad griffie all won our first games. bryce lost, but at this point i did not know this coloradian was even playing with us. turns out he was in boarding school and talked to juz and he said he could play in md states. cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
game 2: my ds tatooine vs aaron moores mains beats and sabbac<br/>
	i start tatooine and jabbas palace, he starts mwyhl and goo nee tay. i get set up in space and the holotable real fast, but he completely controls tatooine. no occupation, oh well. i cant draw chiraneau or an imperial command all game, and battle order and my twileks just disappear off top of reserve. my space drains plus holotable are wearing him away fast, but his drain of 5 on tatooine are killing my tracking and high destinies. he blows away my holotable, because my holonet trans is already down there, so he ends up outdraining me. <br/>
<br/>
full loss -9<br/>
2 (+5)<br/>
<br/>
round 2 in review:<br/>
	well, now i have to win my last 4 games. i can do this. ben, cameron, aaron, and brad all win thier games, and bryce does too. at least my next two games should be scrubs.<br/>
<br/>
game 3: my wys vs seth binfield mkos jawas<br/>
	i start regular stuff, so does he. he reveals herat as his rep, and im like &amp;#8220;TD, he just showed a female alien as his rep.&amp;#8221; anyway, for some BS reason i thought your rep had to be a male. shows how much of a scrub i can be. well, there wasnt any battles all game, i edge for like 13 cards, finally get bo shuda out, but menace fades doesnt come until the end. drains at kessel, kiffex, and the cantina do him in, even after retrieving 8 from abyssin ornament.<br/>
not sure of my win, so im just gonna give approximate numbers from now on.<br/>
<br/>
full win +17?<br/>
4(+20?)<br/>
<br/>
round 3 in review:<br/>
	ok, 2-1, not so bad. ben, aaron, cameron, bryce, and brad win again. and me of course. its surprising none of them have met yet in a game. now the field is narrowing down, and the matchups are getting tougher for the undefeated.<br/>
<br/>
game 4: ny ds tatooine vs jaimes wys pile<br/>
	ok, i designed my ds to drop anything wys could throw. i control tatooine with the executor, battle deployment is out so he only gets one destiny on the ground, i have well earned command out, so i am draining him for 2 at the holotable, like 5 on tatooine, 3 from occupation, and 2 in space. game over in about 10 turns. oh, and the super high point of the game was when he was doing a kessel run and i drew ozzel. he just started laughing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
full win by 31<br/>
6 (+50?)<br/>
<br/>
round 4 in review:<br/>
	ben lost to bryce, which (no offense to bryce) was a bit of an upset. he just got this sick draw, and ben had no way to recover from so much damage. aaron beats brad i think, so hes the only remaining undefeated. cameron wins. right now, theres like seven 3-1 people and one 4-0.<br/>
<br/>
break: me and ben jump in my car, head over to taco bell (which i hate) and chill with dave evans. mostly we were talking about what to do for ds after tatooine, and how bryce basically raped ben.<br/>
<br/>
game 5: my wys vs bryce stevensons &amp;#8216;ben killer&amp;#8217;<br/>
	the ben killer is just your basic bhbm beats. anyway, after me not finding luke in reserve for artoo in red 5, i deploy theron nett on it to kessel on my second turn. he has the emp at the tatooine docking bay, and we both have to pay for my battle plan. since the first battle is so important to the outcome, ill go over it interrupt by interrupt, play by play:<br/>
1. he deploys avenger(with chiraneau piloting) and zuckass in mist hunter to kessel, against my lone 	theron nett in red 5, and battles.<br/>
2. i play do not underestimate our chances, to triple battle damage<br/>
3. i play rapid fire to get an xwing laser cannon from reserve<br/>
4. i fire at zuckass for free, and hit. not lost :(<br/>
5. i play stay sharp to add laser cannon destiny to my power (5)<br/>
6. concentrate all fire makes my guy power +3<br/>
7. i power pivot the avenger (power 0) <br/>
so im at 15, and after destiny he has 5. tripled, he has 30 battle damage. everyone dies plus a bunch off reserve. fun stuff.<br/>
so after alot of draining i end up winning by 25.<br/>
<br/>
full win by 25<br/>
8 (+75?)<br/>
<br/>
round 5 in review:<br/>
	be beats aaron, cameron wins, and brad lost somewhere earlier to aaron. this guy yahn is 4-1, so the final confrontation is still open to 5 people. me, ben, aaron, yahn, and cameron. bryce and brad are <br/>
3-2. that means 4 of us will match up, and one gets a lower player. as it ends up, i get yahn, aaron gets cameron, and ben gets a 2-3 player for some f&amp;#8217;ed up reason. well, im glad i have the top score right now.<br/>
<br/>
game 6: my ds vs yahns hidden base flip with epps<br/>
	well, i knew he was playing hidden base because he said something about it earlier. so i start jabbas palace and sec precautions. after a long drawn out wait for him to flip and some small stuff on the ground, i get the executor and zuckass to probe. i get the base, he loses 8, and then i drain the hell out of him. i also go to trample epp luke, so that was cool.<br/>
<br/>
full win by 22<br/>
10(+99)<br/>
<br/>
swiss in review:<br/>
	aaron moore 10 (+100)<br/>
	kevin elia     10 (+99)<br/>
	ben young     10(+87)<br/>
	bryce stevenson  8(+alot)<br/>
	brad griffie    8(+less)<br/>
	cameron coiner 8(+not too much)<br/>
<br/>
so its me and aaron in the final. &lt;SEE EMAIL ABOVE&gt;<br/>
<br/>
aaron proceeds to absolutely destroy me, as you can see in any of the other trs by other people present. i dont feel like getting into it. i lose by 35 and then by 17. in the game where he was ds though, when i only had 3 cards left, i managed to cause 66 battle damage to myself. i was in a good mood throughout the whole thing, in light of the 0(-52) final. i apologized to jeff cook (the TD) for the HORRIBLE showing, but he said i made it fun even if i didnt make it very close. but he meant it in a completely good way. well, i have one of the fanny packs, and thats all that matters. playing 8 games of starwars is very draining.<br/>
<br/>
contact me if you have any admirals orders for trade, the current count is 678. i need all the help i can get.<br/>
