<blockquote><font class="bfont"> Pre tourney stuff-<br>
I’d only played a feww games in playtesting for this tournament, but I won all but one, so I didn’t really have to do more. I was playing Hunt Down Dueling for Dark, and a profit loosely based on the White Shadow for light. My rating going in to the tournament was 1722. On to the tournament.  <br>
<br>
Tournament-<br>
When my brother (1642) and I arrived, we made the 7th and 8th players.  Then a bunch of others showed up, making sixteen players. Just as we were about to call pairings, Steve Brentson (1926) came and made us an odd number.<br>
<br>
Game 1: Dark vs. Karl Sundberg (1850) Our Most Desperate Hour.<br>
This is a very good deck, and Karl is a good player, so I wasn’t to happy about this macthup, but I had things Going for me: I had my Oversize objective, Foil Holotheatre, and Foil Meditation Chamber, so I had good luck on my side. I draw my hand... Vader, Prince, Emperor (foil), and weapon Lev. Yes! First turn I activate 4, drop Rendili and Endor DB from my hand, then search for DS DB, We both lose to visage, and he goes. He pulls Tatooine, and drops that DB, then draws. He loses off the top to Visage, Honor. Yes! My turn I Put vader at endor DB, flip and draw. He activates, drops Alderran and draws. My turn I drop Emperor and someone else to the DS DB, used weapon lev to get vader’s saber and put it on him. He puts Super Home One at tatooine and eats visage and my drains for a few turns, while I fortify my sites.  Then He puts Corran Horny boy and Twass Khaa in the Holotheatre to cancel visage.  Next turn I drop prince on them, battle.  I draw a 6 to his 1, both his guys die, prince stays. A few turns later he drops Jedi Luke w/saber, EPP Han, and EPP Leia to Vader’s site.  He asks if I will duel, and I say no. He battles, I steal his saber and duel with focased attack.  My destinies: 1,1,6, which is 11 because I have a saber, but luke brings it down to 8. He draws 2 1’s. He decide’s to lose luke instead of crossing, so he loses 18. Then I hit Leia and perate, leaving han vs. Vader and Dr. E &amp; Ponda Boba. He loses han + 4, which is the game.<br>
FW + 23<br>
2 +23<br>
<br>
Highs: Beating Karl, having Hunt Down work nicely the first time I play it in a tourney<br>
Lows: None<br>
<br>
Game 2: Light vs. Joe Kollisch (1480) BHBM<br>
Joe has been getting help from Karl, so he’s doing alot better now than he was before, and can ussually at least split his games. He starts Mara and Fett w/gun. His turn he pulls the DS II DB and puts Palpy their, and Mara’s stick on her. My turn I drop Lando w/ vibrator and forget that I can get Masta from my  deck for free, so I battle with just lando.  I try to exclude Mara, but I get a 1, Crap!, Mara hits lando, Crap!, and I draw a 1 for destiny, Crap!.  And I have good destiny in this deck too. He drops Vader to the Chamber and a couple Royal Guards with Ax’s to emperor’s site and then transits them to Tatooine. My turn I give him Jedi Luke and Drop Blount with Obiwan to the Throne Room, and Dash in outrider to Carida. On his turn he Transits the emperor back to DS II, and moves Vader’s Squad to JP. I drop EPP Leia to the Empty Chameber and free han. I start to do a lot of damage, but forget that emperor can’t move to obi’s site so I get chased around there a little. he wins a few duels late in the game, but my damage kills him in the end.<br>
FW +3<br>
4 +26<br>
<br>
Highs: Winning.<br>
Lows: Forgetting rules, slow start, only winning by 3.<br>
<br>
Game Three: Dark vs. Nick Ares (1600) TIGIH<br>
I have no vader in my hand, so I search with imp. arrest order to get Endor DB, and see all my vader’s are in my deck. I deploy Rendili and drop Sim to the DB to cut his activation.On his turn he starts to activate for luke’s site but I tell him he can’t.  He just sits there and waits to get more force.  My next turn I look through my deck and get DS DB, and see that 2 vader’s are in my force pile.  I start drawing until I get a Vader and a saber. On his turn he gives me luke and saves his force. I deploy vader to flip and transfer luke. On his turn he keeps saving force.  Next I deploy prince to the DS DB and play S&amp;D, then move Sim to DS DB.  He keeps saving, and has about 20 force at this point, but I am doing a lot of damage. My turn I put Emperor at DS, and tarkin at endor.  On his turn he Dploys Daughter with Saber and profiecency, General Solo, General Crix, and Wuta to vader’s site.  Then he tries to battle, but I show him the text on my objective.  He asks to take back Wuta, so i let him. He ends his turn, and on my turn I drop Kir Kanos and battle.  I weapon lev. leias saber, Hit han and miss crix, and I forfiet Kir.His turn he runs to the Hut, and my drains, S&amp;D, and visage soon kill him.<br>
FW +24<br/>
6 +50<br/>
<br/>
Highs: my deck working perfectly<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
All the undefeated players (me, steve Brentson, and Steve Valley) just played dark, so it will just be diff.  I have 50, Steve Valley has 53, and Steve Brentson has 78. Unless Brentson loses, he will win the tournament, so I am trying for second. The pairings end up being that everyone would play whoever they just played.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Light vs. Nick Ares (1600) Court<br/>
He starts Fett w/ gun and Dengar w/ gun. On his first turn he drops scum, then Ephant mon, Galid and Mosep to the chamber. I put down Mos Eisley and get H1 Db and put crix there to start activating a ton. Then he puts Jabba da butt at the chamber and is done. I get a scout and the tatooine DB, then put Blount and Cracken at the tat Db, and Twass Khaa and Mirax at Mos Eisley. His turn he deploys Ree-Yees to the dungeon and moves Mosep over. I deploy Corran and Obi to the dungeon. Battle, make obi move away, draw a 5 for destiny.  My power 15 to his 3. (I love Corran Horn) He loses Ree-yees and 7. On his turn he moves his whole chamber crew out to JP, and does nothing else. I drop EPP Leia and Chewie, Protector to free Han and cancel scum. He moves all his guys back to the Chamber and adds Bane. I swicth Obi to Ben, add anikan’s saber to Leia, and Move Ben and Corran to the Chamber. He battles he kills han and I kill a couple guys, revive han. On my turn I battle kill some more people, and revive han again. He runs away, and I chase him with some of my guys, trapping him between a few sites, with people on all sides. He moves to Twass’s site, I drop hashn, battle him, and kill the rest of his guys, while I just forfiet Hashn. He has no guys left now, and only a few cards left.  I ask one of the kids wacthing my game to ask steve vallee how much he won by. Steve won by 24.  Which means I need to win by 27 to tie, 28 to get second place outright.  I count my deck, 26 cards. So I am using Mirax like mad trying to find a used interupt to play so I can at least tie for second, while "forgetting" to force drain or do profit damage.  Then Nick draws up while I am still looking for a used interupt.<br/>
FW + 26<br/>
8 +76<br/>
<br/>
1st Place: Steve Brentson : 8 +112<br/>
2nd Place: Steve Vallee: 8 +77<br/>
3rd Place: Brian Hollingworth (me) 8 +76<br/>
<br/>
I got a liberty foil, some rares, and a pack of ds II and reflections II for prize support. I got a flagship Executor and Twass Khaa Foil in the packs.  Then I went to talk to brentson, and he got a Lord Vader foil in his pack, so I worked out a deal and got the lord vader.<br/>
That’s all for now. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></font></blockquote>
