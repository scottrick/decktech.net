Pre-tourney:<br/>
Well, it’s been like 2 months since my last sanctioned constructed tourney. First, there was EP1, then there was non-sanctioned EP1, then there was non-sanctioned constructed, and three weeks later, I finally get to go to a tourney I like.  For weeks, I’ve had only one opponent, Bill. We’ve playtested way too many hours than I’d like to count, so it was a blessing to play some new people. So my team (that would be me and Bill ;-P) along with Jon Dansbury head to Abington, get there giving us enough to sanction, and we start in a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
My decks:<br/>
Light- It’s posted under expert decks, called ’Amish Paradise.’ It’s a WYS that I’ve been playing for like 6 months now. It retrieves everything.<br/>
Dark- I’ve been trying a LOT of decks recently, BHBM, Scum, and Senators to name a few. But I decided to stick with Senators because it can find stuff easily. So it’s Senators with mains, and high destiny interrupts. It’s also slightly tecked out against WYS and Kim Caton’s Dagohboring, which has been kicking my a$$ lately.<br/>
<br/>
So I go into this tourney at 1744 with 94 games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
My Amish Paradise (WYS) vs. Kim Caton (1872) ISB/Walkers<br/>
Great. I’m like 1-7 against Kim in sanctioned games. I won this matchup last time, but of course it wasn’t sanctioned because of the Bill Debacle (long story). So Kim starts in the normal Kim way, drawing for the first few turns. She got out YMSYL and pulled the 3rd Marker and Walker Garrison, but that’s about it. I set up with some weak characters, because I had Dodge, Barrier, and It Can Wait in my hand. I find Fades and HotJedi, which stop Kim for a while, but she gets Code Clearance out, which kills like half of my deck’s retrieval. So I get Celebration out, it gets cancelled twice, and she eventually gets around HotJedi. For a while it looked like it was my game, especially when Strikeforce stopped her from canceling my Kessel drain. Then, she flips, drops 5D6 in an empty walker at DB94, wins a battle in space which cancels Strikeforce, and gets out the gay Admiral’s Order which lets her ships move during her control phase. That changed the tide of the game. Well, 5D6 is in a walker, so I can’t Mess him or send him missing with Lost In The Wilderness. So I’m forced to drain for like 2-3 a turn, while Kim does 5-6. She sets up a 1, and retrieves 5 with Abyssin Ornament. After a long drawn out drain war, she wins by 5, the same amount she retrieved. Oh well, I made some pretty gay mistakes, but I guess that comes with not playing in a tourney for a while.<br/>
FL -5<br/>
0 (-5)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: None<br/>
Lows: I can only beat this deck when it doesn’t count<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
My Anti-Kim Senate vs. Kim Caton (1872) Dagoboring test to 6 and duel<br/>
Ug. I hate Dagoboring, which is why I built my Anti-Kim deck. My opening hand contains like 5 cards I can pull.  She wins the race, but I drop Coward so she doesn’t retrieve for the rest of the game. I set up drains at the Senate, the Podrace Arena, the Marketplace, the Cantina, and Kessel. I smack everything she tries to deploy, and Jedi Luke with stick goes hungry at the Market. I YAB Uncontrollable Fury like turn 3. Not much more to say.<br/>
FW +13<br/>
2 (+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating Kim<br/>
Lows: Playing Senate, I feel so dirty now<br/>
<br/>
Game 3<br/>
My WYS vs. Bob Caton (1696) No Objective Big Blue/Bombers<br/>
There isn’t much to say about this game. I never gave up Tatooine, so he couldn’t bomb. After a while, I was able to spread to Kessel as well. He started Code Clearance, so again I’m only left with Celebration to retrieve with. But it makes an appearance and I’m able to spread to all four sites without fear of a beatdown. This game was very bloody, but my multiple destinies and retrieval kept me alive.<br/>
FW +28<br/>
4 (+36)<br/>
<br/>
Game 4<br/>
My Senate vs Bob Caton (1696) Boomrace<br/>
This is pretty funny. A few months ago when I tried the BoomRace deck, Bob was mad because he thought it was too good. Now Bob’s playing it, hehe. I use Lott Dodd to get some beatdown set up, but he gets ready too fast. So I drop Tat Maul and Mara, both with sabers, to the Bunker where he has mucho scrubs. Melas, Corran Horn, Solo, Crix, and Blount I think. I also drop PotF on the Bunker so when he initiates next turn, Edcel limits him to one draw. So I battle, slice Corran Horny and Solo, and Crix dies to attrition. He draws high (surprise, surprise) and I lose Mara and a couple. We battle a lot in the Bunker, but eventually he has to leave and Maul claims victory. I start draining at lots of places and retrieving at the Marketplace. Coward stops his retrieval. I drop Zuckuss in space, but he only lasts a few turns before Home One kicks him out. I start a cycle with the Political Effect and the drain of two at Kessel only gets through once. He tries to kick me out of the Bunker, but I always come out on top. Finally, my drain of 3 at the Rebel Landing Site kills him.<br/>
FW +13<br/>
6 (+49)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating the Boomrace deck, are all Catons allergic to Coward?<br/>
Lows: 4 Caton games in a row<br/>
<br/>
Game 5<br/>
My WYS vs. Arvind Bhasker (1500) Watto<br/>
This was Arvind’s, first full tourney, and he played pretty damn good. He was in first until I was able to dethrone him this game. He has a first turn Maul in the Cantina, but I reply with EPP Luke. We battle and I chop him, but we tie in power so he doesn’t owe me anything else. He can’t really use his objective that much, because of a first turn HotJedi. We both set up for a little bit, and I start retrieving. I get to Edge twice, Harvest twice, and Celebration stayed for the whole game. Man I love free, grabber-less retrieval. In the end, his own Battle Plan killed him, as I was able to kick him out of space. He would use his Objective once or twice, then I would drop some smugglers and clear the site. Mara went missing after she tried to drain at Mos Espa, and he never reclaimed it. Without him flipped, I was able to retrieve a heIl of a lot. The game ended when Lando with glock and another smuggler battled Coruscant Maul with saber. Too Close For Comfort prevented his swing, Lando hit Maul with a blind 6, he drew a 0 for battle destiny, and I drew a pair of fives. Maul and 9 please.<br/>
FW +27<br/>
8 (+76)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: No Code Clearance!<br/>
Lows: None<br/>
<br/>
Game 6<br/>
My Senate vs. Arvind Bhasker (1500) TIGIH<br/>
Geez, I get to play a whopping 3 different people today. It comes to the point where if I win this game, I win the tourney. I’m pretty confident because of last game’s outcome. For the first few turns, he pings me for 1 at Chirpa’s Hut and 1 at my Carida. I set up in the senate and start pulling stuff. I try to Monnok when he has 16 cards, and he senses. He loses 2 for TINT/OE and Evader/Monnok goes to my used. I get it with Crush on my turn, and play it again because he has 13. I’m pretty sure I get some good stuff. I finally find some blue cards and drop ZuckussIMH and DengarIPO against a lone Home One. I kill it and win the battle, so I don’t stack. He drops Cor. Qui-Gon, a Wookiee, and RSL Wedge against Xizor at the Marketplace. He draws low, so I only lose Xizor and 1, and I stack. I activate a million because of Tickles at the senate, and drop Vader. He chops Qui-Gon and the rest of his side clears, leaving Vader to retrieve 1 a turn for the rest of the game. A few turns later Cor. Maul with stick goes to the Landing Platform and he moves Luke over. I battle, chop him so he’s only power 5, and play I Have You Now. I draw a 6, 3, and 4, and add 3 with one of my Politcal Effects. Luke and 18 cards leave him with only a few, which he draws next turn.<br/>
FW +26<br/>
10 (+112)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning, I guess<br/>
Lows: Having to beat a new guy twice in a row.<br/>
<br/>
So I win and take the ICBW foil, I’ll put it up on ebay if anyone wants it. My rating should be close to 1800 after they update it. I guess I’ll give some Props/Slops now.<br/>
<br/>

Nate for getting pizza and soda<br/>
Nate for running the tourney, it was smooth and quick<br/>

Everybody who sowed up and made it sanctioned<br/>
DecktTech for all the work they’re doing, I’ll try and go (make the Wars tourney Sat &amp; Sun)<br/>
<br/>
Slops:<br/>

If you’re in the Coruscant Region, check my DT Group, Team I Bent My Wookie. It’s open to pretty much anyone who wants to join.<br/>
I’ll write a better report next week, I promise (unless it isn’t sanctioned)<br/>
Later<br/>
