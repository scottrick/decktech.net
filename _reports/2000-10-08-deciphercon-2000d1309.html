<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">so i’m off to deciphercon last wednesday...stayed up all night tuesday to make sure i was up bright and early at 4am to catch our 9am flight out of midway airport in chicago (there was alot of driving around involved...picking people up and other such nonsense).  gotta dark deck, but no light deck yet.  get to orlando wednesday afternoon, hang out, play some games with Janiak and Holman...fun stuff.  i learned never to go to the D* when someone is running Set Your Course/Scum.  whoa.  janiak couldn’t bounty hunt to save his life!  so i’m seeing the usual scum and villainy that i’ve run into all year.  tennessee mofos, wacky canadians, girard, those sugar/caffiene kiddies from coruscant, etc, etc, etc....OH and the germans were there too...heh.<br/>
<br/>
12am thursday morning/wednesday night:  dark is either bounty hunting/scum or BHBM space...still no light deck, and i’ve been up for 40 hours<br/>
<br/>
6am thursday morning:  been up for 46 hours....stillno light deck.  at this point i’ve tried just about EVERY possible combination possible as far as 3 starting effects goes for the light side, and EVERY possible combination for staging areas/insurrection.  i figure at this point i’ll just run my profit deck that’s done pretty well for the last 9 months (turbo profit drain).  i change things around a bit, since i’m expecting to see a TON of BHBM.  take out the teamwork cards and 3xnabrun to add in harc seff x2, smokescreen x2, and glancing blow (’cause ’ya GOTTA kill vader somehow).  off to the showers, and then on to the tournament for a 16 hour tourney!  i’m exausted at this point....<br/>

<br/>
i figured that the LSide’s only options would be EBO or Hidden base for Day 1 of worlds, so i play what can beat them at their own systems.  it worked!  yay!  and it’s REALLY fun too when you can track 2 or 3 AO’s to draw 3 6 destinies with Igar on the ground, or draw 2 6 destinies for duelling luke.<br/>
<br/>
game 1: ds vs. joe olson (fake base/tat:celebrating...i think)<br/>
<br/>
i set up rendili, and docking bay for battle order, then dominate with 12 attrition at tatooine...finally draining for 2 each at BOTH tatooine docking bays with Fighters coming in.  <br/>
<br/>
2 (+10)<br/>
<br/>
game 2: ls vs. karl someone...(endor ops with 3x U-3po)<br/>
<br/>
this game is pretty much even up until about ...turn 10, when he drops his 3rd U-3po (HOLY S H I T!!!) and blocks my drain, then sets up decree and that’s it.<br/>
<br/>
2 (+6)<br/>
<br/>
game 3: ls vs. charles hickey (huntdown beatdown)<br/>
<br/>
charles is out for blood!  i thought huntdown was kinda defunct because of HotJedi...well i guess not!  i’d taken all the cards out of my deck that can stop huntdown (destiny adders/savrip) which would’ve let me chop/kill vader, or win the war of attrition for me, so i’m kinda screwed.  critical moment of this game:  i control the audience chamber with ben/luke, and i don’t flip because i want to wait before i lose that extra force to Visage.  this is my lack of sleep kicking in (’cause it’s 6pm and i’ve now been up for 58 hours) for if i’d flipped, the game would’ve been a win for me.  just avoid, drain, profit, and utilize harc seff and play it cool.  so he battles, you are beaten (first strike) i have you now, cancel ben’s gametext, and that’s Luke +15 ...game.  well played...just as i would’ve done it!<br/>
<br/>
2 (-15)<br/>
<br/>
game 4: ds vs. hidden base guy (don’t remember this game to well)<br/>
<br/>
i win the attrition war, and put 8 cards on Insignificant Rebellion. great.<br/>
<br/>
4 (+7)<br/>
<br/>
game 5: ds vs. someone playing EBO<br/>
<br/>
i hammer the last nail in the coffin...another light space drain gets a thrashing...whoa.<br/>
<br/>
6 (+32)<br/>
<br/>
game 6: ls vs. marcus wuest (ralltir troopers)<br/>
<br/>
finally a matchup i can handle!  i’d heard much about wuest and couldn’t wait to play.  he flips 2nd turn with MANY troopers on ralltir...i flip 2nd turn with ben/master/monk.  he beats luke for 6 cards with 4 matching bikerscout troopers (pulled with tactical support) ouch!  i come back with luke/leia and eliminate a couple troopers.  he moves into the audience chamber with 4 troopers to attack ben/han/luke with epp vader...kills a few guys, but not han.  i come back with some stuff and kill some guys.  he comes back and kills some guys AGAIN, but loses all but Irol, who moves out to Tat:JP.  i beat Irol for like 6 cards, and that evens things out for the amount of drain i’ve been taking (3+/turn).  he never gets out battle order, and eventually loses the drain race by 4!!! i only won due to not having deployed 6 locations, just 2.  whoa! close game against a good player.  these are the games that make me like playing starwars in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
8 (+36)<br/>
<br/>
game 7: ds vs. matt sokol (Hbase/matching pilots)<br/>
<br/>
we get all the locations out, but there’s a HUGE throwdown at Rendili!  everything goes there, and luke plays cat &amp; mouse on the ground with Igar/tempest 1 between like 4 docking bays.  i think he eventually ran out of stuff to fight with, and i won the drain race due to chiraneau + fighters coming in.  i LOVE my deck...heh.<br/>
<br/>
10 (+45)<br/>
<br/>
game 8: ls vs. robert rau (SP?) (huntdown duelling)<br/>
<br/>
i went into this game expecting to lose, but hoping to draw things out long enough with HotJedi that maybe i could win a late battle and pull it out.  obi/luke/harc sat around on tatooine with HotJedi for like 15 turns, and he lost a TON of force to visage.  he turns luke, i free han...drain him out.<br/>
<br/>
12 (+68)<br/>
<br/>
i think that’s the right differential, but i could be wrong...who knows...who cares!  i’m IN DAY 2, taking a respectable 12th place.<br/>
<br/>
at this point it’s like 3am on friday morning and i’ve been awake for 67 hours!  unbelievable.  so i can barely walk, talk, or eat...but we try denny’s, but it’s too busy so we hit 7/11 for some chips and sammiches...mmmm.  hit the sack at 5am....have to wake up at 9.<br/>
<br/>
a record for me...69 hours!<br/>
<br/>
the next day i’m way too fatigued to think straight...and even though that didn’t stop me during day 1, i can’t seem to pull a win to save my life<br/>
<br/>
game 1: ds vs. Jim Sells (hbx)<br/>
<br/>
i thought that my 8 AO’s would get me through this one just fine, but he played Organized attack in EVERY FREAKIN BATTLE (and there were a TON).  that’s the one card that can really cream my deck, since i mainly rely on 12 attrition every turn.  oh well...he gets out Legendary Phil, Civil Dis., and keeps draining me for 3 at kessel.  i was only able to draw 3 star destroyers the whole game, but that didn’t stop jim from playing Power Pivot on my Executor (whoa that’s never happened to me before).  things would’ve been closer, but he retrieves 10 with All Wings on the last turn.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-22)<br/>
<br/>
game 2: ls vs. steve brentson (court/scum/profit hate)<br/>
<br/>
another auto loss for a profit like mine.  i try my best to get into the palace, and despite several None Shall Pass i use the alternate text of my 2 You will take me to jabba now and move luke and ben into the Achamber.  sorry about the mess 4lom, etc, etc,etc.  knock out some dudes, but then he comes back with alot of guys and captures ben with IG-88, luke + 6 (i think).  i’m starting to hurt, but he’s been retrieving with scum, and i’ve been dealing him 0 damage.  big loss for me, but i tried.  we both agreed that i was pretty much doomed from the start...heh.<br/>
<br/>
0 (-43)<br/>
<br/>
let me just say now that i’m in what we all refer to as "the sea of jizz."  this is the point at which you get to play in the "big losers" bracket and face all the oddball meta decks.  so i play my dark deck against an EBO with 12 mon-calamari cruisers + captain wedge (DS2) and i can’t seem to put a dent in his fleet since he has 14x 7 forfeit rebel mofos at kiffex.  there’s more to it than that, but who the hell runs 12x mon-cals?<br/>
the other game was a normal game, but obviously this guy was VERY prepared for a MWYHL w/AFA etc.  he ran some SAC and like 6x projective telepathy.  i’m force choked, and then he’s hitting me for 3/turn at cloud city with the emperor/janus/sim...i’m losing the battle to lord vader on tatooine.  <br/>
<br/>
who actually runs crap like this and expects to win anything?<br/>
<br/>
i cut my losses at this point and drop to play in JP-OTSD.<br/>
<br/>
let me tell you this:  JP-OTSD is whacked out.  the light side draws like 4 destiny with lando and the palace raider + the objective.  just give up if you are dark ’cause there’s NO way to win against someone who knows what they’re doing unless you pull multiple ability 3 or 2 characters.<br/>
gay.<br/>
<br/>
we go out drinking...it’s fun...BUT here’s one of the highlights of the weekend.  i brought a box of white bordered premiere along for the weekend...just in case.<br/>
<br/>
mike girard and i are totally hosed at this point, and he’s like "dude, there’s a volunteer tourney for free" and i’m like "let’s go!!!" and he’s like "ok".<br/>
so we can’t play in the volunteer tourney...big surprise.<br/>
the tournament consisted of everyone getting like 5 packs of reflections and playing ALL their cards in their deck...EVEN light OR dark cards!! that’s sooooo cool!<br/>
<br/>
so i’m like "girard, i’m crackin’ this box ’o white border crap and we’re going to do this!"  so girard, heisler, olson and i split the box 4 ways, and it’s a freakin blast!<br/>
<br/>
girard lost vader off the top!! whoa, but he completes OMDH for 4 force with Momaw and the Prophetess on the table.  i tallon roll one of his y-wings with one of his ties.  momaw is a tank at the end of the game with EVERY character enhancing effect possible played on him (merc sunlet, bannis keeg, etc) and he has a dark jedi lightsaber too!  the end of the game sees leia (with 3 droid escort, sporting blaster, and various tatooine utilities) getting battled by the prophetess.  Warrior’s courage, you shouldn’t underestimate their chances, and the prophetess goes down with an addtional 30 force (we were playing 135 card decks by the way).  i get drained out on like...turn 55.  good game man.<br/>
<br/>
go to bed man...heh<br/>
<br/>
saturday:<br/>
<br/>
i sleep until like 4pm, then get up for mcdonalds...yucky fries...and some talk with herren/mikelian/heisler/janiak/li/about old card games and new V:TES release by white wolf (upcoming).  i hang for a few more hours...watch the world finals.<br/>
<br/>
game 1:  Sokol’s HBase Odds vs. Lapoint’s BHBM<br/>
<br/>
matt has forgotten to put luke in his deck, loses by 20.  didn’t see much of this game, ’cause i walked out the minute i saw an "insert" hit the table.  dumb, dumb, dumb.<br/>
<br/>
game 2:  Sokol’s ISB drop and drain w/walkers, etc. vs. Lapoint’s MWYHL retrieval.<br/>
<br/>
this is a long boring game.  boring boring boring.  matt and yannick have already played these decks against each other, and matt should’ve known to "drop and drain" from turn 1, but didn’t, and almost lost it for himself as he drew VERY near 20 force.  yannick decides not to battle in space with the super falcon, and instead lets matt drain him for like 7/turn.  it was a good effort on yannick’s part to prolong the game as long as possible, but ya know...i really was disappointed to see ISB cheese vs. Retrieval go at it in the final game.  gay-@ss crap.<br/>
<br/>
good job to both finalists for getting to where they were...i guess, but i’ll have to say also:  how did you get that far with those decks?<br/>
<br/>
so the coruscant sugar/caffeine kiddies start blitzing all over the place when matt wins, and the yelling that ensues is pretty annoying.  i think we all know who i’m talking about.  but they’re just kids....so whatever.<br/>
<br/>
saturday night at 8pm:  Japanese sealed deck.  whoa!<br/>
this was pretty damned cool, but now i remember what it was like to play OLD sealed deck before OTSD’s fixer cards.  It’s Worse, It Could Be Worse, Scanning Crew, Surprise Assault, Counter Assault.  gay.<br/>
<br/>
i pulled a Leia, Tantive IV, and 2 commander vanden willards..PLUS 2 mining droids and 3 timer mines.  this won me a couple of games, but i couldn’t compete with those dark decks that had 2 stardestroyers and 8 ties.  i go 2 and 2.  the real highlight of the night were the 2 japanese dudes ...Yukihiro and the other dude...who were trading straight up japanese rares for english ones.  whoa.  i got ALOT of stuff...and these guys were so nice too!  rarely do you get to trade someone for something like that...and you both know that it’s mutually beneficial...since the japanese market for english cards is equally as lucrative as the american market for japanese cards.  cool as hell.<br/>
<br/>
so we go get RIPPED at the bar, have a blast, it’s all good.  i did a shot with Pakes, and as i get back to my table in the main hall, i see the two japanese guys!!!!!! HOLY SH1T!!!  i’m like wasted by now and yell "THOSE GUYS F$#KING ROCK!!!" and they’re like "blah blah we don’t speak english" but they laughed at me, so it was all good.  then they’re like "can we take picture?"  and i’m like "YES!!!" holy cow these japanese guys want to take my picture!  it was pretty funny...you had to be there.  maarten logghe, bastian winkelhaus, joe alread, mike girard, chris janiak, eric olson, greg heisler, tj holman, hayes hunter, 3 mofo kids, steve jabroni, and some drunk @#$% all head to denny’s, and in the process, i piss on a car, tj beats on some other hotel room’s window unil the guy comes out...we all run as fast as possible...heh...and when we get to denny’s, hayes finds that he has to go talk to some old dude at the breakfast bar...for what reason i don’t know...<br/>
<br/>
we gorge ourselves...but hayes just eats pie.  i guess he likes pie, ’cause that drunk @#$% sure liked him.  so we get back to the hotel...<br/>
<br/>
and i’m still drunk.  i walk up to Paul Todd Feldman, and kinda feeling standoffish, i say "Mr. Feldman, i hear you’re an @#$%....is this true?"  and a lengthy defense ensues...something about hayes hunter, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
so i sit down to watch PTFeldman play Jeremy Lamiere...feldman has the brangus/set your course with docking bays, and jeremy has Ketwol EBO docking bay retrieval.  whoa...i almost fall asleep in my chair, but i eventually crawl off to bed...<br/>
<br/>
so we left orlando at noon the next day...what a bummer!  i have to go back to the real world.  oh well.<br/>
<br/>
did i mention that little bit about card throwing?  haha!<br/>
we threw SO many cards at each other while playing that Secret Squirrel (WB premiere sealed) thing, that the hotel put an APB out on "card throwers" and threatened to kick anyone out that they caught throwing cards....heh.<br/>
<br/>
what a blast!!!<br/>
<br/>
later guys<br/>
