<br/>
Today was the weekly tournament in Columbus run by Roger McEldowney.  I overslept and woke up about 10:30 when the tourney was supposed to start at 11.  So I wet myself trying to find Battlegrounds for both sides since today was a Reflections II sealed.  I end up calling the shop and begging roger to wait for me, and he goes for it! So I hurry my @ss on over to Silverking so I dont hold them up any longer tat I have to.  Well it turns out I was the 9th person to show up so Roger played too.  We set up and I am the corner guy in the group of 6 for the draft drawing Light Side.  I’ll spare you the details of the draft but some of the highlights were a Scout Luke, Owen and Beru, Talon Kaarde, Liberty, and 2 Dodge.   These would prove to be key. Anyway, on to the games.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Me Vs. Larry Lim<br/>
<br/>
     Larry starts the Executor Holotheatre, I start Tat: Jabba’s Palace (Mainly to bounce my opponents Jabba’s palace start).  I get a Y-Wing to Kiffex to set up a drain of 2 and I get an arcona to the cantinal.  I get in two turns of a drain of 4 and then he decides to drop Dengar in ship, A Sentinel class thing and Dr. E/Ponda Baba and beat the snot of my Y-wing for 10 cards.  Well so much for the advantage I just had.  Praying that he had deployed all of his space I drop Kessel with another Y-Wing for a drain of 3.  At this point I am draining on the ground at 3 sites with 1 character at each and 2 Dodges in my hand while blocking his drain at kiffex with bargaining table.  The Y-wing beatdown was ugly, but I pull it out.  Full win by 8.<br/>
<br/>
2(+8)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning.  Draining for 2 at the cantina with a single Jawa<br/>
Lows: That was one dead Y-Wing.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Me. Vs. Lee Fisk<br/>
<br/>
     There was only 1 DS victory in the first round so I get to play a guy who lost because of my diff.  He starts Anoat and I immediately think he has a ton of space so I’m thinking Kessel and Kiffex are Force Drain Fodder.  I set up at the palace on turn 1 and deploy Goo Nee Tay he deploys a Swamp to anoat and Feltrivern Trevagg and Myioom Onith there.  I chuckle and say "Read Goo Nee Tay" needless to say his face got a touch paler.  Too add insult to injury I play A few Maneuvers on his Tie Fighter at Anoat and track it around.  I deploy Talon Karrde and 2 Shistavean Wolf Men and battle, draw the 6 and hit him for the site and 7 or so.  He then mounts an assault on my lone Alderaan Operative with an Imperial walker, prophetess, and Djas Puhr.  A dodge cures that and nexdt turn my arcona shows up to block the drain.  I drain for 3 total from 3 locations.  Lee has Bad feeling have I out now so I gotta save force.  Next turn I Drop Luke and battle, draw the 6, clear the sight, and drain him out on my next turn.  Full Win by 7.<br/>
<br/>
Total: 4(+15)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Smacking around Myioom, the artful Dodging Jawa<br/>
Lows: him owning space.  Where is my Liberty?!<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Me vs. Blake Mandalis<br/>
<br/>
      Once again only 1 DS player won and it was the same guy who won the first round.  Also, because of previous games I get matched up against Blake, who is 0-2 with bad Diff.  Blake is one of my trek buddies and is still learning the art of star wars.  Anyway he tries to start the palace and gets bounced, so I grab the Y4 War Room and he gets Mos Eisley.  I get both Goo Nee Tay and Bargaining table in my opening hand so that is good.  I set up drains at mos eisley and the cantina.  He comes down with Bane Malar and Dengar with Gun.  Yikes! I dodge him then come back with a wookiee, Luke, and Talon Karrde.  I draw a 7 for destiny (ROCK!!) and clear the site but I lose the wookiee and Talon.  I back luke up with a few scrubs and continue to drain for 4.  His activation is very limited and he only can save up for  more assault and what do I draw? The 7!!! I somehow managed to track it around.  SO my next turn I drop kiffex and kessel while holding a barrier (he has 1 card in hand) with a Y-Wing at each.  Next turn I drain for 13 and he’s done.  Full win by 21.<br/>
<br/>
Total: 6(+36)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning by more than 20 for the first time in my sealed deck career :-)<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Beating on Blake, he is a good guy and still learning.<br/>
<br/>
So at this point I am in first place, ahead of Brandon by 3 Differential.  He is the only 3-0 DS player so it is on for the final round. I start sweating like a fiend because Brandon has hella characters in his deck and pretty much got a God draft, because he has beaten 3 LS players with pretty good decks for a sealed deck.  so off we go.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Me Vs. Brandon Jones<br/>
<br/>
     Brandon is playing with every card in a top loader for luck because he won the last 2 sealed decks doing that.  He starts the palace and I bounce him and get the War Room, and he gets the AC.  The only locations that hit the table after that were his Tusken Canyon and my Kiffex.  I intentionally didnt deploy any other locations because I didnt want to give him anywhere to drain.  My opening hand was interesting: Both Dodges and Order to engage. I decide to try and bait him. I let him deploy first, and he goes to the AC.  I deploy a lone jawa to Tusken canyon and OtE.   Brandon looks at my lone jawa that is screaming "Please, come beat the hell out of me! Please!" Then deploys Commander Praji, a Sandtrooper and an operative and initiates the battle.  I play dodge and the jawa scampers into the AC where Brandon has presence and he loses 3.  My turn I activate, drain for 2 at Kiffex, which gets blocked by Den and save force.  At this point I have Luke, O&amp;B, and Talon in my hand with about 3 aliens on Bargaining table.  His turn he deploys all kinds of guys to the AC and tries to beat down the jawa, but Dodge/OtE works again and he loses another 3.  Next turn he moves out to tusken Canyon and I’m out of dodges so I gots to fortify.  I deploy Talon and a Gran to the now empty AC to drain for 2, and Luke and O&amp;B To back up the Jawa.  I dont battle but I do put a blaster on luke.  His next turn he battles and beats me by 7.  I lose O&amp;B, the jawa, and 1.  So now with my power 12 Luke I throw everything I can at him and beat him by 4, but I draw a 6 for destiny.  He is losing characters from the site 2-3 at a time and Luke isnt going anywhere because I keep backing him up with scrubs.  Meanwhile, I alter his Den and my y-wing is draining for 2 like a champ at kiffex and Talon/Gran are draining for another 2 at the AC.  However, on 1 drain, I get counter assaulted for 5 cards and I get my tracking messed up.  However I will not be deined and I slowly whittle him down and win by 13.<br/>
<br/>
Total: 8(+49)<br/>
<br/>
So I win! That is huge for me because this is my 1st Wars tourney win.  Even if it was a sealed deck.  I feel like a better player and I know I beat the best in the area.  Brandon finishes 3rd and Kyle finishes 2nd.<br/>
