<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is a continuation of the Enduro tournament.  See part 1 if<br/>
you missed it before you read this one.  So the 1st quarter of<br/>
Enduro ends before 4 PM, and the 2nd quarter starts up at 4:30<br/>
PM.  I decide to stick with the FlOps deck for dark (it did go<br/>
2-0) and stuck with EBO as well.  The EBO lost only cuz I <br/>
played it poorly.  So here we go....only 12 more games to go.<br/>
BTW, no rankings were given between tournies, but I knew that<br/>
there were several 4-0 people from the 1st quarter.  I went 3-1<br/>
in the 1st quarter, but had good diferential.  6 (+65).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v James Weldon’s Endor Ops (Mob Pts, Something <br/>
Special Planned, Combat Response)<br/>
<br/>
I start ANSB rather than my 3 effect start.  EBO is running by<br/>
turn 2.  By 4th turn he’s just been drawing and I’ve got 2<br/>
xwings each at Hoth, Sullust, &amp; Fondor.  He drops Zuckuss to<br/>
Fondor, then Executor, which is barriered, then Thrawn &amp; <br/>
Pelleon.  Wow.  So I decide to throw down at Fondor.  I drain<br/>
and move all my xwings over.  He battles (he used all his <br/>
force so he didn’t draw last turn &amp; thus has nothing to <br/>
deploy this turn).  I play Org Attack, he loses Pelleon.  I<br/>
soon realize I’m stuck there now with Something Special <br/>
Planned on table.  Oh no.  So I draw like mad looking for more<br/>
Org Attacks and more xwings.  I draw them, and I hold Fondor<br/>
until he moves his fleet away.  Meanwhile, Zev &amp; Hobbie are on<br/>
Rogue 2 at the North Ridge, while Boushh, Iceboy, and Wedge<br/>
transit to the Endor DB (for 10!) in their speeders.<br/>
<br/>
He drops some guys like Xizor and Vader to Endor DB, but my <br/>
immunity holds up throughout the battles and he loses a bunch<br/>
of guys while I lose Boushh during one of the battles where he<br/>
had big power.  As I said, his fleet spreads to Endor, I play<br/>
AWRI for 8, then replace 6 xwings to boost my differential &amp;<br/>
follow him to Endor.  No more battles happen, since my drains<br/>
next turn finish him.  Win by 34.  2 (+34).<br/>
<br/>
Best: Showdown at Fondor and Endor DB.<br/>
Worst: Something Special Planned hampering movement.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Nghia Nguyen’s WYS (Goo Nee Tay)<br/>
<br/>
See, this is where FlOps is soooo cool.  He thinks I’m playing<br/>
straight up Hunt Down and thinks about his start.  He decides<br/>
he doesn’t want the 1st turn Vader and starts Goo Nee Tay <br/>
rather than his 3 effect start.  Huge for me!  I setup FlOps <br/>
in like 6 turns (couldn’t get it going), and have some big<br/>
drains at all my systems.  We’re losing to Visage &amp; he’s<br/>
losing ships off the top.  I like to see that!  I drop U-3PO<br/>
to the Cantina, he gets out Owen &amp; Beru to Harvest twice &amp;<br/>
the Harvests go OOP.  Then he drops Underworld Contacts!  Now<br/>
I can’t cancel where he has 2 aliens (which is everywhere <br/>
except at the Lars Farm).  He deploys the Audience Chamber &amp;<br/>
Wedge and Luke in there.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I have control of Kiffex, Kashyyk, Tatooine, &amp;<br/>
Rendili.  Big drains.  Whenever he draws OOC/TT, he plays it <br/>
as OOC (not canceling Visage), so I guess he likes the both of<br/>
us losing to it.  I’m retrieving most everything I lose w/SFS.<br/>
However, things go bad when I have Flag Executor w/Piett at<br/>
Kiffex (and FlOps is on a VSD, not Executor).  He drops Mirax<br/>
&amp; a RFC in the Skate, battles and draws 5 &amp; 3!  The Executor<br/>
dies!  Where was my Imperial Command?  I thought he had lost <br/>
his ships, but oh well.  It slows me down a bit, but I’m just<br/>
sooooo far ahead in the drain race its not even funny.  I <br/>
chase the Skate around a little, retrieve w/SRFs and drain<br/>
him out.  Win by 13.  4 (+47).<br/>
<br/>
Best: The Hunt Down fake-out!<br/>
Worst: The big E going down in flames.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Yannick’s HB (BatPLan, Strike Plan, Insight)<br/>
<br/>
Oops, I mean this game is vs. Kevin Shannon, who is playing<br/>
Yannick’s HB deck that uses only like 7 characters and a <br/>
bunch of destiny adders.  I setup FlOps as usual, get 3 TIEs &amp;<br/>
a Star Destroyer at Kashyyk and Endor.  I save 3.  He plays<br/>
Frozen Assets, then DTF, Gold Squad 1 to Kashyyk with Luke, <br/>
EPP Leia, Gen Solo, and Chewie Protector aboard.  That took<br/>
a lot of his force, so he plays Descent into Dark to <br/>
recirculate immediately, then he battles and plays I’ve Got A<br/>
Bad Feeling About This (triples battle damage when you initiate<br/>
where you have lower power).  He plays 6 destiny adder cards,<br/>
ends up doing 44 damage to me (I can’t play my Imperial Command<br/>
due to DTF + Frozen Assets).  That is tripled to 132 damage.<br/>
I take my deck and flip it over to my lost pile.  Lose by 24.<br/>
4 (+23).<br/>
<br/>
Best: At least I don’t get -132 differential.<br/>
Worst: Losing on the 4th or 5th turn.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Jason Henderson’s Hunt Down (IAO,Mob Pts,BatOrder)<br/>
<br/>
Great, the worst matchup (other than ISB) for my EBO is Hunt<br/>
Down.  Well, I start Insight, Wise Advice, &amp; Menace fades.  I<br/>
lose Insight to get HoTJ, and it saved me this game.  After the<br/>
1st turn, I never lost to Visage again.  After I get EBO going,<br/>
he deploys heavy to Hoth and takes over 4 sites.  But HoTJ <br/>
kills all those drains and he’s losing to Visage since my Luke<br/>
is at the North Ridge.  He avoided the North Ridge (expecting<br/>
Ice Storm I assume).  So I’m draining for free and Menace Fades<br/>
is in effect.  The big drains in space kill him.  No battles <br/>
this game.  Just me draining and him losing to Visage every <br/>
turn.  He seemed pretty bummed about something too.  Win by 24.<br/>
6 (+47).  Wish there was more to say, but that’s it.<br/>
<br/>
Best: HoTJ, drains, and getting the 24 differential back.<br/>
Worst: He seemed mad at the world, maybe cuz he couldn’t get No<br/>
Escape or Resistance (but he never even had 2 BG sites).<br/>
<br/>
So that ends the 2nd quarter of Enduro.  It is now past 9 PM, <br/>
&amp; Alex and I are feeling a bit tired.  He was ready to leave. <br/>
He didn’t play as well as he would have liked, and didn’t feel<br/>
like sticking around for more.  But I told him to hang in there,<br/>
&amp; we just grabbed some pizza and beer and chilled for a bit,<br/>
talking about how we had done so far.  Boy, was I starving.  I<br/>
also played some WWF Raw Deal (Steve Austin rules!).  The 3rd<br/>
Quarter was ready to begin at midnight, so I’ll pick up there<br/>
in part 3.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparantly some people want the FlOps deck posted, so I guess<br/>
I’ll post it for review since it’ll be easier than D-mailing it<br/>
individual people.  Lets see....its 3-1 right now, and my EBO<br/>
is 3-1 so far as well.  My total score now is 12 (+112).  I<br/>
think any dark deck I played would’ve lost to Yannick’s deck<br/>
though.  I just didn’t expect it.  I had read it on decktech,<br/>
but didn’t recognize it when Kevin played it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>
