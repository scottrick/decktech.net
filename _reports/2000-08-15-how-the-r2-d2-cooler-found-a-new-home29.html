<blockquote><font class="bfont"> This great event took place in Nashville, TN on 8/12/00<br>
<br>
Greetings all of you fine star wars playing fools out there.<br>
This is my first ever tournament report so if it doesn't follow the same pattern that other tournament reports have in the past. Please let me know when you rate it so that next time I will know what I need to do to improve.<br>
<br>
This tournament was the event to which the winner would recieve an R2-D2 cooler made by pepsi back in 1997 when the movies were re-released. It is a collectors idea and very cool for parties. To win the cooler one had to not only win the tournament but defeat the squadron leader Andrew Martin in a best test of two. I have played against Andy in the past for many years and was looking forward to getting to play him again, if I was given the chance.<br>
<br>
I, at first, had not planned to go because I didn't know how many people would show. After much thought, I decided just to go to the store and see what was up. If there was no tournament, I could still always play test with some players that I don't get to play very often. As it turns out I was the 7th person to show. I then decided to call my good play testing friend Maura Chase to show up as the 8th person. As it turns out she was already on her way anyway, so the tournament became sanctioned with 8 players. <br>
<br>
Pregame lookout:<br>
The players I would have to beat were Jon Tomayko and good old Matt Henthorn (who is the main reason I am writing this report to get back at his last report, enjoy Matt).<br>
<br>
Look at the Stats:(My Decks)<br>
For Light Side I had been play testing a new profit deck that used the new Luke and my old favorite super beatdown combo. The deck doesn't have a lot of space in it but that is ok, because I force the players to always put something down on the ground, and that is when I crush them. SO, I now call the deck SuperProfit. As for Dark Side, I decided to try a new idea with an old one to see if it would work. <br>
I used the Death Star objective and the new and improved docking bay combo to get at least 15 to 17 force my second turn. This deck had alot of small power unique troopers in it with 6 Vaders, plus just enough space to fight off any hidden base decks I might come across. This deck I call SuperTroopers from Hell. <br>
<br>
<br>
Kickoff: Long kick way back<br>
Game 1: My SuperTroopers vs. Aaron Hall's Training Deck.<br>
<br>
I started the game off by finding the control room and placing some small fry there to get out the other 4 docking bays. I then placed another small fry at the Executer: Docking bay and say go. I game him 4 force so he was able to get both Yoda and Leia down but chose only Yoda. He dropped two sites and drew up the rest. I then activated 21 force second turn and because to draw up for I only had 3 cards in my hand, one being a Ghhk for a small beatdown if he chose to go after one of the fries. Next he placed Leia and the first jedi test down with Luke's pack. My third turn I moved one fry to the Endor: Docking bay and began to ping him for one. This of course to any player becomes just too much and they always come down. He decides to deploy two joes and Ben Kenobi on to the Tatooine: Docking bay and then transit over to the fry, interesting I must say, but exactly what I wanted him to do. On my next turn, it being only my fifth. I drop Lord Vader with 4 more small fry unique troopers and good old Tarkin and say battle. I had first strike out as one of my starting so he, with no force saved, could not play any interrupts. I then begin why the troopers are from hell. First I played Trooper Assault making each of the power 2 fries power 4. Then I play Focused Attack on Lord Vader making him a 13, and finally I play Dark Jedi Presence making all of the power 4 guys power 8. This, in the end, gave me a power of 60 to his 11. He then was force to lose the 3 characters and the rest of his deck. Fifth turn win for me in about 15 mins.<br>
<br>
FW 2(+21)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting the combo so fast, him not leaving any force for me to worry about.<br/>
Lows: I should have stopping draw as soon as I had the cards to do the combo. I was to worried.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second Quarter: Feeling the Flow Working it<br/>
Game 2: My SuperProfit vs. Maura Chase's ISB Space<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit worried at first to this game because I had already played this deck before when Josh Koziura played it against me. A good space deck always forced me to change my stratgey. The game started as I expected. She got out the Coursant: Docking Bay and Rendili with her two starting effects. She drops one fry and Ozzel to the Docking Bay and draws the rest. I, of course, had crap in my hand and just drew up. She then drops Admiral Piett and another docking bay, draws a few and stops. I decide to try and kill Piett before she can use his game text to find that ISB Commander. So, I drop Obi with Stick and a Spy to Coursant and say battle. I, of course, miss Piett and draw a crappy destiny she draws like a 5 and I chose to just lose both characters. Her turn she drops a star destroyer and shuttles the other two joes up. I begin to think that I had better start hurting her before she hurts me. So, as soon as I have 5 force in my lost pile and drop Blount to the Audience Chamber and free Han. She drops like one more system, another docking bay, and piles more star destroyers and characters to flip her objective. I put Chewie and Lando at two other sites and use drains and the objective to make her lose more force than she is making me lose. I have battle plan out so we are both having to pay for the drains. She after time can't take paying for drains any longer and put two small frys on one of the docking bays completely forgetting that I still had Jedi Luke and Obi with Stick in my hand ready for he. My next turn I drop both of them with Luke's Stick and say battle. I play Courage of a Skywalker on Luke making him power 14, and Jedi Presence on Obi to make Luke power 28. I then hit both fries with my sticks and use Smoke Screen. My power was like 50 something and she was of course forced to lose the characters and the rest of her deck. Game to me.<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+49) <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Her going to the ground, you know better than that Maura.<br/>
Lows: Missing Piett<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Halftime Show: A quick game of Tron to clear the mind and a brief walk around the store to see what is new in the world of collecting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Third Quarter: Keep Strong Now<br/>
Game 3: My SuperProfit vs. Jon Tomayko's Ral Ops <br/>
<br/>
I was really hoping to face an Ops deck because this deck just eats them alive. Before the game I asked him if how he felt about the game and he replied that he felt confident. All I could think is that he really didn't know what he was getting into. The game started with him dropping the jungle to Ralitir, the Deathstar II: docking bay and Wakeelmui. He to my surprise just drew up without dropping any characters for more force with his effects. I, before the game, wished that I would get Daughter in my openning hand so that when I wanted to I could just drop her to free Han and use her for my SAC. Of course, it happened, openning hand. I then just sat back and drew up each turn only playing Tunnel Vision and Yoda Stew to keep doubles out. My battle plan keeped him from force drainning even once, so I decided to just drop Daughter with only three cards in lost pile and get them back. Then I just drew and played Yoda's Stew until I had the God hand I was looking for and my force was right for the killing. He by this time has flipped his objective and put only one character at each site to decide to go after the guy that is easiest to hit, Colonal Davod Jon. He did play smart and save some force for his oh so important interrupts but was soon useless to my Frozen Assets. He then did a very stupid think and tried to play Ellis with his own Imperal Arrest Order out, I as not to be mean just sense it and move to the battle. I play the combo with Jedi Luke, Obi, and Chewie. He then loses the character and all but like ten cards. I, in the end, flip his objective back and put my hand back with traffic control to win the game by 30.<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(+79)   <br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting Daughter in openning hand and getting the combo off perfect before he even drained once.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: None, everything went as I wanted it to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Forth Quarter: Time to Feel the Burn, Yeah Baby<br/>
Game 4: My SuperTroopers vs. Matt Henthorns Borrowed Deck<br/>
<br/>
Ok, now this game was a no win for Matt in the beginning for he just decided to borrow the decks that he played there. His dark being my own Ral Ops version, and His light was Jon's CLOSED ENVIROMENT deck using the new objective. Well, this game went much like the last one. I got my awesome attivation and my god hand and wait for him to drop someone other than Luke for I can't battle him. On about his third turn he puts General Crix Madine at the Home One: Docking Bay. When I found my spy and some force that was it. Here from the sky game the beatdown from hell. I dropped the spy only to hear him say oh no. Then came Vader and 6 other troopers. I then hear him say OH SHIT for he remembered what I was playing and felt like he was going to die. I played out the combo to make him lose Madine and 50 cards in battle damage. It was the funniest game I had played in a longtime. For after he lost the 30th cards it was just so funny to get into the 40s and so on. How does it feel Matt???<br/>
<br/>
FW 8(+108)<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Kicking the crap out of Matt in only 12 mins and seeing the look on his face when the troopers from hell came before him.<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Taking to long to find the spy, should have won my more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament was mine and it was time to go into overtime for the cooler.<br/>
<br/>
Overtime with Andrew Martin, He played new obj,<br/>
Game 1: My Light vs. His Dark <br/>
<br/>
I started slow with little force for he converted my Audience Chamber. I knew that I could not go to where Vader was. So I just drew up until I found my Grimtash and played it to get 2 Disarms and 2 Lord Vader. This was good for it slowed him down long enough for me to get the combo in my hand. I then put Orrimacko and Blount at the Endor: Docking Bay so he would come to me. He did with the Emperor, both Aids, and Myn Kyneugh. I put Frozen Assets to his force stopping anything that he could do. I then drop Jedi Luke, Obi with Stick, and Chewie. This battle would of course in the game. With him losing all of the characters and the rest of his deck. See a pattern here.<br/>
<br/>
First game me by 30, that was good because he would have to do really well in order to win the test.<br/>
<br/>
Alright, final match (unless tie) for the cooler. It was all down to this yeah baby got to love that pressure.<br/>
<br/>
Double Overtime with Andy, He played new obj,<br/>
Game 2: My Dark vs. His light   <br/>
<br/>
I at first was thinking that this game was pretty much going to go about like the one with Matt because against my deck not having Luke just hurts the light side more than helps it. BUT, Andrew just happened to be playing SUPER TECH TO MY DECK. He starts with Twilight is Upon Me, letting him just cancel Dark Jedi Presence. Beatdown was not going to be easy this game. I get the activation as usual and he just sits there for a few turns. Then I decide to put one fry at each site to just drain until he puts someone there so I can at least make him lose some cards. He decides to transit to the Deathstar and get Luke captured. He puts Home One on the Death Star to drain. I then put Zuckuss and Chimera down to stop him. He battles the guy that has Luke and the whole group of Epp Han, Obi, and Leia go to Yavin: Docking Bay to kill that guy. The fry captures Luke, and I then drop Lord Vader, Mara, and two more guys. I play Focused and Trooper Assault but save the Dark Jedi Presence for he has enough force saved to cancel it. He loses Obi and alot of force. His turn comes and he draw up for there was no way to win by more than 30. <br/>
<br/>
The Tournament and the cooler were mine YEAHHHHH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Well that is it, for all of you that have lasted through this whole thing. YOU ROCK!!!<br/>
The Highlight Film and Hall of Fame game will be posted at a later date.<br/>
