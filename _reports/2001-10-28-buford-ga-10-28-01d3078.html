Well to start off the tournament was a Star Wars CCG Reflections III Pre-Release Weekend. I was going to the one in Buford, Ga so the night before i had to chose 6 battle grounds from tattione, Naboo, and coursant. So I said well for dark i would play the jabba palace sights and for light random crap like naboo and tattione and special edition coursant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I show up to the tournament with like 10 mins to register their and get my cards so that i could play. Then I find out that i was dark and said yes now i know i can win this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My deck man i had a good draw or god just handed me this deck P Darth Vader and tarkin was my killer combo in this deck along with a mercenary pilot with random crap on a skiff for power. The retrival engine was my musicans had the 3 tech musicans able to check the destiney and place it in any order which was tech. But the most tech was arica and 2 over loads.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First Game My dark Vs some random mains<br/>
Well i was still trying to get hold of my deck and how to play it i wasnt realizing my tech in the deck yet just sitting and draining nothing more that was my mistake. my first was not battling my second was picking up till i got vader and tarkin which left me with no force to put them on table. But arica help my @#$% out that game.<br/>
<br/>
Full loss <br/>
0(-7)<br/>
<br/>
After that i went to lunch at subway me and my bud started talking about r3 and said that r3 was horable in this game play because of course we all have lost our 1st games. Then i started to read the text of the cards and realized their powers and i was ready to deal with any deck.<br/>
<br/>
Second game my d Vs some random trash<br/>
Well i started to get out all my sites for jabba palce.<br/>
He made the first move droped a rebel to jabbas palce and then i said none shall pass. he said @#$%. next turn i secure the audince chamber with jabba and stop his drains with arica.next turn i attack. Vader and tarkin combo kill kill kill nothing more nothing less. just battling pure power and my retrivel engine was on all clindyers.<br/>
<br/>
full win +20 <br/>
2(+13)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My third game my dark Vs big time mains<br/>
Well first secure audince chamberand pull the sites. second get tarkin and vader out to battle. use arica to block  drain on naboo. well this game went back and forth. But my engine save me and darth vader getting wacked was tech but not enough to finish me off. But a very good game<br/>
<br/>
Full win +5<br/>
<br/>
4 +18<br/>
<br/>
here i think everything is going well<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My 4th game my d Vs random crap with the tech<br/>
first thing wrong in this match up was me i was not with it.Now he make a huge game play do he went in with luke and a beat down of aliens to take the audince chamber. my most abusive card was 2 trap doors in the deck and the rancor pit. He did the smart think and basicly tried to control the chamber and jabbas place<br/>
i thought i had the game one so i move all but one charater to mos esly but forget the most awsome tech in the game cantina shuffel with obi owan at the site for the cantina shuffel vs lone skrilling i lose first the and not making him lose to ability ability ability one turn.<br/>
