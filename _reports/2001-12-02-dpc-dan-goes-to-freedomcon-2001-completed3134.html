<br/>
DPC Dan III Journey to FreedomCon<br/>
<br/>
I will now begin to recount the experiences I had at this years 1st annual Freedcom, site of the<br/>
2001 Star Wars ccg players, World Championships, Along w/ Star Trek, Jedi Knights and Young<br/>
Jedi also respectivly. And every great story needs a theme... an angle, something that will capture<br/>
the imagination in everyone, well obvisously I’m not a writer, so something cheesy will have to<br/>
do instead. And my gimmick will be a parallel of that great west coast city...HOLLYWOOD. yeah,<br/>
Think about it, this is our mecca. The Place Where we’re the stars of our own Movies( Decks,<br/>
Tourney’s etc...) Now I know your about to hit the Back Button on your browser, But Hold on.<br/>
Just follow me for awhile, you will enjoy the parodies that will mirror the goings ons of <br/>
Tinseltown. Freedcom was our Cannes, Sundance, Showest, the great get together as we show<br/>
off that what we have developed and financed ( Cards purchased, and traded for.) You will read<br/>
of NameDropping ( that shameless practice of metioning notable persons, in order to make one-<br/>
self sound important.), PowerLunches ( you know, your people call my people.) and even <br/>
Tabloid style reporting, Oh yeah... I’ve got some dirt! you’re all going down. so hop on the <br/>
Hollywood Bus and strap yourself in... cause this time its for REAL!<br/>
<br/>
This TR is Rated PG - 13 Some Material inapropriate for pesons under the age of 13, <br/>
Parental guidance is recommended.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and BTW name dropping will be in CAPS.<br/>
<br/>
It’s Tuesday afternoon, I’ve just got off work. I pack up my stuff, grab all the cards I think i’ll need<br/>
over the week I will be at Virginia Beach. Give My Buddy JASON KILBY (3 Time worlds qualifier<br/>
Baby!)  a call, to come pick me up. We head over to his house, talk a little about cards. His <br/>
Girlfriend Chelsea wants to watch real world on mtv. well I don’t watch the show, but it’s on and<br/>
Man!, these people need help. I hadn’t seen that many ho’s since the GodFathers...HO TRAIN...<br/>
anyhoo after that KILBY puts on American Pie, cause I haven’t seen it before. Eh, It’s okay no<br/>
big deal. so then it’s late and we leave at like 8 in the morning so we try and catch some sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Well The Plane Trip over is uneventful and pretty smooth. we change planes over in Detroit.<br/>
and meet up with CHARLES HICKEY and JOE OLSON ( cohorts in the now triple eratted watch<br/>
our lock deck.). they’ll be on the plane w/ us. I pick up an EW magazine in the airport, It has an<br/>
article on the new Lord of the Rings movie coming this month, Dec. 19. only in theaters. But the<br/>
real gold of that issue was the HBO Britney Spears promo page, she was dressed is some Elvis<br/>
style jump suit, with her pierced naval exposed ( wow....................................................).<br/>
Her music special was going to be on sunday night. But I knew I wouldn’t be able to see cause<br/>
1. I don’t think i’ll have HBO. and 2. I’ll probably be playing cards or something.<br/>
<br/>
We Arrive at Norfolk sometime around 9 o’clock. get our luggage hook up with Trekkie Player,<br/>
Don’t remember his name ( I believe he took 3rd at freedomcom for STccg) and we all catch a cab.<br/>
And started wondering if all 5 of us would fit into a cab. well this cab pulled up, the Driver had<br/>
to be close to 400 Pounds. and fit all of us and our luggage in that car. But Believe you me, it<br/>
was a Dang tight fit. altoghether we had about 1750 pounds in that car..., that’s almost a TON!<br/>
and we only bottomed out once!<br/>
<br/>
Arrival of the hotel, it’s nice. We Check in. I meet DAVID ADKERS ( The Steven Spielberg of<br/>
Decktech) I’ve never met him before and he seems like a really nice guy. and of course he<br/>
Congratulates me on my award winning motion picture : Ramapocon DPC. " Yeah, Baby."<br/>
we head up to which will be come a very crowded room over the next few days. it’s nice and<br/>
comfy. JOE OLSON and I play a pick up game that seemed to last for a couple of hours, with him<br/>
or me barely winning. I was using a version of QMC against his Ralltiir. I head down to the <br/>
gaming halls. And HAYES HUNTER (And with a name like that he could be the next big<br/>
action hero superstar!) is playing a pick up game with somebody, and says<br/>
high to me and shakes my hand. "you’re last picture was brilliant." So then shortly afterthat<br/>
I head back to get some shuteye.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday / Interior hotelroom / Morning		FADE IN:<br/>
I am slowly awakeing to the sound of a camera shuttering and the giggles to a familiar<br/>
person. KILBY is taking pictures of everyone in the room, as he has somehow gotten<br/>
a debutant of the lowest common denominator of hollywood starlet to <br/>
drape herself across each one of us to find us in a compromising situations, with our<br/>
pictures be recorded certainly for scandalous reasons of a coming day. she is very<br/>
scantaly dressed in nothing more than her underwear. So After KILBY has his laughs<br/>
we are then formally introduced to Tina. she seemed kind of nice. Didn’t say a whole<br/>
lot though. Tina didn’t have any clothes so I lent her some shorts and my millenium<br/>
falcon swccg T-shirt that I won in a Sealed deck tourney which seems forever ago.<br/>
Didn’t really ever find out why she had no clothes with her to begin with, or where<br/>
she was from...?<br/>
<br/>
So Thursday for me was the YJ Qualifier. and I had my decks put together and<br/>
ready to go. they were both dueling decks, and monsters at that. But only a few<br/>
Showed for this qualifier so it was decided that we will all move on to the final<br/>
day for friday! Woo-Hoo! that was easy. Next was The Posh-Posh Party going<br/>
on In HAYES HUNTER’S and BASTIAN WINKELHAUS’S room. ( I swear, <br/>
Bastian is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of swccg! he’s got all the one-liners too.<br/>
Just ask GEMME.) So I decide to introduce Tina to the boys at the party, Man<br/>
they all got a kick out of her. But BARONI and BERTA, the little perverts that<br/>
they are kept trying to get a peek in her pants! BARONI went even as far to <br/>
ask her to show him her holes?..?. Dude, talk about no class. So after tiring of <br/>
making small movements in the most crowded room I have ever been in, Tina<br/>
and I leave. I go back to my room to tweak some sw’s decks when I get word<br/>
from OLSON, " Baroni just barfed up there." Me, "Some people just have to<br/>
know when to say when.". A little while later Word comes down again. "Yeah<br/>
HAYES HUNTER just puked all over the place in his room." ewww..................<br/>
Well what’s to say, except that, I don’t know of any action hero superstars <br/>
that can’t hold their liquor? Sorry HAYES I guess you’re just another wannabe.<br/>
So I ask OLSON is ALAN SAGAN (eh?, ahem... eh?..., EH!) in his room? <br/>
OLSON tells me there is just some random players up there. So I wait awhile and<br/>
then head up to see if SAGAN was back, nope. so I ask one of the random guys<br/>
for a game. <br/>
<br/>
Pick up game #? I lost count yesterday. my Junk of a DS LS Combat deck vs.<br/>
Random Guy’s, Friends LS LS combat deck. well I wasn’t sure if this was the<br/>
deck I wanted to use for sat. cause it’s been getting beat up by everything.<br/>
and the same is just about to happen again. oh by the way random guy is<br/>
MIKE MERLETTO, and this guys name is catching on hotter that Keanu<br/>
Reeves’s 1st action film... Speed. Pretty much he does what that deck does<br/>
which is draw sick destiny the whole game, while I track a couple of 7’s and<br/>
try to duel off as many jedi as possible, but in the end , I eventually lose the<br/>
track and he wins by a dozen or so. we talk a little bit. and for someone, I <br/>
thought was fairly green, he didn’t make any mistakes that game, that I could<br/>
see.<br/>
<br/>
Friday YJ day two. and I won’t really go into what happened here, I think to<br/>
many of you just don’t give a rats rear end about YJ. so I won’t bore you with<br/>
the details. YJ is alot like the classic B - Movie, Great to us that know it, but to<br/>
the mass public complete trash. (e.g. Evil Dead II) anyhoo for the sake of tooting<br/>
my own horn, I got 5th. yep... not too shabby. I am very proud of myself. thanks<br/>
for asking. HEY! Where I come from 16 players is alot!<br/>
<br/>
HICKEY asked to use my Watto deck for day 2 qualifier for swccg. so I say sure<br/>
no prob. cause I was curious to see what it could do... well he went 2wins and<br/>
1 loss, with it. one game he won by 44! ouch. that’ll leave a mark. but then one game<br/>
it got crushed by some beatdown. I was thinking of adding a ghkk........................<br/>
well Between Friday night and Sat. morning is all kind of a blur. I didn’t know<br/>
what I wanted to play. and it was pretty much me and DAVID IRVINE, JOE<br/>
OLSON, and Keith Watabayashi (Sorry man, you’re not getting capped. I mean<br/>
you’re a great guy and all. but your new blood. like Hayden Christensen, you<br/>
could be good but then it could be all hype. so you’ll have to pay for your own<br/>
limo. the studio is not ready to back you yet.) looking at cards and messing with<br/>
decks. and after being verbally abused for concepting an arcona QMC by JOE and <br/>
Keith. I went and pestered SCOTT LINGRELL to borrow a card. and I ended <br/>
up with Throne room Mains for LS. and I will Play the Watto deck, I let HICKEY use.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday worlds day 2 qualifier.<br/>
After I turned in deck list, I went for some breakfast.<br/>
ahh breakfast down at the Pocahontas cafe! The place mat even<br/>
had the tragic story of the indian princess. I don’t know about you<br/>
but when I eat french toast, I don’t wan’t to read about a woman<br/>
dying of disease leaving 2 children alone with a widowed father...<br/>
But hey! that’s just me. as i’m leaving the hostess hands me a freedomcon<br/>
dogtag that was left behing by one of the players. so when I head back to<br/>
the gaming hall I ask MATT BERTA if he knows whom it may belong, MATT<br/>
was in the restaurant too, with GUZMAN,&amp; HUNTER, so he doesn’t know, and<br/>
the name is completely smugded off the back so it’s nobodys now, and I decide<br/>
right then and there it keep it. So I have an extra FreedomCom Dogtag!<br/>
Hmm... Maybe I can autograph it and put it up for the Deckteck autograph of the<br/>
month! jeez, I wonder... How many Decktech points would people put on it?<br/>
2 maybe?, I should get at least a dozen, wait why sell myself short... a bakers<br/>
dozen! yeah, pure gold.<br/>
<br/>
so back to the whole point at hand day two. pairings are announced.<br/>
Well after most of the pairings were called off, SCOTT LINGRELL signals to me<br/>
as I am his first opponent. Man my name was once again butchered by the<br/>
Assisting Directors. So I sit down next to BRIAN HUNTER ( The Charleton <br/>
Heston of swccg... I mean think about it, they’re both known for being religious<br/>
figures? and, and, People talk all kinds of garbage about them, but when they see<br/>
them in person, it’s all mister Hunter this, and Chuck that. Hmm... I wonder if <br/>
Brian Hunters a Jr. President of the NRA?.) Well SCOTT and I are talking as we<br/>
start the game, about being nervous and stuff, I’m like not really Maybe when the<br/>
my 1st movie was released but not now... not after my couple of Blockbuster Films<br/>
took the world by storm. So then  SCOTT asks the kid playing HUNTER if he’s <br/>
nervous and it’s that random kid MERLETTO! ( now thats an action hero<br/>
superstar name if I ever heard one.) this kid’s gonna be huge! anyhoo, MERLETTO<br/>
in his best Eastwood impression, I Dont give a Shiznitt. Man talk about a pair of <br/>
grapefruits. and then he goes ahead and takes down the man. who walks on water!<br/>
"Down goes Frasier!, Down goes Frasier!" its ok, that MERLETTO guy got trashed<br/>
by Foreman all weekend( that Honking fool TIM GUZMAN.).<br/>
<br/>
Game 1<br/>
Watto vs Scott Lingrell’s RST (2035)<br/>
I flip early, make him lose some force<br/>
he sets up his cards to take out the bunker. He<br/>
searches for something not there I verify , no ooc/tt or <br/>
reg. the game gets tight, I don’t have enough people to<br/>
keep the bunker, so I go for Tat. Occ. set up, I play<br/>
neimodian advisor to get tat system, all other cards<br/>
to set up are in my hand, and the card is not there!<br/>
I was activating like 11, 8 cards in reserve turn before<br/>
I played some stuff recycled the cards in my forcepile<br/>
and the few cards from activation overflow was the<br/>
system. next turn he blows the bunker, I lose my<br/>
hand, 8 force, take a couple of beatdowns and the game<br/>
is over! FL -29 , 0/ -29<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Playing Scott. I wish we could play more often.<br/>
Lows - Tough Deck Flow, Just couldn’t get the cards<br/>
I needed. to compete in the middle of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
Throne Room vs Justin Beal AOBS (1777)<br/>
I get kind of a slow start, he has his stuff going.<br/>
and Can’t draw luke for the life of me. but I have<br/>
Colo Claw on table and Plo Kloon at JCouncel.<br/>
so you would think hacking at xizor would be<br/>
easy huh? nope. swing and draw a 2 and a 1,<br/>
and there was already a 1 on colo from earlier, and<br/>
I swap w/ plo, and draw another 1, the sucide mission<br/>
with epp qui-gon fails. lots of battling and damage <br/>
but in the end he pulls out the victory somewhere in<br/>
the high teens. FL -18? , 0/ -48<br/>
<br/>
Highs - The deck in alot of ways did what it was sup-<br/>
posed to do except excute in its destiney draws. even<br/>
with the support of colo and plo, it wasn’t enough and<br/>
with the lack of proper testing, I couldn’t establish <br/>
weaknesses yet.<br/>
Lows - Someplayers bother me, not them parsay but<br/>
their attitude towards the game. Hey I have battleplan<br/>
on the table but he’s gonna drain me everyturn like it’s<br/>
not there, unless I say something. which I did, remind<br/>
him everyturn to pay 3 force. whatever.<br/>
<br/>
well they start anouncing parings from the top to the<br/>
bottom. and when it gets down to the last few, STEVEN<br/>
TURNER comments that this is humilating to do it this<br/>
way. well I being one of the final two. that they don’t even<br/>
bother to call my name nor my opponent. They just say<br/>
well you two are last, get in there. I have to ask what side I’m<br/>
Playing. my opponent is the newest member of our already<br/>
crowded hotel suite. LAUTARO LEIVA<br/>
He won the Spain providence. and a Super Dude... Dude...<br/>
Dude...<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.<br/>
Throne Room vs Lautaro Leiva HD w/Podracing. (1766)<br/>
Well, He forgot to put in No Escape into his deck,<br/>
and Honor was kicking the snot out of him. his podrace<br/>
did do some damage to me, but in the end with his own<br/>
visage killing him, I win. FW + 21 , 2/ -17<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Getting a win. and a very fun game lots of <br/>
banter back and forth.<br/>
Lows - none for me, but Him forgetting no escape<br/>
was brutal, it killed him all day.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4.<br/>
Watto vs Greg Shaw WYS (1791)<br/>
Well I Built the Watto Deck specifically to take out<br/>
WYS, so I was feeling pretty good going into this<br/>
game. and it was a tough time for greg. as I got all<br/>
my stuff into play w/ occupation in full effect. and<br/>
I  think he only flipped his objective once before<br/>
it flipped back for good. FW +22 , 4 / + 05<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Playing WYS and getting some revenge on<br/>
Greg from Ramapo Open.<br/>
Lows - None, it was a good matchup for me.<br/>
<br/>
So after game 4, I catch up with SCOTT LINGRELL<br/>
and we go across the street to get something to eat.<br/>
SCOTT’s a good guy and not someone I would’ve <br/>
normally got to meet if it wasn’t for swccg.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5.<br/>
Throne Room vs Andy McClure MKOS (2044)<br/>
well he starts Colo, which means I can’t start<br/>
mine, which sucks, cause I’m not using the<br/>
other 2 effects to get mine back in play. I threw<br/>
it in last minute as secret Lingrell tech, and didn’t<br/>
expect anyone else to play it, but DS’s advantage<br/>
is to play effects first. so he drops galid and mosep<br/>
to audience chamber. and then next turn I drop<br/>
padme and epp qui-gon to wreck the place and cause<br/>
like 6 overflow or something. he drops u-3po. and<br/>
then he starts the epp double swinging maul show.<br/>
and this maul is just a beast! I kill one but another comes<br/>
down. and in the end he just did a better job of battling<br/>
than I did. FL -24 , 4 -19<br/>
<br/>
Highs - that beatdown on mosep and galid was sweet.<br/>
especially cause, none shall pass was useless.<br/>
Lows - colo claw fish. Now I did play throne room as<br/>
starting site, and what I didn’t think about until after the<br/>
game was,... does that mean I also play my effects 1st?<br/>
I dunno, somebody help me out, Im curious. also epp.<br/>
maul. dude, the cards a beast. and very difficult to get a<br/>
hold of. I would have built my decks differently had I had<br/>
some, to tech around.<br/>
<br/>
well now i’m 2 wins and 3 losses. and any hope of top 8 is<br/>
out the window, so I decide to play another game with<br/>
my watto deck, cause I like it alot. <br/>
<br/>
Game 6.<br/>
Watto vs Alan Sagan LS,LS Combat (1936)<br/>
Well again I always get the first turn flip, but after that<br/>
for some reason, it seems to go down hill. he sets up<br/>
his drains, podracing. and then when I have my tragedy,<br/>
Aim high, and podracing( BTW this one sucks. just so you<br/>
know, I should’ve looked at it more closley.) shields out he<br/>
inserts on me with ntmto arghh, well I have decent destiney<br/>
out and at one point he underestimates what I can do with<br/>
the deck so I got one good beatdown in with like 12 overflow.<br/>
but in the end it’s not enough, I fall to the Canadian. "eh?" yeah<br/>
he got me. FL -23? , 4 / -42<br/>
<br/>
Highs - I got the deck to flip w/ good defense everygame on<br/>
first turn. it just lacks something lategame. i’ll have to work on<br/>
that.<br/>
Lows - One of the more Impressive decks I saw floating around<br/>
Freedomcon. Good Job Alan. It was similar to RIPPENTOE’S deck.<br/>
that was a good one too.<br/>
<br/>
After Game 6 I dropped from the Tourney. I went and Got some<br/>
Sleep. ahh... precious sleep, why do I deny you so? at some point<br/>
between my sleep and fading consisnous I had heard that <br/>
AKESSON ( he Borrowed my RF3 Qui-Gon Jinn, So then I did have some<br/>
sort of a influence if you will on the final match., at least that’s what<br/>
I tell myself as cry to sleep, in the mire of my failures...) And BASTIAN<br/>
were in the final confrontation, with the same dark deck, a non - objective<br/>
tat. occupation deck. "well I thought, I must be dreaming... non - objective<br/>
decks don’t work anymore." so, I went back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
Well I wake up, Push Tina aside and see that the team tourney’s in 25 min’s<br/>
Scramble time! grab a light side senate deck throw three cards in, and take 3 <br/>
out. grab the stupid ds ls combat deck throw 10 cards in, and pull 10 cards <br/>
out. head down stairs. the medal show is going on, but I miss it as i’m trying<br/>
to figure out what exactly my decks do. not a good sign.<br/>
<br/>
Team tourney, Team name - Team Scrub (and with a name like that, there is<br/>
no pressure to do anything.) it’s CHARLES HICKEY, JOE OLSON, ME and<br/>
some guy who needed a team. <br/>
<br/>
Game 1.<br/>
LS Senate vs Brian Fred HD (2046)<br/>
well, shoot. HD the one deck I didn’t want to play. specifically because<br/>
my deck uses farmboy luke in space. and only runs 1 obi w/stick. and<br/>
no qui-gon. well I get farmboy and rsq wedge. to coruscant system early<br/>
and replace my corscant w/ old school coruscant for the fatty drain.<br/>
he put down no escape from opening hand down. I hate it when that<br/>
happens. so my honor is worth nothing. my drain in space is nothing<br/>
cause I can’t rembember that skywalkers don’t drain on flipped HD.<br/>
duh??? so land red 5 after I deployed corran to db exchange pilots<br/>
take off, so I have 7 ability and a cancel destiny sitting at coruscant<br/>
with a drain of 3. farmboy, running for his life db to db in a non<br/>
epic duel HD satisfying menace fades, while he has maul and vader<br/>
and their sticks on table. finally he drops mara on luke. and iniates.<br/>
well i’m holding portal since early and through verification I see he’s<br/>
running 2 or 3 of the retarget interrupt. but it just so happens not to<br/>
be in his hand at this time so I flip my destiny of 2?.... 2! arggh, mara<br/>
lives chops luke and dark strikes him. no more luke which now means<br/>
only I lose to visage. well now he has a DJedi at every DB. and I cant<br/>
satisfy menace fades. I have valorum in hand and a naboo DB in my<br/>
deck somewhere, so on my turn I go look for it an wala! it’s there so<br/>
down goes valorum and menace fades is back in business. his turn he<br/>
moves vader in front I put a six on colo to suicide and kill vader and<br/>
then move palpy out of senate to cover the coruscant db. but <br/>
he slices valorum in the battle and plays another dark strike! 2 in one<br/>
deck! and then tells me it’s standard practice. well not in hick Oregon<br/>
that’s where our defensive fire goes.<br/>
<br/>
well I still move palpy, and at somepoint he dies so late game down<br/>
comes corran, I draw boussh to cancel visage, and I win by three.<br/>
FW +3 , 2 / +3<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Winning a game I should’ve lost, against a very strong<br/>
player. he topped decked the few starfighters he had leaving me<br/>
uncontested in space from turn 3.<br/>
Lows - Must remember HD on flip side.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2<br/>
DS combat, epic duel vs. 1492 ranked random player. WYS<br/>
well a bad deck match up to begin with for me. tight game.<br/>
I had zuckass n’mist hunter and made two suicide missions to<br/>
take out space, and looking through my reserve deck, I had <br/>
better than 70 % chance of getting destiny to kill outrider,<br/>
but 3 times I failed to pull the right destiny, and I lost space.<br/>
the drain of four by maul was huge. at one point he dropped down<br/>
luke w/ stick, and my turn I drop vader w/stick, epic duel, vaders<br/>
obsession. he crosses luke and loses some force. but in the<br/>
end he forgot to land his starfighter to satisfy menace so I drain<br/>
out his last 3 cards with maul. FW +2 , 4 / +05<br/>
<br/>
Highs - I got to epic duel luke off. cool.<br/>
Lows - Should’ve lost the game, and my deck sucks.<br/>
and, that’s about all I got to say about that.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.<br/>
LS Senate vs Alan Sagan ISB (1936)<br/>
well shoot, I had to play Alan twice at Ramapo, too<br/>
and now once again. and though I got a good jump early,<br/>
once he got his stuff out, it was all down hill.<br/>
FL -15 , 4 / -10<br/>
<br/>
Highs - It was a pretty fun game. If a couple of things went<br/>
my way I could’ve won this one.<br/>
Lows - Alan Is making a Strong push for me to be his Bi-atch.<br/>
"I will not succumb to your canadian ways!"  "eh?"<br/>
<br/>
Game 4.<br/>
DS Combat vs Brian Hunter WYS (2303)<br/>
So I finally get to play the Man. And What Do I tell myself, I<br/>
wish I had a different deck. yeah, so I just try to make the best<br/>
of it. If A 1492 player should of beat this deck. doesn’t than mean<br/>
a 2303 player would win by 64? don’t ask me where I came up with<br/>
that number, It’s not important. anyhoo he beats me silly. Like by <br/>
25, no cards in his lost pile. but... and I mean but... Just like before<br/>
He puts down Luke w/stick. and then I drop Vader w/stick, epic<br/>
duel, vaders obsession. cross luke, and he loses some cards.<br/>
that is before he retrieved it of course. and I know what yer<br/>
saying, "where was run Luke, run?" well he and the other<br/>
opponent were playing it. I saw it in both there decks through<br/>
verification. they just never got it in their hands, at the right<br/>
time. so FL -25 , 4 / 35<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Playing Brian, It was a fun game, Heck I didn’t care.<br/>
Lows - Next time, I will be better prepared.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the tournament they start giving out some <br/>
prizes to random drawings. and my name is called and<br/>
what do I win... General Veers swccg T-Shirt. YEAH!<br/>
I love these T-shirts. I wish they still gave them out over the<br/>
Foils. And I don’t mind being called a T-shirt player thank<br/>
you very much T.J. HOLMAN. because that’s what I’m wearing<br/>
90% of the time, at tourneys......ok, outside of tourneys too.<br/>
but, they’re real comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
So I’m back in the room, and I’m looking at how horrible of<br/>
a deck the ds combat is, when I notice... Luke w/Stick.<br/>
I’ve got BRIAN HUNTER’S Luke! cool..., I could autograph<br/>
this as a hijacked Luke w/stick, and put up on decktech for<br/>
auction. Wait! I wonder if people would bid on this on ebay?<br/>
I could do a 2 for 1 with the Dog Tag! could be bank? uh-huh?<br/>
<br/>
So anyway I’m watching the ram, pats game. It goes to comm-<br/>
recial and I flip the channel and what do I see, oh my gosh...<br/>
Britney Spears. The Room Gets HBO. 1st the Veers T-shirt,<br/>
now Britney...the Trip is paid for. I’m entranced for awhile,<br/>
until an unwanted close up of a couple of queer dancers <br/>
breaks up the brain-washing. so I go down to the Bar to see<br/>
HICKEY play Lord of the Rings. And BRIAN HUNTER is<br/>
Down there so I let him know  that I kidnapped his Luke<br/>
W/stick. He says that’s only his second one and that he needs<br/>
it back, Like I was going to keep it or something? I was just<br/>
gonna sell it on ebay for major bank! 2 for 1 baby!<br/>
<br/>
we head back to the room, and I go to grab the card, and<br/>
I see BRIAN take a look at Tina... Well he gives me this<br/>
look like, I don’t even want to know what you guys are into.<br/>
well all that seemed to get lost because it was the HBO<br/>
Finale of Britney’s concert, and she was getting WET.<br/>
I dunno what was the whole deal, but I wasn’t complaining.<br/>
I think all the guys in the room was mesmerized by the little<br/>
pop diva, I don’t remember Tina saying much during that<br/>
sequence either.<br/>
<br/>
Well that was pretty much the end of the day, I tried to <br/>
get some sleep later on while Beavis(Harpster) and <br/>
Butthead(N.Jones) made clowns out of themselves.<br/>
-Drinking Tip #1- After vomiting, don’t continue to<br/>
drink, it’s not a good thing.<br/>
-Proper ettiquette Tip #1- if your gonna get into<br/>
a card throwing duel with someone... Don’t grab<br/>
their Rares and throw those. They don’t like that.<br/>
<br/>
A little while the last of the seattle crew left the<br/>
room, and we got some shut eye. we awoke in the<br/>
morning payed our bill. ate some breakfast and went<br/>
home. and that’s the end of that. Toodles.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Me for not using one Swear word this whole<br/>
Tourney report. I thought this should’ve been<br/>
rated PG. But the MPAA has it out for me man.<br/>
where’s the justice?<br/>
<br/>
again myself for not blaming or accusing sleep<br/>
deprivation for anything. you know, you finally<br/>
will have to accept the fact that no swccg player<br/>
gets sleep at major tourneys. good or bad, it’s just<br/>
a fact, none of us has the sleep we want before<br/>
we play.<br/>
<br/>
Slops<br/>
<br/>
My performance, I scrubbed.<br/>
I didn’t prepare very well, at all.<br/>
next time.<br/>
<br/>
Honking, Barfing, Puking, Chucking,<br/>
tossing the cookies, losing my lunch,<br/>
lurch, throw up, heave, hurl, etc...<br/>
way too much of that was going on.<br/>
<br/>
airport bars for charging 2.50 for a<br/>
12 oz soda. and 5.00 for a bottle of<br/>
heinekan.<br/>
<br/>
Tina. She borrowed my clothes and <br/>
never said thank you, or anything.<br/>
totally dissed me the whole weekend.<br/>
Rude, somepeople.<br/>
