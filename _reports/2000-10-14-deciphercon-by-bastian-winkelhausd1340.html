<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Deciphercon 2000 is over. I came home and directly hit the bed. Boy, was I tired. Actually I was tired during the whole con. <br/>
But as long as I had a game going it was ok.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The story begins some time ago, with our regional. Death Star 2 came out like 2 or 3 weeks ago and I couldn´t really come up <br/>
with anything new. Martin Falke could. We certainly have some other good players in germany but Martin is like my <br/>
archenemy. I missed the final by a few points of differential but looking at the matchup I would have lost anyway.<br/>
One week later there´s the continentals. I played Ralltiir again, this time with Mob.Points, but basically Akesson style. Light <br/>
side was the problem again, I changed decks every day because no deck really pleased me. Grand Slam on friday and day one <br/>
on saturday I finish 5-1 but I screw up day 2 at 3-3.<br/>
So I have to pay the trip myself. But with 38 players from day 1 there´s no way I´m not trying to qualify.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tournament starts late. A lot of players arrived wendesday like me but there was no way of registering. Instead I had to wait <br/>
more than a whole hour in line next morning. Instead of starting at 10 am we started at 1 pm.<br/>
<br/>

turn, if you didn´t start There is no try you also have Search and destroy in play. It´s quick and delivers nasty beats.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention I couldn´t come up with a decent light deck? Fortunately I playtested with Martin a few times before worlds. We <br/>
came up with a throne room deck that was better against Ralltiir but as we expected more Bring him and Hunt down decks we <br/>
chose this deck. It´s all around solid and able to win big.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS against ??? can´t remember the name<br/>
<br/>
I can´t remeber anything except I won by 23. Lack of sleep does bad things to your memory. Should have taken notes. <br/>
Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS against Paul Myers, Profit, Eloms and mains on CC<br/>
<br/>
He starts Jedipack Han, I put Mara and Jabba in the chamber. First turn he signals for Bargaining table, second turn for order <br/>
to engage. both times Bo Shuda is in his force pile.<br/>
For some turns he just stockpiles Eloms on the table while I drain and set up some defense. Put Tempest scout 1/Arnet down <br/>
on Ralltiir and reinforce at Jabbas palace. When he finally came down with Beggar/Draw their fire and 5 or 6 Eloms he deals <br/>
no battle damage. Thats game. Win by 28 ?<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS against a guy with a big strange hat, ISB drop and drain<br/>
<br/>
He starts IAO, Mob-Points and There is no try. I allways start Squadron Assignments and Strike Planning and normally third <br/>
effect is Wise Advice. But because of there is no try I started Insight. Good choice as he played like 6 or 8 scanning crews. He <br/>
drained exactly once during the whole game and I won easily by 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS against Ray Bordier, Hidden Base with matching pilots<br/>
<br/>
Nobody I ever played talked such loads of @#$%. Some of it was funny but some was really ridiculous. Whatever.<br/>
He can´t deal with Ralltiir. I mostly leave him alone in space and just drain and search and destroy. Win by 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 LS against Dominic Gaudreault, BHBM "The Maschine"<br/>
<br/>
He played the same deck as Yanick and Raphael. Like all the other games I played that one was not close. But this time I lost <br/>
by 22. He played very well.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS against Kyle Craft, old-school Y4-throne-room<br/>
<br/>
Old school means he started careful planning. I tested Y4 and we started heading for the medical and docking bays.Like all the <br/>
other games on day 1 I don´t remember a lot here but I won by 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 DS against ChrisPraskac, TJs EBO<br/>
<br/>
He starts 1stmarker and signal so I don´t expect Sense / Alter and start cannot hide forever. He did play some senses but <br/>
didn´t have´em early on so it doesn´t matter. I do the usual thing, play tactical support first turn, play the street to ralltiir and put <br/>
trooper danvin felth to Exec: docking bay. Second turn I flip and set up search and destroy. I have 2 cadets at the street, Sgt. <br/>
Major Bursk at the prefects office in the middle and trooper Davin Felth went to the ralltiir docking bay. On his second turn he <br/>
put premiere Obi-wan with his stick to the street, send one cadet away, hit the other and made me loose 6 force.<br/>
As he said later, this looked like a good idea. Unfortunately it was not. On my third turn I hit him with all 4 biker scouts, Wallen <br/>
for free, trooper assault, substract 5 from him with barich, draw 2 destinies and he ends up loosing Obi-wan and 22 force. Not <br/>
surprisingly, that was game on turn 3. This dark deck really is a beast.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 LS against David Irvine, BHBM with troopers<br/>
<br/>
I play troopers myself so I know how to deal with them. Plus nobody really puts a lone character out against BHBM early on, <br/>
so I set up in space first. When I came down he hit me next turn with like 5 troopers and trooper assault. But he wasn´t doing <br/>
any battle damage to me. He had a few more trooper assaults but I allways had 2 or 3 built-in weapons so I got rid of his guys <br/>
and win by 20 something.<br/>
<br/>
End of day 1 I end up second with 7-1 and nice differential. Unlike all the 5-3 guys who had to wait for all the results to see if <br/>
they had enough differential I got my semifinalist pass immediately and get to bed at about 2.30 am. But instead of sleeping <br/>
we´re laying in our beds and keep talking till 4. Next morning I´m tired again and as my decks proofed I only changed one <br/>
card. I add the lost in the wilderness and take out another card that I allready forgot. On day one that lost in the wilderness <br/>
could have been real big but now that I put it in, every guy I play puts Vader down on CC or death star. Weird.<br/>
<br/>
Day two starts nearly on time, only one hour late I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS against Matt Berta, Hunt down<br/>
<br/>
Never heard of this guy so I hoped for a relatively easy match. Pull Honor fist turn and get Lando+Falcon out, just like allways. <br/>
I never got this game under control but neither did he. There were really few force drains because I flipped early and he <br/>
couldn´t find my hidden base for a long time. I only lost to visage after he got his 3rd battleground. I retrieved only once with <br/>
On the edge but somehow we couldn´t finish within time. I guess I might have lost if we would have played to the end but now I <br/>
have 11 cards to his 7 so I win on time.<br/>
With a time win first game I surely got better matchups during the next games but I couldn´t get in on 5-3 with good diff <br/>
anymore. I needed to win 5 more for sure. But I was pretty confident.<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS against Kyle Craft, same Y4-throne room as the day before<br/>
<br/>
This game lasted exactly 11 turns and I remember everything. I started There is no try as my 3rd effect, knowing he has SAC.<br/>
His 1st turn : I grab Carida, Ozzel with imperial command and Bursk, Trooper Felth and a cadet with tac. support. He gets a <br/>
nudj from reserve, plays rendezvous point and yodas hut and draws a few.<br/>
My 1st : Play Carida, street to ralltiir and Executor docking bay, trooper Felth to the DB.<br/>
His 2nd : Plays signal to get revolution, revolutions my ralltiir, plays second nudj, draws a bit and leaves 3 force.<br/>
My 2nd : Get prefects office and DB to ralltiir, office in the middle like allways. Ozzel, a cadet and Tempest scout 1 to office, <br/>
elsek to street, move cadet to street and felth to DB, flip.<br/>
His 3rd : He comes down with EPP Leia and Han to office and Taws Khaa to DB. I don´t have a barrier, he´s got 2 force left. <br/>
He initiates at the office and wants to play careful planning. I remind him that I have the first just action and play projective <br/>
telepathy. He senses, draws a 2. Then he plans and draws a 0. I trample Han, he has no other sense and I draw a 5. He draws <br/>
another 0 for battle destiny and has to loose 2 force for battle damage! Ozzel stays alive. Knowing my beatdown-ability he <br/>
moves Leia to DB.<br/>
My 3rd : Play tac. support to get irol, drelosyn and enfield. Use my objective to get trooper assault. Play barich, irol and <br/>
drelosyn to DB, initiate, play trooper assault. He hits barich, my power is 28 to his 8 so he looses Leia, Taws and 11 force. I <br/>
move felth to street and elsek to office( for free!).<br/>
His 4th : Plays EPP Luke to street and order to engage, draws a few.<br/>
My 4th : Use ralltiir to get trooper assault, play enfield and torent. Initiate, play trooper assault, he looses Luke plus 9 force, I <br/>
loose torent because he´s hit.<br/>
His 5th : He is frustrated and play Obi-wan to office an draws.<br/>
My 5th : Don´t use ralltiir, play Mara Jade and Davod Jon, initiate and he looses Obi-wan and 10 force.<br/>
His 6th : He activates his remaining 4 force and draws up.<br/>
<br/>
Full win by 32! Kyle said he never lost that high for maybe 2 years. Everything went my way and I´m really happy now.<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS against Bruce Savin There is good in him<br/>
<br/>
Pretty uneventful game, Lord Vader grabs Luke on turn two, I flip on turn 3. Turns out he´s playing surprise assault but he was <br/>
never able to set up any destinies so I win by 26.<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS against Matt Sokol, BHBM<br/>
<br/>
Matt does virtually nothing in this game for the first turns. In retrospect I read from his report that he had a really bad hand and <br/>
plays a 3 card combo, hoth war room-responsibility of command-much anger in him. He didn´t get this combo going during our <br/>
game though. So I get all my systems out and two ships and flip and he´s just drawing! So I put Blount to emperor on DS:II. I <br/>
didn´t see him getting force lighting from deck but he had one in hand. Unfortunately he draws one of his war room for destiny. <br/>
So I get Han,Leia and Obi, hit him and draw sweet destinies and that´s game. Full win by 24.<br/>
Next day I said something like "Good thing he changed his dark, because the other deck was bad" and now every guy in <br/>
Albany seems to hate me. If you read this Matt, I meant just what I said, that ISB was maybe the best matchup you could get <br/>
and Yanick was well prepared for Bring him. I don´t want to offend you personally but that game was just a piece of cake for <br/>
me because you did virtually nothing all game long! Sure your deck beat a lot of other players but I only saw it in this one game <br/>
and it performed bad. Statement ended, congrats for being the world champion, take it easy.<br/>
<br/>
Game 5. LS against John Arendt, Hunt Down<br/>
<br/>
These days the first 2 or 3 turns go the same in nearly every game. So I got Honor with insight first turn, pull my 2 generals, <br/>
play Lando+Falcon to endor first turn, move to aquaris next turn etc.<br/>
He gets a docking bay first turn, can´t deploy, next turn he searches for another DB and there is none so I can see his deck. <br/>
He´s playing a lot of interrupts, real high destiny stuff but no SAC. One turn before I flip he must have seen there´s a lot of ships <br/>
in his force pile so he draws nearly all of it. I play used grimtaash and he looses all of them to the used pile again. He set up <br/>
search and and destroy with Vader at one site and Emperor and Mara (?) at another site. He only left one force though and I´m <br/>
holding draw their fire. So he can´t really play all he´s got in his hand. I get down with Leia, General Solo, Luke and Blount. I <br/>
play I know to add 2 destinies and he pays his one force to cancel it with Scruffy looking nerf herder. WTF! Anyway, I had <br/>
tracked a destiny so I hit Vader and he looses a bunch of cards and search and destroy. When he found my base he only had 2 <br/>
battlegrounds so I only loose 5 force to security precautions and I win by 22.<br/>
<br/>
So now I´m 5-0 with one time win and I only need to win one more game to be in top 12. One out of three and I´m playing <br/>
dark twice. It sounded so easy yet it proved to be real difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, DS against Martin Akusson, Y4-throne room with DBs and the super home one<br/>
<br/>
He´s playing Hoth and Home one DB and a bunch of twix sites. We practiced that match on friday night and we split the two <br/>
games we played. This time he owned me big time. Difference to Kyle was Marten playing Batlle Plan. I never found the time <br/>
and resources to go to space so I can´t drain him while we skirmish over ralltiir. He never leaves anybody alone so Order to <br/>
engage does me in. Loss by 27<br/>
<br/>
Game 7, LS against Kyle Craft RalOps with big power<br/>
<br/>
I get a real big start with 3 systems in my hand but against Ralltiir I expect a very hard match. But with only 1 match against <br/>
Ralltiir in 8 games I selected the right deck in my eyes. I don´t remember why, but I get to see his deck on first turn. Lot´s of <br/>
big power stuff, sabers for Mara and Darth but also tempest scouts and at-st pilots. So first turn I don´t go to Ralltiir but <br/>
Aquaris to generate a bit extra. Second turn get Lando to Ralltiir and Green Squadron 3 to Aquaris. His turn he sets up at 3 <br/>
sites with Emperor, tempest scout with pilot and Mara Jade. My turn I can´t attack but I hold General Solo and I know so I <br/>
send Solo down to the planet to delay his flip. So I can´t decide where I should go Emperor or Mara, Mara or Emperor and <br/>
finally I put him down with Mara. Then I start picking up cards and I suddenly feel really bad. You know where I just put Solo <br/>
down? At the swamp! No reacts for me!! So i thought, play it cool, maybe he won´t notice. He stretches a bit to flip, get 4th <br/>
site down from reserve, deploy an lone at-st pilot there, deploy dengar in ship to system. I barrier dengar, well knowing he <br/>
can´t deploy a passenger to soak battle damage. He plays another tempest scout with pilot to mara and initiates. I play I know <br/>
and search reserve for Leia and he let´s me. I don´t give a f*** if it was unethical or whatever, this was worlds. Plus I didn´t <br/>
want to look dumb for deploying Solo and then let him beat the snot out of him. I take out the tempest with pilot but couldn´t hit <br/>
Mara with Leia. He wants to move Dengar but I remind him of the barrier, he draws everything except one to react with the <br/>
tempest scout at the desert ( with sandwhirl on it, he played it in advance). So I have one more chance to hit the lone pilot he <br/>
needed to flip. I´m having beggar in hand and Insurrection out and a tunnel vision in hand. But I need EPP Luke or Obi to inflict <br/>
some real damage. So I check my deck during activate phase with 7 cards in it and there´s the DB and both EPPs! I activate 2 <br/>
more and guess what, the DB was in those two force. I beat down Dengar but can´t flip him back and against a flipped Ralltiir <br/>
with all bases covered my deck just looks silly. Full loss by 16.<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 DS against Gary Carman, non-flip HB with huge activation<br/>
<br/>
ARGH! I know there´s not a lot of scrubs in day 2 of worlds but couldn´t I at least get a semi-scrub?! He started staging areas, <br/>
Insurrection and Strike planning. First turn he grabs Crix, Dagobah and yodas hut, home one docking bay, puts down crix and <br/>
grabs blount. Second turn Endor and Hoth docking bay and he activates silly amounts of force. I flip and he comes down with <br/>
the new Wedge, Tycho Celchu and Kal Fal C´ndros. He plays Bacta Tank and Order to engage and everytime I get a combo <br/>
down to draw a second destiny he played barrier and moved. He sensed stuff like trample and when EPP Obi joined the party, <br/>
things were getting out of hand, he played clash of sabers, sorry about the mess etc. It was pretty clear that he won so I let him <br/>
initiated the battles with first strike and draw their fire out  because he said that he might need the differential. I think he finished <br/>
the day at 9th or 10th  anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So thats it, I was out. After winning 5 straight I couldn´t finish the job. I played a lot of pickup games the next day with my <br/>
Brangus Glee Superstar and ISB / ties and entered the japanese sealed on saturday night. I got a lot of crap and Arconas are <br/>
really silly in that enviroment. My space consisted of one Tie fighter, one Tie vanguard and Black 4. My first opponent had 2 <br/>
corvettes. I dropped after the first game and headed for the bar. Sunday I didn´t want to play in the team event because I never <br/>
played a single game with the new cards. So I played Brangus Glee in the kibitz tournament. I actually didn´t do a lot of <br/>
kibitzing, it was just a nonsanctioned tournament. If you haven´t read the description, during this tournament you were allowed <br/>
to watch the other games, comment on game plays, errors etc. I lost the first game by 6. My opponent started the usual EBO <br/>
start. So did his neighbour. When they saw that, they exchanged decks to make it more interesting! Really cool! During the <br/>
games they said things like "You should play Ice Storm in here, I play one in my deck" / "I know, but it´s absolutely useless in <br/>
my game". Made loosing much more fun. I then won the remaining 3 games with high diff ending 6 (+95). I played one <br/>
undefeated in my last game and there was one more. So after finishing my game I go over to their table and ask his opponent <br/>
how he´s doing. He answered " Not good, I think I´m loosing". So I said " No way you´re loosing, show me your hand!". <br/>
Together we pull it of and I win the tournament because of him winning this game and get one of the ultracool  grey t-shirts. <br/>
Kyle Heuer told me they were about three times as expensive as white ones but they look awesome! I played some more really <br/>
cool games the whole day, especially against TJ Holman, this was my funniest game ever!!!<br/>
<br/>
This report is allready way to long so I cut the props allthough some people think it´s the best thing about TRs.<br/>
I just want to say thank you to everybody I played or talked to over the entire con, it was a great experience and I hope to <br/>
meet everybody again next year.<br/>
