                should I care about my Tech Points?</font><br>
                Members can spend their tech points to gain greater control and 
                more access to the content here at DeckTech. Members with highest 
                ratings will be able to purchase special privileges that will 
                distinguish them when they submit or post.</font></font><font face="Haettenschweiler, Tahoma, Arial, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

                <a name="more"></a>How do I get more Tech Points?</font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
                When you first join DeckTech you start with 1500 tech points in 
                your general account. When you enter content, a deck, article 
                or tournament report for a specific game the first time 1/4 of 
                those points are assigned to your tech rating for that game. This 
                is how you indicate to our system that you play that specific 
                game. For each following submission you post for that game your 
                points will be assigned to that game until all points have been 
                distributed. <br>
                <br>
                Points are then added or subtracted based on the ratings you receive 
                for each submission. Each time someone reviews one of your submissions 
                your tech points are adjusted. <br>

                addition for each article, deck or tournament report you review
