The files are stored as php that can easily be viewed by renaming their extentions to html. The intent is to convert all of this into a format easily referenced for posterity by the swccg community.

I moved all of the other files into another branch: all-data. Tournament reports and articles can still be found there. Select the branch in github and rename the files to hrml. (I used a program, Advanced Renamer, to quickly strip down the files and rename them as html.)

The .py file added is the scrip I used to parse through the html files and extract the info as a .md file for use with gh-pages. The files are formatted to work with the [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) integration in GitHub.
