<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I knew as soon as I saw the advertisement on decktech that I wanted to attend the first DPC of the year.  I was sort of saddened by it being placed on Sunday though, but thats understandable.  Jim Boyd, my loyal playtesting partner, and I decided to make the trip just like we did last year.  Last year we both got $150 when we went so we figured why not try again?
<br/>
	I am always talking to Justin about decks and Ive been playtesting the entire 2 months before the DPC.  I have got Senate Ties for DS, thats the bottom line.  Since it beats LSC with ease, demolishes WYS, devastates QMC, and that leaves only LS Senate Beats.  I knew going into the DPC that LS Senate would be popular.  Andy did a good job of making it a viable tournament deck ever since Fcon.  
<br/>
I told Jim to rebuild his LS Senate since I really needed to playtest against it.  He did and we played our first game.  I have a 12 card hand but he uses his objective to pull my Ghhhk into the Used pile and then the Falcon comes down with Life Debt for an overflow ofa lot, lol.  Reguardless of such a beating, I knew this match-up could be easy.  I just needed to develop a consistent way to beat the decktype.  I knew the match-up was a guaranteed timed win for one player or the other.  But I developed two ways to beat the deck while playing against Jim.  First off, I can go to space fast by deploying all my systems and a Tie to each system and hold a Ghhhk.  The regular way people play ties; as for the senate, I would just use two hit and run senators roughly every other turn to utilize their draw their fire.  The plan worked and I beat Jim but it was close.  Then, I developed the second way to beat LS Senate.  Which was to deploy NONE of your systems.  Bunker up at Coruscant with as many ships as you can, then draw to like a 15-20 card hand to get all your senators ready to go.  Then, drop ALL your senators to the senate and use the power bonus from the system and whatever other means necessary to knock the LS out of the senate.  Use your political effect and Aks Moe to drain them for 4 at Coruscant the rest of the game and 1 in the senate.  The second method is unfortunately more likely to time out though.  Also, I added the Bacta Tank canceller so that the second method would be successful in the senate.
<br/>
Justin and B. Hunter kept telling me that Senate Ties stood no chance at controlling the senate and a slight chance at winning the game.  However, it didnt make sense to me at all.  How can a LS senate do damage to you?  Coward stops all hopes of drains and retrieval, and you dictate whether the battlegrounds are deployed.  With my 2 strategies developed to beat LS senate, and with much general deck advice from Justin(thnx again), I was ready for the DPC.
<br/>
Although I had spent the previous month doing a lot of cards, the week before a girl asked me to prom so after our local Friday I had hardly any time to work on perfecting decks.  Then Firday, two days before the DPC, the same girl asked me to hang out with her and a friend so we ended up watching a movie call Joy Ride, LoL.  I dont know if any of you have seen it but its kinda scary.  This trucker chases three people around the entire time.  So I get home at like 11 that night and try to sleep some.  Jim and I drove up in his car on Saturday(insert amazing new Passion CD, Our Love is Loud); while all the time I keep on checking through the rear view mirror to make sure we arent being chased by some maniac driving a 18-wheeler.  He played in the LOTR tourney and I played a bunch of pick-up games the whole day, making sure to show everyone what I was playing, lol.  I also got to read some amazing John Piper theology on Christian Hedonism, oh yeah!  At first I kept my LS Profit deck under wraps b/c I didnt want anyone to really know it was coming; but I eventually busted it out too.  I played a lot of pick-up games against a bunch of people, including a game against Brads ISB with my WYS which he ended up winning by 1!?  My stupid Virtual Luke and Outrider came off my reserve deck to his very first force drain!  How uncharacteristic.  I suppose it coulda gone my way but I let him take back a battle that ended pourly for him.  Nevertheless, it was good to see good ole Brad and some NC guys.  Talked to Neal and David too, its been a while since I had seen either of them.  Got to see Stephen Michael, Jeff Holmes, Andy Mc., and a bunch of good friends throughout the day.
<br/>
Well, Damian Loback had offered to let Jim and me spend the night at his house with John Anderson so we drove about 45 minutes from the Warroom to his house for the night.  I got to bed early(12:30) compared to the other 3.  I needed some sleep badly for the next day.   I played against Johns Europe Base deck before I went to bed to make sure my WYS could handle the Trampleit did.  Ties and cannons are practically useless against my WYS b/c I just use Barrier, Alternatives to Fighting, or A few Maneuvers and then shoot the tie down the next turn.  Pretty simple concept I guess.
<br/>
I wake up on Saturday morning and count my LS deck while doing decklists58 cards.  What the heck!?  I am freaking out at this point b/c I always have 60 and something really weird musta happened b/c I am very strick about every card in my deck.  I quickly come to find I am missing one Palace Raider and something else that Im not sure.  More on this one missing card later.  Saturday morning we make the 45 minutes drive back to the warroom and much to my surprise I find none other than the Oldskooler himself.  So I meet Matt and he shows off, which by now is pretty infamous I suppose, the major tattoo he has on his back.  Crazy stuff, then I heard him mumble something about a $100 bar tab, LoL.  Bad MattBad Matt!  Anyway, a disappointing 15 show as opposed to 63 last year.  Among those shown were the following:  Myself, Clint Hays, Matt Lush, Andy Mcclure, Brian Rippetoe, Brad Reinholdwell right there are 6 in the top 100 of the world, lol.  There were a bunch of other good players too:  Damian, John, Jim, Clay Wilburn, Charles K., Grayson, Etheridge and two other guys whose names escape me now, sorry.  Guess this will be a pretty rough pairing tournament though!
<br/>
<br/>
Decks:  WYS Raiders(my name IS Paul Myers isnt it?  LoL)
<br/>
DS is my version of Senate Ties.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My LS vs. Damian Lobacks(1606) WATTO/TANKS INSTANTLY KILL YOUR CRAFTS WHEN I DRAW A ONE/START His Name Is Anakin/EPP Maul/Imperial Command/Your Raiders deploy for 9/Anything that could possibly be considered Anti-Paul/There is no way I can lose to Pauls WYS/I flip first turn and dominate you!
<br/>
Well, keeping that title in mind, LOL, lets get onto the game!  Damian prolly has the lowest rating of anyone there yet I would desire to play ANYONE there instead of him.  We played this match-up yesterday and it OBVIOUSLLY didnt work to well considering he built the deck to beat me, lol.  He starts IAO Combo, MP Combo, and His Name is Anakin(the most janky card EVER &amp;#61514;.  He pulls Carida, drops the bridge and Mos Espa DB, does not flip, but instead draws up to 12 I believe.  On my turn, I know Im gonna have to move fast to stand a chance.  Luke goes to Kessel, Phylo and a Raider get into a Craft goes to the Mos Espa DB of his so I have a drain of 6 set-up on first turn.  His turn he spends all his force to drop EPP Maul and Dr.e Combo to the Mos Espa DB.  Not sure why though.  He battles and I draw an 8 for battle destiny so he loses both while I chose to lose the Raider so that I can have the drain 3 next turn.  He stacks a AAT Laser Cannon on his freshly deployed ClawFish too, and I wasnt sure why he did that either.  Since he spent 12 force to kill my one raider, he is not able to draw any this turn.  Which means he wont be able to flip next turn either!  I am slowly gaining a little confidence.  On my turn I hit him for 6, drop my &lt;&gt;DB and get the Outrider up to tatooine, while a Raider goes to the Home One DB for 2 and moves to hang out with Phylo.  On his turn, he just draws and tries to get some type of tank combo in his hand.  On my turn, I hit him for 7.  I breathe sighs of relief in my mind as all kinda of yucky cards are coming off the top to my drains, Lateral Damage, Executor, etc.  I drop the Bacta Tank and Honor of the Jedi, then draw for some defenseive cards.  On his turn, he drops Watto from his reserve with a Tank and Pilot to the Junkyard but no Tank  cannon thank goodness.  EPP Vader goes to Mos Espa, and I think he put another EPP Maul at the Mos Espa DB but didnt battle this time.  I am forced to It Could Be Worse his objective damage since he occupies 3 BGs.  On my turn, I drain for 4 and send Wedge in ship to his Carida.  I start setting up my Edges and his tank finally gets a cannon.  His Maul and Vader are running around on tatooine, and Against any other deck, Id just trade a raider for the Vader but my raiders are not easily replenished due to his flipped objective.  I do no battling on the ground because of the tank cannons power.  Chewie goes to the Cantina and his life force is slowly being wittled down.  The constant drain of 5 finally does him in after I retrieve some more with Broken Luke and On The Edge.  He never deploys a ship much to my happiness.  The unwinnnable matchup has been won and by a significant margin!  FW(+27)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My DS vs. James Boyds(1741) LS Senate
<br/>
I dont want any games going to time, so I am forced to go with strategy number one mentioned above.  Before you say Ive played against two easy opponents in a row and not against the big names, think again.  I would have played against ANYONE instead of Damians DS and Jims LS.  Sure I can beat LS Senate easy, but Jims is just a bit different.  He plays the Battle Plains which makes the biggest difference in satisfying Coward, now he can retrieve in EVERY senate battle and EVERY Falcon strike.  Not to mention, Jim starts the oh-so-powerful Scrambled Transmission to pull his Grimtassh(effectively killing strategy #2).  I always start the DB Puller(+2 forfeit also), MP Combo, and Crush.  I put out Waklemui and DS:2 DB first turn because I like to generate force.  I draw some for some senators to use.  He gets Palpy to the senate along with Horox Ryyder to flip his objective and pull the Block a Drain effect.  On my turn, I put out like Kashyyk and a Tie, I use two scrub senators to strike at the senate.  I use his DTF for a two-force swing and then unflip his objective so he cant put two cards from my hand in my used pile.  I pull and deploy the drain +2 effect also.  On his turn, he kills my Senator with Amidala but cant retrieve any due to Coward.  On my turn, I drain for a fat 4 since you dont need to be flipped to use the Political Effects.  I draw some and he burns his only Grimtaash to check my hand.  No doubles since I dont use any in my tie deck.that was a joke.  But actually I didnt have any doubles though.  I couldnt find my Bacta Canceller but Jim never found his Tank anyway so no worries.  He eventually puts out Falcon against a Tie and Life Debts too but I ghhk and the falcon combo goes in front of my Tie at coruscant.  I have no cannon and cant get one either.  I drop 4 More Ties and Battle his falcon, playing All Power to Weapons, retrieving for half the ties, then using his DTF.  I lose nothing and he loses a couple overflow.  On his turn he battles back but its pointless.  I lose 3 ties and put one in used pile and he pays upkeep.  On my turn I use his drop a cannon and battle to use his DTF.  Bye bye falcon.  Out comes his battle plains and an epp luke also.  I drop more ties to my drain 2 systems though and constant Hit and Run attacks using his DTF slowly win me the game.  FW+12.  And may it be known this was my lowest win of the day and maybe roughest game against Jim.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My WYS vs. Adam Weinsteins(1830) Speed Combat Racing
<br/>
This game starts out with a rulings question.  He asks me if I want to start a Pod, and I say I want to see his effect first.  He thinks the Pod comes first due to the wording on Start Your Engines and I disagree.  Jim Colson, our extraordinary TD, rules in my favor so Adam changes his effect from the Box to Blaster Rack for fear of Anis Racer in my WYS.  I reveal like a Control/Tunnel Vision as my racer and have to put it back into my deck because it isnt a racerLoL, I coulda sworn it was.  Mmmm, Jedi Mind Tricks.  Anyway, I could care less if he starts the freakin box.  I suspend it every single game anyway, its just that I like it when the blaster rack is started b/c then my opponent deploys lots of useless weapons from reserve deck and wastes a couple force.  Anyway, he goes first turn with Maul and Stick from reserve to the 3/2 site.  So on my turn, I go with the usual set up of menace fades.  I think I went with Virtual Luke to Kessel and a Raider/Craft to the ground.  Dont you love that 4 force they give you just to help you set up Menace fades?  On his turn we both draw race destiny.  His was pretty low though, he drew like 1,3,5,3.  I am stacking like 2, 4, 5, and something else.  Anyway, I get a ship to Tatooine and get dudes to all three of my battleground docking bays.  What did ya think I would do this game?  He is losing like mad from my drains and then I get out Ill Take the Leader too.  He then comes down with Lord Vader to the Tat DB in front of my Raider/Craft.  I barrier and eventually the race completes.  The difference was 11 and there is no point in flipping the Racing shield.  So I lose 6 since my It could Be Worses seem to be eluding me.  He spends 6 to get back 6 and ends his turn.  On my turn, I just drain him for 3 at kessel, 1 at tatooine, 2 at two DBs, then I retrieve one with Virtual Luke and play an Edge for 4 since one of my race destinies was a trackable Terminate.  Mirax refuses to make an appearance so I stare blankly at the extra Artoo In Red 5 in my hand wishing I could be Edging for 6.  But I have to settle for 4 instead and Lukes retrieval text.  I eventually track A Few Maneuvers and finally just kill his Lord Vader and even spread to his Arena for more drains.  He can supply no resistance to my space drains and little if any ground attack.  So I deploy nothing and draw nothing, just force draining him each turn and waiting for him to lose all his life force.  Pretty simple concept, lol.  FW+17
<br/>
<br/>
Im at the top table still so if I can win this I will definetely make the final.  It turns out there are only two undefeateds and we are both playing opposite sides so Jim said it would work out perfect for four gamesdarn, I wanted 6.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  My DS vs. Charles Kerekanich(1787) Standard LSC
<br/>
Sorry, but there wasnt really anything unique about his deck that made it stand out.  It was your basic LSC and it only had one Han Chewie Falcon and 1-2 baraguins.  He starts the Weapon deploying effect and Insurrection/Aim High but no third effect.  My hand is pretty fat, and he is giving me 4 force so I am gonna make the most of it.  I activate 3, Accelerate for the Hovercam(coulda gotten the Ability x3 but its useless the first two-3 turns of the game when they deploy their mains), then activate 5 more.  I drop Tikkes and Aks Moe into the Senate and flip.  I drop the DS:2 DB, Waklemui, the Hovercam, and pull the Drain Blocking PE since my other one was in my force pile.  On his turn I am able to pull the drain +2 PE though.  His turn he drops Jedi Luke and stick to the 3/2 site, pulls H1 DB, and passes to me.  On my turn I activate a killing, I think it was like 13 or something.  I pull a card with Tikkes, drop my drain +2 effect, put a Tie to Coruscant, and draw up for my Lott Dod.  On his turn I flip Battle Order b/c I know he will eventually flip it on me anyway and I am generating a heck of a lot more than him.  He spends 3 to hit me for 3, I lose the useless PE and two other cards.  He then drops Quiggy to the 2/2 site and pulls his stick from reserve along with Naboo DB and he is only able to draw a couple cards.  I activate a dump load, like 16 now, lol.  I drain for 4 at Coruscant and off the top comes Han/Chewie/Falcon, thats nice.  On my turn I drop 2 cards from his hand.  I then drop another system and a Tie along with Lott Dod and Yeb Yeb.  ON his turn he just spends 6 to drain and puts EPP Obi to the Naboo DB.  I dont know why I am giving you such an in depth description of a boring drain race game though.  I put out two more systems with Ties, Lott Dod brings out good Ole Ability x3 and my Political effect is adding to my drains every turn.  Yeb Yeb is burning his cards like none other too.  I squabbel to retrieve 4 and put my Guard in the senate.  One time he puts out a Baraguin  to avoid Ability x3, but it soon starts to take its toll.  In a long and boring drain race, Senate Ties will always win.  I deploy my Squadrons to retrieve 3 also.  I playtested this matchup with a local guy named Frederick and the Senate always wins.  Charles was unfortunate and couldnt get his baraguins to retrieve much though.  I never deployed my EPP Maul the entire game even though he was in my starting hand.  Uneventful drain race and I ended up on top.  FW +14.
<br/>
<br/>
That makes me the only undefeated going into the final duel.  I choose to play my LS against Charles DS even though I have no idea what he is playing.  {Flashback} Last year at the Atlanta DPC I chose to play DS against Rippetoe even though I had already beaten him by 20+ with my LS.  He went on to lay waste to my DS and moved onto the final duel.  Well, Charles reveals DS Combat as his objective and I breathe a sigh of relief.  This is just like game 3 except that Charles started the box.  And second turn he came to Kessel with Zuckus and Super Fett but no 4-Lom.  He battled my Luke and I played Alternatives to Fighting and he cancelled with this Is Some Rescue.  Everyone watching just gasped, Im still not sure why.  Anyway, he plays start your engines to try and get a high destiny to waste luke with but all three cards were low.  So he loses 2 of them and Shuffles his deck with Omni Box and Battles.  He draws a Lord Vader and that was that.  He ran away and I deployed all my raiders and force drained just like I always due.  I won by 27.  Mcclure chose to play LS against Matt Lushs HD and Andy won by 25.  So its me and Andy in the final  1st gets $120 and 2nd gets $60.  Jim Colson wants to leave so he gives us both $90 and then Andy and I agree to play both sides and anti-up $30 each so Jim is clear of his responsibilities and can leave.  First will still get 120 and 2nd 60.  I opt to play LS first against Andy.
<br/>
<br/>
Brief Summary of Game 1 of Final:
<br/>
Andy starts Senate along with Begin Landing Troops, Phantom Menace, and Claw Fish.  On his first turn he flips the grabber shield, throws Orn Free Taa and Lott Dod into the senate to flip.  On my turn I send good Ole Luke to Kessel, and throw out Battle Plan shield and draw a bunch.  He pulls a card with Lott Dod like every turn of the game but just cant find the answers needed to win.  He was my first opponent to finally make a run at space.  I have Virtual Luke at Kessel and Dash at Tatooine.  He drops Kashyyk with Zuckuss and 4-lom.  So on my turn I respond with Wedge in ship to Kashyyk but he Barriers.  On his turn he adds Bossk along with Fett into the Mist Hunter and battles but I alternatives To Fighting b/c I generally disagree with fighting battles in which my opponent draws 5 Destinies.  In fact, most SWCCG people Ive met dont like to fight against 5 destnies either, lol.  He flies both ships to Tatooine in front of lonley Dash.  Obviouslly if he stays at Kahyyk or Kessel Ill drop the Cannon and blow him away.  SO I tunnel Vision for Melas and decide to battle!  Im so bold, arent I?  I lose the Outrider and he loses Fett and 4-Lom.  Wedge flies over to Tatooine.  Lets think of what happened on the ground.  EPP Vader went to the Cantina on Turn 2.  I retaliated with a Projection and he moved outside in front of my Craft.  I have a Raider/Craft at my &lt;&gt;DB and he drops Blizzard 4 there.  I dont think he battled though.  Hes got the Drain Blocking PE and the +3 Destiny Effect out, he is doing a pretty good job of blocking the Kessel drain.  I drain him for two at Kashyyk, he blocks my kessel drain, and then I ping him for one on the ground.  In space, Bossk and Zuckuss keep running from my poor lonely Wedge.  The bounce from kashyyk to Tatooine and back and forth.  On ground he throws down Sidious against my raidre/craft.  A big gate fell down on Sidiouss head and I cant imagaine it feeling very good.  Fallen Portal=good card, especially with destiny 6s.  He is pinging me for 1 and 1 with EPP Vader and Blizzard 4 at different DBs while EPP Maul goes to the Hutt and he also pings me for 1 in the senate.  His ships keep evading Wedge so that he can hold up Battle Plan.  I drop two plain Raiders in front of Blizzard 4 and everyone dies due to his destiny being +3.  A lone Raider/Craft battles EPP Vader and both people die.  Eventually he runs out of senators so he moves Bossk to Kessel and leaves Zuckuss in front of Wedge at Tatooine.  I shoot down Zuckuss but Bossk kills my luke.  I fly Wedge over to Kessel and sit there.  On the ground things have comes to a halt.  I put out a Raider on my empty craft but Thrawn comes out of nowhere and we trade guys again.  I Edged my Luke for 6 and then 5 due to Code Clearance.  That was just before he died to Bossk.  The game ends with his EPP Maul sitting at my &lt;&gt;DB.  I have a Raider/Craft at my Tat.DB and he puts down Arica there.  But my Myers Tech finally comes in handy as I play Ambush from Lost pile to send her away.  I think I put Chewie in the Cantina too.  He hits me with a Limited Resources and my two Its a Hit are nowhere to be foundso I take 4.  The game finally ends though.  FW +13.
<br/>
<br/>
I told Andy that my Mirax eluded me once again and I was forced to settle for less than Satisfactory Edges.  And just yesterday, two days after the tourney, I am looking through my WYS and low and behold there is NO Mirax.  Apparently she got lost during all those Saturday pick-up games.  I played an entire DPC with WYS, 2 Edges, and the Pulsar Skate without a freaking Mirax.  I am an idiotbut apparently it made no difference so I cant wait to see the decks potential with a Mirax actually in it!  LOL, Andy needs a win by 14 to win the tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  Andys LS Senate vs. my DS Senate
<br/>
The epic duel which I knew I would have to play before I even came to Atlanta.  He starts Colo, DTF, and Battle Plan and I start my regular stuff.  Without a time limit, I am free to implement startegy #2 mentioned above.  I NEED to get my Drain +2 effect from my deck though so I put out Orn Free Taa and Lott Dod in the senate on turn 2 to flip and I get my Drain +2 effect out.  I also throw a Tie to Coruscant even though I have no Ghhhk.  He responds on Turn 3 with Palpy and Horox Ryder and I flip my Coward Shield along with the Grabber shield.  He battles and we both lose a senator, Him losing Palpy and my losing Orn.  Not a bad trade but then he plays some gay interrupt that sends both our remaining guys to the used pile.  I go ahead and grab it cuz I dont want to ever see that card played against me, lol.  On my turn, I drain for 3 at Coruscant but he blocks it.  Literally, the next 4-5 turns were spent with him drawing and setting up his hand and me doing the same.  I literally had at least 15-20 cards in my hand.  He is kept to 12 for fear of my pulled Monnok but he gets threepio to the JCC.  The Senate remains unoccupied but my hand is completely set and Grimtassh proof at that.  I have Lott, Tikkes, Toonbuck, Aks Moe, and a guard.  He comes down with Falcon combo to coruscant and battles.  I dont have a Ghhhk and this looks like trouble for meI take the Tie to used Pile and 11 on top of him, ouch.  No worries though, he flies over to waklemui and pays upkeep.  On my turn I just deploy another Tie to Coruscant along with a Dreadnaught.  I am activating 6 a turn and he is getting the same also.  He finally plays a Twix and is deploying cards like The Camp and Goo so that he can draw back up to 12.  He finally makes a move to the senate with Amidala, Valorum, and EPP Luke and I know I gotta move too.  I put another Tie down at Coruscant so I can have a battle destiny in case he comes with Spiral.  The Tie costs 4 and 1 to retrieve 1 so I wait another turn.  After all, whats the rush?  I am taking 0 force loss a turn.  His turn he replenishes his hand back to 12 and drops the Bacta Tank.  On my turn I bring the heat.  Lott Dod for 2, Tikkes for 3, Aks Moe for 2, Guard for 2, Toonbuck for 2, then spend 1 to add to to Lott Dods politics.  He tries to Clash Lott Dod but I use Crush to cancel it.  I battle and reduce Valorums Politics by 3 and have a Power bonus of 3 from the coruscant system.  My power is like 19 to his 11.  Obviouslly I spent 3-4 turns saving force before launching the assault.  He loses all 3 guys and Amidala to the tank.  I cancel his tank and she goes to the lost Pile too.  All I lost was a Toonbuck.  Keep in mind that in all the senate battles I use his DTF for a 2-force swing, and he uses it for a 1-force swing.  It makes a difference in the long run, trust me.  So He comes back down with Palpys and Amidalas at random times and loses the Senator plus 1-3 overflow.  I am sure to save force to use my Guards text.  He even brings down a second Valorum, much to my surprise, but I kill him too.  Begin Landing Your Troops makes me forfeit only one guy for each battle too.  Finally Ive got Orn free taa and the Guard left in the senate.  He comes down with EPP Obi and battles.  His destiny kills my Guard and he It Could Be Worses for 5.  On my turn I am fresh out of senators, so I just drain at coruscant and he blocks with a palpy.  Meanwhile he is paying his upkeep every turn of the game except that one turn when he It Could Be Worsed for 5, but I didnt catch it and neither did he so nothing happened.  In fact, he was very generous as far as paying the upkeep in my like activation-control phase when I reminded him and he paid it on his own most of the time anyway.  So he has the Falcon combo at Waklemui still, Palpy kills my Orn Free Taa and sits alone in the senate, and my Dreadnaught and two ties rule the Coruscant system(the only BG).  I keep spending three to drain 1 and he continually It Could Be Worses for 1 and I cant do anything either.  So I finally drop Kiffex with a Tie since I feel it necessary to win.  He responds with a Spiral and battles to make me lose 1.  I All Power to Weapons and nothing happens.  Earlier I deployed a third tie To Coruscant to retrieve 1 so I move the Dreadnaught with two ties over to Kiffex and leave one tie at Coruscant.  On his turn he runs the Spiral to Coruscant and pays upkeep.  I dont drain b/c I know he will It Could Be worse it.  I drop EPP Maul to the Senate(Andy-I forgot Goo on him so I aplogize), the card had been out so long and only effects one of my dudes so I forgot.  I battle and use his DTF again.  Palpy and Maul die and the card I retrieved for battling was a Tikkes so thats good.  My dreadnaught goes Back to Coruscant with two ties and leaves one tie at Kiffex.  Well Andy has about 6-7 life force left and is putting my cards out of play left and right.  He moves the Falcon to Kiffex and pays its upkeep, but doesnt move the Spiral away cuz he is out of force.  On my turn I add a cannon to my Tie at Kiffex.  Check the only card ni my reserve and its a 4 so Im set to go.  I drop my Tikkes to the Senate!  Battle and shoot down his falcon alonig with using his DTF again.  Then battle at Coruscant and use his DTF.  However I have no destiny and neither does he so he loses Spiral and like 3-4.  I move Tikkes into the JCC to give Threepio some company and that is that.  On his turn he draws up.  FW by 18.
