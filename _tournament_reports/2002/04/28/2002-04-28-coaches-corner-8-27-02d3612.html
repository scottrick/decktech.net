<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The tournament was held a Coaches Corner in St. Anthony Minnessota at Apache Plaza. The Plaza does look a little run down and has few stores there, but it works ok for SWCCG tournaments. 21 people showed up for the tournament. 
<br/>
<br/>
Now on to the games 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Dann Albright 
<br/>
<br/>
my Throne Room Main vs. his Hunt Down 
<br/>
<br/>
I start the game with a decent hand, but nothing great. I activate 4 force, search for Threepio with His parts showing and get him to the Throne Room and draw the rest. 
<br/>
During his turn I start the race. While he starts getting out sites. For a while after that, he is just getting sites out and deploying some characters to the CC: Docking Bay and Podrace Arena. I get my sites out and start saving up for my Beat Down (as I have a few EPP’s in my hand). I later win the race, but thanks to CHYBC I retrieve nothing. He however looses 6 force. We are both loosing 1 a turn to Visage and I am loosing a couple to his drains. I decide the time is right to strike, so I deploy to the Theed Palace Generator with EPP HAN, EPP OBI, EPP Luke and Twas Khaa. Then the next turn I Narun Leids them to the Arena, and battle his characters. (Guri, Dr. E &amp; Ponda Baba and 1-2 others)
<br/>
<br/>
I clear out the site, but Obi dies. His turn he gets Maul with Saber to the Generator. After that it’s me loosing 3 a turn to drains, and him loosing only 1 to drains, and we are both loosing to visage. I wind up loosing by 1.

Game 2 vs. Anthony Lawrence 
<br/>
<br/>
My TIE’s vs his Light Saber combat(LSC)
<br/>
<br/>
Before the game starts, he says he needs to complete his deck, as it’s short 10 cards. So we eventually get started. He is using a deck he has not played before. That helps me a little. I have no ground and he has little space. So he sets up at the Generator and Generator Core, and drians me for 2-3 at each every turn. I set up at Endor, Naboo, Sullust, Kashyyyk, Kiffex and Rendili, with nothing at Wakeemauli. He later comes to space with Tantive IV and RL in R1. I Lateral Damage the Tantive IV and Shoot down the RL in R1 with my TIE Cannon. Leaving him with a power 0 forfeit 0 Tantive IV. but as he has Lando, Scoundrel on the Tantive IV, he is able to get 2 destiny a 7 and a 4. 
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that battle, we just drain each other, until the TD calls time. I get a TW.

Game 4 vs. Daniel Czech 
<br/>
<br/>
My TIE’s vs his Tatooine Racing deck. 
<br/>
<br/>
He has almost no space in his deck and only 4 ground sites. So I get out my systems and deploy my TIE’s to them. He sets up on the ground with his characters. Other than the race, which I win, we just drain each other. I wind up winning 
<br/>

FW 3(+???)

Game 5 vs. Joel Cooper 
<br/>
<br/>
TIE’s vs. EBO 
<br/>
<br/>
He gets out his Hoth sites and deploys Rebel Troopers to them. He then sets up Echo Base operations and starts deploying systems and X-wings. We are both Deploying systems and X- wings or TIE’s,  but he is draining for more. I batlle his x-wings, but never manage to win that many space battles. With his drains, and the fact that I can’t seem to kill off his X-wings, he winds up winning by 30.

<br/>
Throne Room Mains vs. SYCFA.
<br/>
<br/>
This was an interesting game. Hes stsrts setting up guys at the DS, and gets ready to blow up Alderan, while I save up and get my Beat Down aquad reay. I winn the race, he gets the DS to Alderan. Blows it up and flips. He then gets out 2 of his systems and some Star Destroyers. he moves guy from the DS: Docking bay to a SStar Destroyer, leaving only 2 Death Star Gunners and a srub there. My Turn I deploy my massive beat down sqaud and battle. Luke kills his scrub, and Dengar with gun (the evil scrub) starts blasting away and misses. He has a power 6 plus 1 desting, then winds up with power 10 (after the destiny) I play Gift of the Mentor to add 2 destiny, then draw my 5 destiny. I wnd up with a power 45 to his 10. He looses his 3 guys and 28 more! After that we drain each other for a while, but I end up beating him by 32!
