<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">What follows is a directors report from the 2002 Yavin IV Regional held on April 20,2002 at C&amp;B Cards and Comics in Oxford, North Carolina. The event had 29 attendees from 4 different states; one  from Maryland, one from South Carolina, three from Virginia and twenty four from North Carolina. The judging staff included-Jeffrey Cook II (MD, Bravo 55), Richard Thompson  (NC, Bravo 58), Elissa Hilton (NC, RoR), Don Weinstein (NC, RoR) and myself, Patrick Hines (NC, Bravo 42).

<br/>
Before I continue this report, I would like to thank Jeff, Rich, Elissa and Don for coming out to help and make things run smoothly.  special thanks to Jeff and Rich for working the floor (scoresheets and rulings) for me cause I was a bit under the weather for the day.  Finally, thanks to Charles Deese, store owner, for providing an excellent gaming venue and continuing to support this game we all love to play called SWCCG.
<br/>
<br/>
Considering the tough breaks that SWCCG has had, I think we had a good turnout. Yavin IV is big region with some fairly large travel distances so don’t let the low figures from the other states discourage you.  From the extremely high level of game play and the excitement of the players that I saw, those of you in other regions shouldn’t think twice about making the trip and playing in your own regional.  I think the figures from NC can give you some perspective. On the NC side of things our turnout was 24 down from the 37 we had at states a year ago.  So you could say weve got a majority of NC players who continue to enjoy and play this game.

I’m sure the questions on many of the players minds is -What Decks Were They Playing?-. Contrary to popular belief, not everyone was playing lightsaber combat. In fact amongst the top four players only one had a LS Combat deck. It was a Dark Side Deck and it wasn’t played by the overall winner. To be fair to the players who may be travelling this summer, Ill leave the posting of the EXACT decks up to them, many will be posting reports on the various boards so you’ll have to check there for any more -inside information-. So I dont get too many e-mails, Ill let you in on what the top 4 played (objective wise) so you can draw some of your own conclusions. These are in no specific order! Light Side: HB, QMC, No Objective, QMC. Dark Side: Senate, Hoth, ISB, LS Combat.  Overall, the decks were as follows: Light Side:  Agents (1), Gungans (2), HB (5), HOTH (1), LS COMBAT (5), QMC (6), RST (1), RTP (1), SENATE (1),  WDHAP (1),  WYS(4) and one without an Objective. Dark Side: BHBM (1). COURT (2),  DS II (1),  HOTH (3),  INVASION (1),  ISB (2), LS COMBAT (8), MKOS (2),  OPS (1),  SENATE (3), SYCFA (1), TDIGWATT (2), WATTO (2).  If you are travelling this summer, I think the key to success will be balance and the ability to battle. As I mentioned earlier, if you want to know more, youll have to scout the various sources for tournament reports as the week progresses.
<br/>
<br/>
Another question on your minds, Were people using virtual cards?. The answer is yes, they were used to enhance and improve many old strategies. Most of the HB decks had copies of virtual Luke and some Gold 1. Of the virtual cards currently available, only the Fusion Generator Supply Tanks (V) were not used. All the rest saw plenty of action.

<br/>

To determine the champion of the region we held a no time limits two man playoff between Kevin Elia and  Steven Turner. After two fierce games of play, Stephen Turner from Virgina proved his worth with a record of 4(32) in a two game playoff.
<br/>
<br/>
