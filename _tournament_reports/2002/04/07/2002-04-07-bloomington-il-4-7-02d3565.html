<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">My day started off by going to mass(considering it was a sunday.) after mass i went to an aunts house where i remembered about the tournament. 
<br/>
<br/>
As i got to the store where the tournament was going to be held i got my cards ready for the tournament. Then a freind of my asked me if i wanted to practice play with a freindly game. 
<br/>
<br/>
     Round 1
<br/>
  This round started off with around from luck because i had my qui gon and freinds in hand. i put qui gon down with his light saber. Then the opponets turn he lays down vader and stick with dr. E and ponda baba he instates the batle swings at qui gon. qui gon hit the Dr. E took over on the surgery end. Then i just was tiered of watching a force draind so i lay down a whole lot of senators and i ran out of force. My opponet lays down maul and his saber. Maul swing hits one senator dr.e comits surgery. Maul swings again hit on more senator dr.e commits to surgery. then vader swings hit my last senator no surgery. opponet draws destiny and get a total power of 27 to my power of 1. so i had to pay 26. the rest of the game i let myself get force drained to death.
<br/>
<br/>
      Round 2
<br/>
  I was playin against a weird senat that force drained me alot. i attack once lost. i attacked for the last time losed. so i just kept deploying stuff at the auidence chamber. I lost to the force drain of 8.

It was against a Sabacc deck that sits there and force me to lose cards out the butt and to lose stuff fromout of commision but i had a slite advantage i was immunded to gunaatay. After the whole hour long game Sabacc Owned me or 5484(( () // //5 J (|) ()
