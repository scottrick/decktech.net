<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I know this is extremely late but I found it on my computer and I read it and it was cool, so here it is. 
<br/>
This is a TR from Friday 10/26.
<br/>
<br/>
The Tourney was an EP1 and I knew what to play. I had gone to one last weekend and I had seen the major deck types that beat me, so I was ready to go. When I got there with Martin, only 7 people were there, so we had to make up an extra person to get sactioned. My decks are 
<br/>
Light: Hyperdrive racing coolness
<br/>
Dark: Senate Coolness
<br/>
<br/>
First Game: My Light vs. John Irving Senate (1501)
<br/>
I start Brisky Morning Machine as my effect and he starts the Phantom Menace. Well, he gets the AWESOME start with Maul to his hut and Lott and Passel in the senate to flip. On my turn I only have Valorum in hand and nothing to back him up, so I just draw up some. On his turn he gets some more stuff set up, and we race more. I am getting way ahead of him in the race, so that is good. On my turn, I drop Valorum (holding Stay Here, Where It’s Safe in hand) into the Watto place and Qui-Gon from reserve next door. On his turn he drains of one and we race more. He just keeps getting more and more dudes in the senate. I drain and he stacks one. I can’t really remember what is happening, but I just keep draining and owning him. After the race is over (which I win) he gets some guys to the sites and chases me around. He has dropped I did it! from my hand so I look for that. I have Qui-gon going around with Amidala and a Handmaiden blocking drains. He finally gets the courage to battle me and I lose Amidala and the handmaiden, who goes back to my hand. I get more guys out everywhere and own him. FW by 20
<br/>
2 (+20)
<br/>
Highs: Ownage
<br/>
Lows: None
<br/>

So I think, hey that’s a pretty good start to the tourney. Luckily Brad wins by 43 so I won’t be playing him. He had won like 7 EP1 tourneys before this so hes like number 1 or 2 in the world in EP1. So I get paired up with John again and get ready to own.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs. John’s LS
<br/>
First turn I get an awesome start, like John’s. I get Maul to the site first turn and I get Lott and Porn Frito in the senate first turn. There is no racing this game, so believe I move Maul to Watto’s place. On his turn he drops Naboo system and a c0ck to it. On my turn I drain of two, deploy a nemoidan from reserve to the Watto hut, and draw up. He drains of two and draws some. I drain for a couple, and drop like Maul’s stick on him. The next couple of turns he drops some guys to the outskirts, and moves them to the chamber to fight. I drop more Nemoidans, P-60 and Tikkes and battle. I play Maul Strikes for 2 more destinies, I hit Qui-Gon, and play No Civility, Only Politics for 4 destinies. I draw high for destiny and he loses everyone. On his turn he drops Phylo to Watto’s hut and moves her to Maul’s hut to drain. I drop P-59 on her @#$% and battle. I miss her, but I draw a 9 for destiny via the stuff o’clock political effect (i forgot its name) and he draw a three I believe. That’s her and a couple more. I just keep draining him and he bends over and dies. FW by 23.
<br/>
2 (+43)
<br/>
Highs: Ownage again
<br/>
Lows: nothing
<br/>
<br/>
The last two games I have given John an extra point of differential each for being cool and drawing up for me, so I should really be 2 (+45) but it doesn’t matter...yet.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: My LS vs. Patrick Irving Senate Naboo Destroyer Droids(1500) 
<br/>
I race and he starts that other dude as his racer (Teemto Pagalies) and his effect is The Phantom Menace I believe. I win the race by Stepping every destiny he drew the first 3 turns. I get Qui-Gon and Yarua to the Watto hut and Obi+someone else to the Outskirts, so he’s losing to drains and stackage. I win the race and 5 of the 6 cards he loses are destroyer droids, which superly sucks for him. Many of the cards he stacks are also destroyer droids. He gets Kedar the Black to the Junkyard, but he still has to stack cards. Meanwhile, he is getting destroyer droids on Naboo and I am just Jar-Jar bombing them away every turn. 3 of the 4 destinies I drew for it were We Wish to Board At Once and I wasn’t tracking it. Not that that’s a bad thing, it’s just weird. So he keeps losing to my drains and I lose a couple from his so I stay on top. FW by 36.
<br/>
6 (+79)
<br/>
Highs: Ownage
<br/>
Lows: None
<br/>
<br/>
Now that I’m 3-0, I know I have to play Brad next game. Before the game we have an argument of where to sit...my lucky table (that I’ve sat at all of the tourney) or his table. I refuse to go over with there so Brad comes to mine, and he is pissed. He is like now I have an excuse to beat your ass. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS vs. Brad Reinhold Hyperdrive (1700-ish)
<br/>
This game was totally gay for me. I don’t think I got Maul out early, so I couldn’t do any damage. Early he got Palpy to the senate. On my turn, I drop Lotti and random other senate scrub. I battle and Payroll Palpy, so it’s 0 to like a lot and he loses 7 overflow and I lose the scrub. On his turn he drops Yarua and Valorum and kills me back. He wins the race and just drops a bunch of guys and drains me. I come down with another senate beating and he just loses his guys. He just out-everythings me to win by 31.
<br/>
6 (+48)
<br/>
Highs: Beating him down in the senate.
<br/>
Lows: HIS DECK NEVER RUNS OUT OF CARDS!!!!
<br/>
I beat on him a couple times and he still wins by 31. HOW?!?!?! Anyway, he wins the tourney with me in second place. Brad chooses the Qui-Gon, cuz he’s already got like 7 Mauls and Mike Merletto gets the random Maul. We get some random prizes and I get this Han dude that would prove useful the next day. After the tourney we hang out at Martin’s house and modify his super awesome and super secret DS. 
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that was a cool tourney. I forget the props and slops.
