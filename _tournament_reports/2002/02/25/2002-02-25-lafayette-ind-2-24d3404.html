<br/>
After my wife and I got separated, I find my self in Indiana.  After looking for awhile for game shops I find a tourney in Lafayette, an hour drive away from me.  Great, but after looking at Dechtech for reports I cant find any recent constructed tourneys the only one I find is for a sealed deck.  After looking for a couple days I get connected with Brian Fred by chatting online.  Find out a few things about the game scene around here and managed to meet him at a game store to play test and chat with.  So get to the store and introduce myself and play my old ral ops deck bunch of 2/2 guys, atst, tramples ect. While playing this dude comes up to us and kicks us out for a dude saying what an @#$% draw what the hell is that?  So we go to this one dudes apartment place and I find out how bad my light side was.  I cant build ls or play one for that matter to save my life.  Also, I find out how brutal light side light saber combat is to hunt down.  So the day before the tourney I go to brain Freds apartment and we talk tech and about some dude he built decks for named Steve Brenston.  We talked for a while, and we got around to playing decks. My Hunt down was pretty solid but he recommended a few changes.  So we swapped a few cards out and then played my light side profit.  After 3 turns my profit was smacked upside the head by this hit and fade BHBM deck.  Damn thing was scarry!  So we tore apart my light side deck and rebuild if for podracing and took out 10 characters I originally had about 30 in.  Playtest some more and it did ok not great, but was a whole lot better then it was.  Kurt came in and I played him and we talked some and then we went out at 2 AM to pick up Tony, and went for some drinks and munchies.  And we did a mass trade session and built Tonys deck and we play test my Hunt Down to his hidden base ships and mains.  Fourth turn or so I made a later found out bad call had Tat. Maul, his double lightsaber, maul strikes, and Mauls ship.  So what did I do? I battled his epp Quigley and caused some overflow but went on to lose because of not paying attention to what shields I should use. Then Brian and Tony played for a while while I watched them seeing what tactics and game play they did. I begin to nod off  its about 6 am now and woke up to Tony loud b!tching and cussing about how many barriers Brain is playing.  Damn son, I was think play some Its a hit or something like that.  So Tony calms down and they pull out some wresting on the SNES and I curl up in a chair to get 2-21/2 hours sleep.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we go and we pull in to Mickey Ds so that Tony can get a steak bagel and coffee.  Theres about 6-8 packs of sugar and 2 creamers and hes a little upset with me over him not getting more sugar? So we have about 10 show up.  I playing Huntdown no dueling after much thought to Jedis Restiance and Run Luke Run.  My Light is Profit pod race.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game one
<br/>
Steve Horton WYS vs my Huntdown
<br/>
<br/>
WYS great Brian played this deck against my last night and tore me up with it.  I dont have muck experience about playing against WYS.  Had A great opening hand epp Vader, Mara, Emperor, a few interrupts.  So Vader goes to the cantina first turn and is backed up by Mara second turn.  I get in some rounds of drains and am piling people at the cantina.  Steve is playing real cautious and brings out some smugglers enough to flip 4th turn or so.  So I move Emperor Palpy, and janus to docking bay 94 and leave vader  at the cantina.  Steve drops 3 smugglers to the cantina and We clear the site.  I redeployed DVDLOTS and saber to Mos espa docking bay.  Steve has a couple xwing smugglers at Tatooine and kessal by now and is draining for about 5 a turn.  I decided to play Tat. Maul and his ship to kessal to slow the bleeding a little and try to clear Steve of his sites.  We play cat and mouse for a while and he drops chewie and a couple smugglers against DVDLOTS I a suicide move.  I was too happy to comply and won the battle and drained him out for the win by 19
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(19)
<br/>
Highs: 1st turn Vader, good draws, and beating WYS
<br/>
Lows: none really good game lots of battles.
<br/>
<br/>
So next turn I play Tony, one of the guys I play tested with.  GREAT he knows much about my deck and I havent seen his dark deck. 
<br/>
<br/>
Tonys Lightsaber combat and my pod profit.
<br/>
<br/>
So I start my stuff and Tony plops down Selbubas Podracer. Oh great nice destiny in pod profit and I didnt put in any A Step Backwards. Oh crap well looks like I wont play racing this game.  Get a decent opening hand and get Quigley stick with GOTM.  And plop Quiddley down vs Emperor second turn.  I decided to try and inflict some damage to Tony quickly and try to apply pressure.  I miss the lightsaber draw and keep Quigley there.  He sets up his destiny and combats me and I lose Quigley and Jedi Restiance him so save a card for beats later.  So I try and free han and I do but I miscounted where Quid leys Lightsaber was so I kept his light saber buried.  Oh great! A few more small battles here and there he clears my audience chamber for good since my hans all went to the lost pile by me topdecking them to forcedrains.  SWELL.   Tony brings the beats to my characters and make him lose maul I win the battle by 11 overflow and play advantage on Corran Horn.  So he doesnt like to take 2 during his move phase so he brings down epp maul again and hits Corran Horn and another guy and he lose like 9 this time around.  Im depleted at this time and he drains me out for the win. By like 13
<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(06)
<br/>
<br/>
So next pairings are announced
<br/>
<br/>
Shawn We have a plan Episode 1 98% ls deck vs my Huntdown
<br/>
<br/>
So I spend a few minutes reading it since I dont have any theed.  Hmm ok odd deck design. Almost no other cards than the ones out of Tatooine, courscant and theed.  I spend the next few turns drawing up Vader and his saber.  I deploy DVDLOTS and his saber to the theed throne room and take control of it he drops obi wan and saber to vaders site battles and tries to swing at Vader.  I play Force field. He he. I miss obi with my swing and he draws a 4 for attrition.  Obi stays.  Next turn I drop broken Fett and battle miss again with my saber. He also misses and I draw 13 attrition.  His turn he drops queen amidala and a few scubs to vaders site and I swing at a scub who prevent me from using weapons at amidala.  So I choke her with an blind destiny and success I draw a 5.  He loses quite a few and I drain him out for the win.  By 23 I think
<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(29)
<br/>
<br/>
Next turn I have to play Brian Fred.  Great hes made my deck and knows how to beat it.  
<br/>
<br/>
My pod profit vs his broken senate deck.
<br/>
<br/>
I try and win the race fairly early but he drops secret plans and chybc shields  Brian keep s drawing for the next 6 turns and finally flips his senate deck Im just waiting to deploy to his site so that I can retrieve cards.  I just decided to free han and then he brings epp maul to my audience chamber where I have 6 characters and he clears the site in one turn with just maul.  Just sick destiny he has.  I play a couple characters to his endor back door and he drops another epp maul and bends me over.  I lose quite a bit and he drains me out by 17 I think
<br/>
<br/>
FL 4 (12)
<br/>
<br/>
I play Rich whom Brain says later is a 1800 player that quit star wars some time ago Hes playing some old school decks. In fact he doesnt have a clue to what most of my cards do.  The latest card I see in his deck is prepared defenses. He goes on to finish 0-6 records.  I fell sorry for him, but I was not playing for awhile but I tried to keep up with card texts as much as I could.
<br/>
<br/>
His ls obis hut toche station start. My hunt down
<br/>
<br/>
I cant believe this I havent seen this deck for awhile.  I get out some docking bays for force generating and draw up getting maul, double saber, and maul strikes.  He plays ben and gives him his saber and it my turn I drop maul his stick to toche station and move him over.  He drops han I think battles swings but I force field it.  I hit both and he draws a 1 for destiny. So I have maul with double saber draining for 5 the rest of the game.  P finally draw vader by like turn 6 and he goes to the toche station.  I bak vader up with Emperor and janus and begin trying to stuff as many cards as I can back in my life force.  
<br/>
I drain him out by like 27 or so
<br/>
<br/>
FW 6(38ish)
<br/>
<br/>
So theres some confusion for a few minutes most play the same guy but different sides.
<br/>
<br/>
My pod profit vs his SYCFA with mains and force drain +1 locations.
<br/>
<br/>
I cant really remember much of this the long day, me only getting 2 hors sleep has got my mind turned to clay.  He stacks all of his guys at one site and is draining me for 3.  I draw some and then start the podrace and begin to spread on tatooine and hit him for 5-6 per turn. He then elises his guys to ben and lukes site.  I dont have GOTM in hand so he get me for 15 overflow.  I win the race so that helps some.  Play I did it to retrive more and barely manages to win by 7
<br/>
<br/>
FW 8(40 something)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I fel great after that!  The winners are announced and I came in 4th after not playing in a tiurney for about 7 months.  Got Nute Gunray in my pack of theed and drop off  Tony and Brain to their respective houses.
