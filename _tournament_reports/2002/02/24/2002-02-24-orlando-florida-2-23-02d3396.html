<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, so the draft starts. It&amp;#8217;s a fun tourney, so no one is really keeping their pulls a secret. The guy next to me is getting the best fricking pulls in the entire world. He had at least 2 obis, 2 qui gons, a lando, the falcon combo, and a chewie. Not to mention a ton of other good stuff. Anyway I got a few ok pulls, and managed to get enough for the objective, and the starting effect so I could play some shields. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get that damn maul though! I drafted six shields I think. Anyway here&amp;#8217;s my deck.

Ok honestly I can hardly remember the tournament, but anyway&amp;#8230;
<br/>
<br/>
The first game went something like this&amp;#8230; I think. I was playing this guy. Uhhhh. Damn I must have been wasted or something. Anyway he ended up beating me by 20 something. I couldn&amp;#8217;t get out any good characters and he had too many good guys out. This game must have really sucked
<br/>
<br/>
The second game was cool. This is the guy that got the god pack pulls, with all of the obis, and quiggys. He starts the CC:Casino. We spend a couple of turns drawing and saving force. The third turn in, I plop down a TON of guys at the casino. Some random useless guys, tarkin, trooper garrison, Jabba, and the prophetess. Then I put presence of the force on it. He looks down and just says damn! I start draining for 4 force each turn there. Two from his icons, 1 from garrison, 1 from presence. He gets upset. He puts down the han chewie falcon combo on Bespin. I totally forgot to make him pay each turn. I also puts down Quiggy and some backup at another CC site. This is where my memory totally goes blank. I think that I tried to kick him off of cloud city or something. Anyway the end result was I left the casino not defended enough. He took advantage and killed just about every one of my characters. From there drains led him to victory, but not by much because of the nice early drain I had. Lost by 2 somehow.
<br/>
<br/>
The third game sucked. This is the guy who ended up winning the tourney. He had a damn effective method of retrieving. He somehow managed to pull not only the jedi council chamber which he started, but also yoda MotF. Anyway I sat on Naboo and drained while he put Baragwins or whatever those things that retrieve weapons/vehicles are at the chamber. He also put down Figrin. I would drain him for two, which he would retrieve next turn with his guys. It was slow as hell until he brought Qui-gon, his saber, and some backup to cut up my guys. Fett and his buddies tried to hold them off, but they too fell beneath the whirling blade. I did have the satisfaction of killing qui-gon once, but he came back after a few turns due to excellent tracking, and Figgy. He eventually put down the lars farm, a sandspeeder, and a pilot . He drained me there for two I think. I forget why. After a while I kicked Quigon off of naboo again, and got to drain a little. Unfortunately he was still retrieving. In the end, I just did one final drain and drew up so he wouldn&amp;#8217;t retrieve anymore.
<br/>
Lost by 20 something.
<br/>
<br/>
--Now comes the final round the dark side has yet to win a game. Dark side is sucking ass. For my last round I get to play the guy with the good pulls again. Same start with the casino.&amp;#8212;
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth round was nice. I got the crappiest draws in the entire world. I had every single one of my useless characters in my hand, and not a single good one. Anyway I played the Y4 Jungle with the forest next to it. I stuck the Luke Seeker on naboo. I loaded up the forest with 5 useless characters or so, and stuck presence of the force on it. I had a safe drain for two. He should have gone on CC or Naboo, and drained but he didn&amp;#8217;t. He started to get sick of my drain, so he put some guys on CC to drain, and Lando on the jungle. He fell for my trap J. I put the dragon snake on he jungle and laughed in his face. Snake attacks destiny = 3. Not eaten. Damnit. I needed a four to kill him. I continued to drain, while lando sat there. He put qui-gon on the forest and took out a guy with battle damage. I put down a Garrison, and Fett and took quiggy out. Every turn I would attempt to take out lando, but I kept getting damn threes when I needed a four. He put down some support for lando. I tracked a six. I randomly selected a guy. Yay lando. Destiny draw. THREE!!! What the hell? I was pissed off at this point. He didn&amp;#8217;t have much life force left, but was still draining me. Boom. Battle Order shield out. No more drains. :-P. In a last ditch attempt, he sent lando and backup over to the forest. They all died, and I kept my guys due to my immunity at the forest. Drained for the last few turns and I won! My last brilliant move was to leave 1 force in my deck, and play Uncertain is the future. I put about 7 cards back (A bunch of sixes) and drew 1. Ended up winning by twelve or so.
<br/>
<br/>
(Anyway the tourney was a blast. I was way in the negatives, but I ended up winning the dark side division, because no other dark decks won a game. I got a masterful move foil for my prize. Not too shabby. Anyway sorry about the lack of details, but I was really tired.)
