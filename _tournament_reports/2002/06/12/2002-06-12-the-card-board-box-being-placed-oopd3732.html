<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Sad to say, one of the gaming stores is going to close. We still have 2 others within 20 or so miles so we’ll be alright, though. Our TD found a great deal on some cards (i think he said K-Mart, but he mentioned 2 placers where good deals were to be found, and I know Big-K was 1 of them). He bought enough cards to hold a booster draft for for a tad bit over 10-12 dollars. He couldnt pass up on a deal like that and figured they were Ref 3 and the old store is closing he decided of a nostalgia draft. We only got players for 3 games but we played about 4 hours after the tourney just for $hit &amp; Giggles; Old times sake ya know, so it was a last. I guess I could get on to the games cause this is my first repost. Hope you find it 1/2 as fun reading as I had playing.

<br/>
The highlights of my pulls...nothing fantastic in the foils, a See Threepio and Japanese Rebel Speeder were the only two to go in the deck. My best single card was undoubtedly Corran Horn, though the real power houses were Mirax/Pulsar Skate, Red 7 and matching pilot, and Gold 6 with matching pilot. Of course, the Kessel didnt hurt either.

Game 1 versus Andrew 1824...?
<br/>
Andrew is a very technical player who has been with the game from the beginning (or at least as long as I can remember) 
<br/>
Jamie started Jabbas Palace Audience Chamber versus my Yavin 4 Command Room. Jamie Pulls Xizor first turn and deploys him. I draw up my first turn, and get the unthinkable combo, second turn I drop Tosche Station (my only Tat. site), deploy my foil See Threepio (my only droid), move him to Audience Chamber and use A Gift. This would put an obvious kink in any sealed deck, and it served to do so for Jamie. A Bothan Spy sets up a group of weenies at the Wampa Cave, and the burn really is turned up in space, where I was burning him for 1 at Rendili and 3 at Kessel by mid game. I suffered some beatdown at the Wampa Cave eventually, but this also would keep most of his good characters stuck there for the remainder of the game. Projection of a Skywalker saves me from draining to death at my Command Room, and I out drain for a 2 card win.

Game 2 versus  Andrew Larkin TD 1710’s
<br/>
Andrew had some great power cards, Arica, Dark Jedi Lightsaber, Vader with Saber foil, The Emperor, but was light in space. Much the same as the first game, I started my Command Room versus his Death Star Command Room, which would soon be invaded by the Bothan Spy Scrub Squad. This forces Vader/Saber and some scrubs for potential beatdown, but one character survives, and the next turn I drop two more scrubs and initiate, gaining a second destiny draw from the sites game text, and drawing a total battle of 9- destiny wiping out his whole force, and losing mine in the crossfire. By this point I had controlled space once again, burning for three at Kessel and one somewhere else, and Projection of a Skywalker saved me again, countering the drain bonus of the Dark Jedi Lightsaber wielded by Arica at my Command Room. I squeak out a 1 card win, and the satisfaction of killing Vader with 3 non unique aliens and the pilot of Red 7.

Game 3 versus Brad 1540’s
<br/>
Sadly, the last of the three game series. Brad is a relatively new player of SWCCG who has attacked the game aggresively and has become decent. Unfortunately, Brad got very unlucky location draws. Forced to start Besbin, Cloud City versus my Command Room. No other locations would be deployed for the remainder of the game. Both of us save and draw for a couple of turns, and I finally drop Mirax, Corran and Pulsar Skate, followed by No Questions Asked, giving me the unbelievable 6 power 6 manuever Skate, immune to attrition less than 7! Brad was completely geared for ground pounding, but with no battle ground sites available (and apparently no spies) he was forced to waste his ground crew in forfeit fodder at Cloud CityAfter knowing how graerd for the A$$ RAPING I would take on the ground I didnt want to lay any ground. Getting out Red 7 and matching pilot let me add one destiny to power, and Gold 6 with matching pilot sealed the deal. Slowly, I overpowered him at the City, and won by a whopping 7, bringing me up to a big +10 differential. Much lamentations, after seeing some of the cards in Brads hand, I would have been extra dead if I would have tried my Bothan Spy Scrub Squad anywhere. Eventhough I could have came out with a slightly higher dif. if I had I thought the possible beatdown would end the game but i knew the possible smacketh could kill me, knocking me out of 1st which I knew I had locked as long as won this.
