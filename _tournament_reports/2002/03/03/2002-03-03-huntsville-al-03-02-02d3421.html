<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well the day was good for me went to the army base to check out my future occupation. I was planing this turney for like a week but had no ideai what to play at all. so the night before i am playing counter strike and playing with my cards. 
<br/>
<br/>
I find that my dark is build the death star becaus eni fugure that everybody is meta for andys Ls senate and well i hpoed to catch him off gauard with this deck and with the shiedlds sac had no chance at all with my imperal commands.
<br/>
<br/>
My Ls on the other had was just old school. X-wings Hb flip 
<br/>

<br/>
First game My Ds Vs Andys senator epp maddness.
<br/>
I was hoping for this match up but i hated it because well I played a game aginst some random guys ebo and well won by like 14 and well i though  this would be tought. We both start out with madd activation and well the game was my ds built the 4th turn and. i drop excutor and thrawn. with peitt and with moff jerdin and the ds2 db and well the game was slow. the death star was doing 3 damage a turn until honnor hit the ground and well that was it his epps would take the endor db and his sprial packed with like 3 charaters and my destinys being only one huet thanks to that gay senator and well the game took for ever.
