<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Allright here is the report from Outpost 2000 5 people showed up for this tourney.  crappy turnout, but oh well.  Raveling was there as well as Peter Jacobson, so some good players in attendence.  I went with TR Racing for light, the same LS that I’ve been playing for about 3 months, and a new DS that I threw together and will post after this TR.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS vs. Derek and his TR Mains LS with Gungan Activation Platform.  this was an interesting deck he used Boss Nass and 2 other gungans (I forgot one of them but the other was Rep Been) to activate like 8 force from Boss Nass’s chambers and then he was using Hit and run guys with sabers, since he never drained all I did was load up my Back Door with mains and toys and battle him endlessly, in the end my guys stood up better than his since I had lots more.  FW by about 25
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my DS vs. Mike Raveling and his Senate control deck that rapes TR mains.  Yeah we’ve played this game before, it sucks, there is very little interaction, but his mad high destiny and my crappy draws made it a shorter game than neccesary.  FL by about 20
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Bye
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 my DS vs. Raveling and his EBO.  This was a really fun game, I got my 2 drain 2 sites at endor going and dropped Chimera with Guri Thrawn and Dengar to his space, I just kept draining and following him around while he drained and retrieved with his Baragwins and Virtual Luke at a system, I started dropping my guys to hoth to maximize my drains, and just kept plinking when I lost Zuckuss and about 15 to a battle I thouhgt that was game since that made it so I couldn’t afford Executor, but i kept moving guys into Hoth sites and cancelled EBO late, plus Vader with stick beat on Figgy and an ishi Tib for a few force.  my steady drains finally did him in FW by 4.  This was probably the funnest game I’ve played in a while and Mikes cold clammy handshake was fun to exchange.  Great Game Mike.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 my LS vs. Derek and his Watto.  I had EPP quigon and EPP obi in my opening hand and 2 copies of OOC/TT so I knew this would be a good game.  He started slow and I didn’t when he finally dropped guys I beat them down for a lot of force, and the game ended soon after the podrace.  FW by about 40.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my DS vs. Peter and his MWYHL test to 6.  THis game was over quickly, he made the same mistake that Derek did in trying to attack me at the back door when I had stacked all my guys there (it was the only battleground), but just to rub salt into him I tracked a 0 and overloaded Luke in the middle of his training, killing any hope Peter had.  FW by about 30.
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 5-1 and win the tourney since Mike had a Timed win.  I got the foil LS sense, and was happy
