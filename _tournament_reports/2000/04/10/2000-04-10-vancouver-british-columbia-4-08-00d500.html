<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It's been two days since the BC Provincial Championship, and so
<br/>
I figured I might as well write my first Tournament report.
<br/>
<br/>
About 2 months or so before this Tournament, I told myself
<br/>
'I am going to win this tournament.  I'm gonna be the Provincial
<br/>
Champion'.  Cocky words, but I felt the feat was doable.  I placed
<br/>
7th in last years regional, and 4th in the year before that,
<br/>
so I figured my time was due :) 
<br/>
<br/>
Back then, I'd already figured out my Dark deck.  Rops all
<br/>
the way, it's been my favorite deck for over a year.  I've
<br/>
tried probably every variation of the thing you can imagine,
<br/>
and have been successful with them all.  Troopers, Bikers 
<br/>
Scouts, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, lots of imperials, draining versions,
<br/>
beating versions, numbers, and more.  AT-ST's are definitely
<br/>
the best version, providing power, reacting, decent deploy,
<br/>
and protection from weapons, so AT-ST's it would be.  I toyed
<br/>
with massive high destiny Hunt Down decks for awhile,
<br/>
but in my opinion, Hunt Down is too fragile.  When things
<br/>
begin to go wrong, it always seems like they just keep going
<br/>
wrong...  Although, things don't go wrong often.
<br/>
<br/>
Light was a complete different story.  I KNEW Id be going
<br/>
mains... Mains is my style.  Lots of mains.  high destiny.
<br/>
Beating.  The good stuff :)  So I fooled around with my
<br/>
here's Ben deck, posted on decktech...  but truthfully,
<br/>
and I knew it at the time, that deck is not worthy to win
<br/>
a Championship.  A strong deck, but it was overly
<br/>
designed to deal with the new bounty hunters with lots
<br/>
of put that downs and blaster deflections.  So then I began
<br/>
to fool around with a profit deck, also posted on decktech.
<br/>
This deck met with some success, but I just wasn't happy with it.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, a week before the tournament, two friends of mine
<br/>
broke up there relationship, and I had a TON of school work to
<br/>
do (Exams coming up).  Between school, work, and comforting
<br/>
my friends, I had no time for starwars.  I gave up on
<br/>
winning, it was always a unrealistic idea any ways.
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up building a Throne Room deck with really light
<br/>
SAC.  Good force generation, juts like Tosche Station,
<br/>
but more reliable.  Throne Room just suits my style, although
<br/>
I hadn't played one for over 4 months.
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be posting both decks soon.
<br/>
<br/>
Didn't go to sleep till 2 AM, that was a mistake.  My
<br/>
friend Justin was picking me up at 5:30 am for the 4
<br/>
hour trip to Vancouver (we're both from Kamloops).
<br/>
well my alarm went off, snooze.  snooze.  reset for
<br/>
another 20 min.  
<br/>
Justin had to find an open door and wake me up :)  
<br/>
what a way to start.
<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice trip to Vancouver, but Justin being the
<br/>
moron he is :p  got us lost in Vancouver.  We didn't
<br/>
have a map, but here's a quick rundown:
<br/>
me: 'Stay on this Highway.  Take an exit around here.'
<br/>
him: 'uhh... whatever'.
<br/>
a little bit later...
<br/>
me: 'Why are we going over this bridge... This is North
<br/>
      Vancouver! you dumbass!  turnaround'
<br/>
him: 'uhh... whatever'.
<br/>
me: 'Follow the signs to highway 1 west.  so left here'.
<br/>
him: 'ok'
<br/>
me: 'why did you just turn right when the sign SAYS LEFT!!!??'
<br/>
him: 'trust me this is the way'.
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we got where we needed to go :)
<br/>
<br/>
We had a quick game of my Rops deck vs his light,
<br/>
it was a obi hut Tosche station start.  he beat me,
<br/>
I wasn't too pleased about that... out of 20+ games
<br/>
of this deck with him, he'd only beaten twice before that,
<br/>
but that's bound to happen when you learn your opponents deck
<br/>
inside out :)
<br/>
<br/>
Well tournament starts, Deck lists.  Ugg I hate those things.
<br/>
I named my decks 'Throne Room, Sagan Style' and 'Rops, Sagan Style'.
<br/>
original.  Good turnout to the tournament, 33 people.
<br/>
<br/>
First match ups were surprising, at the top table, top spot,
<br/>
were Kevin Wan and Nicholas Burke, the top two rated players
<br/>
in BC.  I was placed at the 2nd top game, and Im rated 4th
<br/>
in BC, so again, weird.  James Hsu, I think he's rated 3rd,
<br/>
was in the 3rd game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  Throne Room, Sagan Style   vs Brendon Browns (1603) Hunt Down.
<br/>
<br/>
My games get a little fuzzy, I think his start was huntdown.
<br/>
I dropped some 2/0 sites, nudj, lose a force.  He drops a
<br/>
quarren to my swamp, moves over to the farm where my nudj is.
<br/>
lose a force.  Tawws makes an appearance, Draw there fire comes
<br/>
out, I predict Im winner, My lost pile is now empty.  lose a force.
<br/>
He gets out the wastes.  I drop boushh to his holotheatre, 
<br/>
break cover, cancel Visage.  Civil Disorder, Oola makes an 
<br/>
appearance- I think, cause I remember seeing his hand at one point.
<br/>
He loses to disorder, and my drains of 2.  Soon, a shmuck load
<br/>
of troopers make an appearance at the holotheatre.  Boussh
<br/>
nabruns to the wastes, I'm safe!  Civil Disorder canceled though :(
<br/>
he Elis's to boushh next turn, I nabrun back to the holotheatre.
<br/>
he moves 3 of his troopers to obi's hut.  Obi makes an appearance,
<br/>
Han, and Chewie with guns also follow.  Clash one trooper, move the other
<br/>
away, big force loss for him.  Game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 33.
<br/>
<br/>
For my next matchup, Im placed around the 5th highest matchup.
<br/>
Justin won his by 41, congrats.  he's placed at the 2nd matchup.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Rops, Sagan Style vs Jamie Nay's (1519) Throne Room.
<br/>
<br/>
Throne room start... bad feeling or crush... I go with
<br/>
bad feeling, the only way I'd need crush instead would be
<br/>
if he has 6+ revo's.  He picks up.  I get a site out,
<br/>
some 2/0 sites, pick up.  His turn, I think some sites come
<br/>
out, he narshadda's.  Interesting.  Pulls an Elom.  Inserts.
<br/>
Now Im running scared, alls I would need would be 4-5 eloms
<br/>
beating up on one of my walkers (that aren't out yet) combined
<br/>
with Romas Lock to prevent reacts.  I activate, insert comes up.
<br/>
0 - 0, no force loss.  Deploy my swamp which I picked up
<br/>
over his, bubo pulled from reserve, eat the nudj!  roar!
<br/>
bubo moves over, eats the other one.  His turn, 3 eloms+chewie
<br/>
with gun come and kill Bubo, and he inserts.  My turn,
<br/>
activate, drop 3 walkers with pilots, flip.  Pick up
<br/>
vesden, this could be interesting.  He turn, no drain,
<br/>
pick up I think.  Insert comes up on my turn, 9-9, no force
<br/>
loss.  Choke Vader + Tarkin visit his elom force, choke chewie,
<br/>
and pull 4 +3 destiny.  he loses two eloms.  His turn, runs
<br/>
to his throne room.  I drain, and sit pretty.  One or two
<br/>
more battles go by in my favor, game over
<br/>
<br/>
FW +29
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Throne Room, Sagan Style Vs Arian Delisle (1746) ISB.
<br/>
<br/>
ISB start, haven't played against one of those for awhile.
<br/>
Well some turns go by, my sites come out, he FIANLLY gets
<br/>
out jabba's palace and audience chamber.  Two Outer rim
<br/>
scouts come down to yavin, flips his objective, beats up
<br/>
my nudjs, he moves them together.  hmm.. Leia, Han, Chewie
<br/>
make an appearance, only hit one ORS, he ghhhks.  Obi, obi's
<br/>
saber, and Luke+saber make an appearance to his Audience chamber,
<br/>
bacta tank out.  He loses some force, Out of Commission!!!
<br/>
got his Chall Bekan, yeesssss!  His turn, Jabba, Boba Fett,
<br/>
4-Lom, and Dr. E try there luke with obi and luke.  4-lom
<br/>
cancels Lukes text, damn.  Clash Jabba, no destiny adding
<br/>
for you :)  hack 4-lom.  Destiny comes and goes, I clear his
<br/>
site, cept for jabba, luke to the tank.  Next turn, luke goes
<br/>
back to the audience chamber, more ORS come to yavin to flip
<br/>
his objective again, deploys Tempest Scout 2 and moves an ORS
<br/>
into there, the other ones at the throne room. he also did 
<br/>
something to kill luke.  Luke goes to the tank.  My turn,
<br/>
Drop luke against the ORS at the throne room.  Imperial Barrier, 
<br/>
Skywalkers cancels Imperial Barrier.  ROAR!!!  well I beat
<br/>
up the scout, hacked, draw 0 for destiny.   he still loses
<br/>
3 force.  I drain him out. 
<br/>
<br/>
FW +29
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Rops, Sagan Style vs David Houles (1826) Throne Room.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another throne room.  Great.  His turn, he drops 3 2/0 sites,
<br/>
a nudj, revos my Ralltir.  Great.  This could go bad.
<br/>
Well I search for a site, drop a 2/0.  He picks up.  I drop
<br/>
another site, pick up.  he gets out Obi to a Ralltir site,
<br/>
Han + leia to another.  Crap.  Tawss joins Obi.  I 
<br/>
get out Kashyyyk, Boba in slave 1 there.  drop Vader, Tarkin
<br/>
in Tempest Scout 3, and another AT-ST with pilots against
<br/>
obi and tawws, battle, he hacks and misses Tarkin, he
<br/>
loses Tawws.  his turn, run obi to my jungle.  Now he's
<br/>
draining for 2, Im draining for 3.  He deploys Tantive
<br/>
to Kashyyyk, battle order, then moves the Tantive to Raltirr.
<br/>
uhh.. ok.  I leave some walkers at the forest, vader+tarkin
<br/>
and tempest scout 3 go to the jungle after obi.  He drops
<br/>
draw there fire, Lower corridor, orri and oola there, Order
<br/>
to engage, moves tantive back after Boba, and runs gets
<br/>
out someone else to my site with just two walkers, runs 
<br/>
obi there.  My turn, deploy some more guys to the jungle,
<br/>
battle tantive, I retrieve one he loses one.  Spiral reacts, Im immune to his attrition, I lose
<br/>
2,
<br/>
he loses spiral.  I lose 3 to order to engage, and get
<br/>
Tarkin and Vader over to the middle site, leave some guys
<br/>
at jungle.  His turn, drain for 2, oola (no guys), nabruns
<br/>
han+leia to my jungle.  I grab it, now Im out of force.
<br/>
he battles.  I think Im screwed...  looking at my other site,
<br/>
I see Tempest scout 1, reacts for free!  Vader and Tarkin hop
<br/>
on, leaving tempest scout 3 + 2 at st pilots (one outside)
<br/>
to face obi and some other guys.  I choke Han, he misses
<br/>
Tarkin, big loss for him.  He uses savrip and Boussh, still
<br/>
loses 10 more.  he has no destiny left, so no battle against
<br/>
my puny force at the forest.  my turn, drain for 2 in space,
<br/>
one on ground, lose 3 to order to engage, run some guys over
<br/>
to obis hut.  He drains for 2 at lower corridor, I drain him
<br/>
out, to complete one of the most stressful games Ive
<br/>
ever played.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +13
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5  Throne Room, Sagan Style vs Kevin Wan (1918) huntdown.
<br/>
<br/>
He start epic duel, Damn.  I feel a loss coming up.  I drop
<br/>
a nudj, a 2/0 site, make him lose a force to visage, and then cancel it
<br/>
with transmission terminated.  BOOM!  yet another thing that
<br/>
went right for me in this tourney.  I look at my hand, and
<br/>
my mouth drops.  Obi, his stick, oola, civil disorder, two more
<br/>
2/0 sites.  he activates, picks up.  my turn, activate 8,
<br/>
nudj comes out, Obi + stick and oola to farm, civil disorder.
<br/>
He loses 2, picks up.  I drain for one, oola his hand.  
<br/>
rinse and repeat, I get out some more 2/0 sites, he gets
<br/>
out a docking bay.  Leia+blaster hits the docking bay.  
<br/>
Mara comes to play, doesn't find her saber.  Battle, leia
<br/>
hits Mara, both dead.  Next turn, 4-lom and Ig-88 come to visit
<br/>
obi, since I killed the nudj for a bigger drain.  He loses 2
<br/>
to civil since they're both droid and don't have ability.
<br/>
he sends oola to used pile, he wins battle, Lando goes
<br/>
from my hand using the savrip, Droids are dead, obi 's still there.  
<br/>
drain for 2.  He gets Vader after obi finally, battle.  I hack, 
<br/>
he draws enough to sack obi for attrition.  Luke with saber, Han 
<br/>
come down, hack Vader, beat him, Full Win.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 30
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, Rops Sagan Style vs Justin Cachelin (1664).
<br/>
<br/>
Great.  Final game, and Im playing my trainee, ride, friend,
<br/>
and all around moron.  Same decks as earlier, and he beat me then.
<br/>
Looking at my differential compared to other peoples, Im guaranteed
<br/>
to be in the top 2...  Everybody knows we're both from Kamloops,
<br/>
and some bug us about not rigging the game :)  Not the type
<br/>
of thing Id do any ways.  Well game starts.
<br/>
<br/>
He gets his Obi hut Tosche station start, I pull a site.
<br/>
he activates 5, EPP obi goes to his hut for 4 (bad feeling),
<br/>
moves to Tosche station.  I activate, Lt. Arnet comes down
<br/>
in Tempest scout 1.  Battle.  I'm immune to his attrition,
<br/>
obi dead.  His turn, he deploys another obi to the hut,
<br/>
moves over.  I drop an at-st pilot in tempest scout 1,
<br/>
battle.  I pull a 3, +2 attrition due to my pilots, Im immune.
<br/>
Obi gone again.  his turn, he drops obi straight to Tosche
<br/>
station, battle.  Tempest Scout 6 reacts from hand, obi is lost
<br/>
AGAIN, tempest scout 6 goes for attrition.  I flip my object,
<br/>
and he drops Ben after tempest scout 1 AGAIN, determined to kill him.
<br/>
battle, I add a total of 3 to destiny, 2 to attrition, so Ben
<br/>
is gone guaranteed.  He pulls a 4, sack my AT-ST pilot.  So
<br/>
the smoke clears, 4 obis in the lost pile, and tempest scout1
<br/>
and LT. Arnet still sitting pretty.  Bit more stuff happens,
<br/>
I drain him out.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 26.
<br/>
<br/>
final score: 12 (+160)
<br/>
<br/>
and so, I did win!   I really enjoyed this tournament,
<br/>
almost every game, required heavy thought on my part, and
<br/>
even though I won by a extremely large margin, all games
<br/>
were challenging.  
<br/>
I got to meet the Teacher, and we played an unofficial game
<br/>
afterwards.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: Rops, Sagan Style vs Charles Hickey's Evasive profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, hmmm... I had once seen this deck on the net, but
<br/>
it was over a month ago.  Plus, Id NEVER played against
<br/>
a profit deck before.
<br/>
<br/>
I go, pull a site, drop a 2/0.  His is similar.  My turn,
<br/>
drop Tempest scout 2, Watts, and Marquand to his Jabba's Palace.  
<br/>
He drops master luke, Ben, and Boussh.  Mechanical Failure.
<br/>
I pull a 4 and 5, he loses Boussh and luke, revives luke, I sack
<br/>
watts Marquand.  I go for my flip with the occasional attempt and battling.
<br/>
Vader goes after Master Luke, Master luke hacks Vader, then
<br/>
plays clash of sabers.  Battle over, Vaders dead.  DAMN!  or
<br/>
narrow escape stuff.  Fallen Portal.  you name it.  He's only draining
<br/>
for a bit, zuckuss goes up to kashyyyk to increase my drains.
<br/>
Igar and Tempest 1 come over to tatooine to play a bit, he
<br/>
narrow escapes.  Evax and Cabbel jump in Tempest Scout 2, which
<br/>
is still empty, and hike it over to the mechanical Failure, and
<br/>
get rid of it.  Igar and Tempest scout 2 chase his guys around a bit,
<br/>
Boussh comes to Ralltir, meditation, leia's gun.  damn !
<br/>
I drop Mara against Boussh, he shoots the Scout walker, and Misses!
<br/>
hurray!  dust clears, Mara hits my lost, Boussh hits his lost.
<br/>
he ends up battling Igar and company, he plays a destiny adder,
<br/>
pulls a 6, 5, 4.  Tempest Scout 2 is all alone, again.  At the
<br/>
end, he drains me out.  
<br/>
<br/>
FL -2.
<br/>
<br/>
Close game.  Damn close game.  After playing his deck, I learned
<br/>
something though.  Don't go to jabba's palace without good forces
<br/>
cause of master luke.  Also, add in Ability Ability Ability.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The next day, after being home, Justin and I match our other
<br/>
decks up against each other.  We always do this when we don't
<br/>
play in a tourney.  I expected a loss, knowing his dark side
<br/>
style, and I wasn't disappointed.  Loss by 20.  Although,
<br/>
in some ways, it wasn't so bad.  I'd bet if we played 10 games,
<br/>
it would go about 5 - 5.
<br/>
<br/>
Great Tournament, and I'm planning on hitting the Continental.
<br/>
I might Also consider going to the Grand Slam in Portland..
<br/>
Maybe I'll see Teacher there again.
<br/>
<br/>
A large thank you to Doug Taylor, for running a smooth tournament.
<br/>
Also a thank you Charles 'Teacher' Hickey for the game afterwards,
<br/>
and to James I think was the name.  Both Charles and James
<br/>
helped out at the tourney, answering rules questions, setting
<br/>
up games.  Also, Thank you very much to Hyerplight Enterprises
<br/>
for the location.
