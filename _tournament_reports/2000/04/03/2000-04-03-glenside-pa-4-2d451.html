<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ted P. held his usual monthly six-gamer at RPG Outpost in 
<br/>
Glenside.  The attendance was 13, smaller than usual, but 
<br/>
still a good time.  My dark deck was my patented 
<br/>
ISB/walkers/sandwhirls/UC probe droids on Tatooine... My 
<br/>
light deck was a conglomeration of MWYHL to test 1, UC 
<br/>
spies, holotable, and Kessel with a bunch of X-Wings and 
<br/>
laser cannons.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: my light vs. Livio D'Alessios (1771) EJP deck
<br/>
<br/>
I've played Livio's deck before, and I knew he had way too 
<br/>
much spy protection and retrieval potential to risk putting 
<br/>
spies down.  I insert an Anger, Fear, Aggression into his 
<br/>
deck (I only play one, but I start with it to throw people 
<br/>
off their game).  It pops on his first turn of activation, 
<br/>
so he loses a quick 2 (cuz unfortunately, he started 
<br/>
Resistance).  I drop a Bothan Spy UC, but Bubo eats him in 
<br/>
about a turn.  He hits me for a couple of early force 
<br/>
drains, but I pass test #1 fairly quickly and cut that way 
<br/>
down.  Now, my light deck operates on the principle of 
<br/>
getting set up, shutting down my force loss, and then 
<br/>
starting up theirs.  So I'm losing about 3 or 4 on his turns 
<br/>
for a little while.  I draw up for a couple of turns, 
<br/>
getting R3PO, Artoo, A Gift, and Hiding in the Garbage.  Oh 
<br/>
boy.  Ephont Mon is sitting in the Audience Chamber, so R390 
<br/>
gets gifted and Artoo goes Undercover in the Cantina.  There 
<br/>
are only about 5 sites down, and he has a couple of alien 
<br/>
bounty hunters at each one, now draining for a grand total 
<br/>
of 0.  I also deploy HitG, call for an interrupt, and get It 
<br/>
Could Be Worse and We're Doomed (forgotten tech!)  in my 
<br/>
hand.  Good thing, because on his turn Bubo goes to the 
<br/>
Audience Chamber and Droid Detector goes down.  Goodbye, 
<br/>
R3PO... (sniff.)  My turn rolls around, and I set up drains 
<br/>
at the holotable for 2 and Kessel for 2 (with Resistance 
<br/>
out).  I ICBW my loss of one from his objective.  His turn, 
<br/>
I play We're Doomed to cut all of his force drains of one in 
<br/>
half (round down since Artoo is on the table, heehee).  My 
<br/>
turn, I activate everything and HiTG for the two interrupts 
<br/>
again.  Repeat last four sentences indefinitely.  I'm 
<br/>
draining him for 4, he's drainig me for none.  Search and 
<br/>
Destroy came down at one point, but I used HiTG to set up a 
<br/>
one and alter it.  Game over.
<br/>
FW by 13 -- 2(+13)  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 -- my dark vs. Livio D'Alessio's (1771) MWYHL to flip
<br/>
<br/>
Livio begins this game but telling me, 'let's see how you 
<br/>
like it,' inserting an Anger, Fear, Aggression on his first 
<br/>
turn, then preparing the Jedi test set up.  He starts 
<br/>
passing tests like crazy while I set up a drain of one or so 
<br/>
at my Tatooine sites (avoiding the Projections he had down). But, as luck would have it, I managed to pick up Dagobah: 
<br/>
Cave and Failure at the Cave in my first two turns, waiting 
<br/>
for the right time.  I also threw down Secret Plans and 
<br/>
CHYBC.  I have a sandwhirl blowing back and forth, along 
<br/>
with Search and Destroy down so I'm hitting him for a total 
<br/>
of 3 across both our turns.  AFA pops at some point, and I 
<br/>
lose four cards.  He has Daughter turned upside down for 
<br/>
test 5 when my wonderful, wonderful combo goes down about 
<br/>
five sites away.  Suspension!  In the five turns it took him 
<br/>
to get there and get rid of it, I'm draining him for 5 and 
<br/>
hitting him for one a turn with S&amp;D.  I drain him out just 
<br/>
as he gets Daughter back to the site with test five.
<br/>
FW by 19 -- 4(+32)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 -- my light vs. Greg Hodur's (1770) Scum and Villainy
<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever have a game when everything that could have 
<br/>
gone wrong, did?  His first turn he deploys Mara Jade and 
<br/>
Saber to the Jundland Wastes.  I deploy Yoda's Hut, not 
<br/>
enough for Son of Skywalker, Yoda's not there.  Second turn, 
<br/>
he drains me for three and deploys Jabba and Galid to the 
<br/>
AC.  I search my deck for Yoda, Son of Skywalker, Training 
<br/>
Ground, and Test 1.  The only thing there was test 1 (which 
<br/>
I can't take without the site) and Yoda, whom I deploy.  I 
<br/>
draw and get Son.  His turn, he drains me for five and drops 
<br/>
a couple of Bounty Hunters to JP.  My turn, I drop Son and 
<br/>
search for a site.  I find the test, but no training ground.  Can't take it out.  His turn, he drains me for 7.  The drain is killing me, so I drop a spy and look in my deck.  
<br/>
Training ground, but no test.  His turn, he Hutt Smooches my 
<br/>
spy and drains me for another 7.  At Peace goes by on a 
<br/>
force drain.  My turn, I finally get the test down and set 
<br/>
up some ships at Kessel.  This gave me a nice little drain 
<br/>
of two, but I never got the test off because I was getting 
<br/>
drained for too much to set up a 5 (which was what I needed) 
<br/>
and I had lost too many cards to get more than one spy down.
<br/>
FL by approx. 24 -- 4(+8)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 -- my dark vs. Pete Flamini's (1686) Yavin IV Mains
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing happened in this one for a while... he had Melas and 
<br/>
Tawss Khaa sitting on Yavin 4, I had undercover probe droids 
<br/>
there.  I Monnok him for a pair of EPP Obis.  I deploy the 
<br/>
Devastator and Ozzel to Coruscant and started draining for 
<br/>
one.  Next turn, 5D6 goes to a Tatooine site inside Blizzard 
<br/>
1 (can't be snipered, ambushed, double agented, etc.) and I 
<br/>
flip.  I get a couple more drains at Coruscant until he 
<br/>
comes down with Tantive and the fleet, with a bacta tank to 
<br/>
back them up.  We battle it out there for a little while 
<br/>
until I eventually concede the planet and think about 
<br/>
deploying to Tatooine.  Two walkers and a couple agents go 
<br/>
to the Tat:Desert in a sandwhirl.  Everybody around here 
<br/>
plays Controls now, so I was expecting some kind of 
<br/>
beatdown, but he didn't have enough force to bring on a real 
<br/>
beatdown.  Sure enough, he controls my 'whirl and drops down 
<br/>
EPP Han and Chewie with a Mechanical Failure.  I elect not to draw battle destiny (since I'd rather have both of his characters trapped in the desert instead or recirculating on the Bacta Tank) and lose everybody to his destiny of about 10.  My turn, I deploy another sandwhirl to make Han 
<br/>
and Chewie missing and another couple of walkers next door.  I get a few turns of draining for 3, while he's draining me 
<br/>
for one and I'm retrieving one.  Eventually, he controls the 
<br/>
sandwhirl and EPP Luke and Boussh then come down to fight 
<br/>
me.  Here's where I made a mistake that could have cost me 
<br/>
the game -- he had Draw Their Fire down, I had Secet Plans. He had no force to pay to retrieve, and I let him retrieve 
<br/>
his control (doh!).  I lose a walker, and move the other two 
<br/>
to the desert.  I strart hitting him for two there, and he's 
<br/>
still just hitting me for one at Coruscant.  He decides to 
<br/>
try and block the drain by moving over his characters, but 
<br/>
they go to the Tat: Desert and get trapped.  I move away 
<br/>
again and hold down a drain of three for the rest of the 
<br/>
game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW by 7 -- 6(+15)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 -- my light vs. Jeff Podolak's (1686) Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
Opening hand, I get a Bothan Spy and an Undercover.  
<br/>
Beautiful!  He flips on his turn with Vader at the Death 
<br/>
Star Docking Bay.  I lose one on his turn and cancel Visage 
<br/>
on mine. I soak the drain at the Docking Bay for a turn and 
<br/>
what do I lose?  SOS, my apprentice.  I know better than to 
<br/>
lose from my deck before I have everything out... Mara Jade 
<br/>
and Saber come down with Vader, upping his drain to two.  I 
<br/>
deploy Yoda to his hut and R3PO to the docking bay, forcing 
<br/>
Mara to move and reduce the drain by one (since the DB was 
<br/>
his only battleground site).  I deploy Hiding in the Garbage 
<br/>
a turn later, and use it to fish out Artoo and an Undercover 
<br/>
to block his drain and a Bothan Spy and At Peace to start 
<br/>
training... I wait a turn for At Peace to kick in, set up a 
<br/>
five with HiTG, and Boom!  My Bothan Spy is now a Great 
<br/>
Warrior, and my force loss is cut to zero.  I spend the next 
<br/>
couple turns fishing out Kessel, a bunch of ships, the 
<br/>
holotable, and Projections.  Deploy it all.  He brings out 
<br/>
another Visage to the Holotheater, but I cancel it with the 
<br/>
Transmission Terminated I had been holding for many turns.  
<br/>
(When I verified his deck for a docking bay on turn two, I 
<br/>
saw the second one in there).  I start hitting him for 5 a 
<br/>
turn.  He eventually drains with Mara's saber on the 
<br/>
Executor and chucks his objective, both of us forgetting 
<br/>
that with my test passed, he can't.  So I drop another spy a 
<br/>
turn later.  Game over.
<br/>
FW by 22 -- 8(+37)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 -- my dark vs. Greg Hodur's (1770) MWYHL to 2 w/M&amp;T.
<br/>
<br/>
I play very defensively, so all I did for the first couple 
<br/>
of turns was draw.  He sets up to start testing and 
<br/>
eventually deploys the Tantive with a couple of ships and 
<br/>
pilots to Coruscant.  I retaliate with Bossk in Bus, 
<br/>
Devastator, Ozzel, and two Outer Rim Scouts.  We start 
<br/>
battling a bunch, but I had used my Reactor terminal to set 
<br/>
up a ten-card clump of 4's, 5's, and 6's, so I'm drawing a 
<br/>
minimum of nine for destiny each time.  He deploys more 
<br/>
ships and characters and battles, I deploy more ships and 
<br/>
characters and battle.  He sets up Tawss Khaa in the 
<br/>
cantina.  I deploy an undercover probe droid.  He deploys 
<br/>
R3PO, and I can find my laser/sniper combo or restraining 
<br/>
bolt anywhere.  I break his cover and move away, Ghhhk at 
<br/>
the ready.  Luke takes out the probe droid.  I manage to 
<br/>
find Blizzard 1 and 5D6, so I put them in the desert to 
<br/>
reduce the Tatooine drain to a total of one.  On his turn, 
<br/>
EPP Obi goes to the CC Carbon Chamber he just deployed.  I 
<br/>
counter him with an undercover droid at the CC and a 
<br/>
restraining bolt on R3PO (just in case) a couple turns 
<br/>
later.  By this time I've beaten him out at space, so he 
<br/>
runs to the Kiffex he deployed.  I then choose to put 
<br/>
Dagobah: Cave and Failure at the Cave down, along with a 
<br/>
slow buildup of 4 or 5 walkers at the Tat: Desert.  I chase 
<br/>
him around in space, alternating drains of one and two (at 
<br/>
Coruscant and Kiffex) and two at the desert.  He eventually 
<br/>
gets Daughter to the Cave, misses on his first try (I 
<br/>
retrieve two) but hits it the next.  But, the five turns 
<br/>
worth of bonuses hurts, although I am actually losing force 
<br/>
from his Cantina drain because I run out of agents to 
<br/>
retrieve.  Nothing like ekeing out the win with minutes to 
<br/>
go...
<br/>
FW by 5 -- 10(+42)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I end up coming in second at 5-1, behind the 
<br/>
undefeated with a timed win John Lolli (who I never had to 
<br/>
play thanks to the sides we played).  All in all, I was 
<br/>
pretty happy with my performance, with an undefeated dark 
<br/>
deck and a light deck that lost due to bad luck and 
<br/>
atrocious management on my part -- my fault, not the deck's.  Ted ran an excellent tournament, and I pulled a white-
<br/>
bordered Yoda out of my Dagobah packs.  Thanks for reading.
