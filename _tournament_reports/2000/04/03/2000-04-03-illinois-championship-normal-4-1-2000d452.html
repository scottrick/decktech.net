<br/>
The place: Normal, IL
<br/>
<br/>
The decks:
<br/>
Light:  This deck is almost identical to Matt Lush's Throne Room Revo
<br/>
deck on Decktech.  I pulled the 2 leader in ships and Savrip for R-3PO,
<br/>
another grabber, and I Hope She's All Right.  The R-3PO and I Hope She's
<br/>
All Right function in the same way as the 2 leaders, anti-space, and
<br/>
don't have the liability of getting beatdown.  The Savrip was pulled
<br/>
because I needed another grabber, and Masterful Move is a pretty common
<br/>
card.  Here is the deck in it's entirety.

Dark: A fairly standard Rops deck.  Earlier in the week, I had cut the
<br/>
Bad Feeling Have I, and go with IAO start to be able to pull the 1/0
<br/>
docking bays out, which got exchanged with the Wampa Cave and Dagobah
<br/>
Cave.  This gave me an additional card slot to work with, and Rebel
<br/>
Barrier is still running rampant, so Blast Door Controls seemed like a
<br/>
solid choice.

Objective (1):

Ralltiir Operations/In The Hands Of The Empire 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs. Space (Coruscant start)
<br/>
<br/>
I don't get an excellent draw, but neither does he. By the 4th turn or
<br/>
so, I get Premiere Ben and saber draining in the Carbonite Chamber, and
<br/>
I have revolved both Coruscant and Nal Hutta.  I am activating about
<br/>
double the force he is, and I soon draw into I Hope She's All Right
<br/>
(IHSAR).  By now, I have enough characters in hand to handle walkers, so
<br/>
I deploy Master Luke and EPP Han to the Farm and move the Nudj over to
<br/>
set up IHSAR next turn.  Next turn he drops Blizzard 2 with a couple
<br/>
guys and battles.  I think I draw poorly and only manage to kill 1 of
<br/>
them, I lose Han, and he moves away.  Next turn, I setup IHSAR and play
<br/>
it safe, and end up with DoS at the Farm, and Luke and Han at the
<br/>
Swamp.  On his turn, he battles and loses the walker and pilot, and Han
<br/>
bites it again.  By now, he's being drained for 3 at the Carbonite
<br/>
Chamber, 1 from DoS at the Farm, and 1 from Master Luke w/ saber at the
<br/>
swamp, and 1 from IHSAR on each turn.  He's draining for 1 at 2
<br/>
different systems.  He eventually kills off DoS with another walker and
<br/>
cancelling IHSAR, but the damage has been done, and I win by about 20.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs. Frank Amador (12th) Dagobah drain with Baragwin tech
<br/>
<br/>
He starts Dagobah and Careful Planning for 2 generic sites.  I get set
<br/>
up fairly quickly, complete with Search and Destroy, and he gets a slow
<br/>
start.  But he does get the Baragwin engine going.  He has
<br/>
Artoo/Baragwin/Hero of a Thousand Devices/Fire Extinguisher out.  Along
<br/>
with Wise Advice, I can't stop it unless I can Trample the Baragwin. 
<br/>
Meanwhile, I'm slowly draining him at a couple sites and Kashyyyk, but
<br/>
the Baragwin is really slowing the damage down.  I also manage to get
<br/>
DLOTS w/ a saber, and Zuckuss in ship to Dagobah.  Zuckuss lands at the
<br/>
forest to block the Ithorian drain, and DLOTS moves to the Hut.  We run
<br/>
around a bit on Dagobah, and eventually Yoda and Son of Skywalker stay
<br/>
put at the hut to face down DLOTS.  The next turn, I activate all but 4,
<br/>
and pull my lowest destiny out, leaving 3 4s.  This allows to me to cut
<br/>
Yoda, and clear Son out with attrition.  But he pulls a 5 killing
<br/>
DLOTS.  I then land Zuckuss at the forest again for an uncontested drain
<br/>
the remainder of the game.  Now, Frank has to do something off Dagobah. 
<br/>
Soon after he drops an Ithorian with the Baragwin and battles.   I react
<br/>
over and Trample the Baragwin, and he cancels the battle.  But his
<br/>
retrieval has been stopped.  Nothing else eventful happens, and he draws
<br/>
up the remainder of his cards with a few minutes remaining giving me
<br/>
about a 16 point win, with a rather large hand size.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. James Bottoms (10th) Hidden Base with miscellaneous
<br/>
ships, EPPs, and Insurrection boosted 2/2 pilots.
<br/>
As with many Hidden Base decks, he only manages minor interference (EPP
<br/>
Luke) to my flipping, but he is taken care by a chicken walker with
<br/>
AT-ST pilot.  Since he isn't playing beatdown, I manage to safely probe
<br/>
several systems before finding his Hidden Base and he loses 7 cards to
<br/>
Security Precautions.  Blast Door Controls enables a couple battles and
<br/>
clear a couple systems and saving me from being attacked on his turn. 
<br/>
He eventually manages to flip Rops back by clearing one of my sites, and
<br/>
controlling the system.  But I manage to flip it back the next turn, and
<br/>
eventually drain him out, along with Search and Destroy damage.  I win
<br/>
by mid 20s.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs. 'Disco' Dave Nicpon (6th) Big Blue (Defensive Perimeter
<br/>
start)
<br/>
He starts Presence of the Force on his Defensive Perimeter.  I get an
<br/>
early Revo on it, and the next turn Master Luke w/ Saber at his Cantina
<br/>
Alters the PotF.  He gets a walker set up with a couple guys and EPP
<br/>
Fett.  I eat the drain for a turn and drop Ben Kenopi w/ Saber and the
<br/>
Wookie to the Cantina.  Next turn, I Nabrun over, clash Fett, and clear
<br/>
the rest of his site out plus a couple cards.  Unfortunately for me, Ben
<br/>
Kenobi got disarmed after the Nabrun, so I'm stuck with 1 saber for the
<br/>
rest of the game.   He eventually Elises back to the Cantina, then on my
<br/>
turn I Nabrun back and beat him down, but he Ghhhks.  Then I split my
<br/>
forces up Han/Luke/Chewie at the Cantina, and Ben/Daughter at the JP:
<br/>
Entrance Cavern, and setup IHSAR.  Meanwhile, he's been getting some
<br/>
drains in at Kiffex.  Igar in Tempest 1 come down, but don't draw enough
<br/>
attrition to take out Ben, so DoS covers, and comes back.  He picks up,
<br/>
and I win by about 20.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs. Brian Monday (3rd) Rops
<br/>
<br/>
He starts Crush, so I can't Revo until I get a grabber, but I get one on
<br/>
the first pickup.  I revo his Ice Plains, he Evaders, and I grab it, so
<br/>
I can re-revolve the Ice Plains, but he has plenty of force, so the
<br/>
choke isn't extremely effective.  I do manage to get Premeire Ben with a
<br/>
saber down to Ralltiir.  The next turn he drops a load of guys, and I
<br/>
Smoke Screen, but I still lose by 10.  I choose to lose 10 and keep him
<br/>
on the table.  He never manages to get rid of him for the remainder of
<br/>
the game, and he pretty much avoids him.  I suspect he's only running 4
<br/>
sites, so if I can keep a 2nd site occupied, he won't be able to flip. 
<br/>
I drop Master Luke at the docking bay.  Then Vader comes down to beat on
<br/>
Luke for several cards, but Luke stays.  Next turn, EPP Han comes down
<br/>
and battles, he reacts, and I only kill one guy, and Han bites it, but
<br/>
Luke moves away.  Meanwhile, Daughter is draining away for 2 at the
<br/>
Entrance Cavern.  A couple turns later, I drop another EPP Han down ,
<br/>
and Order to Engage.  Han gets Trampled, but he takes 3 from OtE for a
<br/>
couple turns.  Luke gets battled a couple times, but he can't draw high
<br/>
enough to get rid of Luke.  Once I'm convinced he's out of battling
<br/>
capability, Chewie goes to drain at the Jundland Wastes.  I manage to
<br/>
drain him out on Tatooine while Ben and Luke run around Raltiir avoiding
<br/>
DLOTS w/ saber.  I win by about 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs. Jonathan Morse (8th) Hologameboard/Balance
<br/>
<br/>
I don't get any 2/0s so I'm limited to my docking bays and Ralltiir
<br/>
sites, so it's a slow setup.  Eventually, I drop an AT-ST w/ pilot at a
<br/>
site, and he drops Orrimaarko next door to block the flip.  On my turn,
<br/>
I drop Blast Door Controls, which he has to read a couple times, then
<br/>
DLOTS comes down and takes care of Orrimaarko.  My next turn, he throws
<br/>
2 Rebel Barriers from his hand to the drains, and I flip w/ Ozzel/AT-ST
<br/>
and Pilot/Vader.  I get out Search and Destroy and get a ship at
<br/>
Kashyyyk over the next couple turns.  He manages to get rid of Search
<br/>
and Destroy by shooting Ozzel, and I have to react with the walker, and
<br/>
have to forfeit the AT-ST pilot, but his site is cleared.  I set up
<br/>
Decree (negating his Projection bonus on the Holotable) and drop more
<br/>
guys on Ralltiir.  He tries to challenge the Decree by dropping a
<br/>
Corvette with a 2 ability pilot, and Gold Leader at Kashyyyk and saves
<br/>
2.  Next turn, I drop Zuckuss, he reacts with the Spiral, but it gets
<br/>
Barriered, so he loses the pilot and I lose nothing.  He moves to
<br/>
Ralltiir, where I drop the Devastator for clean up.  He gets a couple
<br/>
more guys down to Ralltiir but it's pretty much over at this point, and
<br/>
I win in the mid 20s.
<br/>
<br/>
I finish up in first as the only undefeated at 12 +120.  It
<br/>
was a well run tournament, with no major issues.  So I,
<br/>
Geoff Snider (2nd), along with 120+ other people will get
<br/>
to sit out day 1 at GenCon.
