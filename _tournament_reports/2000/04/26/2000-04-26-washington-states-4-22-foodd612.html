Tourney  Report 4-22-2000
<br/>
<br/>
or, &amp;#8220;How I scrubbed out&amp;#8221;
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I had been working quite a bit = not much time spent on SWCCG. My desire was to come up with some good decks that would be &amp;#8220;one step ahead&amp;#8221; of the rest, which is always a good strategy at larger tournaments.
<br/>
Well, it sounded dandy but with the time I had I came up with squat, so I played standard fare decks instead.
<br/>
Light Side was Throne Room mains, nothing too tricky here.
<br/>
Dark Side was Ralltiir Ops, also standard issue.
<br/>
<br/>
There were 44-46 people at the tournament, pretty good turnout (I think 2 dropped at some point.)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Rallops DS vs Martin Norris MWYHL Mains
<br/>
Martin is a local squadron member who runs many tournaments at Seattles Broken Games. Hes a very nice dude so I knew wed have a pleasant game. He starts MWYHL and Goo Nee Tay, I drop Ralops and Bad Feeling Have I. We scoop up a few cards and I get ready to flip. I admit I dont recall a lot of the details of this game, but I was able to flip and keep a foothold on Ralltiir the whole time. He met me with some expensive mains, but I was able to react and defend. I forgot to add my bonus to battle destiny in that first battle, but from then on I applied it with glee. Mainly the deck did what it does best, battle away the LS and control my locations and drain away.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 19
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Throne Room LS vs Martin Norris RallOps
<br/>
We got paired up again, even with a 19 point win/loss. LS must have had a hard time Game 1. I laugh as I realize we are switching strategies, my mains and his Rallops. I get Nudjes out, but when I do I look in my deck and see 3 Lukes and 3 Bens each time! I need those mofos in my hand. Well, we both draw for a while and I finally get what I need. I put Premiere Ben + saber down planetside and he draws up for something to blast me with. He drops 4 ability 2 imperials in an attempt to remove Ben, including 2 biker scouts Irol and Dreloesyn. I clash one of em so he cant get extra destiny, and hit another with saber, but he draws a 5. He is left with lone guy that I clashed, so I drop Order to Engage and some dude down there, causing a 3 force loss when he cant get backup. The rest of my mains come down and the result is I cannot be stopped.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 25
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Throne Room vs Michael Mikaelian Yavin 4 Occupation
<br/>
Hmmm. I figure I might be in trouble, but if I can get some drains and good battles going, I have a good shot. I have never lost to Mike in tournament play&amp;#8230;can I continue the trend? We both get lots of force quickly, so I drop Ben at Farm followed by Luke and Tawss and I spread out to Swamp also. He drops some Mofos and sets up on Yavin and drops Occupation. Well, this sucks. My deck is just too light on space; this would hurt me this game and my other loss. I drop spiral and start beefing up my space presence by moving mains onboard for multiple destiny. Vader and Tarkin were on the ground, but he shuttles Tarkin up and plays &amp;#8220;your shuttle is ready&amp;#8221; or whatever that crazy card is from SE &amp;#8220;your shuttle is waxed and clean and fueled up&amp;#8221; or something. This makes the Star Destroyer in orbit around Yavin immune to attrition. Well I am hosed. I try to make a stand but then Executor comes out. I decide to switch to the ground and abandon space. I leave a minor complement onboard the Spiral (there were no systems to flee to, nor could I land the ship) but I didnt leave enough forfeit fodder up and got smashed for Spiral+crew+some cards. It was just downhill from there, I tried to make a stand below, but Battle Order was making things quite hard on me. I got drained out.
<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;6 I think

<br/>
Game 4: RallOps vs Walter Zylowski Throne Room mains
<br/>
We start by drawing up and getting ready. I drop some dudes to flip, but leave myself a little thin. He drops 3 mains to the Cantina and Nabruns on over and clears one site.. I can setup some forces down there, but his roving crew of mains is slowing me, compounded critically by the fact that he starts plopping down ships at Ralltiir system. I try to fend them off, but they keep coming, and Wedge is cycled through the Bacta Tank a few times. I moved my ground forces over to the desert in an attempt to lure him there. Sure enough he does end up putting Luke and Obi there and shuttles down Han from above. I say, &amp;#8220;Do you get 2 or 3 destinies there?&amp;#8221; he looks and says &amp;#8220;2&amp;#8230;well, why not&amp;#8221; and shuttles down Leia too, &amp;#8220;now its 3.&amp;#8221; On my turn I say, &amp;#8220;This is my power play&amp;#8230;..Sandwhirl!&amp;#8221; and his mains go away for the rest of the game. My gambit worked! I expand on the ground and bring a new focus to the battle in space. Things turn my way, but he does not give up without a fight. We exchange a few fights here and there, and Cantina comes under contention with Orrimaarko, Mara Jade, and then Tawss Khaa. I cannot be thwarted now, however, and pull out a victory.

Game 5: RallOps vs Peter Sundholm QMC retrieval deck
<br/>
He started QMC and I stared at the Objective for a while. What was he trying to accomplish? I thought it might be retrieval with Celebration and Off the Edge so I started Secret Plans.  I set up some dudes on Ralltiir and he gets two ASP droids down to CC. He drops some Lift Tubes so he can set them up as destinies. In a bid to thwart me on Ralltiir he drops Leia and Tawss at 2 sites and battles, but I am too strong; this gambit turned out to be a regrettable move as I was able to clear away his characters and cause force loss through battle damage. Well, I set up a space presence with Zuckuss and he gets out Falcone and Capn Han. I move between systems until I can set up more space. I decide not to take on Han just yet and I keep some roving ships up there such that one ship can drain for 2 each turn while the other dodges the Falcon. On Ralltiir I am uncontested so I set up a drain of 3 there. I drop Vader+Saber and Tarkin on CC, but he responds with EPP Ben at the other end of CC at a site that can cancel any CC drain. Well, I end up shuttling Vader over to Ralltiir to apply his drain at a fourth Ralltiir site rather than moving 4 sites over to challenge Obi. Then he starts retrieving with On the Edge, setting up 5 and 6 destinies. I grab his On the Edge, but he starts Off the Edging too and I cant grab that one. I was dominating but now he is retrieving big time. I decide to expand my drain in space and challenge the Falcone with Zuckuss and Bossk, drawing 2 destinies and adding 4 from ROps. Even with his retrieval, this is just too much.

Game 6: Throne Room vs Michael Peralta DeathStar space heavy deck
<br/>
He starts Death Star and IAO, I start Throne room stuff. I draw up and get some good mains and decide to wait to see if he drops a site. He draws up and eventually drops Endor and a Dreadnaught with 2 ability 2 pilots. Crap, I cant find any ships so I drop mains on Yavin generic sites and start draining for 2 there to match his 2 in space. This goes on for a while until he drops Kiffex. I have the Spiral in my hand now. Where the F are my other ships? I just didnt put enough space power in this deck. I put out Spiral and some dudes and kill some pilots, but more come out. Well, then Vader + Tarkin appear as pilots and I play Smokescreen to kill Tarkin. On my turn I attack and kill Vader. Basically each turn is drain 2 and attack, for both of us! I want him to lose for Order to Engage, but he battles every turn, always getting reinforcements. Then he puts out Vader and Tarkin again! I am out of smokescreen and destiny adding fools, so I move to the Death Star. Now I dont satisfy Battle Order, but neither does he. However, this would kill me in the end. I try to make a final stand after drawing Falcone and Tantive, but it is just too late for me. Savrip helps, I try to accomplish something but I am battled away. In the end, I am drained out.
<br/>
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211; a little
<br/>
<br/>
Well it was a fun game, but this means I am 4-2 which really stinks up the bathroom. BTW every time I went to the bathroom at the WOTC game center, some dude was separating his marijuana into little packages in the next stall. He was at it all day, the 6+ hours of the tournament. I mean WTF? Go home and do it. Im trying to pee here.
<br/>
<br/>
No one went undefeated, but highest 5-1 went to Joe Olson. I watched during the last game as Charles Hickey played the slowest mofo ever. He had to read Trample 3 times. Charles got a timed loss in that game which cost him 2nd place.
<br/>
<br/>
I end up 9th, so I scrubbed out. Fun was had by all tho, and after we went to some Pancake House for the hook up. I got some Japanese SWCCG as prize, which is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 Hungry Snook vs International Tour breakfasts Scrambled Eggs
<br/>
Well I was quite hungry and I was looking forward to some pancakes. The waitress starts with everyone else, and they order something called International Tour or something which is 2 eggs and some pancakes which can be served in different styles representing various countries. Everyone gets this Swedish pancake action, and they suggest it to me. I say OK lets do it, Swedish International breakfast please, make the eggs scrambled. Well the eggs come out 30 mins later and I chow down. I like a good batch of scramble eggs so I make short work of it, there was really nothing they could have done in this match up.
<br/>
<br/>
FW + a lot
<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 Snook with eggs in stomach vs Swedish Pancakes w/ strawberries
<br/>
Swedish pancakes are thin wiry suckers, not quite the same as your traditional pancakes, but they turned out to be quite good. The sad truth is that I was getting full. But  I pressed on and brought my tech to bear: fork and knife. This is a strong combo against many foods, but especially pancakes. In the end I looked down and there was still some corner of a pancake left. Shoot.
