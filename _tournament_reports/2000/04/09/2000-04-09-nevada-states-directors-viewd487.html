<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First of all I want everyone to know that this is a Tourney Report from the directors view
<br/>
point.  So of course I do not have my own game by game details.  Of course this still helps
<br/>
all of us to see what is out there in the playing field.
<br/>
<br/>
So who is the Nevada State Champ for the Year 2000?  Well that comes later in the
<br/>
report.  We had a disappointing 18 people show up for this event. Some of my younger
<br/>
ones parents thought it was to long of a day and 2 others had SATs.  Strange how it
<br/>
worked out, because I know of at least 5 more that wanted to come and didnt show up. 
<br/>
Anyway I did have all of Nevadas Top People playing in this tournament(except me :))
<br/>
So I knew it was going to be good.
<br/>
<br/>
The main contenders were Kris Lavigne, Dan Christy, Brandon Gravo, Chris Hines, and
<br/>
Matt Berta.  All of them were good players and any one of them could have done it. 
<br/>
Travis Merkle(my padawan), John Spadora, and Jeff Lavigne were also expected to have a
<br/>
good showing.
<br/>
<br/>
We decided, before the Tournament began that we were going to have a final
<br/>
confrontation.  With a Tournament as important as a State Championship we(me and ALL
<br/>
of my players) felt that a Final Confrontation would be the proper way to say who is the
<br/>
Champion of the State for that year.
<br/>
<br/>
I seen a lot of different Deck types at this tournament. Here is a break down of the
<br/>
different decks that were played.

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not bad for a good amount of decks played.  It was also interesting to note that the Top 2
<br/>
people were not playing Rallops or Yavin 4 mains.  Here is a brief summary of the match
<br/>
ups and how some people were knocked down.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 match ups put Matt berta up against Chris Hood, both have a tendency to time
<br/>
out..so guess what happen they Timed out with Chris Hood ahead.  Although this would
<br/>
be Matt's only lost until the final. Brandon Gravo was put up against Noah Singer and
<br/>
Brandon had nothing going good for him this game, he loses. Chris Hines is up against a
<br/>
Newbie...easy win. Travis Merkle and John Spadora match and Travis comes out ahead.
<br/>
Kris Lavigne and Danny Rider(up and coming) face off with Kris taking the victory. Read
<br/>
on.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 match ups during this game Matt takes his winning streak taking down Brandon
<br/>
Gravo.  Gravo is a little down since he is now 0-2.  Kris beats Noah to avenge Brandon
<br/>
and Hines Takes out Garrett.  Two games go by and everything looks like a normal
<br/>
tournament with the usual people winning.  Lets move on.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 has 4 undefeated players that have to play each other.  With Chris Hines going
<br/>
against Dan Christy. And Travis Merkle facing off vs Kris Lavigne. Chris Hines Dark Ops
<br/>
on Corulag was having problems with Dans Mains and others.  Chris wasnt seeing any
<br/>
of his ops and wasnt able to flip for about 6 to 7 turns and when Dan shows up with a
<br/>
Disrupter Pistol things dont look to good, Dan wins by 25. In Travis game Kris seem to
<br/>
be in control for most of the game.  Travis was having trouble getting Ralltiir to flip.  Kris
<br/>
was using a lot of his stuff to keep it unflipped and didnt go to space for a while(Kris was
<br/>
doing HB).  Well after Travis finally killed all of Kris resources he flip and the game was
<br/>
close but Travis wins by 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 now has only 2 undefeated players and they both have to face off.  Dan Christy
<br/>
plays No Order In the Court(my deck that is posted here) and Travis is playing Hidden
<br/>
Base.  Dan doesnt seem worried because he beat a Hidden base earlier today.  Travis is
<br/>
having a hard time most of the game.  Dan at one time Monnok like 5 x-wings out of his
<br/>
hand.  Travis still had more, which was Dan downfall.  Dan thinking that Travis was out of
<br/>
resources spread to thin.  Travis took advantage of the situation for a beatdown which
<br/>
took Dan for about 10 cards.  Dan was having trouble retrieving since Aim High was out,
<br/>
but he did the best he could.  He knows now what mistakes he made and says he wants to
<br/>
put in Search and Destroy(good call), in was close and fun to watch.  Travis wins by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile all those expected to win wins.  It looks like this Travis Merkle 4-0, Dan
<br/>
Christy 3-1, Matt Berta 3-1, Chris Hines 3-1, Kris Lavigne 3-1, and Brandon Gravo 2-2.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 is a tough round for the players.  Dan Christy gets revenge on Travis winning by
<br/>
18. And Matt Berta playing Hunt Down gets his Revenge on Chris Hood winning by 9.
<br/>
Kris Lavigne and Chris Hines had to face off and Kris Lavigne gets hit with numbers and
<br/>
Chris Hines finds his Ops and flips easy with a victory of 31.  Lets us go to the next
<br/>
round.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 match ups put some interesting people together.  First Place would go to the
<br/>
person who wins the top table game.  Which was between Dan Christy and Chris Hines. 
<br/>
Second place looks like it would go to either of the next 4 people which were Travis
<br/>
Merkle if he wins against Jeff.  And either Kris Lavigne or Matt Berta.  Brandon Gravo
<br/>
had a chance also, but he would have to count on Matt Berta to lose against Kris. 
<br/>
Anyway Chris Hines was Playing Yavin 4 Major Choke with like 5-7 Revos and Dan was
<br/>
playing Court.  Dan takes control of the Chamber quickly and gets a ship to Kashyyyk to
<br/>
drain at.  Chris is have trouble finding all the cards he needs for a beatdown.  Meanwhile
<br/>
Chris is loosing to the Court gametext and the drains.  Soon Chris starts to comeback. 
<br/>
Gets Mutible Destines but Jodo Cast takes one of those away.  Dan Starts battles just to
<br/>
cancel them with Projective and has a steady drain in space.  Soon Chris gets out the
<br/>
Falcon, but Denger and Punishing comes to stop immunity and it didnt last long.  It
<br/>
looked like both players had a chance until Lateral Damage with a track 6 and 5 destiny
<br/>
finished Chris.  Dan wins by 15.  I wasnt watching Kris and Matt to closely, by Matt got
<br/>
his retrieval engine working very good.  Kris didnt have secret plans which he doesnt
<br/>
know why and I am sure he is kicking himself for in now.  Matt was in complete control
<br/>
after he retrieved his lost pile winning by 40. Brandon also won his last game by 34 and
<br/>
went to check if Kris won his game, because if Kris did Brandon would have been in the
<br/>
final, but as it turned out, Matt won.
<br/>
<br/>
So the final confrontation was going to be Matt Berta vs Dan Christy.  The competition at
<br/>
this tournament was very high and yet everyone was having fun and the sportsmanship
<br/>
was very admirable.  Even the top Nevada players that took each other down were being
<br/>
great when they didnt make the final. We had lots of prize for everyone.  The Top three
<br/>
got T-shirts from my personal collection. During the rounds to discourage people from
<br/>
stalling I had a special prize for the first person done with the game.  And even something
<br/>
special for the most creative deck title.  Here are the standings of the tournament.  I put
<br/>

Wow I bet your are wondering who played the 60 random cards deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Well there you have the standings. You can stop here if you want, or you can read the
<br/>
Final Confrontation.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Final Confrontation
<br/>
<br/>
Dan Christy is Dark playing Court and Matt Berta is Light playing Falcon Deck.  This
<br/>
game is close the whole time.  Matt is getting burned for a while at his Holo Table because
<br/>
Dan is drain there with a Monnok for a few turns. Soon Matt takes it back with a POAS
<br/>
and the Super Falcon comes out and dominates space for the whole game, but Dan was
<br/>
taking care of Order to Engage by starting a battle retrieving and then playing Projection
<br/>
of Telepathy for most of the game.  I like to count mistakes people make during games
<br/>
and this one was full of mistakes.  First of all Dan forgot a Total of 12 TIMES to use
<br/>
Courts Game text to make Matt lose force and on top of that for at least 5 turns that I
<br/>
noticed Dan Occupied 3 Battle Grounds and still allowed Matt to drain for 3 at Kessel
<br/>
with Resistance out.  Matt made very few mistakes that I noticed.  He Retrieved a lot
<br/>
during this game which almost made it go to time.  The game was close with it being over
<br/>
in 59 Min and 24 Seconds.  Dan Wins by 6.
<br/>
<br/>
Close Matt only needs to win by 7 or Dan needs to stop him.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 of the Final Confrontation
<br/>
<br/>
Matt is playing a Hunt Down with Fake Duel.  He makes people play with caution with
<br/>
the dueling, but doesnt have any dueling in his deck.  Dan is playing a Yoda Hut Start
<br/>
with Goo Nee Tay and twix Sites...he has 2 battle grounds in there just in case, but plays
<br/>
them only if he needs them.  Anyway Dan seems in complete control of this game early on. 
<br/>
He take out Vader after Vader with destiny 5s.  Matt is making a lot of mistakes like
<br/>
forgetting to Altar Goo Nee Tay when he has 2 Altars in his HAND...and it was on the 7
<br/>
side of Hunt down...what is up with that  Soon Matt brings out more Vaders and takes
<br/>
out Obi and crew.  Now Dan is stuck with putting down Scrubs or looking for Obi.  Luke
<br/>
is stuck at the Med Chamber and cant drain because of the 7 side of Hunt down and Dan
<br/>
cant flip it back, because Matt keeps sensing his Nabruns.  At towards the end of the
<br/>
game Matt has 6 cards in his life force and Dan is thinking about Drawing up to make it a
<br/>
Tie in the Final and Matt quickly Altars Something and even did a successful Elis to bring
<br/>
up his Life force.  Dan now decided not to draw up because of this and lets Matt Drain
<br/>
him out and bring up his life force.  Matt wins by 10 force.
<br/>
<br/>
Matt Berta 2(+4)
<br/>
Dan Christy 2(-4)
<br/>
<br/>
Wow.  What a Final Confrontation.  Congratulation to Matt Berta for being the Nevada
<br/>
State Champion of the Year 2000.  And the Runner up Dan Christy.  Both will get a bye
<br/>
into Day 2 of the Continental Championships at Gen Con and I wish them luck if they go.
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of pictures were taken that I will probably post on my web site.  I really enjoyed
<br/>
running this tournament and will be looking forward to the next big one here.  Of course
<br/>
even though I enjoyed running it, maybe the next one I will be playing, who knows.
<br/>
<br/>
Until Next Time,
