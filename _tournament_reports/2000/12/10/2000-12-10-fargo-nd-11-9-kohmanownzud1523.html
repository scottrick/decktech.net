     The tournament in Fargo was an anticipated one to say the least.  The prize was Luke and Vader UR foils, and I knew that selling those would get me close to out of debt (from all the $ I spent going to Gen Con, Regionals, and the Pre-Release).  Jonathon Swenson was running it, so even if I don’t win, I figure I still got to talk to him... and he’s a nice guy.  Its about two weeks before the tournament, and currently Scott Poster is giving me a ride.  Zack Stenerson (the local player that wins all their tournys) doesn’t sound like he’ll be able to play on AIM.  I’m getting kind of giddy, because I can beat a bunch of locals hands down, and I need that prize.  And then Mike Raveling and Graham Neil decide to drive down, and it turns out Zack freed up the day.  I got my work cut out for me now.
<br/>
     The night before the tournament Scott Poster calls me. It turns out he’s heading up that night to go to some bars with a couple of friends from college.  I’m only 15, and therefore, couldn’t join him, and am stuck without a ride.  POOP SUCK CRAP!!!  It all works out OK though, because I call a bunch of different SMs, and finally get ahold of Chris Perman.  He gives me Raveling’s phone number, and Raveling had offered me a ride before, so I’m back in the business.  
<br/>
     I set my alarm for 8:30, and go to bed around midnight.  7:30 comes around, and it turns out I heard Mike wrong on the phone... he’s ringing the door bell.  I take a shotgun shower, grab some Granola bars, and we’re off!
<br/>
     The ride up was pretty uneventful, except for seeing several poor basterds in the ditches.  We finally get there (after a 3 hour drive), and I talk to Stenerson and Swenson.  It looks like it’ll be a decent sized turn out.  I trade with the locals, and we begin the tournament with 27 people.  Going into this tournament, I am rated 1927, and finally broke the top ten of the bespin region.

<br/>
Darkside:  HDADTJ Dueling Kohman style.  This deck has a little bit of meta for everything, just enough to give me the edge.  It runs 2 Janus’s and 3 Masterful Moves, so tracking it just that easy.  It uses the usual IAO/Mob Points, though starts the third effect depending on the opponent.  I took out Security Precautions, and that really sucked... though we’ll discuss that later.
<br/>
<br/>
Lightside:  I posted this deck on D-Tech already.  Its a Hardcore EBOX deck, and will do damn good against nearly all decks that you can match it up with.  The only change I made was adding an Ice Storm.  I don’t see the Spiral the entire tournament.  I NEVER drew it up...
<br/>

<br/>
Game 1:  Light VS Graham Neils PRODIGY!
<br/>
     Well that just figures.  First game is against someone I had to drive up with.  POOP SUCK CRAP.  I know this game will be pretty fun though, being as how we’re both good players, and are really easy going in tourny play.  I don’t get an X-Wing in my starting hand, and thats bad because now I can’t do a rush drain of three at the D*.  I get lots of stuff I need to set up EBO though, and get it going either 2nd or 3rd turn with Obi, Zev, and Hobbie.  He lays down CBHYBC, which is bothersome.  I get my Alter though, and torch it to his used pile.  I put an X-Wing to Alderaan for a safe drain of two for a turn.  I then send two X-Wings to the Death Star for my little drain of 5.  He comes down with Zuckuss, but I have Rapid Fire in my hand, and torch the basterd with an X-Wing Laser Cannon.  On my turn I drain for quite a bit, and put of more systems with an X-Wing at all the 6-8 parsecs (Tatooine and Endor), and 2 X-Wings at all the 0-2 parsecs (Kiffex, the Deathstar).  He can’t stop any of the drains, and starts drawing.  I drain him for 15 on my turn, which is harsh.  He comes down again with Zuckuss, and destroys an X-Wing.  On my turn I lay an X-Wing with a cannon... and I’m sure you can guess what insued.  I eventually drain him out...

Game Two:  DS vs Local’s EBO/Baragwin Deck
<br/>
This was an easy game for me.  I just set up Emperor/Janus and Vader/Tarkin on the ground and he never came down.  They we’re at the Death Star Docking Bay, and the Cloud City Docking Bay, so he couldn’t Projection me.  He doesn’t use the Baragwin retrieval very well, because he’d just retrieve on his turn instead of losing the same card multiple times and retrieving it.  He finally tries something in space, but my starships take care of him.  He doesn’t drain until his last turn of the game when I had cards in my hand to spare.  I felt a little bad, it was kind of a slaughter.  He took it well though.

Game Three: DS vs Mike Raveling’s THATS A LOT OF SYSTEMS hb
<br/>
He set up super fast in space, and I got out No Bargain and S&amp;D pretty quickly.  I was making him lose 2 and 2, while he was draining me fast and furious in space.  I lost quite a bit of force fast this game.  He had a total of 12 different systems in his deck, and tons of X-Wings.  All he really did was spread out to 7 systems, flip, and shut my drains down on the ground.  I went to space to try to probe, and eventually I got it though it was already too late, as his HB was one of the last planets I probed.  Jedi Luke goes down with a tracked five and eliminates Vader, which canceled S&amp;D and made me lose to Visage as well, though the game was pretty much already over.  I still drilled him down as much as I could.

Game Four: LS vs Raveling’s BOOYA SUPER FALCON tie deck
<br/>
His deck was really original.  It used Its An Older Code, SCrew, Set For Stun, and I’ve Lost Artoo to get around the super falcon.  I set up EBO late, beccause he keeps Set For Stunning my 3rd guy, Zev.  Eventually I get it going, the only Systems on the table is Endor, Wakeelmui and Kuat.  He had been draining at Endor for a while, but I had been cancelling it with Rebel Fleet.  Finally I move from Endor to Wakeelmui with a single X-Wing (whats wrong with this picture).  He lays down Zuckuss, and battles.  I rapid fire to get a Laser Cannon, so he Projective Telepathies the battle.  At this point he moves Zuckuss to Endor, we both realize that I couldn’t my move the X-Wing as he can’t move the Misthunter.  Oh well, we both missed it.  It was a foible.  He decides to move it to Kuat.  I set up my drains, and he is only activating around 10 force which isn’t enough because his Tie Scouts take 4 to deploy.  I drain steadily, and it eventually ends.  I feel bad because my victory is tainted by the endor to wakeelmui movement.  I think he feels a tinge frustrated too, if not just because he lost to Kohman.  What can you do though.

Game Five:  DS vs Graham’s Deadbolt Pile
<br/>
DAMMIT AND POOP SUCK CRAP!!!  I have to play the two people I rode up with a total of 4 times in the tournament.  I play them a couple times every month.  Oh well, this is a fun game.  It takes me a while to get a Vader, though the Emperor and Janus are doing their jobs at a docking bay.  Finally he lays down Tycho and Han with Blaster to the Holotheatre cancelling visage.  I look at my hand.  I have Vader/Saber, 4-LOM and Iggy in addition to CBHYBC.  I lay all three down on them, pretty sure I’ll get on @#$%ing beatdown.  I battle, and 4-LOM anally probes Han.  Iggy goes for the Capture on Tycho and misses.  POOP SUCK CRAP.  Vader swings and hits Tycho, and we draw battle destiny.  I get a 1 and a 2 which is horrid for my deck, while he draws a 2.  I lose 4-LOM and clear the site.  I move Vader to the Executor DB and leave Iggy at the Meditation Chamber.  Finally Vader gets to the D* docking bay, while Emperor and Janus are still causing trouble at he CC docking bay.  He lays down Leia, Han, and Tawss, then realizes my objective is flipped, and he has a Skywalker.  I move Vader there and its then his turn.  He lays Luke down, and I force torch Han.  He then battles.  He swings and hits Vader, and I hit Luke.  Leia misses Janus.  He draws a 3 for battle destiny, and I draw a 2.  When the dust clears all thats left is Tawss and the Emperor.  He moves Tawss to the D* DB.  I play No Bargain and retrieve the Vader with Saber into my hand.  I then proceed to beat the hell out of Tawss with Vader and Tempest 1.  He loses Tawss and 11 force or so.  He’s annoyed, because he should’ve spared Leia instead of Tawss, because in a situation like that he could’ve On The Edged her.  He can’t really mount another offense, and I win.

Going into the final game I’m in second place behind the undefeated Zack Stenerson.  I’m the same Allegence as him, se he has to play Raveling’s DS deck, and I know Zacks play Super Falcon.  If Raveling can win by enough, and I can win by enough I got the tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Six:  LS vs Local’s speeder bike ROps
<br/>
I’m a bit concerned about this game.  ROps usually fairs pretty well against EBO.  He apparently get a really good hand, though I’m unconcerned.  2nd turn I move 2 X-Wings to Ralltiir, and start setting up EBO.  Around 3rd or 4th turn EBO comes out, and he still doesn’t have a starship to take Ralltiir back.  I’m cancelling his drains on the ground with Rebel Fleet, and my 2 Projections.  Finally I set up EBO and start to spread out.  Finally Zuckuss goes down to Ralltiir and gets barriered, though that flips his objective.  Then IGGY/2000 comes down to Tatooine, and a battle insues.  I use Organized Attack, and he draws battle destiny.  I keep the X-Wing there, and lose 2 force.  On my turn an X-Wing Laser Cannon comes down and blows Zuckuss like a 2 dollar whore.  Zuckuss makes another appearence, and the same result occurs.  I drain him out, and play All Wings to retrieve all but one card.

<br/>
The Raveling/Stenerson game is finishing as I report my scores, and I goto watch it.  Raveling is winning hardcore, and it turns out the game ends in his favor by 28 force.  Swenson plugs the scores into the computer, and it turns out I took the tourney!!!  SWEET!!! MY DEBT IS THAT MUCH CLOSER TO BEING PAYED!!! I’M GOING TO DISNEY WORLD!!!  After that, we go to Perkins, and talk with Stenerson and Swenson.  We eventually mozey onto our drive home.  Raveling drives 45 mph the first leg of the trip because its snowing, and because of all the wind its nearly a white out.  I finally get home after the 4 hour car drive.  Thanks for reading.  I hope I didn’t bore anyone too much. </font></td>
