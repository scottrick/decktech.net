<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Tournament is at noon, some of the players
<br/>
are traveling 200+ miles in the near blizzard conditions.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I’m playing hidden ebo v 1.5, and Cole Ryba’s tie deck
<br/>
<br/>
First Match:
<br/>
<br/>
i get paired against some wash-up scrub, who is just
<br/>
getting back in the game.  My hidden/ebo against his
<br/>
i don’t even remember what he played.  This guy played
<br/>
twilek advisor for his starting effect, i beat him without
<br/>
lifting a finger, he said, "wow, you played great",  I
<br/>
win by 17.
<br/>
<br/>
Second Match:
<br/>
<br/>
Against Shane Butler, and old nemesis.  My ties against
<br/>
his mind what you have learned/super falcon/on the edge
<br/>
deck.  He cheats a small bit buy saing he dropped yoda
<br/>
from his reserve for -2 when it came from his hand.  I
<br/>
whip on his superfalcon for his loss of 13 force, he
<br/>
mis-counts tracked destiny for on the edge, he stalls
<br/>
the game out, i get a timed win +22.
<br/>
<br/>
Third Match
<br/>
<br/>
Against Zach.  My Ties against his mind what you have
<br/>
learned/superfalcon/on the edge deck.  He spanked me,
<br/>
I drew up.
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth
<br/>
<br/>
Hidden ebo vs Brian herold’s hunt down.
<br/>
<br/>
he epic dueled my obi at ehco docking bay, and lost.
<br/>
i didn’t play smart and lost the match.  harold is very
<br/>
wormy to play against.
<br/>
<br/>
fifth:
<br/>
<br/>
my hidden ebo against gabe andersons bring him before me.
<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of this match, some newbie scrub that had
<br/>
the bye was running around pissing people off, i get
<br/>
distracted and irritated, couldn’t recover, i lose
<br/>
to gabe.
<br/>
<br/>
6th
<br/>
<br/>
my ties against gary murphy’s ebo y-wing swarm.
<br/>
<br/>
he get’s his ebo set up and on the next turn, he drops
<br/>
7 or so y-wings to 7 different sites, all for free.
<br/>
<br/>
he drains me for 15 the next turn.  my ties and dreadnaughts
<br/>
by some miracle chase him off, i win!
<br/>
<br/>
Josh Kohman ends up winning.
<br/>
<br/>
I’m sure i forgot to mention alot of people, and i probably
<br/>
didn’t spell many names right, but like I said, this is my
<br/>
first tournament report, it’s like playing a new deck,
<br/>
a little strange at first, then later i learn where
<br/>
i could do some improving.  
<br/>
<br/>
After the tournament, a bunch of us went to perkins.
<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to all the guys from the cities, st. cloud,
<br/>
and surrounding nodak places for braving the weather
<br/>
and making this the best tournament i’ve seen
<br/>
in this town in a long long time.
<br/>
<br/>
p’s and s’s
