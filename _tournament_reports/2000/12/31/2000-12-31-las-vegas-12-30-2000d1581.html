This was going to be my first tournament in about 3 or 4 months, actually this was my first constructed tournament since DSII has been released.  Because of my long vacation of from the tourney scene, I had no idea what to expect from all  but a few players and I wasn’t that confident at my chances of taking the tourney.  For light I was playing a Hidden Mains deck that uses Strike Planning and a few scouts.  For dark I was playing a MKOS Scum deck with only two chevins just so I could flip.  Here we go:
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
LS vs. Shane ’Outlaw’ Watners MKOS TIEs
<br/>
I start Strike Planning, Aim High, and Insurrection.  He starts the Desert Heart and Rancor Pit with Mobil Points, Well Guarded, and a couple other effects.  He has two or three systems in his openeing hand, so he drops them.  I pull my stuff like normal and set up some drains with Jedi Luke and Ben Kenobi, each with their lightsaber.  He drops an undercover Labria(his rep) so I sart running away with Jedi Luke.  Labria eventually follows Luke into the Desert Heart.  Since Labria is stuck, I drop a Skiff and move Luke to the Tat. DB.  Nothing else of note really happens.  I did pay a lone interceptor that was sitting a that system SFS goes on a visit with the Tantive and a couple of pilots but could only inflict 5 damage after the TIE was gone.  Never had a chance in space because I couldn’t find a Falcon even though I play 2.  I lose by 9.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I got to use my Skiff
<br/>
Lows: No Falcon for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
DS vs. Shane Watners MWYHL AFA, Superfalcon deck
<br/>
I start to pull my stuff as usual.  Second turn I deploy some guys at the a second site and set-up S&amp;D(I had No Bargain and Bad Feeling out so I wasn’t worried about mains).  His turn he drops Tawss and Melas and clears a site with a high draw, and only Tawss stays.  I draw a couple turns before sending EJP Dengar, IG, and someone elseto Tawss’ site, flip with a chevin at another site, battle, hit Tawss, play Jabba’s Through W/You to add a destiny, add a destiny with IG, and hit Shane for 19 damage.  That was basically game since he lost his only Kessel because of that.  He would just play AFA and I would cancel with Projective has I drained him for two or 3 a turn.  Oh yeah, I had to kill EPP Obi a couple times and EPP Leia once, they kept hiding out in the desert heart to drain me for 2.  Win by somewhere in the teens.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beatdown, drawing  destiny of 19, revenge.
<br/>
Lows: People draining me at the desert.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
DS vs. Jeff ’I’m Gay’ Lavigne’s TIGIH Ewoks and Scouts
<br/>
This game was weird.  I took awhile to set-up while he was really quick.  I controlled his early drains with Control before I started to fight him on Endor.  I thought I was going to lose but I was able to kill Midge and Kazak which made his drains suck ass.  His characters were dying while mine kept coming back( I had 3 or four characters that I only play one of hit the table at least twice).  I eventually pull the game out.  Win by somewhere in the teens.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Control, regenerating aliens.
<br/>
Lows: Ewoks always scare me.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
LS vs Kris ’VegasPimp’ Lavignes Hunt Down Dueler
<br/>
All the battlegrounds that this deck has are systems so I knew he would have to play POTF on his Med. Chamber or go to one of my DB’s before Visage worked.  I bided my time before deploying my battleground DB’s.  I waited until POTF was on the Med. Chamber and then deployed the Tat. DB.  I sent a whole @#$%load of guys to to Tat DB including Ben &amp; Luke, both with there blades.   I also take control of Endor with Home 1 and Falcon.  He deploys DLOTS with a ssaber and doesn’t battle/duel on his turn.  During my control phase he disarms Ben and then duel.  He draws three 6s, I lose Ben and nine.  I deploy a couple more characters, battle, levitate vaders stick, he loses vader and some extra.  I continue to drain.  He eventually deploys Jade to fight, she dies as do a couple of my scrubs.  I send some guys into the Executor via POTF to start draining.  Vader comes to duel Luke but loses due to the Jedi Knights awesome gametext.  I win by something in the teens.
<br/>
<br/>
High: Luke beats Vader.
<br/>
Low: Vader beats Ben.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
LS vs Jeff Lavignes Hunt Down Dueler
<br/>
Once again I only deploy my Tat. DB and put a @#$%load of people there. He tries to bother me with EJP Dengar, EPP Fett, and Dr. E but has to lose everything and a few more via Fallen Portal.  I also take over my Endor with Home 1 and a couple pilots.  He decides to deploy EPP Vader and duel, he plays focused attack but Luke still wins by 1.  Jeff basically commits suicide after that.  I win in the 20s.
<br/>
<br/>
High: Luke wining another duel even though I’m not packing any duel protection.
<br/>
Low:  I didn’t draw and Insurrection Planning the whole day.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
DS vs Matt ’Phobos’ Berta’s Throne Room Mains
<br/>
We’re at the top table and Matt is the only undefeated.  Even if I slaghter Matt it is unlikely that I will win becase his diff is so high.  Slow start for me except for Bad Feeling being in my hand.  It takes 24 force before Jedi Luke can get past my defenses.  Skirmishes start to occur in the Audience CHamber every turn.  I miss Jedi Luke with Hidden Weapons twice.  I eventually have to run away from the Audience Chamber, draw a few, and save up for a turn.  Then Mighty Jabba returns along with EPP Fett, EJP Dengar, Dr. E and Bib.  We battle and Hidden Weapons finally works on Luke, so he is captured by Fett.  This leaves my squad fighting Jeroen Webb and Major Hass’an.  After the surgery I as only fighting Hass’an.  He takes about 20 damage for that battle, and I wasn’t even flipped.  We also skirished at the Desert where Mara Jade killed his second copies of EPP Han and EPP Leia.  He soon draws up.  I win by 29.  If he wouldn’t have drawn up I would have retrieved another force and won by 30.
<br/>
<br/>
High: Beatdown, showing Matt that being an Atheist is truly more powerful than being a satanist.
<br/>
Lows: He didn’t give me any force.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matt still takes 1st because of his diff, I take 2nd, and other people come in behind us.  I get some reflections, Jabba’s Palace, Endor, and CC for support. . . I think.  Nothing great in the packs though.  So for my first post DSII constructed tournament I take 2nd out of 15, missing first only be differential.  Not too shabby.
<br/>
<br/>
After the tournament 8 of us went to Applebees.  The waitress carded everybody who ordered alcohol and was proabbly pissed that she got our table being that we were loud and unruly.  My food sucked, except for the appetizers and fries.  Shane Watner and our TD Dan ’Mystikal’ Christy aren’t real men so they got chick drinks.  I probably have to go to and win the tournament next weekend, if I have time.
