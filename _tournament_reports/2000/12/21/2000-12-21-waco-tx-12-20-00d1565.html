<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After going to absolutely NO tournaments since August, it was time for hoostino to get his game on. Despite it being a Wednesday afternoon, and in Waco, where I have never heard of anyone playing, I made an hour-long journey with old friend and vet Sam Pavlak, who came down from Arizona to hang with his former chums. Sam hasn’t played since before the release of DSII, so I built him a few decks to play with and tried to get him up to speed on all of the new cards. 
<br/>
For LS, I took a Hidden Mains deck, New Age Soul Reaver-style, just with no Revos and more characters. For Dark, I had difficulty in finally deciding to use my improved Epic Hunt Down. For Sambo, I built a mad Agents/Fan deck, and a teched-out MKOS Abyssin deck. 
<br/>
Much to our dismay, only 8 players showed up, but hell, if it’s sanctioned, I’m game. Moving on...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS vs Mark Couture’s Flipping Court
<br/>
He sets up pretty quick with a few dudes in the Chamber along with Presence, yet no Scum. He is using mad Imperials, too, as I discover later in the game. After three turns, I get Ben, JK Luke, and Lando With Vibrator to the Chamber and clear the site. He keeps coming back, and eventually gets most of my mains off the table. He even eats Lando with the Rancor. However, the On and Off The Edges keep my mains recycling and I keep bringin’ da drain pain until he can’t take it anymore. 
<br/>
Full Win by 23 2(+23)

<br/>
Game 2 DS vs Donald Beckham’s EBO X-Wings
<br/>
Not much activity for the first turn or two, I drop Vader and flip on turn three. He Terminates my first Visage, but I quickly Move for another one and set it up again. He gets EBO up and running and begins to drop and drain with X-Wings. No Incom on the table, so I go to space with Bossk In Bus and Zuck In Hunter. I clear many X-Wings by tracking, but he is able to get off at least a drain of three per turn. But Visage and Search And Destroy are thinning his deck. I Sniper an early Boussh, and proceed to drain him out.

Full Win by 18 4(+41)

Game 3 DS vs Sam Pavlak’s Chadra-Fans
<br/>
Sam is going to easily be my toughest competition, despite his lack of experience with DSII and beyond. He wrecked an Epic Hunt Down in Game 1, so I was kinda sweating this. He gets up and running somewhat quickly, but I take complete control of Tatooine by the third turn. A first turn Vader allows Visage to wreck him, and he is never able to recover enough to put up a fight on Tatooine. He eventually comes down swinging, literally with EPP Luke. He takes out Vader and a scrub pilot. Next turn, I drop another Vader and clear out his Fans. I built his deck, so I knew to avoid all docking bays and interior sites, as the deck has like 3 Fallen Portals and 2 Blast The Door, Kid!. He tries to get a few drains off, but he never saw one of his two Tesseks (even though he used 4 YWTMTJN and I had no SAC), and my drains and Visage (he was unable to find my anti-Hunt Down tech, Figrin Dan) did him in despite a first turn Bargaining Table.

Full Win by 20 6(+61)

<br/>
Game 4 LS vs Nick Fehring’s Strange Bespin/Bad Feeling Have I start
<br/>
This dude was the only other undefeated player going into the final game, but I failed to see how after seeing his weird start. Oh well. He sets up pretty quickly with Mara and Saber at the Lower Corridor on Turn 2. I can only stare at the Ben and Jedi Luke in my hand, and I draw. I drop Ben, Alter BFHI, and deploy Jedi Luke. He sets up Baron in Saber 1 at Bespin. I look in my hand and find I already have the Super Falcon ready to go. Next turn, here it comes and lays the smackdown on the Baron. I Tunnel Vision for Obi and Lukes’ Sabers, and drop Menace Fades. He is locked down at this point, and I have an almost untouchable drain of 5. I Edge to retrieve most of my lost pile, and the tournament is easily mine. 
<br/>
Full Win by 28 8(+89)
<br/>
<br/>
Sam took third after getting a timed win in Game 4. Pretty solid for someone who hasn’t played a game in seven months. 
<br/>
It felt good to finally get back in the tournament scene. After a grueling semester, I was ready to start playing as much as I can. I had no time for SWCCG much at all. But, the semester yielded a 3.76 GPA, so I’m happy. 
<br/>
Not much else to say.

Darwin bless. Hoostino out.  </font></td>
