<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Our last Tourney of the year was a rare 3 rounder. There was quite a good turnout with I think over 20 players. For DS I was playing a SYCF Big Blue beatdown and for LS I was using a Hidden Mains beatdown based off a deck by Paul Evans. My rating going into the tourney was 1696. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
My DS vs Michael Holroyd’s(1500) Rescue the Princess
<br/>
<br/>
At the start he told me it was his first Tourney so I wasn’t to concerned. I started Mob. Points, IAO and Battle Order. He started Wise Advice, Insurrection and something else. It was a fairly quick game. First turn i pull a DB and D* war room and just draw. He deploys a bothan spy and Han Solo to the Yavin 4 DB and plays that Utinni Effect(Prisoner 2187?) on the corridor targeting the spy and moves to the D* DB. I don’t want the princess freed so I deploy Lord Vader w/stick and ECC 4LOM, slash the spy and kill Han to attrition. That was almost game right there. He spends the rest of the time trying to free Leia while I set up in space with some Star Destroyers and Admiral Chiraneu at Kiffex and Rendili and drain him out. I win by 20.

2(+20)
<br/>
Highs: quick easy win
<br/>
Lows: waiting almost 45 minutes for my next game
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
My LS vs Matt Balderston’s(1503) SYCF Ties
<br/>
<br/>
I start Insurrection, Strike Planning and Battle Plan. He started Oppressive, Comabat Response and Mob. Points. His first turn he puts out Wakawhatever so I figured...great....Tie swarm, and I was right. He sets up Interceptors all over the place while I try to find some Cloud City sites and puc to drain at....which is not going to well so I make the mistake of deploying to early in space with Home One, Ackbar, and his officers along with Tantive and Spiral. That might have been ok but I decided to be stupid and seperate the smaller capitals from Home One. Can you say Interceptor beatdown? He had a power 54 Ties to my power 19 Home One at sullest. Home One, Ackbar and his crew plus some more gone just like that. I finally got puc and lower corridor w/Obi Wan there and Jedi Luke and stick at the D* DB for some draining but his retrieval was too much...he spread in space  and drained me out. Loss by 14.
<br/>
2(+6)
<br/>
Highs: Umm...still having a positive differential?
<br/>
Lows: Completely dominated in space.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
My LS vs Phillip Rowell’s(1625) BHBM
<br/>
<br/>
Whenever Phillip and I play the games are usually close and go either way. This was a very interactive game and I’m trying to remember it but some of the details may be out of order. I start Insurrection, Menace Fades Strike Planning. He starts IAO, Oppressive and I think No Escape but I could be wrong on that. We spend the first couple of turns pulling sites/systems and setting up our activation. He makes the first move by deploying Palpy and Mara w/stick to the Endor DB. So I pull Jedi Luke from Reserve and deploy him and his stick there. I clash Mara and battle Palpy, he draws a zero for battle destiny to my 1...he ops to losing 5 instead of Palpy. His turn he moves Palpy away to the D*2 DB and draws. I set up CC with puc, epp han, Tawss and ECC Lando and leave Luke where he’s at. we battle back and forth on CC with my crew and his Mara and some other scrubs. He wears me down a little and I run. I set up Home One and crew at Mon Cal and get Menace in affect so he soesn’t get his drain bonuses from Janus and Mara’s stick. Vader finally comes down and captures Luke(I’m not sure why he waited as long as he did) He duels once and I lose 3. Time is getting close and I get an Off the edge played. We are both low in our force pile and he makes the mistake  dueling and using the last 2 cards in his reserve deck when he needed to battle on CC or lose to OTE(we tied on the duel). Anyways time is called and I get to finish my turn and play an off the edge to win it. Timed win by 16.
<br/>
3(+22)
<br/>
Highs: Fun game...lots of battles.
<br/>
Lows: timed win
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
My DS vs Paul Jasen’s(1346) TIGIH
<br/>
<br/>
Another very quick game. It looked like he was trying to do a blow up the bunker thing. I deploy Vader and stick to the Endor DB to s*rew his activation right off the bat. He walks Luke over to give him up. I fight some of his scouts and ewoks on Endor while setting up the space crew at Kiffex, Rendili and Corolug. Not much more to write...I killed him with drains in space and waaay over deployed. win by 16.

Highs:winning
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
My DS vs Matt Balderston’s(1503) HB Xwing swarm w/numbers
<br/>
<br/>
Matt loves those swarm decks. I told him it was time for some revenge from our earlier game. 
<br/>
He starts Wise advice, Do or do not and something else. I start Mob Points, IAO and Battle Order. The first couple of turns we take time to set up systems/sites and I get the numbers killer out by turn  so I’m safe from his inserts. I get Executor w/ Chiraneu and a couple of scrub pilots, Dominator w/ Piett and more pilots and a D*squadron Destroyer w/ Ozzel....I’m all ready to use my Imperial Commands. He sets up xwings all over the place with a lando in Falcon. I got great draws and get put out Bossk in bus and ZiMH. He ghkks a little here and a little there. I put Vader w/stick at Endor DB and Mara w/stick at Tatooine DB and he projection of Skywalker both of them. He flips HB and is cancelling some of my big drains at Kiffex and such so I start probing. I find it after 2 turns because I have a lot of ships in space. He spends most of the game dodging the Exec. and tries to pull of an all wings report in at the end but fails the draw. I win by 10 (I think it was more but thats what I have written down here).
<br/>
7(+48)
<br/>
Highs: Dominating in space
<br/>
Lows: not getting out S&amp;D( I need some more Twileks in this deck)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
My LS vs Tristan Batchelor’s(1626) HuntDown
<br/>
<br/>
Another good Game! I start Insurrection, Do or do Not and strike planning. He starts No escape, IAO and something else. I cancel visage 1st turn with a lucky TT. I know Tristan plays heavy dueling so I keep Obi and Luke off the table. He gets Sim Aloo and Janus over to the Home one DB from  the D* DB(I’m not sure why he did that) so I deploy Epp Han, Epp Leia and some other scrub. I hit both of them! He loses a bunch. He gets Palpy, and Vader out and flips then deploys another visage. I eat visage a couple of turns while I set up CC with Puc Ecc Lando Tawss and Han. I leave Leia at the Home One DB since she can’t drain. I then draw Lower corridor and think I’m safe to deploy Obi there but he deploys an ATst to Vaders site...transits then walks into the corridor to duel Obi. Obi out of play and I lose 9...ouch. He’s chasing me around CC while I have Leia with anis stick still at the Home One DB. I set up a few ships in space and get Menace going. He deploys Mara W/stick and Dengar In Punishing One to Home One DB to beat up lone Leia. He initiates..I clash Mara..Ha! He loses the ship plus a few. I’m draining for 2 in space and almost nothing on the ground because he’s chasing me with Vader and Tarkin and scrub. I’m down to like 10 force left. I get a good battle in against Tarkin and Vader and he loses Tarkin and a few. I then have the game winning card in hand. Anger, Fear Aggression. I insert and move all my characters away. He’s paying to drain because of Battle plan. His turn he says he’s going to activate just 1. Bam AFA pops....he loses for it and doesnt have enough force to move his guys around he loses the one card he was holding in his hand...Vaders Obession so I deploy Luke next turn and him and crew beat up Vader...Game. Win by 8. 
<br/>
9(+56) 
<br/>
Highs: Another fun game...clashing Mara at a great time...AFA winning the game.
<br/>
Lows: Obi getting dueled. 
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up coming in 2nd place. Paul Evans took 1st going undefeated. I pulled crap in my prize support but I guess you can’t get lucky pulls every week....last tourney I pulled both Ultra rares in D*2 in 2 packs.
