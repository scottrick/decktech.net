<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I don’t have much of a preamble to this report. The tourney was well attended (30 ish). There was a JP sealed in the morning that I also played in. I took 3rd in the sealed as the top Dark Side player. The only sealed game I lost was to Steve Baroni who hammered me with a godlike starting hand to beatdown a good-sized force I had deployed at the LS desert site.  My best pack pull was a Rancor but I did not get the Rancor Pit or Malakili, so I could not use it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I was using my Huntdown and my Hidden Base Revolver decks that I have used at the past couple of tournaments. On to the Games: 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 
<br/>
My Hidden Base Revolver vs.  Dan ? Not sure of his rating. No Objective. Death Star Start. 
<br/>
I started Hidden Base and deployed Staging Areas, Strike Planning, and Insurrection with HFTMF. What? No objective? I my first thought was manipulation but it was not manipulation. I am really not sure what the focus of the deck was. I do know that he was not prepared for Revolutions. This game was pretty one-sided. I never really saw what he had in mind. He could never muster enough force to get anything going. I was able to knock out everything he put on the table pretty easily.

Highs: My weak light deck gets an easy one under its belt
<br/>
Lows: All too easy
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My Huntdown vs. Steve Baroni 1826 Agents in the Court + Ewoks on Endor
<br/>
Steve has a pretty cool heavy drain deck. Definitely weak to Imperial Decree or Bright Center (if DS is packing Endor ). This was a very close game. Steve started Agents in the Court, Yarna, Uh Oh and anti-SAC (Wise Advise and Do or Do Not). I started he usual Huntdown stuff with Epic Duel and Mob. Points, Insurrection, and Crush. I got Vader down early to a docking bay. Steve Trans Terminated Visage first turn. On his turn, he got down a couple of Endor Sites and set up Bo Shuda and Tessek at the Audience Chamber. My turn, I used No Escape to get back my Visage and I re-deployed it. Steve used Kazak, Ithorians, Tessek, and Ewoks on Endor to get huge drains. I used my characters to block the drains and deal damage with weapons and the threat of dueling. I lost my Secret Plans off the top to a drain, so Steve was able to get a good Nar Shaada Windchimes retrieval. Steve forgot to drain once and he believes it cost him the game. However, in the last couple of turns, I opted not to deploy and move to one of his drain sites. I could have tried to block the drains but I decided to go for the mathematically certain drain victory rather than risk a nasty surprise in a battle.  As it was, I got the full win by 3 force in a nail biter.

Highs: Beating a good player with an innovative deck
<br/>
Lows: Losing Secret Plans off the top. I think I let him get away with draining with Leia once or twice while Huntdown was flipped. The kind of mistake I had better not make against my next opponent
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Huntdown vs. Steve Brentson(2104) HBX
<br/>
Steve started Hidden Base, Anti-SAC, and You Can Not Hide Forever. I started he usual Huntdown stuff with Epic Duel and Mob. Points, Insurrection, and Crush. First turn I drew until I found Vader. We both lost to Visage. On Steve’s first turn, he got a few systems down and deployed Honor Of The Jedi. So, at the end of my turn, I lost off the top of my reserve -- Bossk in Houndstooth. I activated 10 force and deployed Vader to the Executor docking bay, deployed No Escape and got Bossk in Bus back into my hand (also killing Honor - Steve seemed dismayed).  I then deployed Ephant Mon to the audience chamber. This was the classic HD vs. HBX game. Early on I caused direct damage with Search and Destroy, Visage and small drains at docking bays. He got his systems deployed and bided his time. He deployed Bousch to one of my docking bays. IG88 came down and snipered her. TK422 came later and effectively killed a drain. When he finally flipped, I got out Security Precautions and probed the HB correctly on my first try. He lost 8 force to Security Precautions.  I put a small force in space and survived his initial beatdown attempt. Then it was cat and mouse. I moved to block his space drains while trying to avoid getting hammered. He got out the generic forest and put Luke there to flip Huntdown back. I decided not to try to get Vader to the Forest -- this was late game and I had limited force. Instead, I moved Mara and Saber to the Executor Docking Bay to start draining there and place my objective out of play.  I had lost my Secret Plans off of the top of the deck to a drain early on, so he was able to get off a substantial Nar Shaada Windchimes retrieval. It wasn’t enough, though. I hung on to win.

Highs: I won versus a world class player
<br/>
Lows: There was an awkward moment during the game where Steve thought that I’d deployed after drawing. I can only say that I was not doing that and Steve seemed to accept that I was not after I denied it. I would rather have lost than be thought a cheater by a great player.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 HB Revolver vs. Karl Sundberg (1868) Endor Ops Balanced
<br/>
I started Hidden Base and deployed Staging Areas, Strike Planning, and Insurrection with HFTMF. He started Endor Ops stuff plus Oppressive, There is no Try and I forget the third effect. This was another cat and mouse Game. I went to the ground early, figuring he would have a smallish ground force. I revolved everything that it was reasonable to revolve. He played very conservatively, saving force every turn. I was surprised at the size of his ground forces and the relative smallness of his space fleet. We managed to block each other’s drains. I deployed Order To Engage, which was starting to give me an advantage when time was called. I knew that he was up by about 4 force so, I activated to leave 2 cards in my force pile (unfortunately I had tracked for my previous turn but was unsure of these 2 cards) and sent some support for my EPP Leia against his lone Mara. I had to cause him to lose 5 force from his reserve deck. I looked for a docking bay. None in there. It was a destiny 1 and a destiny 5. I showed them to Karl and we knew that it all depended on which was on top. If I reduced her forfeit to zero and win the battle by 5, I win the game. If I missed, I would have to win by 12. The 5 was on top. I hit and won by 6. Timed win.

Highs: This was another nail biter. Great fun against a great opponent.
<br/>
Lows: Well I’d rather not go to time.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 HB Revolver vs. Justin Desai (1778) Huntdown/No Duel 
<br/>
I started Hidden Base and deployed Staging Areas, Strike Planning, and Insurrection with HFTMF. I made a huge slip early in this game. I did not look at the starting cards. I played the game for about 6 turns as if he had Epic Duel on the table. Justin got Vader and Tarkin down quickly despite my attempted choke. I had Luke in my first Draw and could have put him down against Vader and staved off some of the damage. As it was, I kept eating the loss to visage off of my reserve deck (2 Obis and 2 Jedi Lukes). I got Cracken and Orimarko down to the Holotheater to take some of the heat off but Mara and Dr. Evazan came to call. I finally realized my stupidity and deployed Luke but it was too little, too late.  In the meantime, he deployed Visage again to suck away my life force. Praying that he did not have a lateral damage in hand, I deployed a lone Tantive to Carida. But he did have a Lateral Damage. The fact that I made mistakes does not take away from Justin’s victory. He did not make any mistakes.

Highs: Justin is cool. 
<br/>
Lows: Between this and the timed win, I am not going to win the tournament now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 Huntdown vs. Michael Rodriguez(1554) TIGIH
<br/>
I started the usual Huntdown stuff with Epic Duel and Mob. Points, Insurrection, and Crush. He started TIGIH I forget the starting stuff. He deployed Bargaining Table early and went fishing for Eloms. He deployed some docking Bays. He Cancelled Visage early but it didn’t matter. He did not give himself enough force generation and could not muster enough force for an Elom Beatdown. He also let me hold Carida the whole game with one ship. An unfortunate victim of the self-choke.
