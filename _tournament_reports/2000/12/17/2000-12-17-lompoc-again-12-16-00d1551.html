<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings again all and yet another fun filled report for Lompoc...and from me.
<br/>
<br/>
Well Monday rolls around and Sean tells me via AIM that there is gonna be another tournament...where...Lompoc....of course...well I’m sitting there and thinking of what I would play, since last week I went there and I played my favorite BHBM deck (undefeated now in 16 tournaments), but what to do for lightside...that’s a suck. I thought that maybe I would make a new deck...or perhaps just play the Rescue The Princess deck again. That one seems to work quite well. (if your interested it will be posted soon on decktech) So there I am sitting there on Monday thinking do I want to go to the tournament...nah, yeah, nah...yeah...so I mill about and decide later that I may go and go back to work...the next day I am sitting at my computer again and it decides to be stupid and get a virus so I am sitting there w/a Virus infected bomputer and not much to do, AIM and ICQ are both working and some programs are working so I shoot the shiznit w/some people online and talk about decks and stuff and BAM it hits me a GREAT thought for a deck so go the Microsoft Windows (and pray that it’s up and it is) and type out this deck that looks good...but we never know till we try. So I get home throw the cards together and and wait for Thursdays free tournament and see how it does. Well it won both games, so that’s a plus and I figure what the hell I will play this deck at the tournament. So I ask some people if their gonna go and they say no and someone says maybe so I’m thinking cool I have someone to go with and it won’t be just me on that long lovely trek to Lompoc...ewwwwww 75Miles...YUCK! :)
<br/>
<br/>
So I wake up @ 9:30 Saturday morning and get a call from my friend saying that he has to go to work and can’t go DAMN!!!! now do I want to still go...I suppose I do so I check out my decks one last time and head out the door. Making the usual stop at the gas station to fill up first and then get a Pepsi and a candy bar (usually a WHATCHAMACALLIT or a BUTTERFINGERS) they have the best crunchiness sound and that sugar hi that I need for the drive.... If I didn’t mention it I will now I HATE DRIVING TO LOMPOC it’s 75 Miles and it’s a suck when your by yourself. So why do I keep doing it...I’ll tell you why I like beating Joel...no that’s not it (sorry Joel) I like, no rather I love to play this game and so I drive to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say the ride their was quite boring for once...yeah right...4 Cops pulling over a line of cars and a delay as long as day is...sheesh here I am thinking that I am not going to make it on time and think should I speed up...Um, no Cat you shouldn’t...there are 4 (count em 4) cop cars up ahead...and who knows whose in them and are they scanning...so I drive nice and 65 till I get to the Lompoc exit (no cops here, right) WRONG!!!! 2 cop cars sitting on the off ramp and then they decide to move as I start the turn. So for about 8 miles I have 2 cops behind me w/me doing 65 the entire time....man what a freakin suck...then suddenly their lights go on and I look at the speedometer...65...okay what did I do...So I start to pull over thinking that man am I screwed...well I was wrong they just shot right by me and I never saw them again as I drove the rest of the way @ 75 MPH... hehe I love my car.
<br/>
<br/>
So anyhow I get to the tournament and the locals are there and I make 8 so were sanctioned and I am ready to start...thinking okay, I’ll play this person first, then this person second, him third and Joel for the final...well I was almost right...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - yup you gussed wrong, Cat - BHBM vs. Joel Jacksons (infamous undefeated except by me) HB/Kessel Run
<br/>
<br/>
First off I would like to say to everyone and Joel cause I know that hes reading this. That this is a good deck, unfortunately Joel just can’t seem to get that deck to work for him against me, and so it goes down as another victory for me. As usual w/BHBM I start w/D*II War Room (gee go fig), Bring Him Before Me (umm...yeah) Insignificant Rebellion, Your Destiny, Prepared Defense, Mobilization Points, Imperial Arrest Order and Opressive Enforcement. Joel starts w/Rendezvous Point, Hidden Base and some starting stuff...of which I recall one of them is Strike Planning (can’t remember the others) I start normal w/the Emperor paying a visit to the D*II Docking Bay, Rendili in space and a Force Lightning. In my hand I have Janus, Lord Vader, ZiMH and some random Red stuff. I say go and Joel gets out the generals before he activates, then drops a site and tells me to go. I think that he’s learning not to go to space to quick agaisnt me cause I always seem to get something out. And this was no exception, as Joel says my entire unbeatable space fleet that never seems to loose...5 ships Joel that’s all. hehe gotta love that immunity and power. Any how for a couple of turns I’m cycling w/Janus and Force Lightning getting more ships, and Mara and her stick and soem more sites w/Imperal Arrest Order and setting up my cards...eventually dropping Lord Vader to Endor:DB and Mara Jade to Endor:DB and their sticks...then moving LV to Generic DB @ Rendili for Search &amp; Destroy (which I forget almost the entire game - I’m thinking of taking that card out for the amount of times that I forget it’s out I might as well not use it) So I’m force draining and making him loose 3 a turn for a couple of turns (Luke’s in space on a ship...whatcha doing up there Luke your daddy’s down here) So eventually after loosing some Force Joel brings Luke to his daddy and I start loosing a few for a couple of turns...eventually I get Luke w/LV to the Emperor and then to the D*II:Throne Room to turn the prodigal son...which I finally do after which Joel says you have to draw two 1’s for me to win...hehe I do that and knowing that I have a 6 and 5 left I loose the duel, and conver Luke. First time in a tournament that I have done that...thanks Joel. :) (as I know he’s reading this...hehe Sorry man it couldn’t have happened to a nicer kid). So I win against Joel’s undefeated except to me 48-4 Hidden Base.
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 2(+22)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Converting Luke
<br/>
Lows: Playing Joel in the first game
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - My: Hidden Mains (it’s in the Shareware check it out and LMK what you tihnk) vs. Bryan West COTVG
<br/>
<br/>
Bryan sets up the normal stuff and I set up w/Rendezvous Point, Heading For The Medical Frigate, Staging Areas, Strike Planning and Insurrection. Bryan goes first and deploys Boelo to the Audeince Chamber, a good start for guy who can cancel a destiny @ the chambe himself. Usefull no, No, unfortunately it wasn’t. I activated after getting out my generals and deploying the Home One War Room, and deploy Boushh to Boelo to cancel the drain. Leaving the one. In my hand I have Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight, his stick, Han W/Blaster and some red. I activate draw a couple and get Ben and stick and say go. Bryan activates draws a few and says go. I drop Luke Skywalker w/his stick and he gets barried (damn me for not having a sense in my hand) and then I drop Han and break Bousshs cover and initiate a battle, before which I dropped Obi-Wan and his Lightsaber at the Sarlacc Pit. I cap Boelo w/a untracked 6 and draw a 5 Bryan draws something and I loose Boussh and Han walks over to Ben and hangs out there for a while, while Luke Skywalker, JK w/stick hang in the Audience Chamber. Some attempts were made for Bryan when he tried to battle me a few tims but I fallen portaled one of them the more important one when he dropped a couple of Skrillings and Dr. E against Leia W/Blaster and Ketwol @ the Tat:DB I dropped Fallen Portal agaisnt the band and the 2 Skrilling bite the bullet and Dr.E get’s capped and he looses about 5 more of which they were mainly characters. He tried again later to drop Bane Malar agaisnt 2 Leia and Cracken (who moved to the Back Door) and again Fallen Portal fell and Bane died...finally the force drains of 8 a turn were to much and I won out by 30.
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 2(+30) - 4(+52)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Beating Court w/my new deck, and Fallen Portal
<br/>
Lows: Imperial Barrier and me w/o a Sense...damn that would’ve hurt more. Luke, Han, Leia agsinst Boelo. ~smirks~
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - BHBM vs. Chris Chaetlin’s Hidden Base/Spy madness.
<br/>
<br/>
Well this was another HB for me to play. Of all the people I play @ Lompoc I am always playing against a HB deck...ah well. Why should Chris be any different. I start the normal and he starts the normal for HB and get’s the Generals and some stuff and drops a planet or two and I set up w/Janus tech and Emperor and wait for the space. I drop Mara Jade @ Endor:DB and Boussh comes to visit, I drop LV @ Generic Site and a Bothan Spy comes to visit, well that Bothan is met by a swift kick in the butt as Sniper deals him 11 and kills him off...a few looses of 3 and some Force Drains brings Luke to daddy and another Bothan to block. Meanwhile I dropped ZIMH and DIPO along w/Chimera and Sarkli in space and have about 4 cards stacked allready. Sniper makes it’s triumphant return w/First Strike. I track it and Janus it to my hand thus killing that stupid Bothan again and getting LV over to his Master, and them to the Throne Room to start some conversion. Meanwhile his space is depleting as Home One is wounded "Lateral Damaged it when I fought it and he just kept moving it to the new planet) Meanwhile I have Jabba The Hutt sitting @ Generic Site and Mara @ antoher site and Boussh still @ the Endor:DB twiddling her thumbs, he drops the undercover and IG-88 w/Gun come to visit initiate, win the battle and stack another. Finally I have the conversion alomst complete...6 stacked and then I duel w/tracked 1’s and a 5 for the finally. 3 Cards in the deck draw the 2 1’s and all that’s left is a 5 I draw that and Luke comes to the dark side again...WOOHOO!!! not only have I only done that once in a tournament, but now I did it twice and in the same day.... Thanks Chris. :) anyhow I win another one w/BHBM...yeah!
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 2(+22) - 6(+74)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Converting Luke for the 2nd time
<br/>
Lows: Stupid Undercover Spies...damn them.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - Hidden Mains vs....oh my god I get to play his Dark Side for the first time EVER... Joel Jackson’s CCT
<br/>
<br/>
WOW I get to play Joel again...well I was right about one thing I would play him for the finals and I did...Joel starts the normal for CCT and I hand him Tycho who get’s to spend the entire game in the dungeon. Joel doesn’t bother trying to get him for some reason or another...and Bryan tells him to not battle me cause I have Fallen Portals...which is fine w/me cause I will just sit there and do what I wish. Anyhow Joel sets up and drops Boelo to the Audience chamber and Tat:DB and tells me to go. I drop Tat:DB from hand, Home One:DB and Crix and Ishi Tib there they stay there the entire game. I activate for a couple of turns as does Joel and I loose a couple of force for FD’s then I drop Luke Skywalker JK w/stick, Barriers, then Han and some one else...Ben and Ketowl are sitting at the DB and Sim Aloo is sitting at his DB:CC so I move to Sim and don’t battle. He goes and drops Choke Vader and Lightsaber to Luke and Han and moves sim away... I drop Boussh to the boys, and Tawss Khaa and Cracken to Sim battle and make him loose Sim as well I move Ben and Ketwol to the CC:Chamber. Joel decides that he wants to battle and does so before deploying Janus and the Emperor to CC:DB anyhow I moved Han out of the AC a while back to cover w/Tawss for more power and Boussh and Luke sit there he battles I Weapon Leviate the stick to Boussh and think for a moment and then say Mah, Lukes got it and he procedes to choke Boussh good thing I gave the stick to luke. I swing and hit Vader he draws below the destiny but I have power of 9 and he looses Vader and 1. Melas makes a trip to the CC:Chamber and moves to free Tycho but Mara Jade comes down to a Barrier and doesn’t get to free his bud...but Ben moves to Melas, Melas moves to Ketwol and I win by Force Drain because the Emperor can’t move and Janus is with him...so in feeble attempt before I win Brangues makes a charging dash against Han and Tawss and looses to the shot and I recover another full win...Sorry again Joel.
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 2(+25) - 8(+99)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Weapon Levitating Vaders beat stick
<br/>
Lows: Watching Choke Vader, Choke Boussh...Man what a suck!. :)
<br/>
<br/>
Well that’s that and another tournament for BHBM making it 16-0 and my new Lightside 2-0 let’s see if we can’t make a compatibility...

After the tournament I decide I don’t want Taco Bell and I want Fosters Freeze (for those on the East Coast it’s like a Dairy Queen...and if you don’t know what that is picture a burger joint w/ice cream as well) - anyhow Joel, Bryan and 2 other join me and we talk about deck. Joels gonna copy my BHBM and use that next weekend which is his last tournament in CA he’s moving....to bad we’ll miss ya.
