<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First, before I begin, a slight clarification on my name. I am neither 'crazy' nor a 'hermit'. I just don't get outside very much.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was Sunday and I was exceptionally eager to play. I hadn't gotten a chance to play the previous weekend, and my usual Thursday night playing time hadn't been exceptional. I picked up a ride off of Al Schaefer (note: Congrats to Al for his finish at the Normal tournament on the 11th), and we departed, arriving sometime before two. We walk into the shop where the tournament is being held, and find a couple of guys inside already. We find that the tournament is going to start at 2:30, now, despite the fact that we had enough people a good 15-20 minutes before. Like I need more time to instill self-doubt in myself. While on the topic of things that increase my self-doubt, I should mention my decks. Light Side was a beatdown Profit deck that's a blast to play half of the time, Dark Side was the Hunt Down deck I've used for far too long. Then, the tournament pairing are announced, and I make a mad rush to grab a seat at the table, as I really hate to play my games on the floor. For that matter, I hate a lot of things.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, LS against somebody(I hate it when I forget someone's name)'s Dark Side alien/Tusken deck.
<br/>
<br/>
I start Goo Nee Tay and Premiere Han in the chamber, he starts Mos Eisley and converts Jabba's Palce with Combat Readiness. He also drops the SE Jabba and Boelo at the chamber. Already, I'm in a good mood, as while I have Ben Kenobi in my opening hand, I've little else. Next, he deploys the Jundland Wastes and Lars Moisture Farm, converts the chamber, and starts massing troops inside the chamber. He's piling up Tuskens, Taym Dren-Garen, and he actually starts sending banthas with a couple raiders to a few sites. My only move is to deploy Artoo. Next turn, I grab A Gift, move into the chamber and deploy it. I then procede to knock out Mara w/saber using Double Agent, and procede to draw two of everything. I'm starting to get curious as to where Boushh is, where Luke is, where anything is. I'm holding two GoTMs in my hand and no Luke. Finally, I find Luke w/saber and deploy him and Ben together into the chamber for 12 (stupid Bad Feeling Have I). On his next turn, he deploys a LOT into the chamber and initiates a battle. He's got Ephant Mon to suck up any attrition, but when I find he has 30 something power I decide to play Gift Of The Mentor. Mind you, this is after I missed Taym Dren-garen(did hit Jabba) with a saber. 3 stinking 1s. I lose the battle 36-13. I lose Luke and revive for 7, play First Aid and lose Artoo from my hand to cover 5, and slowly lose 11 more. Meanwhile, time is running out. I deploy Chewie w/blaster and Wedge into the chamber, and fight it out some more. Eventually, I start drawing cards other than 0s, and he decides to leave. Good riddance. I break Han out, retreive 10, and drain (figures he'd deploy Den of Theives), he loses 1 from objective. Finally, I Nabrun my 22 power in characters to a site, and wail on some Tuskens, despite his react with a bantha and a couple more. I spread out and make him lose a lotta force real fast, and I win with 1 minute to go before timing out.

Game 2: DS vs Scott Wyngarden's Light Side
<br/>
<br/>
I start Bad Feeling Have I when I see he deploys  Obi's Hut and Careful Planning for the desert and Farm. I thought something smelled fishy. I drop Vader on the second turn to his Lars Moisture Farm and flip, he cancels Visage before long. He deploys a Sandwhirl to the desert, making me less than thrilled. (I recall that these people in Wheaton all play with 5 Controls for such an occasion). I do an impressive job of drawing massive amounts of cards, and attempt an Elis with 3 cards in my force pile. I draw a one and move into Obi's Hut. Before I can begin setting up shop, he brings down Ben Kenobi w/saber and Electrobinocs. He starts setting up a draw, but then realizes he can't initiate a battle, as my objective remains flipped. Ha ha. I bring down Iggy and battle, cancel Obi's swing with Force Field, and make him lose 5. I notice the Sandwhirl has turned direction and is quickly coming towards the Hut. I begin looking for Elis again. Couple of turns later, I Elis Vader out to the Dark Forest, and Obi really is a senile old man wandering aimlessly. The rest of the game is forgettable, just me draining w/Vader at Dark Forest, Mara at Port Town District, re-deployed Visage too.

Game 3: DS against Paul Motz
<br/>
<br/>
This was annoying, and really, really stupid. Now, to the intelligent comments.
<br/>
<br/>
He starts revolver crap, and naturally I start Crush. First turn, he revolves something, and I cancel it with Evader. He then proceeds to Visored Vision it out of my Used Pile. I've had better days. He deploys another Revolution and moves Luke into the Holotheatre. I deploy DLOTS w/Saber to the Port Town District, and deploy CMYBC. Take that, I think. Not so fast. He starts moving Nudjs away, and deploys Obi to the Farm, and Uncontrollable Fury onto Vader. For some odd reason, I forget the entire game to pick up Vader. I lost the game to Uncontrollable Fury, basically. Mara came down to Yavin and paid a little visit, and I did remove Obi, re-flipping. By the end, he can't drain, but I'm losing two a turn anyway and don't have enough cards to hold out. I am not a merry man, put simply.

Game 4 LS against my buddy Paul's Hunt Down Dueler.
<br/>
<br/>
He starts IAO, I start Goo Nee Tay. He deploys a SHINY Endor docking bay first turn and draws. I begin drawing some cards, deciding on whether or not I want to mess with him. DLOTS w/saber comes down and flips at the docking bay. I immediately Tranmission Terminated Visage, and Clashed the POTF that he deployed. He wasn't thrilled, so I felt my day was complete ---permitting I won the game, of course. He deploys Iggy with Gun to the Audience Chamber, as I deployed Boushh to block Vader. Next turn, he Snipers Boushh and drains, I deploy Ben Kenobi w/saber to the chamber. I Disarm Iggy on his turn, which he wasn't too happy about. I break Han out on my turn, drain a little and make him lose a Force. Mara w/saber and Dr. E visit, but I lifted the saber off Jade and beat the whole gang outta there. Then, Master Luke w/Anakin's comes down, and he's losing 4 a turn. He decides that he's has to come to me to kill me. He slowly gets over to the chamber and duels Ben, with no Focused Attack. I draw a 4 and a 2, Glancing Blow one of his 6s. I lay a royal beatdown on a re-deployed Jade the next turn.

Somehow, I ended up with a different differtial than I had at the tournament. It doesn't matter, Paul beat me out by a few anyway. Regardless, I had a great time, and I have concluded I would prefer not to see Tuskens for a while. In addition, I now also hate Uncontrollable Fury.

As a final note, aren't I wordy? </font></td>
