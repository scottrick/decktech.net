<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is the first part of my Tournament Report...instead of
<br/>
making it 7 pages long I've decided to post it in two pieces
<br/>
and expand on it here and there. This also refers to the 
<br/>
song by Orgy and the laughs and fun I had this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I had been looking forward to the March 4th Florida Grand
<br/>
Slam since Neal Razi and David Akers mentioned it at a little
<br/>
card party I had in late January. I had been playtesting decks
<br/>
off and on for awhile trying to come up with fun combonations
<br/>
and good decks. Dark Side was like anything I picked up worked
<br/>
-- ROps , HDADTJ , Courts , even ISB , etc...so the problem I
<br/>
had was finding a Lightside and I waited until the night before
<br/>
to mess around with it and finalize my thoughts. Merritt Island
<br/>
was a nice 1 hour and 40 minute cruise from my hometown of Jupiter
<br/>
at 80 mph. My crew this time was Daniel Blackford and Lee Edwards.
<br/>
From what I had been advertising and hearing there was gonna be a 
<br/>
lot of high ratings there and a lot of good players there.
<br/>
Anyway on to the deck intro : Nine Inch Nails was what I 
<br/>
played on the way to the 'Slam so I figured these titles 
<br/>
corrolated to my decks pretty well. 
<br/>
<br/>
LS - 'The Fragile' - Hidden Base Mains...Beatdown and misc.
<br/>
stuff that I wanted to try out. 
<br/>
<br/>
DS - 'The Wretched' - Switched name of Musician deck...wanted
<br/>
to make it more menacing. 
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament was run by Squadron Members Charles Lund and 
<br/>
Mitchell Velasco and was run very smoothly. 
<br/>
<br/>
Before the tournament I went out to lunch with Mitchell Velasco
<br/>
who is my buddy and I haven't seen in TWO YEARS along with
<br/>
Dan BlackfordÂ…talking about decks and stuff which was pretty
<br/>
cool because at these big tournaments you want to say hello
<br/>
to people you haven't seen and sometimes there isn't enough
<br/>
time. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : ' The Fragile ' versus Andreas S-'s Endor Operations...
<br/>
<br/>
Start : Me - Hidden Base stuff and get Wise Advice. HIM- Endor
<br/>
Ops stuff plus Any Methods Necessary for Death Star Prison and
<br/>
some stuff I can't remember ( didn't matter ). He deploys Ephant 
<br/>
Mon to the Bunker first turn and draws. We both draw like crazy. 
<br/>
I spit out Systems here and there to control his activation. He 
<br/>
deploys M'kae on the Devastator at Kiffex with a Tractor Beam.
<br/>
I make a huge mistake that costs me the game. For some reason I don't 
<br/>
get Draw Their Fire... I attack with Millenium Falcon , EPP Leia ,
<br/>
Cpn Han , Jereon Webb and Tantive 4...he plays the tractor beam junk 
<br/>
to capture my Falcon . WTF ? Duh... anyway I draw my tracked 5 to blow 
<br/>
his stuff up ( and captured loaded Falcon in the process ) ... this
<br/>
was huge because I would've smacked up Dev and played Legendary 
<br/>
Starfighter and he'd been hurting badly from that but I didn't so 
<br/>
I don't. I put down Obi-Wan Kenobi w/ Tawss Khaa at the Docking Bay
<br/>
and deploy Battle Plan to try to slow him down. I also play Descent
<br/>
Into the Dark and Catch most of his Senses and Alters while he is 
<br/>
setting up destinies with Terminal and my Dark , ugh. The sickest thing 
<br/>
was we both had like 30 card hands but whereas his deck would've really 
<br/>
been crippled by Grimtaash mine would've had no problem with Monnok. Anyway
<br/>
Super Falcon comes back out and destroys stuff while I try to Few Manuevers , 
<br/>
Frozen Assets , and Draw Their Fire my way around Tractor Beams. He gets in a
<br/>
few good drains with Endor Ops and he catches It Could Be Worse. He also catches
<br/>
my On the Edges. He also Sensed them once or twice for bad recycling. Basically 
<br/>
he brings down EPP Vader , Mara Jade with Stick , and Tarkin to smack Obi and
<br/>
Tawss and I lose 8 after them. That was basically game. Loss by 16. 
<br/>
Record : 0 ( -16 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Nothing really
<br/>
Lowlights : Playing dumb
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : ' The Wretched ' v. Ira Myers Harvest-ish deck...
<br/>
<br/>
Start : CotV with Surface Defense . Him : Mos Eisley and CP for Farm.
<br/>
<br/>
Well this game also starts out pretty slow too. I start deploying stuff
<br/>
to fortify the Audience Chamber. He deploys the Harvest setup
<br/>
to the Farm very quickly and after he has 4 cards in lost 
<br/>
Pile he plays a Harvest... I Hell to Pay it. After getting
<br/>
a sizeable force at the Audience Chamber I decide to tempt a 
<br/>
Nabrun and he Quite A Mercs it. I drop EJP Dengar ( heheheh - sorry ) ,
<br/>
Lyn Me , Sy Snootles , and a few heavy hitters out to battle
<br/>
the Harvest Crew. Scum and Villiany is up and I start launching
<br/>
an all out campaign on the Tatooine Landscape. Dengar caps 
<br/>
Owen and Beru , Mara Jade w/ her stick finds that Ben Kenobi
<br/>
has a certain kind of magnetism to him-- a Blaster Deflection
<br/>
of some sort. So I drop the Harvest crew -- he played another
<br/>
Harvest to add Battle Destinies but I forfeited out the wazoo.
<br/>
Next turn I get 4-LOM down there and cancel Ben for a turn or
<br/>
two at most  ( Put That Down and Blaster Deflections ! ) which
<br/>
is enough to send his characters running to Mos Eisley. A Musician
<br/>
herd shows up and out powers the Harvest Crew 27 to 3. All of them
<br/>
die and he loses 3 after that. I lose a few guys here and there but
<br/>
when he tries to jump me he can't match my power. Leia and Orrimarko
<br/>
tried to defend the Farm but Brangus , 4-LOM , and the phasing Jabba
<br/>
( I say that because I deployed him probably like 5 times ) ...come 
<br/>
to the farm and get rid of Leia. Orrimarko can only run the next site
<br/>
 over. He puts out Tawss Khaa to the Sarlaac pit and is done.
<br/>
Elis seals it. Win by 22 . Record : 2 ( +6 )
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : This was an Excellent Game...battling all the 
<br/>
way through...very tough played.
<br/>
Lowlights : This is but a SCRATCH of the actually little 
<br/>
nuases that were happening , I wish I had this game on video
<br/>
tape because I would probably watch it over and over again. 
<br/>
The recycling Jabba thing was kinda sick though...but only 
<br/>
Jabba can recycle so much ... Luke can recycle better ;) 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 'The Fragile' v. Ira Myers ROps deck..
<br/>
<br/>
I start everything and Battle Plan. He starts Ralltiir Ops
<br/>
and is puzzled as to what to start so he doesn't start anything.
<br/>
He gets Dagobah Cave out and the sites. I drop 2 systems from 
<br/>
hand , 1 from reserve , and a Dagobah Site from Reserve. BANG !
<br/>
Turn 2 I'm activating 13 Force and am pumped. He flips pretty 
<br/>
early. I save up and Tunnel Vision...and Tunnel Vision. He deploys
<br/>
CBHYBC and Bad Feeling Have I. So my first main(s) force is Obi 
<br/>
and Luke w/ Gift of the Mentor. 'Imperial Barrier you say ? Uh..
<br/>
..Skywalkers...to cancel Barrier , that cancels Barrier ...yep' 
<br/>
... I battle DTF , he reacts a  walker over , I hit Cabbel or 
<br/>
someone like that and clear the site with attrition...this 
<br/>
would be somewhat of a recurring theme. He has his objective flipped
<br/>
and is basically pumping all his force towards being able to draw 
<br/>
destiny at all his Ralltiir Locations. I keep tossing Luke and Obi to 
<br/>
knock out something and draw destiny...Tunnel Vision , wash , rinse , 
<br/>
repeat. Then I decide I need to start retrieving my mains back so I put
<br/>
EPP Leia on the Spiral at Rendezvous Point and move it to Tatooine  , 
<br/>
play Descent Into the Dark , A Few Manuevers on Vader's Shuttle , 
<br/>
On The Edge for 4 , He grabs my On the Edge , and I pay 2 to play 
<br/>
On the Edge again...get back 3 more including mains that I needed. 
<br/>
He attacks my EPP Leia on Spiral with Zuckuss but draws a bad destiny
<br/>
( Even with ROps ) so the Spiral Lives !  Zuckuss must be choking on 
<br/>
his ammonia based atmosphere because here comes Captain Han , Jereon 
<br/>
Webb , and the Millenium Falcon to help the Spiral. Battle 
<br/>
commences I draw my 2 Tracked Destinies...Boom boom...Zuckuss
<br/>
in Hunter goes down along with 4 more... Spiral goes down...
<br/>
Legendary Starfighter HAS LANDED! Aooooga ! Aoooga ! Attention
<br/>
Imperial Fleet : Captain Han Solo has said you must destroy his
<br/>
ship or it will destroy you.  The Navy makes a few more attempts
<br/>
but tracked destinies attrition them down. Obi makes yet ANOTHER 
<br/>
APPEARANCE on Ralltiir for 9 force and takes out Tarkin. The Navy
<br/>
knocks Captain Han Solo out but it appears he was only below deck
<br/>
perhaps paranoid of Lateral Damage. Tracked Destinies and more ships
<br/>
blow up. So the way it stands now I have Hidden Base Flipped...I 
<br/>
control Tatooine and he is at Bothawui and Corulag along with 2 
<br/>
Ralltiir Sites. I have EPP Leia at his Forest after Obi sucked up
<br/>
the attrition. So it is Swamp ( Vader ) - Forest ( Leia ) - and 
<br/>
Prefect Office ( Tempest 4 ). On my turn I activate and play....
<br/>
can you feel it...can you ...can you  possibly guess ? 
<br/>
Tunnel Vision. And I can't help but laugh a sinister and menacing
<br/>
laugh as I take my card into hand from Active Force. I pay 9 Force
<br/>
for EPP Luke for at least the 8th time this game. Battle...Knock 
<br/>
off the Walker... Move Leia away from Vader ( who moved to Leia's
<br/>
site on his turn ) and Flipped Ralltiir Ops back ! It took me about
<br/>
12 Obi/Luke Strikes to do it but I did it...Grand Slam Home Run Baby...
<br/>
now he's in trouble.  I'm draining for only 3 but I have DTF out , he's
<br/>
losing 2 for Legendary Starfighter and Hidden Base is providing the force
<br/>
choke to mess him over. This choke is on the mark and finishes him off. 
<br/>
Win by 12. Record : 4 ( +18 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : heh... I can't help but sit back and have fun
<br/>
with Ira. He is such a funny guy and a good guy to play versus. I really
<br/>
didn't expect our games to be such slugfests and I thought he had the 
<br/>
upper hand in this one...I mean whatever I threw at him he just had more
<br/>
ability 4 combos to get objective enhanced Destiny. I think I snatched this
<br/>
win out from under him. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights : Having to play him again...at least I invited 
<br/>
him over to have some recompense for the nastyness I did to him.
<br/>
<br/>
Coming in Part 2 : Games versus Decktech Citizens : Leonard
<br/>
Mitchell , Hugh Shelton , and CLINT HAYS ! Along with the
<br/>
wrapup stuff.
