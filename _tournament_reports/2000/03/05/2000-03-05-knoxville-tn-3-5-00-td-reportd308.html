<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, after last week's aborted attempt of a tourney (only 6 showed...), I decided to up the ante to get people to show up. I decided to give away an extra box of boosters (I had one extra that I recieved late). I figured that, coupled with Sean Smallman's visit to the area as part of the South East demo tour, we ought to be in good shape. Yep, it turns out we had our largest turnout yet, with some driving hours to come. Sean even donated MORE packs as support. It was VERY sucessful. All said and done we had 16, which is a good deal for our area. So, the combatants in order of placement:

Game 1 matchups and highlights:
<br/>
Jason's Mind What you have learned vs. David Duncan's ISB- Jason is rated over 2000, and David is just a beginner. It was only a matter of time before Jason's hit squad totally decimated the ISB agents. Jason by 23
<br/>
Matt M's ISB's on Hoth vs. Chris's EBO- The ISB's did their job by infiltrating the Rebel's Echo Base. EBO never got deployed and the ISB and walkers dominated Hoth while beating what rebels were scurrying around. Not unlike the movies. Matt by 31
<br/>
Ben's Huntdown vs. Andrew's Profit- Ben's Huntdown got an early lead, but Andrew freed Han and flipped his objective, while outdraining and causing the force loss from Profit. Towards the end battling took place, but Andrew came out on top, even winning an Epic Duel. Andrew by 8.
<br/>
David W's Profit vs. Rob Schenk's Court deck- David's profit got the jump on Rob's deck, and Master Luke and crew freed Han after a few short battles. The retrival and the build-up of mains had Rob down. David by 26.
<br/>
Craig's JP deck vs. Joseph's Ewok deck- Craig starts off by setting up the Gailid drains, while Joseph has his Ewoks on Endor doing their thing. Criag decides to have Dr. Evazan and Bossk w/ Gun to wipe out the Ewoks at the back door. Well, after a well drawn Wicket exclusion, a few sentries deployed as reacts, Dr. Evazan was hurt.. badly. Then the excluded Bossk has no where to run and gets killed. EWOKS WIN! by 35, too... very nasty.
<br/>
John's Manipulator vs. Matt G's Cloud City deck- Scanning Crews, Dangerous times and all other manipulator cheese worked well against Matt's Light CC deck. Meanwhile, Vader, Mara and Bane Malar kept Endor free. John with a big 40 win.
<br/>
Ross's Hidden Base vs. Thomas's Rumors deck- Space against space. VERY close and good game. In the end, however, Thomas had probed Ross's hidden base and had ground drains going. Thomas by 16.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 matches and highlights:
<br/>
Jason's Hunt Down vs. Thomas's Hidden Base- Very close game, but in the end Jason got his ships going and Visage hurt Thomas. Jason by 15.
<br/>
Matt M's Hidden Base vs David Wood's Court- Matt got an early jump, and flipped relatively early. Since Court decks have very little in terms of drains, an early flip noramlly means its demise. Matt by 20.
<br/>
Ben's Hidden Base odds vs. Todd's Endor Ops- Ben flipped early and kept sending EPPs to stop Todd from flipping his. The odds really added up in the end, as well. Ben by 18. 
<br/>
Odie's profit vs. Andrew's Rumors- This game was very close. With Andrew getting rumors set up early and draining alot in space, and Odie retrieving, and also draining alot, it was close. In the end, Rumors won. Andrew by 3.
<br/>
Craig's beatdown vs. Matt G's CC deck- Craig gets his hit squads out early and fast, and beats down everything that Matt can play. Matt simply couldn't get his locations out. Criag by 25.
<br/>
John's speeder ops vs. Joseph's Dark Deal- Speeder Ops flipped first and had just too many drains going on. John by 22.
<br/>
Ross's Dark Deal obj vs. David's Hidden Base- David is a beginner and allowed his fleet to get wrecked by Bounty Hunter ships, as well as let Ross get Dark Deal going. Ross by 21.
<br/>
Rob's EBO vs. Chris's Huntdown- Vader and crew visited Hoth and wrecked everyone trying to set up EBO. Chris by 40.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 matchups and highlights
<br/>
Jason's Mind What you have learned vs. Andrew's Rumors- Jason's pulls off the first test, thus killing the point of Rumors. Jason by 23.
<br/>
Matt M's ISB vs. John's speeder ops- A well-timed 9 Imperials and a Vader by 4th turn along with a Jedi presence will hurt any deck. I believe over a 30 force loss during one battle Ouch. Matt by 36.
<br/>
Ben's Huntdown vs. Joseph's Ewoks- Vader slays more of the midgets. Plent were choked too. Ben by 35.
<br/>
Odie's Profit vs. Thoma's Rumors- Odie frees Han, retireives and then a drain race begins. However, Thomas had trouble controlling the sites, as Odie was battling on Endor. In the end, this battling paid off, as Odie won by 20.
<br/>
Craig's JP vs. Ross's Hidden Base- Craig got his ships and his pilots relatively early on, and was able to outdrain the Hidden Base deck for the win by 33.
<br/>
Rob's Court vs. Matt G's CC deck- Rob got aliens out quickly, while Matt lost 1 force for a few turns before deploying to Jabba's palace, and then getting beat. He did get some retrieval going, but it was too late. Rob by 10.
<br/>
David's ISB vs. Todd's Hidden Base- David gets an early lead and out drains. Then Todd flips his objective and its very close, but David squeaks it out by 3.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 matchups and hightlights
<br/>
Jason's Hunt Down vs. Matt's HB- Luke gets dueled and becomes lost. That and Visage never got canceled. Ouch. Jason by 10.
<br/>
Ben's Hidden Base odds vs. John's Manip- since the manip deck really only screw over character-based decks, especially a rebel based one, it didn't really do much against an alien/droid odds deck. Ben by 25.
<br/>
Odie's Hunt Down vs. Craig's beatdown- Odie duels Luke and that pretty much seals it. Odie by 18.
<br/>
David's profit vs. Chris's Hunt Down- David actually survive's Chris' dueling deck to beat it with sheer power and Luke's cheap deploy via profit. In the end it was very close, but David won by 3.
<br/>
Andrew's Profit vs. Joseph's Dark Deal- Andrew flips and retrieves, and battles what Joseph plays on CC. Andrew wins by a close won by 2. 
<br/>
Ross's Dark Deal vs. Thomas's Hidden Base- Ross get a really early flip and Thomas only plays with 5 systems, and Ross is able to contest most of them. Ross wins by 14.
<br/>
Rob's EBO vs. Todd's Endor Ops- Both players stay on their own planets, and Rob is able to deploy EBO and exploit it. Rob wins by 20.
<br/>
<br/>
All in all a great turnout and tourney. Each player walked away with 5 packs each and everyone had alot of fun. Sean Smallman was there giving Young Jedi demos.
