<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">....Girard at the AZ State Championship... :-) 
<br/>
<br/>
  First off, vocabulary lesson for the day - Mize - whenever something happens or someone does something
<br/>
  that in some way screws you over and has little chance of happening.  For example, you say I need a
<br/>
  transmission terminated to cancel your visage, you top deck a transmission terminated as the first card you
<br/>
  draw, therefore you just mized all over your opponent.
<br/>
<br/>
  This is a report on the Arizona State Championship and how things weren't in my favor and how I would like
<br/>
  to see changes to the tournament structure.  
<br/>
<br/>
  Alright, the decks I played were 
<br/>
<br/>
  LS - Speeder Ops off of Ralitiir - pretty much screws over Rops and the opponent must play your game if
<br/>
  he/she has any chance of winning.  This is a non-beatdown style of deck.
<br/>
<br/>
  DS - Girard's patented Vegas Style - This deck starts CCT, so I immediately get a rebel or retreival for the rest
<br/>
  of the game.  This deck also sets up the Casino adjacent to the Security Tower with an expand the empire on it
<br/>
  so I can retreive whenever I play sabacc for the safety of the indoors.  I stick ephant man, Lando and corporal
<br/>
  Prescott at the tower so I have added retreival during the game (Prescott says instead of force draining, may
<br/>
  pay x to retreive x where x=number of captives :-).  I play epp vaders and ig88 w/guns for ground support and
<br/>
  bounty hunter ships for space support.  The tower is pretty much secure from invasion.  I do damage with
<br/>
  sabacc (trooper and CC), a fear, and interrogation array.  TECH card of the deck - Frustration - to keep the
<br/>
  catch cards from catching my sabacc.  This deck is tight, I have made all the necessary changes and I feel it is
<br/>
  pretty much invincible.
<br/>
<br/>
  So I get ready to play.  I was going to do some audio broadcasts but the stupid windows program only records
<br/>
  for one minute and it kept locking up on me, so no broadcasts from the AZ State Championships.  Gold 18 Will
<br/>
  Schmidt announces a bunch of stuff and answers questions.  I find it hard to swallow that there will be no final
<br/>
  confrontation.  So since there is no final match, we are going to have a bunch of people clumped together at
<br/>
  5-1 and who ever got the best matchup last round is going to mize the trophy.  I think that is pretty stinky,
<br/>
  cause guess what happens.  Anyway, I'll save my usual rant until the end of the TR.
<br/>
<br/>
  Onto the games 
<br/>
<br/>
  Game One vs. Scot Vales LS Holotable/ 16 Anger fear aggression deck. 
<br/>
  So, this is probably the most non-interactive game I have ever played.  We start out, I get TK422 for some
<br/>
  torturing.  I get the casino set up with ETE and start sabaccing.  An insert (AFA) is played pretty much every
<br/>
  turn and I lose all my battle cards (IG88, vader, ships).  The sabaccs start to hurt him.  I am retreiving four force
<br/>
  on my turn and three on his (sabacc, prescott).  I keep bousch at bay with scanning crews.  So it gets down to
<br/>
  it, he played battle plan so he can't drain at the holotable (only had one force left).  This is my chance, I use
<br/>
  broken concentration to put the force back and retreive with prescott.  I procede to do that for about 12-15
<br/>
  turns and he finally catches on, he says alright count your lost pile since your going to retreive it anyway. 
<br/>
  Woohoo, it worked, talk about a great lock.  I retreive while preventing him from drawing up.
<br/>
<br/>
  FW +39 
<br/>
<br/>
  Lots of dark side won big.  I was the fourth ranked darkside player. 
<br/>
<br/>
  Game Two vs. Local Guy DS ISB 
<br/>
  Speeder ops is so uneventful.  I could tell that this guy was kinda new to the game.  He setup at two of my
<br/>
  sites, I setup at the other five and the system.  I don't have to pay for drains he does, I win
<br/>
<br/>
  FW +20something 
<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry, but that is the way it is with speeder ops, drain for two, drain for two, drain for two.... 
<br/>
<br/>
  Game Three vs. Jeff McCarrol DS CCT/Manipulator 
<br/>
  Thank goodness I played him this morning in playtesting.  I helped him make his deck better, but in the
<br/>
  meantime I fortified my deck.  I started with Don't Tread on Me and the three effects.  I had a shock in my
<br/>
  opening hand but he had a catch card, he still lost four but he got luke.  I decided to bait and switch him.  So I
<br/>
  put down an operative, 2x speeder (op inside one of them), and beezer.  he came down with vader and battled. 
<br/>
  I lost some, but not a lot.  Now that the big guy was on the board, I would work around him.  I setup and
<br/>
  flipped next turn at the far end of the planet with sicsixs for anti-elis protection.  I avoided the rest of the game. 
<br/>
  He had to lose 15 cards to Senses and alters (including themselves).  That put me over the top.
<br/>
<br/>
  FW +17 
<br/>
<br/>
  So I am the top ranked player at this point.  but that is bad, I gotta play my good buddy Josh Martin.  We sit
<br/>
  down and talk it out.  We were trying to figure it out if a draw (1 +51) would have helped either of us given the
<br/>
  amount of undefeated players that were still in it.  We pondered a true tie for about 5-10 minutes and then
<br/>
  came to the conclusion that it wouldn't have helped since there were going to be an even number of
<br/>
  undefeateds and we would have to play again.  So we play it out.
<br/>
<br/>
  Game Four vs. Josh Martin's I built this deck this morning. 
<br/>
  Again I feel that I have the advantage cause I helped him build this deck and my dark deck is unstoppable.  He
<br/>
  is with Hidden base and I get Jek Porkins for my CCT bait.  I sabacc for some turns while he sets up massive
<br/>
  drains in space.  I go and contest them and chase around Kal Fal (her and bacta tank = nasty combo to get
<br/>
  around battle order).  In the end he has about 6-7 cards left.  I ambush kal with vader and end the game.  He
<br/>
  would have drained for about 11 next turn and I couldn't risk it for a diff boost.
<br/>
<br/>
  FW +20something 
<br/>
<br/>
  I am the top ranked player again, this time I have to play one of the better local players Chris Shaner.  This guy
<br/>
  is obviously playing ORS/ISB cause he owns like 90 of them.  But I get to play dark.
<br/>
<br/>
  Game Five vs. Chris Shaner's Operatives on Ralitirr 
<br/>
  Whoa, it looks like someone thinks like I do.  He wasn't playing speeders though, he was playing little aliens
<br/>
  (hmenthe, sicsix, ithorian, epps).  I know him off a couple times but he spreads out and lays civil disorder.  This
<br/>
  is what won him the game, I couldn't satisfy it every turn so that with the drain of four-six every turn killed me. 
<br/>
  I couldn't retreive enough, but this game wasn't lost because my deck failed me, it was my stupidity.  He has
<br/>
  three force saved, I play vader to a site with a lone ithorian.  I look right at broken con, but don't activate
<br/>
  it...DOH!!!, so he it's a traps the battle and vader is stranded for the rest of the game.  he plays around and
<br/>
  wins.
<br/>
<br/>
  FL -12 
<br/>
<br/>
  So Shaner and I are still top ranked.  then it is Jeff McCarrol, Josh martin (they play each other), DJ andrews
<br/>
  and patrick Hug.
<br/>
<br/>
  Game Six vs. Chris Shaner's ORS/ISB. 
<br/>
  Surprise, Surprise.  A second turn grimtaash nets me both of his SE Jabba's and two ghhks (what I wouldn't
<br/>
  give to be playing brenston's beats at this point).  He still plays scum and villainy, plays some scouts, battles
<br/>
  and retreives jabba and a ghhk.  I battle some scouts, he retreives and battles some more.  This game was
<br/>
  pretty monotonous for having so much interraction.  I ambush the AC and take everyone out and cancel Scum
<br/>
  and villainy.  I knock him off my planet and win the game.  FW +8
<br/>
<br/>
  So obviously that wasn't enough.  DJ whupped up on Patrick and that put him into first.  Josh won against Jeff
<br/>
  and that put him into 2nd.  This is where there should have been a final confrontation.  DJ got really lucky with
<br/>
  some card plays and won by 30 to put him ahead, does this make him State Champ, I don't think so, I think he
<br/>
  deserves the right to the bye into the 2nd day, but I don't think he deserves the State Championship crown. 
<br/>
  Obviously, he disagrees, as do the TD and some of his friends.  I think it is bogus and Josh deserved a chance
<br/>
  at a finals.  It is pretty sucky if you ask me.
<br/>
<br/>
  So I went and played Hold 'em from 10pm Saturday till 3pm sunday and mized about 90 bones off of some
<br/>
  magic players, so I am not as butthurt as I was on saturday.
