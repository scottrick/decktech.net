<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After a 2 month break from running tournaments, I put my director's hat on and ran a local event on 7/15/00.  Obviously, this report will not contain any game by game player analysis.  Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy.
<br/>
<br/>
The high temperature in Austin on Saturday was 107 degrees, which probably explains why only 12 players braved the heat to attend the last Central Texas tournament before the release of DS II.  Despite the small turnout, I was extremely pleased to draw two out-of-town guests to this event: Jack Bauer from North Carolina and 1999 Dagobah Regional Champ Jason Burrows from Florida.  Jack is in Austin for a summer internship and Jason is visiting family.  Both guests made quite an impression (Jack won the tournament!), and hopefully had a good time.
<br/>
<br/>
Jack only lost 1 game all day and won the tournament easily with a record of 10 (+84).  Jack was playing Dagobah Clouds/Inserts for the DS and Yavin IV Mains/Arconas/Order to Engage for the LS.  Wade Kothmann also finished 5-1, but two of the wins were timed. 
<br/>
<br/>
Even though DS II will completely change the tournament scene next week, I took a deck poll for old times sake.  I have to say that I was extremely pleased with the diversity of decks that were played, although the LS dominated the DS overall with a record of 23-12.
<br/>
<br/>
LS Decks (23 wins)
<br/>
Echo Base Operations (x4)
<br/>
Yavin IV Mains/Arconas/Order to Engage
<br/>
Jedi Test to 5 (WENT UNDEFEATED!)
<br/>
Massassi Base Operations (BLEW UP THE DEATH STAR 3 TIMES!)
<br/>
Profit with SAC
<br/>
Elom Numbers with Throne Room Jump
<br/>
HB X-Wing Swarm
<br/>
Ewok Madness on Endor
<br/>
Economy Mains and Toys
<br/>
<br/>
DS Decks (12 wins)
<br/>
Set Your Course force jump/beatdown (x3)
<br/>
This Deal is Getting Worse (x2)
<br/>
Hunt Down and Destroy No Duel (x2)
<br/>
Dagobah Clouds/Inserts
<br/>
Court of the Vile Gangster
<br/>
ISB Operations with Deserts/Sandwhirls
<br/>
Raltiir Operations
<br/>
Jabba's Palace Force Jump (Expand the Empire)
<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, 6 different DS Objectives were used, and 4 different LS Objectives hit the table.  I think this is a good sign for the future of the game, and will hopefully continue with the release of DS II.  The variety of decks resulted in several interesting matchups and even more interesting events.  For example:
<br/>
<br/>
- Luke in Red 5 was preparing for an Attack Run until Obsidian 2 and a Lamda shutle drew a 5 for battle destiny!  Another Luke eventually made the run, but the delay cost the LS the game (despite blowing up the Death Star!)
<br/>
<br/>
- Vader and Tarkin were preparing to invade Echo Base, but suddenly lost themselves in an Ice Storm.  Several walkers mounted a search party, but thanks to bad destiny draws, the unfortunate duo were stuck on the Ice Plains for 2/3 of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
- A very brave Boussh broke cover against Igar and Tempest I.  Leia was emboldened by Yoda's Gimer Stickuntil Mara Jade came down the next turn.  Leia's demise was ugly, but the rebellion was saved by a timely Ghhk.
<br/>
<br/>
- In the final game between the top players, Jason's Test to 5 deck squared off against Jack's Dagobah clouds/inserts deck.  It was a furious battle on land and in the clouds, but Daughter trained quickly, and completed Test 5 with a 5 for destiny.  The Imperials continued to battle furiously, but repeated fives for battle destiny were too much to overcome.
<br/>
<br/>
- The MBO deck finally faced a Set Your Course deck and eventually blew up the real Death Star (not the wimpy LS version).  The DS only lost 15 cards because the War Room was NOT deployed, but the loss was still devastating.
<br/>
<br/>
During the tournament, I discussed DS II with my players and asked them to share their thoughts about the new set.  Here are some of the observations we made:
<br/>
<br/>
1. Numbers are dead, but they won't disappear completely from the tournament scene.  Its only a matter of time before the DS stops playing the magic bullet and a clever player wins a major tournament (regional or open ) using LS or DS numbers.
<br/>
2. Honor of the Jedi is a powerful card, but its far from broken.
<br/>
3. Jedi Testing to 6 will become a viable tournament deck.  Just look at what Jason Burrows did with his Test to 5 deck (he usually finished Test 5 on turn 6 or 7 every time).  He won all of his LS games by more than 20 force!  DS II makes Jedi Testing even faster, and deadlier.
<br/>
4. The ultra-rarity of Luke and the Emperor is NOT a big deal.
<br/>
5. DS Space decks could return to the tournament scene with a Vengeance (pun intended!!!)
<br/>
6. Massassi Base Operations is FUN to play, but is a little too card intensive.  Kenton's MBO deck went 2-1, but won both of its games by very few force.
<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, here are the final stats for the tournament:
<br/>
<br/>
Games Played: 35
<br/>
Games Called on Time: 3
<br/>
LS Wins: 23
<br/>
DS Wins: 12
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
