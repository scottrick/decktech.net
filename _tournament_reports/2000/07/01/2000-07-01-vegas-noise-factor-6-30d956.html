So this may be slightly a day off but hey, we all played till 9 at night and it was some playing, I assure you. 
<br/>
The Prep: The entire month before this tournament, I'm stressing not just foor this small tournament but for the impending regionals that are fast are their way. I haven't been able too make it to the last two tournaments and I was just lucky enough to get my hands on some 3rd anthology the week before this started. So finally, after getting my butt hammered at practice the night before, I build my decks. I should note that I was watching the movie "Trekkies" and listening to the Bloodhound Gang. and while this will affetc my TR writing style, it also affected my level of focus when I was building my deck. This will come into play later.
<br/>
<br/>
At the Shop: Before I begin I should explain somewhat how this store is layed out and how this layout/background noise (hence the Noise Factoring) contributed to the tournament scene. We play in the backroom in a store that not only does CCG's but computer multi-player and RPG/ Strategy games. The backroom has no air conditioning and half the time is filled with too many people who haven't showered in days. Add a tile floor, tight walls, overzealous computer junkies (seriously I think they were getting a tan from the computer monitors) and a brownie that someone trashed on the floor and you have a situation that brings any stable, focused SW:ccg player close to PMSing. (To any female readers, I have a good attitude towards menstration.) Needless to say, not too many of us enjoyed playing in the backroom. But we dealt with it and we were all joyous that the tournament started on time. The tournament was watched over by Tim "Info Broker" Guzman and  he did a great job dealing withour location troubles.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1: VS Dan "Mystikal" Christy (1797)
<br/>
My Throne Room vs Dan's Hoth-Beats
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly that may not be what he calls his deck but from what I saw, it plays similar to the name. It seems every time there's a tournament at Triple J's we play each other. We have between us at this location a 1-1 record. Anyhow this game goes for several turns with both of us activating and drawing. I am extremely lucky in getting out three  of my  twix sites 2nd turn. He finally puts down Vader at the farm and I put down a little  of my own beatdown squad. I clear out Vader andplace a characterof mine in the tank. this is where it gets technical. I want to use out of commision  right after he lost Vader, but he stated I could only use it after he lost Vader and battle damage. I am thinking in steps as in I lose a character, he loses a character, I can play OOC and then he loses battle damage. Anyhow he lets me use OOC before losing battle damage. I don't get Vader and in the end this was probably better for the game. He then places  responsibility of command on my war room and suddenly Luke can't drain or battle. Damn. I Nabrun to the war room, then Nabrun back to the forest and drain. I probably should have kept a nabrun but take into consideration the noise factor and I'm playing well so far against a really good player. Then he deploys Mara, her saber and two scrubs to the 3rd marker and he converts my  war room. Double Damn. I spend several turns trying to re-draw my nabruns and during those times, defesnively win his SAC attempts to cancel my Bacta Tank and Savrip. I finally get Liea, and a scrub, battle Mara and almost clear the site. Instead Mara sits there. once again Vader is deployed and I lose 4 force several turns until I nabrun over to the 3rd marker with Han, Liea and Luke. Dan is a brave soul. he deploys tow more scrubs, and battles. Don't get Cocky + Skywalkers + Enhanced Game text= Cleared site and game won.

<br/>
THE GOOD: Beating Dan, a higher ranked player. I wasn't expecting that. This was a good game too. Full of everything SWCCG should be. 
<br/>
THE BAD: My eagerness in Nabruning everywhere. That might have changed the game slightly.
<br/>
THE UGLY: This game was actually pretty. But if I had to go with ugly, I'd say the Bacta Tank. I mean Luke is wearing a diaper! That's pretty ugly in my book.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2 vs Matt LeFontane (sp? Couldn't find his rank)
<br/>
My Set your Course for Shutdown vs. EBO X-wings
<br/>
<br/>
My deck is basically more of a DS beatdown with some modifications based off of The Ultimate Power (check that deck out!) I get my Miyoom going 3rd turn which is a turn too late in preventing him from setting up EBO. I use a monnok early on and hit him for 2 xwings and 2 hyper escapes. He can afford commons so this deck makes sense. I set up resistance, and a saber drain and begin to look for my battle plan. Oh wait, I didn't  put that card in when I was deck building. "Damn you Trekkies!" I cursed. the only thing Trekkies are good for is making Star Wars fans feel good about themselves. So there goes my lynch pin against EBO. Also losing my 4 starships to drains didn't help my ability to block some of his drains. I Sense and Alter everything he plays and this helps me a great deal as he does not have wise advice. I got eager with my monnok and couldn't get my other 2 before he deployed his remaining x-wings and spread to drain me wickedly. i get Search and Destroy too late in the game to help much and in the end, he wins by ten ins a lopsided drain race.
<br/>
FL by 10. i am now at 2 (+4)
<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: Miyoom shutdown. Wicked Sense/Alter action. I handle the SAC like the quarterback Randle Cunningham. Also we got to play in the one spot that's air conditioned in this whole friggin building. Ahh, AC.
<br/>
THE BAD: Realizing at the end of the game I left out a key card. 
<br/>
THE UGLY: Trekkies. Especially the ones that dress up like Klingons. ::Shudder::
<br/>
<br/>
So I'm kicking myself and game 3 winds around. Time for me to redeem myself.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3: Vs Ben "Jigglypimp" Cavin (1680)
<br/>
Set Your Course for Shutdown vs EBO-EBG-OPP (ya you know me)
<br/>
<br/>
I start Bad Feeling. Little do I know that this will be the first in several good strikes for me. He sets up EBO just before I apply the Miyoom lockdown. I monnok and get several of his Red Squadron X-wings. He pulls EBG, puts down Wedge and Toryn and Rouge 3. Nice. Then he puts Luke in the Falcon at Hoth. Next turn I pull my all my starships, praise the gods of irony, deploy Vader, saber, Tarkin, and POTF to the 4th marker. I deploy Fett in Slave and battle Luke away. I drain for a nice 6 for two turns. then he deploys several starships in hopes of spreading my forces thin. I don't think so. I ZiMH to Kasyyyk to beat the spiral (three turns later realize I wasn't supposed to draw destiny there) And his drains are cut off once again as CHYBG is in effect. Ahh the love of a fearful wookiee...
<br/>
He finally gets brave and moves Rogue 3 and liea with rifle to the 4th marker. Then I get mean. Alter bacta Tank and EBG. Wedge's special immunity is lost. We battle, I clear his guys and lose nobody. the game ends with a short chase about the stars and then a Appearance by everyone's semi-favorite Super Star Destroyer.
<br/>
FW by 17. Currently at (4 +21) 
<br/>
As I am counting my differential, Dan Christy is counting his acrss from me. he wins by 17 as well and we both finsih counting at the same time. Suddenly I feel as if I have stepped into an alternate dimension and will be forced to spend years in black and white reruns on the Sci-fi channel. (Direct reference to the Twilight Zone for the lesser educated.)
<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: Everything. Wiggly-dunking my SAC, Draining, drawing and using everything I ahve to the fullest.
<br/>
THE BAD: Feeling semi-chumpish after I realized my error at the kasyyyk system.
<br/>
THE UGLY: Miyoom Oonith. Her face looks like a Picasso piece.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 4: VS J.T. (last name? ranking?)
<br/>
Biker Ralops vs my Throne Room
<br/>
<br/>
Me and JT talk online quite a bit about decks and this was a surprise coming from him. Fortunately for me, Ral ops of any kind favors my deck. I save up and let him flip. had i known what his deck contained, I could have easily deployed and controled his planet. He started IAO so I was also limited as to when I could utlize my Nabruns. I finally spank a scrub slightly and sense botrh of his attempts to react with the bikers. he comes down heavy with Tarkin and Vader, I Tank Luke and savrip some cards. My next turn I return the favor and deploy a powerful force to match his. He battles. I hit evryone he has except Vader and play Gift of the mentor and don't get @#$%y. CLear his site and most of his force pile. I spend some time chasing around his guys but not applying beatdowns. I sense more reacts, utilize Draw thier Fire for retrieval and sigh. This game goes to time. 
<br/>
THE GOOD: Destiny adders. Nothing says loving like, "Don't get @#$%y!"
<br/>
THE BAD: Going to time. This game was by the book. Despite the originality it wasn't very creative and the only thing that made it fun was verbally abusing the computer geeks. Who by this time mind you had broken several records on the decibal level. Seriously the store was getting complaints from people across town...
<br/>
THE UGLY: This really fat guy sitting behind me. I hate to be a stifler on it but the chair was broken. No lie. It was disturbing. I have nothing against obescity but this gave me a whole new level of thinking. Jabba looks skinny next to this guy. The Rancor would choke just trying to get a leg off. (note: if offended, see the warning at the start of this report. Then bite me.)

Timed Win by 27 5 (+28)

GAME 5: VS Chris Hines (1789)  
<br/>
My Throne Room vs SYCF-Shutdown/manip
<br/>
<br/>
I played this deck the night before and my RTP got it's royal ass creamed. (Princess=Royal. F***ed up the A**= Ass Creaming.) I was so set on losing this game that my mental level faltered. The Noise factor was killing me, I was sweating gallons through my Daisy-duke cutoffs and the fat guy was starting the next earthquake. (San Fransciso, prepare for a 9 on the Richter scale) Chris starts CHYBC and on turn 4 deploys the Executor, and a DSSD to Kasyyyk. I have one chance to do some damage. I deploy Han, Falcon, Luke, R2 in red 5, Obi-wan and battle. Gift of the mentor, Don't get @#$%y and destiny clears his ships out. I waste no time altering CHYBC and move over to the death star with the falcon. I get some drains in and defensivly sense Chris' cards until he deploys Vader to the farm. But wait! he then deploys bane malar to a DS site I had moved into and battles. his destiny clears obi-wan and I decide that Han is safer in the Falcon. However I can now deploy Obi-wan from hand as well as a scrub and Liea. I battle Vader off and lose Liea. Then we spend a game of Zuckuss cat and mouseing-my starships until I drain him out.
<br/>
FW by 28 currently at 7 (+78 or so)
<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: Altering CHYBC. That won me the game with a steady drain of at least 3 a turn.
<br/>
THE BAD: leaving han alone in the Falcon. I was very scared.
<br/>
THE UGLY: Captain Lennox. he never saw play but he's in Chris' deck and the guy has got a really wierd mole on his cheek. That's ugly.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 6: VS Kris Lavigne (1902)
<br/>
SYCF- ShutDown vs Profit
<br/>
<br/>
Whew, I'm at the head table, last game, with a possible win under my belt. AND I'm back under the air conditioning. Aside from having to stand up while playing, this is the perfect way to end a Tournament. I haven't felt this wierd since I found out Santa doesn't exist. (yes, it's true, Virginia.) I get the Miyoom set up 3rd turn. I scanning crew his Master Luke and then use a monnok to empty his hand down some. He grabs it. this slows me down but I keep up the pressure enough to get out Search and Destroy and a saber drain. unfortunately when i monnoked, i didn't get all his characters and only suceeded in putting them in his used pile. I put the hurt on for several more turns and fianlly he has more force than i can activate in his hand. And where is my other monnok? nowhere to be found. In a bold move, he deploys chewie, ben, Master Luke, boushh (to DS) and flips. he beats miyoom and the race to the finish begins. We attempt to battle. He tries to use fallen portal. I sense. But lack the destiny to do some hurt. He puts down a spy and I miss a drain of 3. He's now causing 2 profit damage and draining for 5. I am draining for 4. I try to battle with 4-lom and jabba but a Run luke, run brings the Master over who then sends jabba back. Next turn 4-lom is disarmed, but only after Chewie goes bye-bye. After some evasive action, he shuts me down. This was one of the biggest turn arounds I have ever played in and despite my loss it was a good game and we both made key mistakes. I drained twice at the death star DB, he was draining me at DS sites even after CHYBC was out and we might not have payed attention to Resistence and bad feeling (in effect before he flipped) either way it was a tight game. the one thing that lost me this game was once again the lack of Battle Order also not having an oppressive enforement. He had wise advice and I could have used some of my stuff circulating around in my deck. 
<br/>
FL 12 Final standing 7 (+66 or so)
<br/>
<br/>
THE GOOD: Air Conditioning. Holding Kris out that long. He's a 1900+ player here and I am at 1625 going intothis tournament. 
<br/>
THE BAD: Lack of oppressive enforcement and battle Order. sigh, those changes will be made immediately. Also the turn around was crazy-sniffle.
<br/>
THE UGLY: Ru-Paul. She has absolutely nothing to do with this game but big black guy in drag = no arousal on my part. eww.
<br/>
<br/>
The Post-Game: So I ended up in fourth place. Wowzer, I haven't done this well ever. I had a blast and I am almsot certain with what i want to do for regionals. The prize support was tight. I pulled a pretty U-3P0 foil and 7 CC rares. I did some trading, more playtesting and made fun of the computer gamers. Then I blasted Bloodhound Gang and proceeded to dream those dreams that only I am capable of. Props to the Info Broker for a good tournament. it was needed right before the regionals. Also I'd like to thank everyone for thier help in aiding my deck decisions. And as one last note, I'd like to thank the acadamey.
