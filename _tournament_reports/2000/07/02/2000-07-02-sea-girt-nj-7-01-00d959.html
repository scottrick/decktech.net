<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">We're trying to develop a new player base in this area of NJ, and judging by the few unfamiliar faces it seems to be working.  There were a couple of little kids who came around who wanted to learn how to play as well while we were there. We started the tournament with 10 players, and halfway through the first game another kid showed up to create a bye, but 5 minutes after he got there, Steve Brentson came in to even things out.  I was playing LS Speeder ops/Clak'dor and DS a new numbers idea that I came up with.(DS deck will be on decktech later this week) I was rated at 1943 before the tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Matthew Holloman(1500)'s ISB Coruscant deck.
<br/>
	He had never played in a tournament before, and had only been playing since about March.  Still, I was a tad worried about the matchup, remembering those fun games against Kim Caton's ISB decks that destroy ops.  Anyway, i get a horrible draw, deck wasn't shuffled very well.  He puts some generic sites down on coruscant and sets up 1 or 2 drains.  I get my ops out and flip.  He has the avenger sitting by itself at coruscant for the early drain that is now 0.  I deploy EPP Luke in Artoo in red 5 to clak'dor and move to Coruscant(couldn't find farmboy).  I didn't see the need to send luke to a ground site, he had 1 or 2 drains of 1 and had decent power with some non-unique imperial leaders at the spaceport sites.  He has no pilots to deploy so he shuttles up ozzel.  I deploy red leader in red 1 to back-up luke and battle and draw a tracked 5.  he draws a 2, so the avenger dies and luke lives.  Then I slap on legendary starfighter to red 5.  He's losing 2 for that, and 6-8 from my ground drains, game over.  win by 20
<br/>
2(+20)
<br/>
<br/>
After the game i trade him some cards to make his deck better and discuss some ideas to change the idea of the deck(he wanted to play it on hoth, and i told him a good way to do it.  No Kim, i didn't just hand him your decklist from the Regional)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS vs Jason Lane(1461) Space/droid Numbers
<br/>
	as he's shuffling his deck, i notice one or two cards with the holograms different from the others, so I ask him to switch them around.  When he does, I see what cards they are-three destiny 4 droids.  Great, he's playing numbers too.  this should be fun.  He starts Rendezvous Point and Haven, I start SYCFA with the Death Star sites.  I start quickly, putting two droids at the War room and insert.  He activates deploys two droids to the docking bay.  I deploy another droid and draw for some cards.  the numbers pop when he activated so he loses 4, and then he drops 8d8, so he's up 1 in the numbers category.  then he starts inserting anger fear and odds.  i need to make him lose force somehow, so I deploy 2 ships to endor for a solid drain, and put dengar with blaster at the docking bay with his droids.  I have battle order out, he's got wars not make on great.  He's saving a few force.  I force drain with dengar where his 3 droids are, then cancel my own drain with a counter assualt.  I draw 11 to his 3, so he loses 8 cards.  he doesn't come battle zuckuss and bossk at endor, and I do the same trick with dengar again later.  his inserts never pop as I don't need to activate much force.  Win by 36    4(+56)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 LS vs Thomas Hermley-Keene's(1682) RalOps
<br/>
	Tom just keeps getting better each and every week, and I'd like to say that comes from playing Mike Dalton and myself regularly.  This is another bad matchup for the ops deck(which is why I won't be playing it anymore).  I get a decent draw, and 3rd turn I flip.  Tom throws evax, cabbal, and pol triedum down and flips his, then moves cabbal to pol at the swamp.  I convert his forest where evax is, drop farmboy to evax, and throw a speeder at the desert, then battle and kill evax, flipping his back.  the speeder then joins luke at the forest.  Now the debate, put luke in the speeder so he is safe from weapons, or leave him outside where he is immune to attrition.  he doesn't get much force, about 7 or 8 and only a few cards in hand.  I'll leave luke outside.  Next turn, he deploys IG with gun and captures luke, and I lose the speeder and 2.  The game gets farely boring for a while, as he put out battle order, and there were no battleground systems to be found.  He flips back, I'm paying for all my drains for 1 and he drains for 1 at 1 site with mara and saber.  then he sends vader down to try to do some damage, clears 1 site, but I just deploy another op and speeder, and draw a tracked 5 and vader is gone.  He finally gets out Decree and now I drain for 0 and he has a drain for 1.  He's got zuckuss at ralltir, and bus at coruscant for decree. I lost some of my ships earlier, but got them back.  I could've drawn for them and gone to ralltir to block decree, but time was about to run out.  he had 6 force left, i had about 18, so I just let him drain 1 or 2 more turns and took the timed win.  win by 15  5(+71)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs Michael Dalton's(2114) Dagobah/Test 2 deck.
<br/>
	Mike and I play in almost every tournament, so this matchup was no surprise.  Wasn't too sure what he was playing, but he knew what I had, and thought he couldn't beat it.  I deploy tech mor and 2 droids to the death star and insert right away.  he gets yoda out to dagobah and keeps pulling sites, shuffling my insert around(i cut it to the very bottom once, he wasn't happy when he saw that)  It finally pops, but he has enough force to use it could be worse for the damage.  I don't have any force left to grab it.  He gets daughter out and starts training her, I put Zuckuss and the Bus at Endor, and Fett in Slave 1 at Kiffex to drain.  Another insert pops and he it could be worsed, but I grabbed this time.  After he completes the second test, I play set for stun on daughter with a tracked 6 and she's back in hand, tests are gone.  Mike never came to space and my inserts popped twice for damage.  Win by 19   7(+90)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs Ted Panczyszyn's(1701) "A really bad deck" SYCFA Manipulator.
<br/>
	He's playing Scanning crews, a dangerous time, junk with some space ships.  I flip 3rd turn again, and I'm draining for 8.  He's moving my cards around, but it really isn't affecting me.  He didn't get down to clak'dor and his space drains were minus 1, so I wasn't getting hurt.  This game was very non-interactive, and it was done fairly quickly.  Win by 22		9(+112)
<br/>
<br/>
Well both Steve Brentson and I had played LS that game, so we wouldn't get to play the last game.  As it worked out,everyone played the opponent they played in game 5.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS vs Ted's(1701) EBO deck
<br/>
	My first turn I just draw because my hand sucks.(4 of my 6 inserts and both counter assualts, plus a twi'lek and vader's shuttle)  He pulls a site and ebo then draws.  I deploy tech mor and a droid and insert.  he pulls two sites, deploys a destiny 3 guy and toryn farr and an xwing and sets up ebo.  I draw to get some useful stuff.  His turn the numbers pop for 3 damage, then he pulls hoth and puts haven on it, deploys two or 3 ships and takes off from the docking bay.  I've got most of my ships in hand, but I'm not going to haven(made that mistake against TJ at regional).  I deploy another droid and reactor terminal, insert again, and wait.  He deploys kessel and pulls kiffex, then deploys jereon webb and epp han to the death star.  I barrier han, so no battle.  he moves 2 xwings and gold leader to kessel, and has two corvettes and another ship at hoth.  I had set up some 6's to play with counter assault, but decided to kill the drain at kessel was a much better idea.  I drop Zuckuss, Dengar, and Ig-88 in ships, battle and draw two 6's, clear the system and he loses a few cards.  One drain down.  Battle order is out, so he has to pay for hoth, which he doesn't like because insert is in the deck and he's got 6 to my 14.  he deploys wioslea to the 3rd marker and moves toryn farr to the 4th. now he doesn't have to pay.  Wioslea moves over to 4th with toryn.  He drains on death star for 1  i lose three for drain in space, and then counter assualt the wioslea drain, ending the game because the numbers just popped when he activated and he has to lose 8 from the counter assualt.  Full win by 22 again.
<br/>
<br/>
I finish undefeated 11(+134) and take home the Jabba shirt that Mike Dalton donated.  Would have liked to play Steve for fun but time did not permit that, especially since he had a deck that my ds should not be able to beat.  Going to need a new LS for next week's tournament in Cedar Grove, might not play the DS, but it is a really fun deck.
