<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">    It all started when gold 18 posted his spoiler about a month ago,
<br/>
I made my decks about a week after that and they wrecked everything insite.  My lightside kept on losing to court but wrecked evrything else.
<br/>
I put in some tech to take out court(2x Herc Seff) and of course honor the jedi and now my light wrecked everything.  My light was i can still save you, 17 speeder beatdown deck with enough space to hold battle plan.  
<br/>
My dark was a Rops with the emperor and his boys deck.  Both had some extra tech which will reamian secret for awhile because it's still unknown tech.  
<br/>
The Day before the tourny two of my friends came over to spend the night, we playtested pretty much all night.  My Rops beat my friend Ben's I can still save him/elom beats deck, and i was very happy because i wanted to see how my deck would do against that.  My light was a beast and wrecked everything that was thrown at it.
<br/>
Only one problem, I still did not own a luke's saber, well i made a speeder beats/mwyhl deck to take to the regional jsut in case i couldn't trade for a saber before the rounds started.
<br/>
well, me and my boys woke up around 6 am, the tourny started at 9, i finished making my decklists and felt pretty confident about my cahnces of at least placing well.  especially since i came in 5th at states and should have placed higher had i not made a stupid mistake.
<br/>
We got to the hall around 8, nobody had a luke's saber. damn. around quarter to 9 "dan" came in and traded me a luke's saber.  Yes!!  There were about 60 people at the regional.. among the notables, Steve Brenstson, defending champion.  Hayes hunter, highest ranking player in the region and champion two years ago.  Eric Hunter, Mass state champion.
<br/>
Steve wall, 3rd highest ranked player in the region, but he lives about 8 hours away from civilaztion so knowbody really knew if he was as good as his ranking or not.
<br/>
There were a bunch of other good players too.  There were also a ton of people i had never seen before, including a bunch of older gentle men in their late 40s....interesting.
<br/>
Well the tourny started around 10, on to the games:
<br/>
First game, My Rops vs. Steve Wall's(1980) I can save Him with....Ewoks and numbers...?
<br/>
Well, I guess I was going to find out if he was a good player sooner than i thought.  Intersting thing, Right before this game, Hayes Hunter(who knows the kashyyyk region pretty well) called me the "most underated player in the region."  Steve Wall is comonly reagared as the "most overated player in the region."  
<br/>
Another intersting thing, when the pairings were anounced, "steve wall vs. Justin Desai, a mook cheer went up for me, because people assumed steve was going to trounce me.   Ok, well enough, On to the action.  I started with battle order, IAO and oppresive.  He started with yarna.
<br/>
I got a pretty good hand, throne room, sim aloo, and an alter an a at-st and some other stuff.  I deployed executor docking bay( i use 1-0 docking bays for activation) from reserve deck and swamp from reserve as well. dropped down the throne room and drew.  He paid three to drain me of 1 at the chirpa's hut, i lost some card and he drew up.
<br/>
Next turn i droped sim at the swamp, deployed another site and docking bay, tried to alter his yarna, he said it was immune but i said no, he looked at the card and said damn. I tried to alter it, drew a 4, damn...I had a mmonnok and everything.
<br/>
I saved up my force. his turn, he deployed back door, 3x ewok spearman and an ithorian, i raised my eyebrow when i saw ewoks...i was like, i'm gonna win this because theres a better cahnce of a snowball melting on hoth than me losing to an ewok deck.
<br/>
he drew some cards up and that was all.  Next turn i flipped, and dropped the emp, overseeing it personally and kashyyyk.  We traded drains for a couple turns, both paying 3 to drain. He evntually came down with home one, i just knocked it off with fett in ship and stacked destinies.  His drains were starting to annoy me on endor so i dropped lord vader, gmt to the back door(by this time he had kazak and a bunch of ewoks at diff endor sites.
<br/>
He barriered vader.  Next turn he spent all his force to drain and i lost like 4 cards, hge made no move to move his cards away from vader and gmt.  (btw, he never moved luke the whole game, even after i got chybc out).  Next turn i drained for a bunch, dropped a at sts and some more power charcters to the back dooe, trampled the ithorian, looked his destiny battles, i had like 24 to his 12, he lost every thing plus like 4 force.
<br/>
He just kept paying to drain for 3 and i kept draining for 8 for free.  Then something weird happed, he inserted never tell me the odds, i was like%#@*!!  You're actually playing numbers?  I had a total of 3 to his 12 tho so i guess it was a good move.  But alas it was to late for him because i never activated and just lost cards from hand.  At the verty end, he hjad 5 ewok spearmen on table , he tried wind chimes, i used sim aloo's text to move a 5 to the top of his reserved deck so he cpouldn't retrieve.  Tech.
<br/>
I eventually drained him out.  FW by 19.
<br/>
Highs:  Winning every battle, kicking ewoks in the ass!!  Beating a high ranked player.  My deck worked perfectly.
<br/>
Lows: He was a little cheesey with the rules, telling me i couldn't take back actions, when before the tourny started the TD said 1 action take backs were allowed. But I kicked his ass anyway and proved he is overated.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Hayes won, Brentson won, Eric won.  The majority of the top players all won.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, My LS Speeder beats vs.  Alex ????'s flipping court.
<br/>
<br/>
This kid was over matched.  He started with all wrapped up and no bargain.  I started with battle plan, the card that lets you grab honor and wise advice.
<br/>
he got scum set up early, i got manuvering flaps in my opening hand.  He deployed several aliens during the agme, but herc seff at the pit of carcoon cancelled all his drains at the audience chamber and i won every battle at the pit of carcoon, making his  lose tons of force for battle damage.  H e captured obi and an asp droid but i just drained him out.  I later nabruned luke over to where he had a lone jodo kast with fett's gun, i killed jodo and amde him lose like 6 force but he shot luke!!
<br/>
Not all that much more action in this game.  I cpontinued to drain him of 1 at the pit and 1 at the landing platform and he continued too drop guys and battled retieving 2 force but then losing the battle and having to lose 4-5 force.  eventually he dropped fett alonbe at the pit and battled.  I had 42 power and he had 4.  Game set and match.
<br/>
FW by 18.  
<br/>
Highs:  Speeders being powerful.  Herc Seff being a beast.  I lost a total of 6 cards this game.
<br/>
Lows: Beating a kid who had no clue what he was doing.
<br/>
<br/>
3rd game, My LS vs. Brain ????'s coruscant opps with royal guards.
<br/>
Brain is a good player(rating around 1700_ and had beat my speeders at states.  
<br/>
I started the same, he started with iao, tht card that lets you forfeit weapons and something else.
<br/>
I got good start, beat him up early with speeders.  and was toally winning the game.  Herc was doing his job on coruscant.
<br/>
Only problem was that i forgot to tell him to stack a card each time he lost a battle. I beat him in 3 battles and forgot to tell him to stack... i was totally winning but then he drooped vader to where luke was and captured him, and then powered up at 3 differsnt loactions and drained there. he was fdrianing for 3 a turn, and me for 2 a turn.  If i had remebered to tell him to stack i coulda turned vader but i didn't.  Later in the game i tried to battle him but his guards were very pwerful, in almost every battle he had like 40 power to my 25-30.  I probably coulda beat him if i had just protected herc and out drained him, but i decided to play agrresively and go for battles, i underestimated his power and payed for it.  FL by 16.
<br/>
Highs:  My Deck worked well, i just made to many mistakes.
<br/>
Lows: forgeting to tell him to stack, literally makeing 2-3 mistakes that cost me the game. Knowing that I should have won.  Losing to the same guy at both states and now the regional.
<br/>
<br/>
Eric Hunter was still undefeated, so were hayes, steve brentson, my friend ben , and a whole mess of other people.
<br/>
<br/>
My 4th game.  My dark vs.  ???? ?????'s EBO.
<br/>
<br/>
My rops rippped this deck to pieces in like 8 minutes.  This was probaly the most boring game i had all day.  i don't mean to sound @#$%y but there really was no challenge.  I felt bad beating a deck that severly. I won every battle, flipped turn 2, made him lose over 10 force for search, altered bacta tank, never lost anything to a drain, won evry battle in space.  my hand was 18 cards when i baet him.  FW by 25.
<br/>
Highs:  winning ever battle.
<br/>
Lows: nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Hayes Hunter had played steve brentson in a game this round, steve won by 4 playing his LS profit deck.
<br/>
There were lie 4 undefaeteds left.
<br/>
<br/>
5th game.  My Light side vs. Steve Wall's Hit and run court.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, he was happy to play me again, he had won all his games since i beat him.  He wanted to show everybody he wasn'r=t overated.  I wanted to show everybody he was.  bith of our differentials sucked so to have  even a slim chance to win the tourny we would have to win by like 30.
<br/>
He started with scum, i started my usual.  First turn he deployed Jabba the hutt and drew. My first turn i dropped the flaps, a twix and obi to the pit.
<br/>
next turn he spent 3 to drain for 1 and drew.  My next turn i deployed herc, and 2 flapped speeders.  At some point he monnoked me for 2 speeders and 2x nabruns.
<br/>
He hit and run with mara a few times, retrieving force but losing battles and stacking for it.  Herc was a beast thsi game, soaking up like 10 damage.  i was draining with luke for 2 every turn at the platform and 1 at the pit, i later dropped the 3rd marker with epp han and a couple speeders to gain the adavntage in the drain race.
<br/>
But he was retrieving a bunch of force for scum, i eventually got obi to the audience chamnber and killed jabba and cancelled scum, that was big.  He then dropped mara to the landing platform and captured luke, he would have to lose 2 per turn now.
<br/>
He deployed sullust and bossk in bus and zimh.  I briefly had home one(doesn't the name "home one" sound like a retarded person trying to say home run...?)
<br/>
I battled in space a few times but he evtually got me. It was now a true drain race, he was battle plan safe however and i wasn't.  However i had 2 things going for me, i was making him lose 2 foce per turn for luke and a force for his own objective.
<br/>
i got boushh to the landing platform and that was game, he continued to drain in sullust to keep the differential low but i had the game.  FW by 4.
<br/>
Highs:  beating him twice and raising my rating a ton!  winning alot of batlles. speeders rock!
<br/>
Lows: winning by so little. I was now 8(+50). 
<br/>
<br/>
 The highest 8 was hayes, only 2 undefaeteds left eric and steve but both had played the same sides in the previous game so they wouldn't play each other. in order for a 5-1 player to make it one of them would have to lose.
<br/>
<br/>
I now knew There was no way i could possibly get into the final round. 
<br/>
<br/>
6th game:  my rops vs. Ric ???????'s ebo.
<br/>
Great, the other person to beat me at states, what are the odds?
<br/>
This game i don't rember too much of, all i know is that i had contol of ral, and i fliiped early and set up search.  I was on my way to winning, but i wasn't battle plan safe.  He had a few systems open and i deployed fett in s1, and didn't save a force, next turn he deployed like 30 power and drew a stacked 6 to my 0 destiny.  he deployed first strike so i had to lose like 5 force.  from there it was pretty much game.
<br/>
I'm pretty sure i woulda won if i had just stayed on the groung, but who knows.  I just wanted to battle in this game. but props to Ric, he's a great player and i nver saw the baetdown coming.
<br/>
FL by a bunch.
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish 4-2 but my diff sucks.  Eric and Steve are in the final.  Steve won the first game by 24.  in the second game Steve drew up when eric only had 20 cardss left.  Alot of people said this was cheesey but, i don't think it was, I'd do the same thing.
<br/>
<br/>
So heres my Props and slops:
<br/>
<br/>
Props:
<br/>
To my boys Ben and Mike R., they were cool the whole time, they even played real well at the regional.  And the next day we went to cape cod and had a kick ass time.
<br/>
To Brain C. for driving me to MCDonalds.  And not only that but lertting me borrwo a trample.  And not only that but pulling off the emperor's prize in a game!!
<br/>
To "dan" who traded me a luke's sabers.
<br/>
To Steve Wall for losing to me twice:)
<br/>
To Kris earl and his "staff" for running a great tourny.
<br/>
To Steve Brentson for winning.
<br/>
To Hayes Hunter for being a chill kid and probably the best player there.  watch for him to qualify in an open.
<br/>
To Steve Baroni for being chill and beatuing up Wall's ewok deck after the tourny with counter assaults.
<br/>
And lastly to Me , because even though i scrubbed out, I should have won all 6 of my games.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
To Eric for not giving me props on his TR.  What happened eric, i thought i was the pimp?
<br/>
To Steve Wall, He really is overated.
<br/>
To some guy who was playing asterid sancuary./a wings, didn't know what any of his cards did, then while he was losing to some kid, kept saying he lost onkly because his opening hand was bad.  Hey Buddy, you lost because you're not a good player.
<br/>
To The Kashyyyk Region, because during the whole tournament, not one player completed the new objective to win the game.
<br/>
thats all folks,  --H2O--
