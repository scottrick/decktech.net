<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So it all starts out last October 9th, after RamapoCon 99 get over with.
<br/>
I email everyone for feedback and get some good ideas to start with making
<br/>
the next RamapoCon.  The biggest problem was going about having it so soon
<br/>
to the last one, 7 months.  I decided though that if I was going to make
<br/>
RCon a regular event, May might me the best time for it.  After having all
<br/>
winter to think it over, I started this semester at Ramapo and started to
<br/>
get things underway.  I reserved the room from last year for Saturday but
<br/>
was not allowed to have it other days, after much negotiations I was able
<br/>
to get some large sized rooms for what I thought would be three great days
<br/>
of tournaments and fun...I was definitely right on that one.
<br/>
<br/>
So the next three months required a lot of travelling to other area to
<br/>
promote the tournament.  I ended up travelling to Clarks Summit (PA),
<br/>
Columbia (MD), Long Island, Staten Island, Albany, Philly, and countless
<br/>
promote the tournament.  I ended up travelling to Clarks Summit (PA),
<br/>
Columbia (MD), Long Island, Staten Island, Albany, Philly, and countless
<br/>
other places.  It was great travelling!  I also became a human plug
<br/>
machine for the Convention.  Much thanks for George Gundry, Nathan Brown
<br/>
and everyone else that plugged this tournament everywhere they went.
<br/>
<br/>
A big thing that happened as far as promotion goes is when David Akers put
<br/>
information about RamapoCon II on Decktech.  Kim Caton wrote a article for
<br/>
me with the schedule and then David put it up for me.  Thanks again David!
<br/>
<br/>
The big thing that happened to me and turned this into a great convention
<br/>
was the Ramapo College giving me $2000 to help cover the expenses of
<br/>
getting everything I needed to make this tournament as exciting as
<br/>
possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of the prizes I got for RCon II

<br/>
<br/>
So after I was able to get all of the prizes organized I needed to get
<br/>
events planned.  After all was said and done we had these events-
<br/>
2 SW Constructed Friday tournaments
<br/>
2 YJ Constructed Saturday tournaments
<br/>
RCon Championship (Sat)
<br/>
No Such Thing As Luck (Sat)
<br/>
Booster Draft Sealed Deck using CC, JP and Premiere (Sat)
<br/>
2 Austin Powers tournaments (Sat)
<br/>
RCon Team Tournament (Sun)
<br/>
<br/>
Looking for volunteers to run the events was easy!  I actually had to turn
<br/>
people away because I wanted to give the Squadron Members a chance to
<br/>
play.  Here was the list of people I had running events-
<br/>
<br/>
Rich Haman
<br/>
Ted Panczyszyn
<br/>
Chris Gogolen
<br/>
Jason Lembo
<br/>
Doug Faust
<br/>
<br/>
Plus Bart Robinson and Blythe Hermley-Keen kept everything going on
<br/>
Saturday!
<br/>
<br/>
So after the events, prizes, and Rooms were ready it was time to get some
<br/>
special guests...Justin Pakes and Kevin Reitzel happened to have some time
<br/>
and was able to make the trip with Dan Bojanowski, The Virginia State
<br/>
Champ. The best part is that they came up as Three Star Wars players and
<br/>
not Decipher guys which was great because neither of them had had the
<br/>
chance to play in a while.
<br/>
<br/>
So come Friday, I was able to stress a bit and get things ready to start
<br/>
up.  So Jonathan Chu and Charlie Herren go and eat with me, during that I
<br/>
meet up with Todd Thiener, Craig Berry, and Mike Blythe but they are tired
<br/>
and want to get sleep so they leave for the hotel until 2pm.  So waiting
<br/>
around and getting ready we meet with Tom Hermley-Keen and Mike Dalton.
<br/>
After going to the room that the tournament was going to be for and
<br/>
noticing that it was a sauna, I decided to find a different room.  After
<br/>
finding another room the first tournament Rich Haman started the
<br/>
tournament with 12 people including my only tournament participation
<br/>
during the weekend (besides a thrashing by Travis for fun on Sunday).
<br/>
<br/>
Onto the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Anktopot vs Mike Dalton's (2010) TR Mains
<br/>
<br/>
Mike and I have played these two decks plenty of times against each other.
<br/>
My guess is 10 times in playtesting and 4 in tournament play.  The one
<br/>
time in tournament play I won was in states and I knew he would get
<br/>
revenge, not to mention stay away from the D* Docking Bay this time too.
<br/>
I don't remember much about this game except the game was very close back
<br/>
and forth with me taking out his Falcon with Zuckuss and Vader piloting
<br/>
and him picking off Vader a few times.  The big blow that swung the game
<br/>
was me leaving Dengar by himself at a site...he dropped EPP Luke and EPP
<br/>
Han, hit Dengar then drew 2 destiny...I was able to play Res Luk Rauf to
<br/>
get 1 Battle Destiny and I hit both Han and Luke but I lost 16 force to
<br/>
the battle...game over.
<br/>
<br/>
FL (-15)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights-Hitting Luke and Han with Dengar
<br/>
Lowlights- Losing 16 in that battle...
<br/>
<br/>
So I get to play Todd Theiner next.  We played last at an 8th Man at DCon
<br/>
at a 3am tournament...we played about 4 or 5 am then so we both don't
<br/>
remember much about it.  I do know we split those games though.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Juz's Revenge vs Todd Theiner's (1723) Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
This game went really well for me.  In fact, I had a Character named Tawss
<br/>
Khaa single handedly beat the Dark Side.  I had Draw Their Fire out and
<br/>
retrieved 5 times I battled with Tawss.  To make it worse I predicted
<br/>
right in each of those battles and retrieved 5 more with Tawss' gametext.
<br/>
I was so happy, I had Todd sign my Tawss.  The entire game I was drawing 5
<br/>
destinies and his were extremely low.  Not much he could do, especially
<br/>
after canceling Visage.  Before the game Chu was talking about 2 Tawss
<br/>
Khaa's aren't needed...during the game I was shouting out how much force
<br/>
she retrieved and it made me laugh...I guess you had to be there ;).
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+25)
<br/>
<br/>
2(+10)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights- Tawss baby!  10 retrieved force from her.
<br/>
Lowlights- None
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Anktopot vs Jonathan Chu's (1983) LS Juz's Revenge (Twigg Style)
<br/>
<br/>
So I know I can win this game because my lightside deck can never win
<br/>
against the dark...strange but true.  I had Visage going the whole game
<br/>
and great activation too so having Hunt Down flipped early made his life
<br/>
miserable.  I used my Holonet's to cancel his TT's and that kept Visage
<br/>
going.  Put All Sections On Alert is definitely now my favorite card.  I
<br/>
was happy that I made a believer of that Saturday out of Juz when he put
<br/>
it in his deck ;).
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+6)
<br/>
<br/>
4(+26)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights- Beating the eventual Two-time RamapoCon II Champion ;)
<br/>
Lowlights- not winning by enough ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Juz's Revenge vs Jonathan Chu's (1983) ROps
<br/>
<br/>
This game was maybe close for the first 5 minutes but after that I was
<br/>
dead.  My deck cannot deal with the forfeit bonus that the IAO and AT-ST
<br/>
Pilots get along with the Reacts.  The destinies are all two high with the
<br/>
objective...plus he started Resistance.  How could he not.  This game had
<br/>
some chance but having Tawss and EPP Luke stranded on Yavin draining for 0
<br/>
and Obi-Wan getting lost in the desert on Raltiir didn't help.
<br/>
<br/>
FL (-20)
<br/>
<br/>
4(+6)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights- Using Projections to cancel drains
<br/>
Lowlights- Taking out the Tibrin in my deck...not that it would have
<br/>
mattered ;).
<br/>
<br/>
So I scrub out against good competition and take 7th place and Charlie
<br/>
Herren gets the Captain Han Solo Foil.  I go and check the phone messages
<br/>
because Bart is coming up by train...and he leaves one.  I wasn't sure how
<br/>
long he was at the train station so I grab Gogolen to help me pick him up.
<br/>
On the way to the car we see Juz, Kevin Reitzel and Dan Bojonowski (VA
<br/>
State Champ).  We show them to the room and all of a sudden 28 people are
<br/>
in the room when we get Bart back!  Everyone started coming out of the
<br/>
woodwork.  The tournament would have been larger but some of the Albany
<br/>
guys wanted to tech for the big tournament tomorrow.   This tournament
<br/>
went extremely well with a great turnout.  Rich Haman helped me keep this
<br/>
tournament organized!  It was great to see Juz, Kevin playing again for
<br/>
the first time in a while!
<br/>

<br/>
So after the tournament (Which Rich helped again with!) I did my version
<br/>
of Kevin Reitzel's 'Because I can' prizes for some cool gameplay events.
<br/>
One of which was Manny Rodriguez having 4 biker scouts, 4 bikes, 4 biker
<br/>
cannons all at the same site.  The best one however was Tom Hermley-Keen
<br/>
using sniper with 4Lom to cancel Yoda's gametext so he could battle him!
<br/>
After the battle he even captured him with All Wrapped Up.  The top decks
<br/>
in the tournament were again Hunt Down, ROps, and Y4 Mains.  A big thanks
<br/>
to Kevin and Justin to being able to come up and play in their first
<br/>
tournament in a long time.  I believe this was Juz's first constructed
<br/>
tournament since 1998 in Austrailia.  As for Kevin, not exactly sure ;).
<br/>
<br/>
So I gave away the Jabba the Hutt foil to Jonathan Chu and I had some of
<br/>
the George Gundry 'special idea' posters signed by everyone and gave them
<br/>
away.  There was also a group of younger players that I gave some of the
<br/>
extra packs to and each of them also got Tanis and Velken signed cards.  I
<br/>
gave away packs of Jabba's Palace and Special Edition, which made everyone
<br/>
happy.  Afterwards, everyone went home and I went with Juz, Kevin and Dan
<br/>
to show them where the hotel was.  We show up, chatted a bit about tech
<br/>
and such for Saturday's tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Best quote of the weekend for me happened as us 4 were walking back to
<br/>
Dan's car right after the #2 earlybird.  I asked Juz what he was going to
<br/>
play for Light Side tomorrow (Sat) and he said, 'I am going to play Juz's
<br/>
Revenge since someone named the deck after me.'  He didn't realized who
<br/>
thought of the deck name so I kind of smiled and said, 'Juz, that was me.'
<br/>
I thought it was funny, guess you had to be there.
<br/>
<br/>
So Juz and I worked on his dark deck and light decks, swapping cards out
<br/>
of my deck and into his as needed.  Saturday was going to be a good day
<br/>
for him and some of the tech he used was just plain awesome.  At about 3am
<br/>
I got into bed in time for my 3 hours of sleep.  Friday night was great
<br/>
all of us sitting around chatting for a while, Kevin was making his deck,
<br/>
Dan was just relaxing and Juz was trying to figure out some secret
<br/>
tech...that tech was to be placed in his deck for Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
So sleep was a good thing at 3am.  Day 2 report will be coming
