<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After my 5-1 last weekend, I definitely felt like playing again this weekend, despite the fact that I rented Perfect Dark and was up til around 5am playing it with my roommates.  I took the same two decks, changed 3 cards in my DS, and expected to play some of the same people as in Cedar Grove, especially Mike Dalton.  We had 16 players show up, one of whom this was his first tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't remember what I was playing-DS Huntdown, LS HB/Tat mains/OMDH.  I was rated 1880 at the start of the tournament(+71 points for my 5-1 last saturday)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Jonathan Torres (1500) Ralltir Ops/Troopers
<br/>
	Hey wouldn't you know it, I get to play the newbie. Good, I'm hungry and there is a bagel place in the shopping center.  This kid really was just learning how to play.  He kept forgetting what order the phases went in, never started a battle, and when I battled him I had to remind him that he could draw a destiny since he had 4 ability.  The deck wasn't horrible, obviously one of his friends helped him build it, but he just didn't know how to use it.  I put my ability 4 guys on Ralltir along with EPP Han who just shot his guys.  Orrimaarko was also huge.  I was coaching him towards the end, reminding him to force drain me at the one site I let him hold, but I got hungry and just finished off those guys too, then went and got a bagel.  I had 14 cards in my hand and traffic control out, but didn't put them back.  If I housed him in his very first tournament game, he might have gotten discouraged and quit playing, and I didn't want to be a total douche bag.

FW +34   2(+34)

Game 2 DS vs Michael Dalton(2067) HB/OMDH/Tat Mains.
<br/>
	This matchup was my only loss last weekend, but I knew I could beat him if I got the right start.  I got Vader down 2nd turn, flip.  He didn't cancel Visage the entire game.  Took him a few turns to find Ben and Luke-there are 3 of each in his deck.  Finally he gets Ben and Melas into the cantina, so now we both lose to visage.  I have my squad in hand ready to deploy and give his guys a whooping, but I forgot to put my 6's back with reactor so I have to wait. He puts down EPP Luke with them.  I put down u-3po to block the drain, put my 6's back.  He sorry about the messes, but then he doesn't drain. I activate and save so I can do this right.  He forgets to drain again, and deploys Yoda, then smacks himself in head for forgetting to drain.  He has 1 force saved.  I deploy the squad-Iggy with gun, dengar with gun, djas puhr, and dr. evazan to the cantina.  I have my 6's set up.  I also deploy first strike.  I battle, dengar shoots ben(he had a saber too), operate.  Luke swings and misses dengar.  dengar shoots at luke, blaster deflection cancels it, so then Ig captures luke, and then I draw a 6 for destiny.  Melas and about 9 cards is what he loses, Djas puhr is what I lose.  I've got the ground, Captain Han in falcon can't pull off to many OMDH by himself.  eventually I go to space with zuckuss and bus just to battle and retrieve.

Game 3 vs Michael Smith(1698) Huntdown/duel
<br/>
	He starts epic duel and bad feeling, so right away I know he has elis in the deck.
<br/>
I start goo nee tay.  He saves for two turns and then drops Vader and Tarkin to the Defensive permiter with a presence of the force.  I projection the site, then deploy jeroen webb and tawss khaa to holotheatre.  I get a drain or 2 off and then mara comes down and kills the two of them.  I had already put out EPP Luke and Han to his CC: downtown plaza.  he deploys blizzard 1, evazan piloting, and puts djas puhr as a passenger so he can't be hit, then tramples Han and battles.  Ok, he gets no destiny and I draw a tracked 5, since I knew he had to be coming sooner or later.  next turn i deploy another epp han, and put ben kenobi in the cantina.  he drains for another turn or two, i'm outdraining, and I deploy my ships to tatooine and pull off OMDHs.  I get boussh to the 3rd marker, then he elises vader to the cantina and duels Ben, i lose no big deal, I just retrieve some of the lost cards, and then break boussh's cover, deploy orrimarrko and beat a tempest scout and tarkin.  nothing he can do with just vader, especially when I put out battle plan.  FW +20  6(+81)

<br/>
Game 4 DS vs Rob Middleton(1773) Y4 Mains.
<br/>
	He starts the usual, pulls the nudjs.  Uses a first turn revo on my meditation chamber, but I had crush in hand.  I deploy and endor site, crush, pull evader and cancel the revo.  he deploys boussh(breaks cover) and epp luke to holotheatre, then I deploy vader to endor and flip.  no drain for them.  he starts moving them to the executor docking bay so he can move to endor to fight vader.  he puts fury on vader and oola alone in the throne room.  i have mara in hand, but the saber's not in the reserve deck so I draw for it.  he deploys obi to vader, I barrier, then he moves boussh and luke to the docking bay and nabruns to obi.  I deploy mara with saber to oola, and tarkin, evax, and evazan to vader, deploy first strike(he has 1 force left, i thought for a barrier, but no).  battle oola first, swing and miss and draw a 0 for destiny-that sucked!!.  he just loses oola.  then I battle with vader and squad.  swing at luke, miss, he goes for vader and misses.  I play I have you now. he plays skywalkers, but I cancel it with Boring Conversation.  I draw 12 in attrition so Obi and Boussh die, i lose evax.  his turn he deploys another Obi-wan and his saber and battles.  luke swings at vader and misses, vader swings at ben and I draw a 6,0.  Ben hits vader.  I lose all 3, he loses luke.  Mara is still draining for 3 and we are both losing to visage.  I deploy u-3po to block his drain.  he wants to move obi back to executor, but doesn't have enough force.  I deploy Choke vader with saber, battle and swing, hit obi, he draws low.  Objective flips, visage makes him lose and I am draining for 6.  Game, set, match.   Fw +24    8(+105)

Yeah, 9-1 over the past week.  Feels good to be playing solid again as we get closer to the regional(june 17th).  I ain't gonna win(well maybe, but the bookies have me at around 20-1), but I just want to get back to the player that I used to be a few months ago.
