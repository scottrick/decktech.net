<br/>
<br/>
Well finally it happened, the first big tournament this
<br/>
year, the national. The last couple of months I was tweaking
<br/>
and toying with decks for this day. I playtested a lot with
<br/>
my friends Vitor Alves da Silva, Michel Oldenburg and Sander
<br/>
Dijst. Sander is a former world qualifier and hadn't played
<br/>
the game for a long time. Now he also dusted off his cards
<br/>
for this day. It was held in Amstelveen and that's my
<br/>
hometown and furthermore it was held across the street. A 
<br/>
good 1 minute walk. 
<br/>
<br/>
The decks were a problem for me. I always play Mains &amp; Toys
<br/>
for both sides. For light the choice was between Throne
<br/>
Room Mains, Tosche Mains or Profit. I played Profit on my
<br/>
last two tournaments and it hadn't lost there so after some
<br/>
tweaking and some modifications that was my deck. For dark
<br/>
there was a big problem. I couldn't find a dark deck that
<br/>
did well in playtesting. I had tried Endor Ops, 
<br/>
3rd Marker/5th Marker, Court etc. Nothing worked for me.
<br/>
Then I came across 'The Info Broker's Hunt Down-deck'. It
<br/>
worked like hell for my opponents in playtesting. So that 
<br/>
was my dark deck. 
<br/>
<br/>
Light : Profit modified to my style
<br/>
Dark : The Info Broker's Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
After the big walk we entered the arena. So on to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
LS vs Maarten Rossou Court Of The Vile Gangster starting
<br/>
Bad Feeling Have I
<br/>
<br/>
Maarten is a fun opponent but also a good one. I started 
<br/>
Goo Nee Tay against him. From the moment I took my starting
<br/>
hand I knew I was in trouble. All I had were interrupts and
<br/>
effects. So no locations and no characters. He started by
<br/>
the way with Jabba The Hutt and Chall Bekan. He got 
<br/>
CC-Engineer from his deck and converted the Audience 
<br/>
Chamber. So with no force activation and no characters I 
<br/>
couldn't do nothing but picking up some cards and hoping for
<br/>
some sites. He setted up some space and in the meantime I 
<br/>
draw some characters, but no locations. So what could I do,
<br/>
save force and deploy some or drawing more cards up hoping 
<br/>
for some locations. I also couldn't retrieve anymore because
<br/>
he also setted up a brutal force in the Audience Chamber. I 
<br/>
knew I was losing, but how can I make the loss less 
<br/>
painfull. Well I couldn't I lost with 27.
<br/>
0 (-27)
<br/>
<br/>
Well that was a good start, NOT!! The good thing about it 
<br/>
was that I lost all the tention about winning the 
<br/>
tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
DS vs Jurn de Ruiter Tosche Mains starting Goo Nee Tay
<br/>
<br/>
I talked to Jurn before the tournament about decks by email.
<br/>
I advised him to use a deck that I send him. He did so I 
<br/>
knew what to expect and started with Presence Of The Force 
<br/>
on Tosche Station. I got an early Vader and deployed him on 
<br/>
my second turn. He also came out strong with an early Luke 
<br/>
on Tosche Station. I was lucky that I got Luke away from the
<br/>
table and begin a big draining party in space. He tried to 
<br/>
do some damage, but Obi got circled/dueled away and that was
<br/>
the game there. I won with 22.
<br/>
2 (-5)
<br/>
<br/>
My dark proved to be a stabile deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
DS vs Bram Snepvangers Speed Profit starting General Han 
<br/>
and Goo Nee Tay
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know him and with his Magic shirt and his playing 
<br/>
style I could see that he wasn't playing SWCCG on a regular 
<br/>
basis. He made some mistakes now and then, but also 
<br/>
surprised me at one time. I started Come Here You Big Coward
<br/>
and he obviously didn't know the card. He was struggling 
<br/>
through the game and his Ben got circled early so he had a 
<br/>
hard time pulling his thing off. For me it was an easy game,
<br/>
I was draining in space as well on the ground. He had no 
<br/>
starships in his deck so space was easy for me. Draining for 
<br/>
8 and Visage killed him. I won with 25.
<br/>
4 (+20)
<br/>
<br/>
Well if I keep on winning like this I still got a shot at 
<br/>
winning it all.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
LS vs Paul van Horne This Deal  starting Imperial Arrest 
<br/>
Order
<br/>
<br/>
I had never played aginst him, but there is a first time for 
<br/>
everything. I started normal Profit with Goo Nee Tay. He put 
<br/>
no aliens in the Audience Chamber. He had a hard time 
<br/>
setting up his Deal. I put Tawss Khaa early on Cloud City 
<br/>
and Orrimaarko on another CC location. He is only picking up 
<br/>
cards. In the meantime I was setting up a steady drain at 
<br/>
Bespin with my starships and on Cloud City, because he 
<br/>
wasn't deploying anything. He had maybe 30 cards in hand and 
<br/>
only 15 force in his reserve deck. He setted up his Deal and 
<br/>
could only deploy some characters. They got kicked around and 
<br/>
after I retrieved with profit he stopped the game. I won 
<br/>
with 34.
<br/>
6 (+54)
<br/>
<br/>
Only two more big wins to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
LS vs Sander Dijst 3rd Marker/5th Marker Mains and Toys 
<br/>
starting Bad Feeling Have I
<br/>
<br/>
Sander is a good friend and a very good SWCCG-player. I 
<br/>
playtested against him and during playtesting we ended up 
<br/>
50/50 with these decks. I started with Battle Order so when 
<br/>
he started with Mara Jade and moved her away it will cost 
<br/>
him to drain. I had a beautiful starting hand, two locations 
<br/>
and when I drew cards for the first time I picked another 
<br/>
one. So I had enough force to do my thing. We had the first 
<br/>
5/6 rounds every turn a batlle on Tatooine JP. After I 
<br/>
counted my force loss, I thought it was time to retrieve 
<br/>
some force I free up Han. Vader visited the party, but we 
<br/>
both agreed that Orrimaarko is a oneyed son of a b.. He 
<br/>
lost a lot through him. I setted up a drain at the Defensive 
<br/>
Perimeter and it was to much for him to handle. I won the 
<br/>
game with 21.
<br/>
8 (+75)
<br/>
<br/>
I almost pull it off.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
DS vs Johan van der Meer Throne Room Force Choke starting 
<br/>
Goo Nee Tay (I believe, correct me when I'm wrong Johan)
<br/>
<br/>
Johan was the top player at that moment, the only 
<br/>
undefeated player. I must win big here and I was in the 
<br/>
final. He started normal Throne Room. I started with 
<br/>
Presence Of The Force on the Throne Room. He activated and 
<br/>
deployed the Nudj, both of them (not at the Throne Room) and 
<br/>
tried a Revolution on the Med Chamber. Luckily for me I had 
<br/>
one of my 3 Evaders in hand and that was one loss for him. I 
<br/>
had an Vader and his saber in my opening hand and also 
<br/>
Kashyyyk. Deployed Kashyyyk picked up and saved some force 
<br/>
for my next turn Vader. He wasn't really in the game and 
<br/>
made some big mistakes. I had my Vader down and drained him 
<br/>
for 4 at the Throne Room and two at Kashyyyk (I had Zuckuss 
<br/>
there in the meantime). It was to much for him to handle. 
<br/>
The Visage did his work although he cancelled it at one 
<br/>
point. The crucial mistake he made was that he activated 
<br/>
until he had two force left. He looked for a Nudj only to 
<br/>
look at the two cards. I got to verify that it was a 0 and 
<br/>
a 4. He used Nabrun to get Obi against Vader and he draw the 
<br/>
4. I had on the other hand a Circle in my hand and used it 
<br/>
against him. He had only one force left and that was the 0. 
<br/>
Game and I won with 26.
<br/>
<br/>
The impossible happened I'm the top player after 6 games, so 
<br/>
that means I will play the final against no. 2. That was 
<br/>
Maarten Rossou, but we both wanted also to attend the Young 
<br/>
Jedi tournament and since we both are going to Brussel we 
<br/>
agreed not to play the final. So we are both the Dutch 
<br/>
Champions for a year, only I got the props because I was the 
<br/>
top player.
<br/>
<br/>
By the way Young Jedi sucks ass. There was no fun at all, 
<br/>
only when we played each other and when I played Jeroen van
<br/>
de Bosch (he's also a swccg-player). (for the record I went 
<br/>
3-3)
