<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">haha, so i get back from missouri (boring, no offense to you missourans) after playing a whole bunch with my brother down there, and its my first tournament back.. so since i played a lot with my two fave decks (ROps and Throne Room) i decide to go with a couple different ones that i have lying around that are just as good (Dagobah X-wings, and High Destiny HuntDown).. Ill post the decks on here eventually...
<br/>
It was only a four gamer, so ill try and keep it short.. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS HuntDown vs. Erick Butzlaff's Throne Room Mains
<br/>
<br/>
 Erick is a well intentioned guy, but he has this annoying ability to find exactly what the net deck of the month is, and play some heavily modified yet extrapolated version of it week after week.. so when i saw the throne room start i wanted to be cautious of #s... anyway, theres a little trick vs throne room with huntdown that drives people nuts (it works best with duelling, but isnt restricted to it).. in any case i like to start prescence of the force on the throne room against Throne Room because with an early vader on Y4, and the huge destiny in my deck, im more than willing to take on mains early in the game with darth (it was set up essentially to take the world on with just the dark lord, and can easily do that) and in any case stopping the choke from nudj's on Y4 greatly reduces the sting of that deck because theyre forced to defend the farm (a drain of 3 with darth/mara + saber but only a drain of one for light) and thus cant dedicate as much to draining me anywhere else, plus most decks play only 2 nudjs, so it leaves a very good drain location open for me on Y4 at any time... first turn he draws a couple, after a nudj, and my turn i play the death star and 3rd marker, draw a few.. i play mara w/saber, and a walker to the third marker a turn later for a decent drain (im holding a barrier and a YAB) and on his turn to avoid taking even more damage he lays momaw nadon and orrimarko at the holotheater.. at this point i have 2 choices.. i can lay CHYBC and ignore the drains, or i can kill the invaders, do some damage, and hopefully get another visage soon.. in any case, i elect to go for it vs the interlopers.. i lay vader w/saber, initiate battle, play I Have You Now (orrimarko is ab&gt;2), then clash orrimarko (so i get extra destinies but he doesnt get to kill my vader w/saber) and easily slash momaw.. i draw 6,6 for destiny, and he loses 17... he just draws on his turn, so on mine, i sniper orrimarko, and beam vader back to hand.. later, vader , walker, and evazan go to the farm via another PoTF, kill a nudj, and manage to beat the crap out of Luke, Han and Obi, duel obi, trample han, I Have you now/Slash luke, he loses 12 or something.. pretty easy win

Game 2: Im only in 2nd place, as someone won by 41???
<br/>
My Dagobah X-wings vs. Someone's Court
<br/>
<br/>
I was scared about this game, as i dont want to lose to a court deck played by someone i know i should beat just because im playing X-wings.. Well, i draw kessel in my opening hand, play a yoda/etc, and he ACTUALLY LAYS DS Kashyyyk?? so i play kessel next turn, with an x-wing at both sites, and a houjix in hand.. he falls for it, plays a dred+pilot and searches for zuckuss, and initiates.. i out of nowhere (since there is no first strike on table) and he loses the pilot on the dred.. at the end of his turn i play OA and search for 3 X-wings (i had deployed S-Foils 2nd turn) and drop 4 X-wings, Red SQ X-wing, and RL in R1, and X-wing laser cannons, battle, instant kill Zuckuss, play another Organized Attack for extra power.. and power pivot the dred so its got nothing..  so i have power 41 to his 5, he loses the drednought for 5, plus 36 cards.. next turn i drain him out for the game... he was a little upset, as hed never seen swarm before, and he was a little distressed... i felt bad i guess.. 
<br/>
Full win +30
<br/>
overall:4(+66)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS High Destiny HuntDown vs. Mike Schuff's Speeder Ops
<br/>
<br/>
Great. Speeder Ops. He tries to get the jump on me with speeders, and since he sees an alter go off the top of my deck from visage, he holds off on playing flaps. However, his first turn Op Op speeder Speeder Site Site Site is answered with fett, a blizzard scout 1, a walker, and Igar (i deployed a couple sites and didnt draw much first turn), and he loses a bunch from the exchange (no houjix i guess)..  i then move my guys to his farm, where i plan on eventually laying a potf... anyway, on his next turn, he plays another operative/spdr/luke and lays flaps (hes obviously going for a beatdown here)  pair but has run out of steam.. but since im mean, i lay vader/blizzard two vs one of them (the op is in the vehicle) so his power is 3 plus destiny, and mine is 12 plus.. i draw a 5, he draws a 3, i lose nothing. he loses both, at the other site, ive got mara jade+saber facing masterl luke, and given the destiny in my deck (Thirty Six 5 or 6 destiny cards, two  7's and the destiny ive seen so far from him (mostly 3's and 2's because of ops/speeders) and the fact that mara has a saber that gives her +2 its almost like cancelling any courage of a skywalker that he might have.. so i duel luke and draw a 6,4 he draws a 3,3 (no duel defense in hand) so i get master luke and 5 force (since hes already lost some to visage and deployed a bunch, losing 15 would give the game up for him).. so i initiate battle with master luke and mara against his operative/speeder pair, and since luke was on the speeder to protect him from sabers (vader was already on the table so he wasnt a consideration)  i can beam the operative back to his hand and battle the lone speeder with a power 15 against his 2, he loses the speeder for 3 and 10 more (whoops, shouldve just put luke out of play) and i consolidate my stuff a little, lay a couple PoTF so i can drain for 3 at 2 locations, and he goes down hard.. 
<br/>
full win +27

Game 4: My LS X-wings vs another court deck by Mike Schuff
<br/>
<br/>
I hate court decks.. This one was more traditional, with early search for mara, early search for S&amp;D.. well, we drain race it for a while, im cancelling with its a hit, ICBW, rebel fleet, cancelling his bonuses, and reducing with projection of a skywalker, while hes taking drains of 6 (2 at kiffex, 3 at kessel, 1 at tatooine) and losing to Civil Disorder.. Rebel Fleet never gets altered, so im cancelling all game with that, and by the time he gets enough grabbers to grab everything im using, ive got the endgame All Wings Set up to retreive 9, and then sink some of my X-wings in the swamp to keep the rebel fleet going.. This game takes forever, but really isnt ever close.. it ends after i lay an EPP and whack one of his lone people for 7, but it wasnt going to be close anyway.. he couldnt pay to drain at that point.. 
<br/>
Full win +32
<br/>
8 (+129)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this tournament was pretty easy, although i found that D:X-wings are an even bigger pain in the butt than i had ever imagined, and im actually considering refining it a little and making it my regular deck, weaknesses against IAO not withstanding, its awesome against ROps, and is wicked in space...  For DS the duelling worked out well, even though i didnt expect to beat the Speeder Ops deck really.. The highlight of the tournament was turning master luke to the dark side (this was my first time actually playing a duelling DS in a sanctioned tourney) and then returning an operative to his hand to battle his lone speeder.. he could never get around battle order because i didnt lay any systems, and i elected to pay for my battle order and not lay anything to his system.. so there was no opportunity for landing claw/RL to get around paying.. 
<br/>
all in all one of the more enjoyable experiences ive had at a tournament in a while.. pulled some butt rares in my prize suppor though..
