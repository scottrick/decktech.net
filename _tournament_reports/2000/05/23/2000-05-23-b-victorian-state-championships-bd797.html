<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">G'day,
<br/>
Kev harassed me into writing a tourney report, so I figured I might as well
<br/>
send it here too.
<br/>
<br/>
For light, I was playing a cool Profit Odds deck I've called 'POAS'
<br/>
<br/>
POAS stands for Profit Odds And Stuff (and some half-decent destiny 5 effect
<br/>
too)
<br/>
<br/>
This is pretty much the deck I played (and won with) at my states, but with
<br/>
a few changes I reckon it needed.  It was designed for a meta heavy with
<br/>
Raltiir Ops and Tatooine:Aliens, and throughout the day it had an average
<br/>
winning differential of over 40.  It worked rather nicely, and owes a lot to
<br/>
Scott Lingrell's deck 'Juz's Revenge.'

       You Can Either Profit By This... / Or Be Destroyed
<br/>
------------------------------------
<br/>
Use Tibrin to get back stuff, and once you get Lando out there, you should
<br/>
be able to draw 3 battle destiny per battle (since they gotta battle due to
<br/>
Order TO Engage), and you can get Punch It! back every turn you play it.
<br/>
Throw either Wedge or Romas in as a pilot (Consider playing Toryn if you
<br/>
need to as well, possible in place of Tawss Khaa or Leesub), and keep yoru
<br/>
odds total up.  Artoo can do a gift, which will hurt Odds, as will
<br/>
Signalling for Battle Plan early.  Start Uh-Oh!, thereby preventing the
<br/>
first turn Hunt Down flip on Jabba's Palace, and don't release Han until
<br/>
you've got your opponent dead (and retrieve 10 force when needed).  Demotion
<br/>
messes with Vesden, and try to grab odds.  Plenty of EPPs to send on suicide
<br/>
runs, especially with Mechanical Failure + Romas to kill those irritating
<br/>
AT-STs (though Trample is kinda mean)
<br/>
<br/>
Since it is mostly inserts, the force issues against a Tatooine/Tat:JP start
<br/>
is not such a problem, and Artoo and Luke are both deploy -2.  Use BoShuda
<br/>
to protect Wioslea or Ardon Crell (who deploys free) or Leesub, and Order To
<br/>
Engage to evict the Dark Side from the Audience Chamber.
<br/>
<br/>
Little duelling protection, except for Glancing Blow, 'cause that's all you
<br/>
need with some decent destiny draws, and Glancing Blow is nice with some
<br/>
beatdown anyway.  Simply don't fight Vader w/ Luke/Obi-Wan if they got Epic
<br/>
Duel out.  If they do get Mara or someone otu to Jabba's Palace for an early
<br/>
drain, use Projection and Battle Plan to slow the damage, and once you get A
<br/>
Gift out there, you shouldn't have a problem.  LITW is very nice against a
<br/>
HuntDown deck that is lured by the prospective drain of 2 or 3 at Jabba's
<br/>
Palace.
<br/>
<br/>
Effective use of BoShuda and Uh-Oh! will win you games.
<br/>
<br/>
A change you might look at making is to add in the Hologameboard, and
<br/>
switching Bacta Tank out for the Savrip, and usign Transmission Terminated
<br/>
to help protect whatever you leave to drain there.
<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, you start Uh-Oh!.
<br/>

Anyway, onto the games:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, Light vs someone from Ballarat/Bendigo (i forgot the name)
<br/>
<br/>
He started with Ralltiir Ops, but I got a decent draw, though I did get
<br/>
2xTransmission Terminated in my opening hand.  I was soon inserting, used
<br/>
8d8 to complete A Gift (didn't draw Artoo until later), Leesub/Wioslea in
<br/>
the Audience Chamber with Boshuda, and I got Lando In Falcon and Wedge over
<br/>
to Raltiir via Tibrin.  He was playing with a bunch of sleens, which he
<br/>
deployed whenever he deployed a site, but not once got a site from reserve
<br/>
deck, and never flipped until the end of the game.  He threw a star
<br/>
destroyer or two at Lando, but the Spiral sped to its rescue, only to die in
<br/>
the battle.  Some shocking information from Raltiir early in the game
<br/>
allowed Lando to follow his destiny later, destroying a star destroyer with
<br/>
a tracked destiny 5.  Inserts finished him off, and I freed Han and did
<br/>
damage with Profit with Han and EPP Obi at the Audience Chamber, with EPP
<br/>
Luke and the high destiny aliens and Luke at Jabba's Palace.  In addition,
<br/>
Lando ran off to Tibrin, while the Tantive 4 went to Raltiir to protest
<br/>
against the subjugation and to enjoy the power +1 bonus.  :)  I finished the
<br/>
game with 0 cards in lost pile thanks to the retrieval of 10 force, and him
<br/>
not force draining once all game.  Vader did make an appearance on Raltiir,
<br/>
but he got really cranky, and his uncontrollable fury ate him up, especially
<br/>
knowing that Luke and Obi were on Tatooine, and he wasn't.
<br/>
Full win by 38 - 2+38
<br/>
<br/>
After this game, having had a chat to some of the other players, I found out
<br/>
that there were like 10 games with wins by over 30 force - Some real
<br/>
massacres.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, Dark vs Stuart Jones.
<br/>
We were playing the same Dark decks, which we both knew were really strong.
<br/>
On the decklist form, Stuart called his version 'If you beat this deck, you
<br/>
cheated,' which was quite appropriate.  Anyway, in our game, I got a good
<br/>
draw, holding both Battle Plan and Oppressive Enforcement in hand, and soon
<br/>
after Twileking for TBHTP to effectively stop his Sense and Alter.  I made a
<br/>
mistake early on in not flipping my objective when I should have, but in the
<br/>
end 3 destiny draws of 6 (two deliberate, one after a shuffle) won the game
<br/>
by 11 force.  Stuart ended up in 6th place.
<br/>
Full win by 11 - 4+49
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, Light vs David Huberman
<br/>
Dave was my apprentice in the beginners tournament last year, and kindly won
<br/>
a GOTM T-Shirt for me, which was nice.  Basically, my deck was too fast for
<br/>
his Hunt Down, and I again managed to draw 2 Transmission Terminateds into
<br/>
my opening hand.   Consequently, he was doing no force loss to me, and my
<br/>
starships drawing battle by themselves (or with a pilot) and Draw Their Fire
<br/>
beat up his TIE Defenders.  In the end, I threw down Tibrin and occupied it
<br/>
to throw more cards to my lost pile so I could retrieve as much as possible
<br/>
when I freed Han, and I used Obi-Wan and Luke to beat on Mara Jade in the
<br/>
Audience Chamber when I had no aliens in there.  Resistance was nasty since
<br/>
he occupied 3 battlegrounds when it came up once (Vader w/ POTF at the
<br/>
Meditation Chamber), but my starships cleaned up his solitary TIE Defenders.
<br/>
Full win by 43 - 6+92
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, Dark vs Rodney Lee
<br/>
Rod's a pretty decent player, and I think at this stage he was also
<br/>
undefeated.  However, he deployed EPP Han w/ Chewie and Wedge and the
<br/>
Tantive 4 to the Death Star, which I ignored courtesy of CHYBC.  Ben and
<br/>
Luke were slaughtered on Tatooine, and Rodney drew up early to prevent me
<br/>
from returning my hand (of like 12 cards) with Reactor Terminal.  His deck
<br/>
was meant to be a massive beatdown, but it simply couldn't drain, especially
<br/>
after CHYBC.  Once he deployed half his hit force, he simply had no way to
<br/>
deal with my guys who couldn't be beatdown by a fully fledged EPP team, let
<br/>
alone half of one.  Ben and Luke got hammered by IG-88 and 4-LOM in
<br/>
particular - From memory, over the whole tournament, my IG-88 captured 3
<br/>
Bens and 2 EPP Lukes, which was a good result for him.  And now Chris Janiak
<br/>
reckons I should remove him...pfft.  Also, Rodney finished the tournament in
<br/>
5th place.
<br/>
Full win by 24 {but i still had 12 cards in hand....} - 8+116
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, Dark vs Luca Costanzo
<br/>
As it turns out, I was supposed to play my light deck here, but before the
<br/>
parings were announced, Kev asked me to pick a hand (one of which contained
<br/>
a dark pin and the other a light pin), I picked the dark pin, and assumed
<br/>
that that was to be side, but apparently it was supposed to be Luca's.
<br/>
Either way, I played Dark here, and Luca's Hidden Base w/ EPPs and Figrin
<br/>
simply couldn't deal with a 3 walkers and Choke Vader chasing them whereever
<br/>
they went on the ground.  Obi-Wan borrowed Yoda's Gimer Stick, and EPP Luke
<br/>
sliced my only Vader once, but he was successfully Evadered, tracked back to
<br/>
hand, and re-deployed to ensure that the Damage from Order To Engage was
<br/>
negligble.  Tarkin and a couple of other dudes went to drain at a 2/0 with a
<br/>
POTF, and Search And DEstroy sped the game up - Eventually, Luca was
<br/>
effectively draining for 0, and I was draining for 6 once I killed off Obi,
<br/>
and that was it.  Fortunately, Yoda's Gimer Stick kept turning the site he
<br/>
was at into a non-battleground site, so S+D kicked in even though Obi was
<br/>
out.
<br/>
Full win by 13 - 10+129
<br/>
<br/>
I had been in 1st place since the end of game 3, but it was now into the
<br/>
business end of the toruney - One last game, against Daniel Robertson
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, Dark vs Daniel Robertson
<br/>
He also started, like Rodney, with Obi-Wan's Hut and Tosche Station, so I
<br/>
decided to let him do something.  He waited longer than I could, so i
<br/>
deployed the Avenger, Devastator, Dengar in Ship and Boba in Ship with
<br/>
pilots to Coruscant, and POTF too.  Next turn, I took over the Cantina with
<br/>
a bunch of dudes, and he was draining for 0.  Ben and Luke were mucking
<br/>
about on Tatooine running back and forth, as I was soon able to get a
<br/>
walker, plus Commadner IGar to Obi's Hut for two battle destinies. He
<br/>
eventually deployed the Falcon w/ Leia and Captain Han, so I had to battle
<br/>
it, and he played Punch It and I Know to add destiny.  I forfeited a few
<br/>
dudes, and he lost EPP Leia to attrition, and he ran away.  Consequently,
<br/>
Zuckuss in Mist Hunter with a tracked destiny 6 cleared out Han, and
<br/>
thereafter I was able to drain for free, while he was curtailed by Battle
<br/>
PLan and also the simple fact that there was nowhere from him to drain.
<br/>
Full win by 18 - 12 + 147.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the tournament, I was ahead of Donno (the only other
<br/>
undefeated player) by 40 diffential, so that was that.  There was talk of a
<br/>
7th or 8th game, but we simply ran out of time.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was good fun, and only one person dropped out, which was good.
<br/>
Kev ran a good tournament, and as far as I know, only California has been
<br/>
larger (with 57 people)
<br/>
<br/>
Props:
<br/>
Stu for building a bloody good dark deck
<br/>
Everyone I played for 6 decent games
<br/>
Kev, for not making a single bad ruling on any of my games
<br/>
Dono for coming second
<br/>
Scott Lingrell for the original inspiration for the light deck
<br/>
Everyone else for turning up
<br/>
Russel Crowe for putting in a good performance in Gladiator, which I went
<br/>
and saw with Rod afterwards
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
The venue owners who needed us out by 5pm
<br/>
Decipher for not releasing a CRD
<br/>
The train line for producing a timetable that makes it look like there's a
<br/>
7:10am train when there isn't (and for confusing me into thinking Sunday was
<br/>
Saturday)
<br/>
<br/>
Have a good one,
