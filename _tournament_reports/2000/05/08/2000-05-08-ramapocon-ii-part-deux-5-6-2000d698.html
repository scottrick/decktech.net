Pre-tourney notes
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
Coming off a successful first day of RamapoCon II, I tweak 
<br/>
my decks a little bit prior to the big tournament on 
<br/>
Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
The big decision to make was between playing Yavin 4 droids
<br/>
or mains. The droid deck is a machine - by now everyone
<br/>
knows it uses hit and run EPPs for big battle damage, 
<br/>
combined with droid inserts for a huge one or two turn loss
<br/>
that is difficult, if not impossible, to recover from. The
<br/>
mains deck was more solid -  but also more boring, and it's
<br/>
been around for a long time. On Friday, Imperial Barrier
<br/>
was surprisingly popular, making hit and run difficult, and
<br/>
the area in general was prepped for droids, so mains 
<br/>
became the deck of choice.
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning, I only made a few changes. In my ROPs deck,
<br/>
I switched out a Sandwhirl for a Monnok - almost everyone
<br/>
had heard at some point about some guy who had gotten 
<br/>
everyone Sandwhirled at the desert on Ralltiir, so nobody
<br/>
was about to deploy or move there. I also swapped Imperial
<br/>
Decree for Bubo - a tough call. Yavin 4 was rampant and 
<br/>
a first turn Bubo would be, in effect, a 2/0 site for the
<br/>
purposes of activation, but with 4 destiny. Also, Decree 
<br/>
was always a tough card to get active - with only four 
<br/>
ships in the deck, I never liked to put them at my 
<br/>
battleground systems to control the two system/one site 
<br/>
requirement. For the light side, I swapped my R-3P0 for 
<br/>
an Uncontrollable Fury, mainly because R-3P0 never saw
<br/>
any action and Fury is huge, if only to get rid of a
<br/>
You Are Beaten from your opponent's hand. I also switched
<br/>
Revolution for a Rebel Barrier. The rest of the decks can 
<br/>
be found in my report of Day one.
<br/>

<br/>
Day 2: the main tournament
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
Sixty-eight people showed up to compete at the second
<br/>
RamapoCon, held at Ramapo College, NJ. The competition
<br/>
was stiff; notable names included Brian and Chris Terwiliger,
<br/>
Matt Sokol, Steve Brentson, Charlie Herren, Mike Dalton,
<br/>
Chris Praskac, Wojciech Jankowski, and Dan Bojanowski, 
<br/>
among others. Team Albany and Ghetto Squad were out en force.
<br/>
There were players from ten states, including Michigan,
<br/>
Georgia and Virginia. Even Juz Pakes and Kevin Reitzel from
<br/>
Decipher were playing.
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament started a little late, but quickly made up
<br/>
the time - helping Scott Lingrell were Thomas and Blythe 
<br/>
Hermley-Keen, Bart Robinson, and Rich Haman, all of whom
<br/>
did an excellent job keeping the main event organized and
<br/>
efficient. Props to them all.
<br/>
<br/>
On to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
Game One: LS vs Wojciech Jankowski (2002)'s Endor Ops
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.... what a great starting opponent. I was hoping for
<br/>
an easier victory, but I was also confident about the 
<br/>
matchup - I had played Woj, each of us with the same decks,
<br/>
at last year's RamapoCon and more recently, the Philly GS, 
<br/>
notching wins of 26 and 30, so I knew more or less how to
<br/>
play it.
<br/>
<br/>
I got a decent draw and dropped a 2/0, a nudj and drew. His
<br/>
turn, he put out two systems to commence the force 
<br/>
activation and drew also. Most of the game, he either had
<br/>
as much force activation as I did, or more - this worried
<br/>
me a little because in the previous two matchups I had with
<br/>
him, he was choked for the greater part of those games. In
<br/>
any case, I got out an early Bacta Tank, reinforced later
<br/>
by Savrip, and these allowed me to keep my guys around in 
<br/>
space. I only packed three ships, so this was key. Control
<br/>
of the ground was mine the whole game, and when Battle Plan
<br/>
hit the table, I cleared off any guys he had left so he had
<br/>
to pay for his sparse drains the rest of the game. This 
<br/>
matchup sucks ass for dark.
<br/>
FW 2(+21)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting the good matchup. Getting out the Tank,
<br/>
Savrip and having SAC dominate his red cards.
<br/>
Lows: The matchup sucked for him. Vesden hanging out in the
<br/>
bunker with a Nudj for a +2 drain somewhere almost every 
<br/>
turn late in the game when I had it in hand.
<br/>
<br/>
The big names recorded wins for the most part after the
<br/>
first game, not surprisingly. One notable upset - Juz beat
<br/>
Ray Bordier by a good margin. The second game moved in 
<br/>
without any delay - interestingly (and to their loud
<br/>
disapproval), the Terwiliger brothers were matched up. I
<br/>
was paired with Patrick Ziagos, from Clarks Summit, PA. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: ROPs vs Patrick Ziagos (1821)'s Hidden Base Revo
<br/>
<br/>
He started Hidden Base... and I thought immediately, auto-
<br/>
win. He was a really nice guy who played slowly, but 
<br/>
thoroughly. The game started out rough from the first turn -
<br/>
I got one 2/0 site, which is nice, but his turn, he drops 
<br/>
3 2/0's and revolves mine. So I activate my 3, draw... no
<br/>
2/0's. He puts out another 2/0 (count the force advantage...
<br/>
15 to 4) and draws. I hit him with a used monnok to reduce
<br/>
his hand size drastically but damn he just drew it all
<br/>
back the turn after. Soon he gets out a Traffic Control 
<br/>
and puts everything he needs in his hand and everything else
<br/>
back into his deck. He has guys all over my planet and I
<br/>
was activating basically nothing. The game was slow - I had
<br/>
a few small victories on the ground here and there - but he 
<br/>
played it smart, always had enough in his hand to wreck what
<br/>
I put down, and prevented the flip long enough to make it
<br/>
useless. Civil Disorder locked the game down.
<br/>
FL 0(-15)
<br/>
Overall: 2(+6)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting a 2/0 in my hand! That was all...
<br/>
Lows: I think out of 10 games, ROps would beat his deck
<br/>
7 or 8. He got a damn good draw, but to his credit, Patrick
<br/>
played it like a champ, preventing the trademark ROPs
<br/>
turnaround.
<br/>
<br/>
So after getting hammered, I went outside to see how
<br/>
everyone else had done. Brian had gotten massacred by Chris
<br/>
by 33 cards, and it seemed like Revolution decks were 
<br/>
pretty popular - both Travis Desell and Chris Praskac 
<br/>
were sporting them and went 6-0 each between this tournament
<br/>
and the team tournament. I was disappointed in the previous
<br/>
game but didn't really care and went into game three 
<br/>
ready to kick ass and chew bubble gum...
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: LS vs George Gundry (1543)'s Court Snowtrooper 
<br/>
Odds
<br/>
<br/>
That's right... Court Snowtrooper Odds. He played a first
<br/>
turn Twi'lek and snagged Undercover... and then pulled 
<br/>
Hoth: Docking Bay from his deck and Garindan using the JP
<br/>
gametext. heheh....
<br/>
<br/>
Luke with Lightsaber hit the Sarlacc pit to stop the Court
<br/>
GT force loss, and I drew. He drew. I got some more
<br/>
activation and drew... lots of guys in my hand. His turn,
<br/>
he puts out Serg Major Bursk (the snowtrooper guy), a cadet, 
<br/>
and a snowtrooper... no insert. I slap down Obi-Wan, his
<br/>
saber, Tawss and some guys for a beating. His cadet moves 
<br/>
away into the Hoth: war room and I sense his Trooper assault
<br/>
for a load of damage. The rest of this game goes downhill
<br/>
for him, as he can't keep any guys on the table for insert 
<br/>
and any red cards he put out got SAC'ed away. Hell, his
<br/>
Sarlacc couldn't even touch Luke. It was a mess.
<br/>
FW 2(+29)
<br/>
Overall: 4(+35)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: the game
<br/>
Lows: not being able to kill Garindan, who sat undercover
<br/>
in the audience chamber the whole game.
<br/>
<br/>
Chris Terwiliger was undefeated at this point, along with
<br/>
Ghetto Leader himself, sitting at the head table all the 
<br/>
way up to this point. Michael Dalton was also undefeated. 
<br/>
Dalton got paired up with little Twigg and Hodur played
<br/>
a Team Albany member, Mike D'amboise, who was sporting
<br/>
a nifty Profit numbers deck. I went back to inching my way
<br/>
to the top table.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: my ROPs vs Frank Walsh (1717)'s Profit mains
<br/>
<br/>
This game starts real slow... decent draw but after that I'm
<br/>
getting nothing I need. He draws for like 5 turns straight,
<br/>
and by then I flip, but I'm not draining for any because
<br/>
I'm stupid and I put out Battle Order. He flips with eight
<br/>
cards in his lost pile and retrieves them all. So it goes
<br/>
back and forth, I'm losing 4, he's losing 4, and it's close.
<br/>
I don't put out Oppressive because he started Do or Do Not
<br/>
so there's obviously no SAC involved in his deck... and he
<br/>
makes me pay by playing On the Edge, tracking a six, when
<br/>
I have only two cards left. Ouch. That puts the game slightly
<br/>
in his favor, but he mistracks the next time and kills off
<br/>
his Obi and the saber that was put on him. Kashyyyk comes
<br/>
out way too late, but it's enough to put me ahead in the
<br/>
drain race. Ability^3 plugs him a few times because he only
<br/>
plays with the main characters basically and First Strike
<br/>
helps a little bit. The little damage is what does him in.
<br/>
FW 2(+5)
<br/>
Overall 6(+40)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning against a player that is better than his
<br/>
ranking
<br/>
Lows: I played like a shmuck all game and underestimated
<br/>
his deck. I won't do that with profit anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to trim the analysis because my plane is leaving
<br/>
soon. Hodur is still sitting at the top table, which is
<br/>
cool as hell. Twigg beat Dalton and is paired up with Hodur; 
<br/>
Praskac is also still undefeated.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Five: my ROPs vs Steve Brentson (2031)'s Speeder Ops
<br/>
<br/>
This is my first time talking or playing with Steve. I was
<br/>
looking forward to this game -  I thought the matchup was 
<br/>
in my favor because I've played against some of the best
<br/>
Speeder Ops in the world back in Nashville and I know how
<br/>
to play ROps against it. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I start the stuff and begin collecting guys to put all
<br/>
over his planet. My opening hand helps out a lot - a 2/0, 
<br/>
Tempest 1, Blizzard 2, and Darth Vader EPP. That's power
<br/>
for you. I draw a little and he goes. He puts out a Flaps
<br/>
and a site and draws. I plop another 2/0 and draw. During
<br/>
his turn, he locks flaps, puts out an Incom, an ithorian, 
<br/>
and two speeders at the swamp on Bothauwi. During my turn, I drop Tempest 1,
<br/>
some 2/2 scrub, and some other guy, trample his engineer,
<br/>
and commence the beating. He moves his remaining speeders
<br/>
away and puts out some more to ensure it doesn't get 
<br/>
hammered and draws. My turn, I feel silly and flip with 
<br/>
Arden, some 2/2 scrub and some other 2/2 scrub on ralltiir, 
<br/>
with Barrier as my only protection. But his hand isn't big
<br/>
enough to pose an immediate threat and I alter his Flaps
<br/>
successfully when Vader comes down for a beatdown so I feel
<br/>
safe. The whole game I am retrieving with First Strike when
<br/>
I battle and making him lose guys. Destinies come out in my
<br/>
favor - one time he has an engineer, an ithorian and an op 
<br/>
in a speeder at a site. I look for something, see four 3's
<br/>
in my reserve deck, and trample/capture his guys so he only
<br/>
gets one destiny. Eventually I flip him back and drain him
<br/>
out.
<br/>
FW 2(+16)
<br/>
Overall 8(+56)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Getting a great draw, knowing how to play against
<br/>
the deck and beating a tough opponent.
<br/>
Lows: nothing, really.
<br/>
<br/>
Little Twigg beat Hodur that game, so him and Praskac are
<br/>
the only two undefeateds left. Unfortunately, they were
<br/>
the same side so they can't play - I'm at the second table,
<br/>
playing Travis Desell (who is dark side, luckily for me, 
<br/>
since I pack no Revo protection), while Hodur and Praskac
<br/>
duke it out in the battle of the Ghetto, and Twigg is
<br/>
playing the highest 4-1 on his side, John Lolli, at the #1
<br/>
table.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: my LS mains vs Travis Desell (1683)'s ROPs.
<br/>
<br/>
Travis is a good buddy of mine at home and he's much better
<br/>
than his rating - he didn't play for a long time, came back
<br/>
and got hammered. His dark deck was a modified version of 
<br/>
Charlie Herren's ROPs deck he used to win the Florida GS, 
<br/>
and I knew basically every card and also knew that he would
<br/>
stand a great chance of winning if he got a good draw. That's
<br/>
ROPs for you, nothing special. So I was happy as hell when
<br/>
he didn't put down any 2/0's his first turn.
<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my hand had 2 2/0's in it... hell yeah.
<br/>
I had like a 15 force difference in activation in my favor
<br/>
the entire game, and anything he put out got hammered into
<br/>
oblivion. This game was a total rout - the only 2/0 he put
<br/>
out all game was the Ice Plains, and I put down Orrimaarko
<br/>
at my Hoth: War Room and moved over for a drain of two the
<br/>
whole game. Obi and his saber were draining their share
<br/>
at the docking bay, and Tantive and some guys were chillin
<br/>
up in space. Civil Disorder came out and the Lockdown was
<br/>
complete.
<br/>
FW 2(+32)
<br/>
Overall 10(+88)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: my hand was ridiculously good and his was horrible.
<br/>
There wasn't much of a game in this game. We played outside
<br/>
right after, same matchups, and it was close but he ended
<br/>
up winning. Shows how much of a difference a good draw
<br/>
makes, especially in a close matchup like this.
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Little Twigg won again, but Praskac lost to Hodur in a 
<br/>
tough game, so Twigg was the only undefeated. He claimed
<br/>
first place, and I was the 5-1 player with the highest
<br/>
differential, so I got to play him in the final duel in 
<br/>
an attempt to defend my RamapoCon title.
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I gotta go catch my plane to go back to
<br/>
Nashville now, so I will include the final duel in Part 
<br/>
3 of my RamapoCon II report, which covers the team 
<br/>
tournament. Thanks for reading.
