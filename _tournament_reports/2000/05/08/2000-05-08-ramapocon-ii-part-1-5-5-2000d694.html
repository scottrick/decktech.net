<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is just part one of an overly long, extended and
<br/>
comprehensive tournament report of RamapoCon II. I have
<br/>
about seven hours until my flight outta here and a computer
<br/>
lab with T-1 internet access.

Pre-tourney notes
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
So my finals end on the Sunday before this tourney, and I
<br/>
have nothing to do for like five days. I talk to Clint and
<br/>
we're all about prepping for Ramapo all day Tuesday and 
<br/>
Wednesday. Sunday and Monday I'm throwing together all these
<br/>
goofy decks like Vegas-style and EV9D9 and Yavin 4 droids
<br/>
Twigg-style, plus keeping together as much as possible the
<br/>
tried and true, like ROPs and Hunt Down beats and Yavin 4
<br/>
mains. Vegas-style is cool as hell and I'm thinking it'd be
<br/>
fun to play this stuff if I got to learn how to play it.
<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday rolls around and me and Clint test a whole bunch at
<br/>
a local store. Stevens Turner and Lewis drop by and we play
<br/>
a little. Vegas-style flops around while getting trashed by
<br/>
Yavin 4 all day long. Numbers eats it alive and the Casino
<br/>
is nowhere to be found. So I scrap this deck but I figure
<br/>
it'd be a hella fun to play for No Such Thing As Luck. I've
<br/>
got like six decks and nothing innovative that works so 
<br/>
I'm set on playing some of my old stuff that does allright.
<br/>
<br/>
On Thursday I catch an early flight up to St Louis, then 
<br/>
connect to Newark, NJ. Scotty Lingrell hooks me up with a
<br/>
and we wait around for Charlie Herren's flight to roll in 
<br/>
from Atlanta. It ends up being delayed for like an hour and 
<br/>
a half so we get a bite to eat, wait on Charlie, then drive
<br/>
back up to Ramapo to crash at Scott's place. Me and Charlie 
<br/>
are psyched for Sunday's team tourney - we had agreed with 
<br/>
Brentson and Dalton on a team for it. We end up playing our
<br/>
different decks at some place on campus with Scott's goofy
<br/>
Anktopot and Juz's Revenge that gets pushed around by 
<br/>
ROPs. At like 2 am we head over to Scott's and crash for 
<br/>
the night.

<br/>
Friday's tournament decks
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
Friday had the first two tournaments of RamapoCon - two
<br/>
four-game sanctioned constructed SW:CCG, one at 3 and one at 7. The
<br/>
first one was run by Rich Haman (Red 86) and had twelve 
<br/>
people, including three guys from Michigan that made the 
<br/>
long drive. Two guys from Ohio were supposed to come too,
<br/>
but they fracked up and drove down the week before. Oops. 
<br/>
The competition was pretty good - nobody expected a really
<br/>
large turnout for the first event. Notables included Mike
<br/>
Dalton and Charlie Herren, as well as Scott and myself. 
<br/>
<br/>
I decided to play Yavin 4 droids and ROPs. Y4 droids was a 
<br/>
tough call - I think in most places it would work so much
<br/>
better than a Yavin 4 mains deck, but here, where Juz's 
<br/>
Revenge originated, everyone would know how to play against
<br/>
it. Since most tournaments end up being all about matchups 
<br/>
anyways, I figured it'd be cool to play and see how it did 
<br/>
to help make my choice for the big tourney on Saturday.
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the decks on Friday - I'm posting them here and
<br/>
not in the deck section because these decks have been put
<br/>
there in every single ass variant possible.

Brief notes: Your standard ROPs. I don't pack Revolution
<br/>
protection because it's a waste of space IMHO. A good Revo
<br/>
deck will rip apart ROPs anyways unless you pack like a 
<br/>
Crush and 3 Evaders, and if you can fit that in here you're
<br/>
a champ. Ability^3 is a choice call but I like it - early
<br/>
game it forces your opponent to play out of his game, and
<br/>
late game it makes him put down guys for you to wreck. It's
<br/>
great against Profit and Dagobah, and anything that forces
<br/>
your opponent to use force and put down guys when he would 
<br/>
much rather be drawing for the big beatdown is solid.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Friday: first tournament
<br/>
***
<br/>
Game One: my DS vs Todd Theiner (1756)'s Hidden Base mains.
<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty trademark of ROPs - it starts slow
<br/>
then mows people down. He started Battle Plan.I got a decent
<br/>
draw, put down a 2/0, searched for a site, and drew. He did 
<br/>
the same during his turn. This went on for two turns, then
<br/>
I started saving force and flipped strong like fifth turn.
<br/>
Wherever he put down guys, I wrecked them. He eventually
<br/>
flipped his Objective but I got Security out and probed
<br/>
right within two turns. The deck worked like a machine.
<br/>
FW: 2 (+18)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: This deck is an auto-win against Hidden Base. Or 
<br/>
so I thought...
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: my LS vs Mike Dalton (2023)'s Court space
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't want this matchup at all - Dalton is a good friend
<br/>
of Scott's and must have played against Scott's version
<br/>
of Y4 droids a billion times. Luckily he was playing a fun 
<br/>
deck and not his machine Hunt Down or ROPs.
<br/>
<br/>
I got an OK draw and put out a Nudj, losing to Court and 
<br/>
drawing. He started Surface Defense with all three and put
<br/>
out an 0/1 Docking Bay, lost to Court, and drew. Next turn,
<br/>
he put out some aliens and Scum and fortified the chamber.
<br/>
I projectioned the audience chamber, lost to Court for like
<br/>
five turns, eventually getting out the Hologameboard, a guy 
<br/>
there, Battle Plan, and Boussh at the Sarlacc pit to stop
<br/>
the Court loss without having to worry about Hutt Smooch
<br/>
or any of that trash. He missed a Sniper with IG-88 and we
<br/>
were pretty much at a standstill.
<br/>
<br/>
The turning point was when I put down Artoo and 8D8 and
<br/>
inserted. My total was 11 and his was 3; Hologameboard
<br/>
covered my part of Resistance and there were only two 
<br/>
battlegrounds on the table. His deck was about fortifying
<br/>
on the ground and then running space with forfeit and 
<br/>
bounty hunter ships, but an early monnok revealed Captain
<br/>
Han, EPP Leia and the Falcon in my hand, so he was wary of
<br/>
playing any space battlegrounds. The insert changed his mind.
<br/>
He put out Zuckuss in Mist at Endor, moved Mara over to 
<br/>
the Sarlacc Pit, put a guy on Zuckuss, moved the Death Star
<br/>
(the only other system out) to parsec 1, and drew.
<br/>
<br/>
My turn, I put out the Falcon which promptly got barriered. 
<br/>
Nevertheless, in went Captain Han and Luke EPP (Leia was 
<br/>
hanging out on the ground undercover). Drew. Insert popped
<br/>
for 0 during his turn, and he put down Bossk in and Battled
<br/>
the almost super-falcon. I cleared the system with stacked
<br/>
destinies and legendary starfighter hit the table. This
<br/>
card won me the game. A late Tantive IV and Wedge, and 
<br/>
a stranded Boba Fett in Slave 1 at the Death Star vs 
<br/>
the Supra-Falcon and Tantive reinforced the victory.
<br/>
FW 2(+6): Cumulative 4(+24)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Legendary Starfighter - thanks Hays for this one.
<br/>
A close game... these are the most fun.
<br/>
Lows: none, really. It worked well and I played it pretty
<br/>
well too.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: my LS vs Scott Lingrell (1886)'s Anktopot.
<br/>
<br/>
This deck is so messed up on paper, but it works like a 
<br/>
machine! He only plays like 6 different cards with ability,
<br/>
and the rest is all about high destinies. He flipped second
<br/>
or third turn and got good activation - a Coruscant in his
<br/>
opening hand helped this alot (he only runs like five
<br/>
locations). I got off one insert, but losing to Visage hurt
<br/>
all game long and he tortured my second insert and cancelled
<br/>
Uncontrollable. I couldn't draw an EPP with a saber fast 
<br/>
enough to kill Vader and get around his junk like Put All
<br/>
Sections on Alert. Holonet Transmissions killed my TT's. 
<br/>
This game was a rout.
<br/>
FL 0(-16): Cumulative 4(+8)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Taking a few hits early and hanging in the game...
<br/>
a different draw might have made it closer.
<br/>
Lows: Stopping everything I had for him.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: ROPs vs Scott Lingrell (1886)'s LS droids.
<br/>
<br/>
I knew his deck so he didn't stand much of a chance. I
<br/>
started Resistance instead of IAO to force him to deploy a
<br/>
guy to cover his portion of occupying at least one
<br/>
battleground. I set up fast and put all my guys in walkers
<br/>
to avoid the EPP beatdown and have enough forfeit to cover
<br/>
any battle damage. He could never get anything going. 
<br/>
FW 2(+20): Cumulative 6(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none... I knew his deck and knew what I needed to do
<br/>
to absolutely shut it down.
<br/>
Lows: the same.
<br/>
<br/>
I was the only 3-1, getting second place, while Charlie 
<br/>
Herren went 4-0 and nabbed first and a Captain Han foil.
<br/>
<br/>
***
<br/>
Tournament two
<br/>
***
<br/>
<br/>
Many people started to roll in around 5 and 6, including
<br/>
Juz Pakes, Kevin Reitzel, and Dan Bojanowski from Yavin 4,
<br/>
and Team Albany from Coruscant. The second tournament
<br/>
started half an hour or so after the first one ended, with
<br/>
28 participants.
<br/>
<br/>
For decks I played the same ROPs deck as before and played
<br/>
Y4 mains instead of droids. 
<br/>
<br/>

Brief notes: This deck was pretty junky for a Y4 deck, but
<br/>
I didn't put a lot of time into it. I forgot to put back
<br/>
stuff I had taken out for the droid deck, like Draw Their 
<br/>
Fire and Order to Engage. Oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
Game One: My LS vs Manny Rodriguez (1550)'s Biker Scouts
<br/>
<br/>
He started Combat Readiness, taking out Endor: Forest
<br/>
Clearing and Dark Forest. I had gotten absolutely raped
<br/>
by a deck like this back in Nashville the week before, but
<br/>
I had been playing droids instead of mains. Whew. He put
<br/>
down a biker scout with a bike at both sites and drew for 
<br/>
his turn, and I proceeded to destroy them with guys. The
<br/>
game was all played on Endor, except for Melas who was
<br/>
pinging him for two at the Carbonite Chamber the entire time.
<br/>
Savrip was out for protection and basically his troupe of
<br/>
seven bikers and bikes, three of which had guns, drained me
<br/>
for one or two at one site while I plugged him for 2 with
<br/>
Melas, 2 at one of his sites with Han and Chewie and 2 at
<br/>
another Endor site with Obi and his saber. Boussh prevented
<br/>
him from cancelling my drains with Strategic Reserves. 
<br/>
The game was over pretty quickly. 
<br/>
FW 2(+24)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: SAC and mains wreck!
<br/>
Lows: none.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: DS vs Luis Rodriguez (1708)'s QMC deck.
<br/>
<br/>
ROPs got a great start in this game, flipping safely by
<br/>
third turn. He got a first turn flip with Wedge in Premiere
<br/>
Falcon and Lando with at the guest quarters, but Zuckuss and
<br/>
Evax reflipped. Once ROps got flipped, I beat him off 
<br/>
every single location he had a guy on and drained him out. 
<br/>
He never came to Ralltiir.
<br/>
FW 2(+29): Cumulaive 4(+53)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The deck worked like a machine. Deploy -1 Tarkin,
<br/>
Vader and IG-88 with a stacked destiny wrecking the hell
<br/>
out of one guy.
<br/>
Lows: none.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: my LS vs Dan Bojanowski (2055)'s ROPs.
<br/>
<br/>
This matchup is usually decided by who gets the good draw...
<br/>
I got it this game. A bunch of 2/0's in my opening hand put
<br/>
Obiwan on his planet with Bacta backup. A saber followed. 
<br/>
He put out a few guys but a smokescreen and power beat them 
<br/>
off his planet. Tantive and a guy hit Ralltiir but he 
<br/>
manhandled them with three bounty hunter ships. That was
<br/>
the only low - soon after Oola and Civil Disorder put down
<br/>
the lock.
<br/>
FW 2(+20ish): Cumulative 6(+70ish)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The lockdown. A great draw.
<br/>
Lows: It would've turned out opposite if he had gotten his 
<br/>
2/0's and me none..
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: ROPs vs Rich Haman (1767)'s Y4 mains.
<br/>
<br/>
Rich is a great guy and this game was solid and a lot of
<br/>
fun. He got a pretty good draw, but so did I - we both had
<br/>
2/0's out early. He avoided my desert like the plague but 
<br/>
put down some guys at my docking bay and drew a lot. I got
<br/>
enough stuff in my hand to flip but waited a few turns, 
<br/>
activating and drawing a little bit each time but no more
<br/>
than two cards each time. Took a few drains of one or two
<br/>
but then I flipped and held it down almost the whole game -
<br/>
he flipped me back once but I reflipped the next turn. 
<br/>
High destinies and not battling until I was ready won the
<br/>
game. Pulling anything you want out of your deck is huge!
<br/>
FW 2(+teens): Cumulative 8(+80something)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: a great game! Well fought and nobody got really
<br/>
screwed with draws.
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Me and Dalton both went undefeated, but I had the higher
<br/>
diff so got the Jabba Foil. Scott had everyone sign three
<br/>
Endor posters - the one with Luke and Leia flying a speeder
<br/>
bike through the forest alongside a biker scout - and those
<br/>
were given out as prizes, along with packs. Both tournaments
<br/>
were run well - Rich ran the first and Scott the second. 
<br/>
Brentson didn't play on Friday but between me, Dalton and
<br/>
Charlie, we claimed the top two spots both days. Our team
<br/>
was looking strong for Sunday! 
<br/>
<br/>
Props and Slops for Day 1:
<br/>
<br/>
Props
<br/>
~Scott for handling everything well and moving us to a room
<br/>
that had air-conditioning
<br/>
~The team for placing well in both tourneys
<br/>
~ROPs because it's a machine
<br/>
~Juz and Kevin and Dan for making the drive up to play 
<br/>
(sorry about the 0-4 finish Juz)
<br/>
~everyone for being great sports!
<br/>
<br/>
Slops
<br/>
~The heat - it must've been 95 degrees outside
<br/>
~Scott's Anktopot for wrecking the hell outta me
<br/>
~Team Albany not playing Friday night to not reveal their
<br/>
tech (Hunt Down and Y4... surprise)
<br/>
~Ramapo College for closing the cafeteria at 7 p.m. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading all this, it's long as hell but I'm 
<br/>
gonna be as thorough as possible to cover everything. 
<br/>
Hopefully I'll be able to put up the big tourney on Saturday
<br/>
later today... if not, then soon. Look for Part Two!
