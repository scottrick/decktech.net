<br/>
<br/>
The Las Vegas Grand Slam was something I was really looking forward to in quite a long
<br/>
time.  The Event was held at Vacation Village Hotel and Casino.  The room we had there
<br/>
was not that bad, and it had a good sound system to direct people to there tables and the
<br/>
event was ran pretty smoothly with not to many problems.  As we know YJ is a part of the
<br/>
Grand Slam, but we care little of that here, but I still like the game so I played in that. 
<br/>
And out of 28 people I came in first place for that, so that was cool.  I was a little high
<br/>
from that and was now really looking forward to the Starwars Event.  Chris Hines(Gold 8)
<br/>
ran the YJ Event alone pretty good, but he knew he was going to need help for the SW
<br/>
Event.  He had Brad Bedlion and Robert Corbett help him out and now is a good time to
<br/>
say good job guys.  Chris really appreciated it.
<br/>
<br/>
We had a total of 52 people show up.  I was really happy with this attendance and some of
<br/>
the names that came were great.  Some I havent seen since D-con so this was going to be
<br/>
interesting.  The Arizona crew, had Mike Girard, Mike Sinclair, Dj Andrews, Brian
<br/>
Garrison, and Jay Web, and I think others, but please forgive me for not remembering
<br/>
ALL.  Josh Martin came to just report on the event, but decided he did not want to play. 
<br/>
Kyle Craft and Matt Reicks came all the way down from Colorado.  Utah had about 3, but
<br/>
sorry dont know who.  And California had the biggest Crew beside all the locals that
<br/>
were there.  James Lafferty, Eric Bruen, Ryan Schueller, Ben Vanbuskiyi(sp?), Tom
<br/>
Mascara, John Borders, Greg Miller, and many, many others that I can not think of right
<br/>
now.  And of course we had all the good Local players show up for this event.  I will
<br/>
mention them, because I know they just like to be mentioned :)  Brandon Droid Pimp
<br/>
Gravo, Kris VegasPimp Lavigne, Ted Hansen, Dan Mystical Christy, John The Man
<br/>
Spadora, Shane Watner, Noah, Jeff, and the rest know who you are just let me know
<br/>
continue with the good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Well we planned on starting at 1:00 PM, but we all know how that goes.  There were
<br/>
some who didnt have there Decklist ready so it took a little while, but eventually we
<br/>
started around 1:40 I believe, maybe a little sooner, but I was ready.  This was one of the
<br/>
few tournaments that I did not have to face anyone from Vegas.  I loved that.  Everyone I
<br/>
played was from Out of Town and I really liked getting to know some of the ones I didnt
<br/>
already know.  I tested so many decks with Ted Hansen, and Chris Hines, for this
<br/>
Tourney.  We went back and forth with what was good, and what people may play or not. 
<br/>
I was trying some wacky Ideas with them.  Both agreed that no one will expect Dark
<br/>
numbers, but I didnt want to play that.  However Ted did play it with much success. 
<br/>
That deck went Undefeated.  I wanted to go with something strong and proven.  So I
<br/>
decided to play with Profit on the Light Side and Hunt Down/with Duel on the Dark Side. 
<br/>
I will post my new version of the Profit that I played and my Hunt Down sometime later
<br/>
this week.  But if you read all this mumble jumble then thanks and now off to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My DS vs Rudy Rojas Hidden Base (Rating 1551)
<br/>
<br/>
I love to play hidden base with this deck.  I start Presence on the Med Chamber and he
<br/>
starts, Wise Advice.  Now everytime I see this for some reason, I am thinking he is playing
<br/>
HB Numbers and wants to grab, my Torture of something.  I get Vader and No torture in
<br/>
my starting hand, so I am a little worried.  I activate draw a couple and save to deploy
<br/>
Vader next turn.  We both loose from Visage and the first card he loose is a ability 2
<br/>
scrub pilot so now my worry of inserts are over.  When he start deploying his systems I
<br/>
start deploying my ships.  I monnoked him to notice that he didnt have the super falcon in
<br/>
his hand so there was little to worry about.  So I went ahead and left a Dreadnuaght only
<br/>
at 2 different systems and Boba fett in ship and another.  Visage was taking some really
<br/>
good stuff off the top of his deck.  He deploys to battle on one Dreadnuaght, and I use
<br/>
Med Chambers Text to add a destiny. I subtract 2 from his battle destiny using Their Fire
<br/>
has gone.... game text to survive and he loses his ship.  He got brave towards the end
<br/>
game and put Obi in front of vader making me flip.  I think he had Duel protection in his
<br/>
hand So I didnt duel him.  Later I find out he didnt and just wanted to die to end the
<br/>
game, but either way I won this one. FW by 26.
<br/>
Score: 2 (+26)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: I was glad to see he wasnt playing numbers.  And have control all game.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Not dueling when that would have been cool, win or lose my diff would have
<br/>
been the same.  but I was playing it safe I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My LS vs Ryan Schuellers Hunt Down without Duel (Rating 1872)
<br/>
<br/>
This game started kind of bad for me.  I couldnt find Master Luke or Ben for awhile.  But
<br/>
it seemed like he was having some problems also.  We were both loosing to Visage for a
<br/>
while and he was Draining me for 3 with Presence at Tat: JP with Mara and Vader there. 
<br/>
Soon I put Boushh in front of that drain and was still trying to catch up.  When I freed
<br/>
Han and retrieved my force, I started finding things I needed to win this game.  I battled
<br/>
one of his walkers with Mechanical Failure on it, he had to take 12 battle Damage from
<br/>
that, but with 2 pilots helped out with IAO didnt really cause to much damage.  But I felt
<br/>
in control of this game.  He was hurting from OTE, because he didnt want to battle me,
<br/>
knowing I had stuff to hurt him.  All of a sudden he manages to get rid of OTE and puts
<br/>
Bubo in front of Ben, Chewie, Lando, Liea, MLuke, and Han.  That is 6 people  there
<br/>
chances were pretty slime to eat han.  I didnt have a Fallen Portal in Hand which sucked,
<br/>
and guess want happened.  I shuffled and he choose randomly and chose Han.  No of
<br/>
course he didnt have to battle me or stay there to stop the drain so he splits to two
<br/>
different locations.  I cant drain or cause any damage right now, but he has finally find a
<br/>
system and started drain for 2 at that.  I finally get Han back out there, but with little
<br/>
success, because he gets Trampled right away, and he has built up a force to finally battle,
<br/>
and I play Gift of a mentor to make him loose some, but not enough.  In the end Ben was
<br/>
alone and he beat he up just a little and I ran out of cards.  FL by 12
<br/>
Total Score: 2(+14)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Having Control at Mid game.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Losing Control when Han was pick out of 5 others to be eaten by Bubo, what
<br/>
is up with that.
<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine this brought me a little down.  I couldnt be to upset, because it
<br/>
wasnt like I made any mistakes, it just happened.  Oh well I move on.  I go to see how
<br/>
some of the others players are doing and find out the Kyle lost his first game to Eric, but
<br/>
he now has this look on his face that he will not lose to another.  James also Lost his first
<br/>
game to a Local, that James says was some bad luck.  I thought wow this is going to be
<br/>
interesting.  I was like Kyle at this point, just wanted to continue and focus on the next
<br/>
few games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My LS vs Mike Sinclairs Ralltiir Ops (Rating 1720)
<br/>
<br/>
Now I tested this deck against Ralltiir a lot.  In fact I thought I was going to see nothing
<br/>
but Ralltiir so I was ready for many of the different versions.  However Mike proved that
<br/>
this was going to be a tough game from the beginning.  During this game I had the worst
<br/>
draw of my life.  I had up to 22 cards in hand and had only 3 characters, but they were all
<br/>
Luke so this did me no good at all.  He did monnok me hoping he would get all of my
<br/>
Harvest, but when he looked at my hand he noticed I was playing with none, but he did
<br/>
manage to get 2 of my senses.  Which kept me from battling since I couldnt sense any
<br/>
reacts.  He also played with the Desert and I wasnt going to go there for the life of me,
<br/>
we all no what can happen if we do.  I did not notice if he had a Sandwhirl in his deck, but
<br/>
I wasnt going to take any chances.  I was taking force drains like crazy, and since my
<br/>
hand was so big, I lost everything from my hand and put only High destinys in my lost
<br/>
pile.  Finally I started to find my characters, I had Luke on Ralltiir early, even before he
<br/>
flipped hoping I can cause damage.  I did a little with a mechanical failure, and then when
<br/>
he tried to cancel it he failed, so next turn when he drained I surprised assaulted him for
<br/>
only 3 more cards I think.  I finally found Ben which then he rescued Han and then I
<br/>
retrieved all the High Destinys I put in the lost Pile.  I did get Leia Undercover on Ralltiir
<br/>
and another Undercover over there to slow down some drains.  Ben and Han are at the
<br/>
Tat: JP and are draining for 1 with Obi saber.  Fallen Portal helped get rid of Mara which
<br/>
was good and Clash Helped me a little to.  He loose an Altar toward the End game, and
<br/>
this is when I deploy OTE.  This is what helped me catch up to my loses.  He would battle
<br/>
Luke on Ralltiir and I would Narrow Escape to where he had People so he would have to
<br/>
lose 3 force.  Vader got Clash so he would have to lose some more force.  Lando was
<br/>
only in the Cantina Draining for one and making him lose, because my objective was
<br/>
flipped.  With me making him lose force like crazy, and him Draining in Space like crazy,
<br/>
and when he grabbed Narrow Escape it was getting close.  This game came down to the
<br/>
wire, it is right up there with some of the best games I have ever played.  This game was
<br/>
awesome I will never forget it.  Anyway I squeeze out the win...so FW by 1
<br/>
Total Score: 4(+15)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Playing such a close game, it made it so much fun, and I didnt see any mistake
<br/>
played by either of us...it was good.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Drawing 22 cards and still no people...that sucked.  And only winning by 1 was
<br/>
a lowlight, because it probably took me out of the final chances...lets move on
<br/>
<br/>
Well now I am getting a little nervous.  I am thinking to myself that, first my light loses
<br/>
then it only wins by 1, this is going to be a tough day for light side.  Or so I think.  But
<br/>
just to calm my nerves a little I walk over to the Bar and order me a Beer.  I down that
<br/>
real quick and am now ready for the next game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My DS vs Greg Millers Mwyhl Falcon Deck...(Rating 1769)
<br/>
<br/>
Now Greg seems like he is one cool guy.  There is one thing I do know, and that is he is
<br/>
the best young player I met in a long time.  He starts Battle Plan and I start Presence on
<br/>
the Med Chamber.  When I see his Starting location I think Super Falcon right away.  He
<br/>
was losing to Visage right from the beginning, since I had Vader in opening draw.  The
<br/>
card he lost from the top was Transmission Terminated which kind of sucked, but it was
<br/>
good for me.  He did manage to get out another one so he did kill it soon, of course I did
<br/>
have more Visage to put out.  Also he got the light side Holo Table out early and then I
<br/>
was like YEP the is SuperFalcon.  Right away I was looking for Come Here you Coward. 
<br/>
At one time he drains me for 2 at Kessel, since I converted his Kessel with mine and I lose
<br/>
for the top.  Guess what, it was Come here you Coward.  I told be there that was probably
<br/>
game for him, and he said he could get around that anyway.  I was like...ok.  All this time
<br/>
I already had Image of a Dark Lord in my hand but I was waiting to him to go there first. 
<br/>
He didnt until after our space battle.  I was saving a lot of force to battle the superfalcon. 
<br/>
I had Ig in ship, the buss, Dreadnaught, and Boba in slave 1.  So I monnoked to see what
<br/>
he had in hand.  During the Monnok I happened to get 3 On the Edges out of his hand.  I
<br/>
was like...Awesome....this is so HUGE....this made up for losing the Coward card. 
<br/>
Anyway I make a note what he has in hand, which is Punch it and Out of Nowhere.  The
<br/>
turn before this I set up my destiny so I knew what I was going to draw.  So I deploy
<br/>
everyone except Boba in ship....so that is 3 destiny for me.  And since Vader was at the
<br/>
Med Chamber I will be able to subtract 2 from every Destiny draw he makes.  And since
<br/>
he had Captain Han, with Out of Nowhere and Punch it gets 5 destinys, which I subtracted
<br/>
2 from each and I draw a 4, 7, 5...I believe that was game for me, but he still had some
<br/>
fighting force.  I was after all losing to fury deployed on Vader for a good portion of the
<br/>
game, and he did deploy Projection of a Skywalker on the LS Holo Table to get a Drain,
<br/>
but this was when I deployed Image of a Dark Lord to battle and I subtracted his destiny,
<br/>
so my guys stays and his goes.  With Visage taking his toll on him it was soon over.  FW
<br/>
by 19
<br/>
Total Score: 6(+34)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  I guess playing like I knew every card in his deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Taking down such I cool kid it would have been nice to see him in the top 10
<br/>
<br/>
Well you would think that I was starting to relax, well not quite.  I still needed some more
<br/>
beer to warm my blood.  I to warm my hands, which were a little cold for some reason. 
<br/>
So I go back to the bar and order a 24 oz beer which was like Ice Cold so my hands just
<br/>
got colder, but I enjoyed it.  I went to see how everyone else was doing.  Girard just lost
<br/>
to some local player who he said had a great draw.  And who was making drains cost a
<br/>
little to much.  Kyle was coming back by winning all of his games, and James was also
<br/>
coming back.  It was Ben and Eric Bruen who were the only undefeated players so far and
<br/>
they ended up playing each other twice in the end...here is what comes next for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My DS vs Tom Mascaris Mwyhl x-wings Swarm Deck...(Rating 1904)
<br/>
<br/>
Well the first thing Tom says is oh great you are here to beat me again.  He says that
<br/>
because he always gives me a hard time about beating him in the Wild Card at DCon,
<br/>
because if he beat me then he would have been in Worlds.  I like this guy.  He is so cool,
<br/>
and he makes me laugh.  Anyway he start with Yarna and I start usual against this deck.  I
<br/>
think...you are not playing Astroid Santuary are you.  Of course he wasnt which I learned
<br/>
quickly when he started deploying.  Now at this time, Tom was so tired, it looked liked he
<br/>
was going to fall asleep during the game.  I didnt feel like he was playing his best.  He
<br/>
said there were up way to late...I guess so.  Anyway One battle in space where he had to
<br/>
lose 17 cards, because I lateral damaged, was huge for me.  I later Monnoked to see
<br/>
where I can go safely.  I was draining in space at some of mine and at some of his
<br/>
locations.  The deck he was playing was also the same deck that was playing at the Top
<br/>
table which I thought was interesting.  But with my ability to subtract his destiny I was in
<br/>
so much control.  He did however cancel Visage early and I was unable to find another. 
<br/>
But he could not catch up to the force loss.  FW by 33
<br/>
Total Score 8(+67)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Winning by so much when I needed it most.  I needed to get back to sheet
<br/>
chances.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Having Tom so Tired and him making a mistake to not save force to play
<br/>
alternatives to fighting.
<br/>
<br/>
I am pumped, I do think I need any more beer until afterwards.  Which we might do
<br/>
something later with the group that traveled.  James wants to gamble a little in between
<br/>
this round since we both finished so early.  Things are starting to get interesting, because
<br/>
the two undefeated people just timed out with Ben being on top.  Ben only need one more
<br/>
drain of 2 to win the game so it was crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 My LS vs Dan Lujans CCT/with SAC...(Rating..1939)
<br/>
<br/>
Well Dan and I see each other at big tournaments like this, but for some reason we never
<br/>
ended up playing until now.  First thing when I see his objective, I am like...where this is
<br/>
interesting.  I give him Orr, for a captive and start with Wise Advice like I do every game
<br/>
with this deck.  Since Clayton just won the California State Champs with CCT Skrillings
<br/>
Numbers I was thinking he brought the same thing.  So I held onto Dont forget the
<br/>
Droids until I knew for sure.  As it turned out he wasnt.  In fact the deck was very well
<br/>
put together, and it had some profit hate in there.  I was losing force like crazy to drains,
<br/>
and was once again looking for cards I needed to catch up.  At one point I thought I was
<br/>
going to beat up on Dengar, because he was with Vader.  So I deployed Master Luke and
<br/>
gave him his Saber.  Then played Clash on Vader, he Sensed and I grabbed the Sense and
<br/>
played Altar.  Then he just YAB on Luke so I never did get the beat down.  He then on
<br/>
his turn Elis Dengar to the Cantina to drain for 2 and then elised him back to safety.  I
<br/>
though wow maybe I can catch him in an important time and use quite a mercenary. 
<br/>
Anyway he was in so much control of this game.  I still have not freed Han, and he had
<br/>
like about 6 people in the audience chamber protecting him.  Boushh never came out this
<br/>
game I was really wondering what happened to her.  Anyway I move Ben, Master Luke,
<br/>
Chewie, Lando over to the Chamber, because frankly this is my only choice.  He deploys
<br/>
Djas, and some other person, he already had Dr. E, Mara Jade, Vader, and Jabba there,
<br/>
and 4Lom.  He battles and I play Weapon Lev on Mara, but somehow he has enough to
<br/>
stack some sense and get rid of that card.  But he couldnt get rid of Gift of a Mentor. 
<br/>
This saved me somehow.  We went back and forth battling there, but in the end I had the
<br/>
chamber.  I could not believe it.  I then freed Han and retrieved 10 force and starting
<br/>
finally making him lose cards other than just battling.  He had to lose 5 the first turn...I
<br/>
spread, then 8 the next and then it was to much for him.  He elis some over and YES I got
<br/>
to use QAM to put them to the lost pile and that was it.  I dont know how I did it, but I
<br/>
reach up real high and pull out a win :)  FW by 12
<br/>
Total Score 10(+79)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Yes I won...I know I will be getting a sheet for sure.  And coming back when I
<br/>
thought it was over.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Well I didnt win Huge to be in the final, but it was fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well what a tournament this was.  I came in 4th place overall which I thought was great
<br/>
considering the day I had.  This was so much fun and now I am looking forward to the
<br/>
regional.  It was interesting that the top 2 players timed out Again.  But this time Eric won
<br/>
the timed victory.  So it looks like they kind of screwed each other.  So we had no one
<br/>
person who was Undefeated and it was James Laffety, who came in first overall.  Jim
<br/>
didnt want to play in the final, because he just wanted to gamble and see more of Vegas. 
<br/>
So he let the Second place person which was Ryan Schueller pick which sheet he wanted
<br/>
then went to party.  Anyway here are the Top 10, because for right now that is all I have.
<br/>
<br/>
1. James Lafferty (San Diego)
<br/>
2.Ryan Schueller (LA)
<br/>
3. Kyle Craft (Colorado)
<br/>
4. Tim Guzman (Me, Las Vegas)
<br/>
5. Eric Bruen (LA)
<br/>
6. Ben Vanbuski (SD)
<br/>
7. Christopher Hood (Las Vegas)
<br/>
8. Brandon Gravo (Las Vegas)
<br/>
9. Patrick Garcia (Cali)
<br/>
10. Ted Hansen (Las Vegas)
