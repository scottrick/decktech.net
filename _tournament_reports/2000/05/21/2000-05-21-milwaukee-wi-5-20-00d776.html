<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">yeah, so after a hiatus from the listserve and starwars that lasted about 3 
<br/>
weeks (the length of time it takes to get a job, start working full time and 
<br/>
get a paycheck) im back.. 
<br/>
<br/>
so i talked to erick (a local tournament director and player) about whether 
<br/>
or not there was a tournament on saturday the night before, and he tells me 
<br/>
that evan fitzgerald and corey faherty are coming (i guess evan must have hit 
<br/>
a snag), and that since theyre on our team, i should come to offer up some 
<br/>
rating points or something.. 
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, during the 3 weeks  that i didnt play starwars at all, somehow my 
<br/>
decks got entirely mixed together beyond recognition, and after finding that 
<br/>
out 2 hours before the tournament started, i made a dark deck in an hour and 
<br/>
a half, and went to the tourney light deck-less..  so i got there, and i had 
<br/>
a box of cards (one of those 250 card boxes) and i was going through it and 
<br/>
trying to decide whether i should just whip together some mains deck, or try 
<br/>
and make something weird, and weird won out somehow, so i decided to try and 
<br/>
make, from scratch, with no decklist, a spinoff from a deck that mike josem 
<br/>
was talking to me about over AOLIM the night before... profit numbers.. heres 
<br/>
a decklist, and im positive that Joz's version has got to be better than this 
<br/>
one (i made it in 15 minutes) so not to knock the concept overall (i actually 
<br/>
like it, and it integrates its strategies very well, which is cool)  but the 
<br/>
deck i made was ass.. here it is for your perusal:
<br/>
<br/>

Profit

<br/>
<br/>
in any case, i tust that my point is clear about why my choice shouldve been 
<br/>
mains :))
<br/>
<br/>
my dark deck was a high destiny HD, with duelling, but it rarely actually 
<br/>
duels.. 
<br/>
<br/>
first game- Dark Side HD High Destiny vs. (i forgot the name.. sorry) Toschi 
<br/>
Mains:
<br/>
<br/>
I start PoTF on his Obis hut, and lay darth helmet there with his stick... it 
<br/>
just so happens that i drew a focussed attack and a circle in my opening 
<br/>
hand.. go figure.. 
<br/>
anyhow, he lays obiwan for 2 force, and starts to lay something (he tells me 
<br/>
later its his saber) but since i get the next action, i duel (figuring hes 
<br/>
got 6 cards, i get 3 destiny, and the likelihood of him having better destiny 
<br/>
than me isnt good, and him having both duelling counters is terrible, plus i 
<br/>
have a stick and he doesnt..), play focussed attack, draw 6,5,4, he draws a 
<br/>
5,4 my total is 24, his is 14, he places obi out of play and loses 9, draws 3 
<br/>
cards, and lets me go.. on my turn i drain for 5 with vader, and draw a 
<br/>
few... he just draws some more.. i get out mara with stick and a vehicle with 
<br/>
vader (mara goes to the jundland waste), he eventually tries to battle mara, 
<br/>
but hes getting hit for between 7 and 9 per turn, plus the loss of 14 right 
<br/>
away from drain/duel and this game lasts about 5 minutes.. 
<br/>
<br/>
full win by 41
<br/>
2 (+41)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:LS profit bothan spy deck vs. Corey Fahertys HD deck with hardly any 
<br/>
dudes
<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i didnt want to play the deck i had against corey (since i had an 
<br/>
inkling of its true nature) and i was sitting there wondering how i was gonna 
<br/>
win.. so i saw him start op enforcement, and since that card is always in 
<br/>
duelling decks to counter SAC (grab the sac, track the dueling card, and they 
<br/>
cant stop it) i pointed out that he wasnt going to fool me ( ;p) and started 
<br/>
the bargaining table (figuring hed have a small number of locations to drain 
<br/>
at, and that it would save me quite a lot of force).. 
<br/>
<br/>
in any case, the game started out badly for both of us, i couldnt find 
<br/>
numbers, he couldnt find vader, until we both finally got rolling.. he got 
<br/>
around battle order by playing ships in several locations, and vader on the 
<br/>
ground, and i had undercover spies cancelling drains, and ICBW + BT stopping 
<br/>
him in space plus im hitting for 2 each turn at the holotable, so it looked 
<br/>
like a standstill.. until he drained with vader, i played lost in the 
<br/>
wilderness (all my 2/0s were outdoor) and he SENSEd!! id managed to draw 
<br/>
THREE senses the turn before by playing interrupts hoping hed play them not 
<br/>
anticipating the LITW against vader, and but i guess he had 4 in hand.. oh 
<br/>
well.. so he senses, draws a VISAGE, and it doesnt cancel my LITW.. so what 
<br/>
do i draw?? a friggen ZERO!! there were exactly 4 cards in my deck that 
<br/>
couldve caused LITW not to work, and i drew one of them.. ha well.. anyhow, 
<br/>
the game starts to go a little south for me, so i finally drop some bothans 
<br/>
and free han, to give me 2 more force drain.. after that it gets a little 
<br/>
strange, while he spreads out as far as he can in space to drain for a lot, 
<br/>
and i end up taking out two with a RL, and circumventing my own battle order 
<br/>
to seal the victory.. i understand that he made a mistake near the end that 
<br/>
wouldve made it closer, but otherwise this was a well played game on both of 
<br/>
our parts, and i learn that the surprise value of the deck isnt to be 
<br/>
underestimated (a note: the 0 side of profit works well because an undercover 
<br/>
spy at JP stops all drains at tatooine which makes them much less likely to 
<br/>
defend the AC at all to stop you from taking it over.. the suicide EPPs can 
<br/>
wipe it clean in the endgame easily to free han because wasting 6 characters 
<br/>
where they cant drain just isnt good at all).. 
<br/>
<br/>
full win by 23
<br/>
4 (+64)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS vs Erick Butzlaff's Juz's Revenge
<br/>
<br/>
I start PoTF on the throne room to invade Y4 (since its the only way to go in 
<br/>
this matchup) and get out some locations early.. first turn he draws 2 nudj, 
<br/>
so i play mara get her saber, and whack one.. next turn i play vader to the 
<br/>
PoTF site to drain.. 
<br/>
I have 3 tortures in my deck, and since he neglected to put enough grapplers 
<br/>
in his he only gets one numbers through.. so i drain for a ton, he suicide 
<br/>
EPPs a couple times to no real effect, the pressure is kept on (despite a 
<br/>
psuedo hilarious couple seconds where IG88 and a walker were running away 
<br/>
from orrimarko) and without numbers hes not really gonna win this one.. he 
<br/>
tries to beat up vader with a lone luke, but I Have You Now, plus hitting 
<br/>
luke does 11 battle damage.. ouch..
<br/>
<br/>
full win by 25
<br/>
6 (+89)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS 'pile' vs Erick's 'i just took bubo out' ROps
<br/>
<br/>
This game starts out terribly, i cant get anything going, and he gets out 
<br/>
some decent drains , and even alters my bargaining table (it goes to used).. 
<br/>
anyway, it sucked pretty bad, but i got some stuff moving finally, got a 
<br/>
couple inserts to work and started blocking drains.. midgame freed han to do 
<br/>
some damage and to satisfy search and destroy to even up, and late-game it 
<br/>
was pretty even, with both of us draining at roughly equal rates.. finally, 
<br/>
he gets out kashyyk, drains for some extra force per turn, and the balance 
<br/>
starts shifting in his favor.. eventually, i sacrifice an EPP that id been 
<br/>
saving to defend han if necessary to kill mara + a scrub walker (to stop me 
<br/>
from LITW, i let erick page through my deck before the game and hes using 
<br/>
that to his fullest advantage) and i finally redeploy my WNMOG.. 
<br/>
so it comes down to the wire, ive got 6 cards left in reserve, 3 in hand 
<br/>
(numbers, momaw, and the useless bargaining table, ive used all of my bothans 
<br/>
already), luke, a bothan, and han at the AC, a droid and a UC spy facing 
<br/>
ozzel and DS2 in a walker at JP, and a projection at the holotable, hes got 3 
<br/>
cards in reserve, no hand Igar and T1 draining for 1 on raltiir, and zuckuss 
<br/>
in space draining for 2,  and a scrub walker (atst) with marquand and watts 
<br/>
at the Farm draining for 2.. so i sit and think cause, his turn, hes gona 
<br/>
drain me for 5, im then only gonna be able to hit him for 1 cause i wont be 
<br/>
able to drain, then hes gonna hit me for 4 and kill me.. so i need a better 
<br/>
way..  so i sit there for maybe 5 minutes, which makes erick a little mad, 
<br/>
cause he almost thinks im stalling (i offered to forfeit in that case, i dont 
<br/>
want a timed win on stalling) and inspiration hits.. i pull the projection 
<br/>
from the holotable (he wont be able to drain next turn anyway under the 
<br/>
current hypothesis) and lay it on Igar's site.. i lay momaw vs the scrub 
<br/>
walker (he has 2 active and it costs 2 to battle, so they dont get the extra 
<br/>
destiny, and if he does that, i lose 2 force, and he loses 2 to han/luke, and 
<br/>
isnt able to drain me out anymore) break the UC spy at JP's cover, move it 
<br/>
over with momaw so i get a destiny,  and let it be erick's turn.. now hes 
<br/>
forced to initiate battle against luke to not get hit for 2 by profit, and if 
<br/>
he wants to KILL luke, he cant even drain (WNMOG makes him use 2 to initiate 
<br/>
and he only has 3 life-force).. so he initates, and picks a 1 (tarkin) and 
<br/>
with the Rops bonus (2) he only nails the droid at the location.. the next 
<br/>
turn he gets hit by 2 from profit, drains me for 2, and i win by 5 :)))...  
<br/>
probably the best most obscure play ive been a part of or responsible for in 
<br/>
a while.. itkinda reminded me why i play swccg in the first place..  to pull 
<br/>
what looked like a losing situation out at the end.. 
<br/>
i guess mike josem actually ended up winning his australian states with his 
<br/>
version of profit odds (disclaimer:which is totally not even similar to mine 
<br/>
at all) , so the concept is actually pretty cool..  anyway it was fun to play 
<br/>
a totally rogue deck instead of a modified concept.. 
<br/>
<br/>
  full win by 5
<br/>
8 (+94)
<br/>
<br/>
so thats all from that tournament, i won a captain han in the CC prize 
<br/>
support (awesome, FINALLY something i didnt have to give away ;).. )..  </font></td>
