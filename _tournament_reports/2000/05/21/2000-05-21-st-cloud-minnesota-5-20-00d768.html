<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, i get back to Minnesota this wednesday after finishing school for the year and find out the first tournament is Saturday.  So i guessed that everyone around here has started playing Scum decks that start tatooine and JP after they found out how good it is, so my LS is some special scum hate, throne room start with 2 Monks, a narshadda and a LS version of JP, thats 4 cards i can draw first turn to screw scum over.  My DS was Scum with some anti-anti scum cards like an extra bubo and a He Hans't Come Back Yet (geez this reminds me of Jp manip, anti Jp Manip, anti-anti Jp Manip of 2 years ago), and mostly guys with guns and Dr. E. the destinies are high enough so that I almost always hit who I target.
<br/>
<br/>
On the way up I put on some random tapes in the car that I haven't listened to in a year and come across Prodigy's smack my @#$% up, so I'm psyched to do just that at the tournament
<br/>
<br/>
As this tournament got started, i was very excited because I had just spent a year in Pittsburgh of constantly playing people rated in the 1600s.  Now at this tournament, besides my self, there is one player other player in the 1900s, and 2 in the high 1800s, so it should be a lot of fun!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs Josh Kohman(1891)
<br/>
<br/>
Josh starts Raltiir Ops with IAO.  I get a couple twix site in my opening hand and drop those.  We draw for a couple turns before he flips with assorted characters and three sites.  I drop Obi and Han from hand and beat him up at one of the sites, I chase him to another site but he gets vader from reserve and manages to kill Han.  At this point I make a big mistake, I had Tantive and Jeoren Webb in hand, and he only occupied 2 sites on raltiir, so I could have dropped Webb at the empty site, tantive at Raltiir, flip his objective back and shuttle up to raltiir.  but I had a few mains in my hand too and I thought I could wipe him clear from another one of the sites on Raltiir, so over the next three turns I would constantly drop mains on raltiir and try to beat him up but he always just had enough characters reacting(like tempest 6 from hand) to cushion the damage and occupy the sites.  I get out Order to Engage but that just gets altered.  Eventually he gets out another vader to clear me off of raltiir and starts dropping Blizzard Walkers to support his guys, it was at this point I deployed Tantive and Jeoren and flipped his objective back, but it was too late as he had drawn some ships and deployed devastator, vader's shuttle + pilot to raltiir.  I eventually beat him off of the system but it was too late because he had a solid hold on each of the raltiir sites, so there was no way for me to flip his objective back.  At this point i deploy Bomarr monk and Ben with his saber to audience chamber, melas to Hoth 3rd marker and turn it into a drain race, but we had the same amount of drains and he had more force than me so I Lose by 7.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs Mike Raveling (1883)
<br/>
<br/>
Mike starts with throne room and I start with the usual Tatooine/JP.  He drops elom first turn on Yavin and inserts so now I know perfectly what this deck does.  I twilek for a No Bargin 'cause I know he has EPP Luke's in his deck and I want to make it hard for EPP luke to come down to Jabba's palace 'cause with the destiny in his deck he can chop anyone he wants.  So i get out Ig 2000 with a ORS piloting at Tatooine, Jabba at Audience Chamber and Brangus at JP, along with resistance.  but he starts getting EPP luke to make suicide runs and keeps me from occupying 3 battlegrounds.  All the while during this his first insert still doesn't pop because I'm constantly shuffling during my turns.  I get out Bubo at Yavin and he goes to work munching on Eloms and Nudjs.  By the time the first insert pops he had 2 eloms and I had Brangus and 2 ors on the table so I only lose 1 from the insert even though I didn't satisfy resistance.  Eventually he runs out of EPP lukes and he could only nabrun around his Eloms and try to battle me but I simply didn't deploy Mara so there was no imperials for him to beat up on and my drains + tat. occupation does him in. Win by 19
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Mike Raveling (1883)
<br/>
<br/>
I play Mike again and this time I start with throne room and he starts with tatooine and JP, so we have a good laugh over that one.  I get out a twix site first turn, pull a nudj, and drop a monk at his Jabba's Palace.  Next turn I get out Obi's Hut and puts down Ben and his saber and move them over to Jabba's Palace to guard my monk.  The game is basically over at this point because he can't get his sites because of my monk, and he can't get enough force to fight me at Jabba's Palace because he has no sites, and I'm just sitting on a drain of 3 a turn, and after a few turns I get out Tantive, Lando in Falcon and Wedge at his Tatooine and starts draining there too.  He eventually gets out his Audience chamber and a few other JP sites but it was too late as I just moved over to his audience chamber and dropped my Jabba's Palace and made him lose a few more force.  win by 25.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Herb Macy(1709)
<br/>
<br/>
Herb managed to get his rating up to the mid 1800s at one point earlier this year but he hasn't changed his decks in over a year and it's now costing his rating to drop like a fly. He starts DBO and Goo Nee Tay against my scum and i figure there is no way in the world I can lose this matchup.  I get out Audience Chamber and Jabba first turn and he starts pulling his sites with DBO.  We draw for a few turns nd I get out Bad Feeling and No Bargin, he makes the first move by dropping Obi Wan and Premier Luke at the Audience chamber to try to battle Jabba, he had Light sabers for both characters but I bounce Obi back to his hand with None shall pass and barrier luke, so on my turn down comes Mara w/ saber and 4-lom.  I battle and he has to lose luke + quite a few force.  I just lose Mara.  I get a ship at tatooine and a ship at Dantooine.  he drops obi and his saber a couple turns later and takes out Jabba, but I battle Obi to retrive some stuff and a turn later drop Special Ed. Jabba and galid.  He can't really do much more on tatooine so he runs back to Dantooine but thats even better for me because it allows me to pick and choose my own battles, so I constantly drop Mara and Iggy and battle his guys, retrive and repeat.  so eventually he runs out of characters and force. Win by 20 something.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs Andy Newton (1713)
<br/>
<br/>
Andy starts the DS CC objective pulling some random site and secret plans.  I get nothing good in my hand so i just draw, but his first turn he pulls Bespin, deploys Jabba's Palace and uses that text to pull the Audience chamber, so he's activating some nice force.
<br/>
I get out Obi and saber at Jabba's Palace and a monk there.  He gets out EPP Vader, EPP Fett and Dr. E. at the Audience chamber and moves them over to Jabba's Palace, where I was at.  I was weary of what he could do even though I had Luke Han Leia in my hand, so I just nabrun my guys over to audience chamber and drain there.  He drops BIHT at Bespin with forfeit fodder and battle plans.  so i get out Lando in Falcon with pilot at bespin and battle a few times, but i wasn't able to clear him out, and eventually lando in falcon, without a pilot, had to run to his Kashyyyk.  now he can't activate all the force he is able to, so I drop Monk and EPP Han and Leia at Obi's Hut to up my drains.  He knows I have senses in hand so he doesn't try to nabrun his squad to beat me down, but instead moves over to his just deployed Jundland Wastes to drain.  meanwhile he deploys zuckuss in mist hunters, lateral damages my Lando in Falcon, and battles, luckily I had spiral in hand to react and soak up all the damage.  next turn I drop wedge in Falcon, Tantive at Bespin, move falcon over to cancel lat. damage at the same time.  His turn he moves Vader/Fett/Dr. E over to Obi's Hut, but I just nabrun my guys to Jabba's Palace and keeps on draining.  at this point I also deploy my Jabba's Palace to make him lose a force.  He tries to drain next turn but i remind him that Obi's Hut isn't a battleground so he only had enough force for one drain, and I drain him out next turn.  win by 5.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs Andy Newton (1713)
<br/>
<br/>
Andy now starts Throne room.  He gets out some random guy at Jabba's Palace first turn, but I had Audience chamber and another JP site in hand so I didn't matter that much.  next turn I drop EPP vader and clear out Jabba's Palace and get out Jabba at Audience chamber with scum.  He twileks for Aim High and gets that out, along with EPP Luke at Jabba's Palace, so I drop Mara and Dr. E and hits Luke + Operate.  He drops EPP Han Luke and Leia and battle me but I just projected telepathy it.  my turn I get out 4 Lom and dengar with gun and battle him, he misses twice with shots at Dr. E. while I hit Luke + operate, hit Leia + operate, and hit han but no operate.  so he loses everyone plus a bunch of force.  he doesn't have much fight left, especially after I make luke missing with He hasn't come back yet and capture Obi with Iggy.  I just deploy galid, occupation and drain him out.  win by 23.
<br/>
<br/>
I manage to take home first place due to the wierd chance that no one else was 5-1, so I get assorted packs and play Graham Neal (1947) in a couple sealed deck games with out packs, he gets about 6 characters total in his lightside and I get some good stuff like PotF, Igar, and Prophtess, so i totally destroy him in 2 games and drive home.
