<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hello, everyone.
<br/>
This is my first Star Wars tournament report and my first submission to DeckTech.
<br/>
I'm Mike Wudhapitak, 16-year-old high school student. I play over 40 cards, miniatures, etc. games, Star Wars being one of them. I only play Star Wars once in a full moon though(they only have tourneys here once a month).
<br/>
Here's the tournament report for May.
<br/>
I was playing Hunt Down and Destroy and Kashyyk(sp?) Operatives I borrowed from a friend because my decks were incomplete and at home.
<br/>
<br/>
Round 1
<br/>
John Glascow, playing some random deck
<br/>
I didn't pay attention much to his deck-- I was experiencing the proverbial 'God Draw.' There's not much your opponent can do when you're generating 12 force before he gets his third turn. I think I get a turn 3 objective flip and start the draining. I establish a drain on Endor, Hoth, and in space. He Transmission Terminated my Visage first turn. I drain him out quickly, as he can't compete in space and I have Vader/Tarkin hanging around, ready to Elis at will. I win by 22.
<br/>
<br/>
Round 2
<br/>
Michael Crosby, playing ISB
<br/>
The game goes slowly for a while, with few deployments. Then I drop an operative and a little bit of backup. His turn, he drops DLOTS, backup, and then proceeds to rape my rather puny gang. The game goes downhill from there as he flips his objective and I don't flip mine. Loss by 26. =(
<br/>
<br/>
Round 3
<br/>
Brandon Young, playing some random Operatives pile I believe
<br/>
He was a threat until I remembered who I was playing. He had a good deck, but having even the best deck in the world doesn't matter if you're a suboptimal player. He's been getting better in the past year, but he's still no match for me. Vader with his Beat Stick comes down upon Master Luke. Hunt Down and DESTROY!!! Or in this case, get a tie on the duel(who in the world does that?!), even after using a Focused Attack. Destinies of 5, 1, and 0 SUCK. Thank the Maker that I didn't lose! I proceed to battle Luke and have Jerriko eat his soup. Power 6 Jerriko is some good. I drain/Visage away the rest of his deck. Win by 26.
<br/>
<br/>
Round 4
<br/>
Richard Williams, playing Raltiir Operations
<br/>
I try to take the fight to his planet and get beaten badly. In the meantime, I search some land and drop some ops. His objective is cool, but in this match-up mine is cooler. I slowly drain him for a few every turn, and he can't drain me. His Battle Order hurts both of us, but it pains him more. Vader gets beaten up after a hit-and-run on an operative, but Evader saves him. We remove each other from our planets and start a force drain race. I outrace him. =)
<br/>
Win by 22.
<br/>
<br/>
So, I do well enough to get second. Michael Crosby gets first. In my packs of Cloud City, I pull a Dark Side Lando. Yay... Not too bad for someone who hasn't played  in over 2 months. I missed the last couple of tournaments, but I guess I still have it in me if I can mize a win off of the local players. See you all next time.
