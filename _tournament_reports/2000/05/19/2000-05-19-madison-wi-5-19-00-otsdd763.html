<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So we have been talking about running a Thursday night OTSD for some time and we finally got a day where enough people could show up.  I was supposed to be playing slow pitch but a hurricane (including golf ball size hail - if you have never seen it, it is quite a site) swept through Wisconsin and the game was obviously cancelled.  We end up getting 11 people, which is a good turnout for a 6 pm OTSD on a weeknight.

<br/>
Game 1: Ron (SL Courlaq) vs. me
<br/>
<br/>
Not too much to say here&amp;#8230;but I will give complete details.  I convert his Courlaq first turn.  I am activating 5 to his 2.  By the end of my third turn, I have Dreadnaught, Black Tie, and Tie Fighter draining for 1.  He finally pulls Tatooine and I move over to drain for two.  I have done nothing for three turns and have a ton of force saved up just waiting for him to make a move.  If you ever question what is the difference between a good and bad sealed deck, its force generation.  I drain for two and he it could be worses it, but I its worse for 18 and he is losing 20.  He does to and get a ship down at courlaq but I chase and drain him around until the end of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
We go over his deck and I tell him that he should really be starting the Throne room since that has a ton of benefits, I do not know if it helped him the rest of the night
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 +26
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: John (SL Tatooine) vs. me
<br/>
I saw in the previous game he got Luke, wedge, corvette&amp;#8230;but I didnt realize he had 9 pilots (WTF?).  I get another great opening hand and drop a tie fighter to Tat first turn with a Obsidian tie second turn.  I get in a couple nice drains for two, but I do not hit any of the big cards.  He finally comes and smacks me around since I cannot find the dread and I cannot get any forfeit fodder to the system.  I lost Courlaq from my hand and realize now how huge a mistake that is.  I hold the lateral damage for a time when another system is out and I have the dread, but the situation does not arrive.  I get down cantina and tuskcan canyon and have mosep draining in the cantina.  He has the jawa camp down and control of the system with three starships.  I am winning the drain race, from the early drain and both of us being even at two now and he drops to my tuskan canyon to make his drains three.  This is where the ass forfeit of DS aliens kills me.  I just cannot get him to lose any force and I am losing characters as he battles me on his way to the cantina.  I comes down to me not being able to make him lose any force as he wittles me down to nothing in the cantina.  Talz, beru, wedge, luke, are just too much forfeit to handle.
<br/>
<br/>
FL 0 -3   -  Overall 2 (+23)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Robb (Courlaq SL) vs. me
<br/>
Re-read game one.  First turn convert his system.  Drop dreadnaught, ties, and amass huge amounts of force, drain for 1 and do not deploy any of the 4 locations in my hand (no 0 destinies left).  He finally gets down the DS Docking Bay and tries to do something, but I have too much force and too many characters.  I beat him off the DS even with a two destiny battle for him at the war room.  He just is choked hard.  He finally puts down an xwing and a red xwing.  I Drop Yavin, lattle damage the red xwing and initiate.  That ends the game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +16 - Overall 4 (+39)
<br/>
<br/>
So we play a championship game and John (Game 2) is the only undefeated LS player, and I am the top DS player.
<br/>
<br/>
Championship game: John vs. me
<br/>
<br/>
Game starts the same with Tatooine and DS War room.  I get a scanning crew drawing on the first turn and his opening hand was 6 characters - 3 pilots, corvette, red card.  I drop Courlaq. And wait for him to make the first move.  He goes to Tatooine system and I drop several ships, with dread, to Courlaq.  I get him to chase me around and he finally has tiree, a trained talz, beru, z-95, and garouf laflour in the vette.  I go to the tuskan canyon and start hitting him for two to his one in space.  I get mass aliens to the site and drop mos eisly too.  He cannot take the drains anymore and shuttles characters down and deploys more.  I am stationed at the canyon and mos eisly and he is at mos eisly. We battle soon at the canyon with mass force and I hit him for a loss of 8.  So he goes to forfeit and point out the Garouf adds one to forfeit of others on tat site.  I look at the card and notice his game text is cancelled with a tax collector, and right there is feltipern trevagg.  Not that is tech :P.  He has to lose a significant amount and runs the rest to mos eisly.  I chase to Mos eisly and initiate against power 6 (rebel guard) with no destiny and I have power 4 with a destiny. I of course draw a location and lose two force.  I move away trying to bait him into draining me there and it works.  I hit him for a loss of 7 with a counter assualt, I see his 2 (WTF!) corvette go to the drain.   Eventually he loses luke to a force loss and he is weak enough in space that I stay.  He leaves himself with three destiny once and I thought I had him, until he plays out of nowhere, but I think he only drew a two.  I all he has left in space is the vette with tiree.  Next turn, I drop latteral damage and end the game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +8
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the TD who had great prize support, the OTSD has ass rares except the luke and two Wedges.  I won a Qui-gon figure, which is a pretty cool prize.
