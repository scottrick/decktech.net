<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I went to the Grand Slam fresh off of a 2nd place finish at states. However I knew there would be people from out of town and I seem to have a mental block about tournaments with tourists and being able to win... so here we go... (I don't remeber any names of people I played 'cept for 1 guy)
<br/>
<br/>
For dark I was playing a variation of Info Broker's No Order In The Court v1.1, and for light a Tosche Station Mains.  
<br/>
<br/>
To break it down early, when I stick to my starting interrupt I win. When I try to adapt, I lose.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1  DS vs. Guy's HB X-wings
<br/>
<br/>
I see HB and sigh inwardly, as I hate playing HB. So I start with Surface Defence for all 3. He starts S-Foils. Early on I set up Mara at the AC w/saber and get a steady drain of 2. He deploys systems and only puts x's at the Rendezvous Point. He's still suffering drains and losses to Court. Later I deploy Dr. E and Dengar w/gun to the Great Pit and deploy Search And Destroy and draw. Security Precautions, YES! So he deploys premiere Obi and saber to fight Dr E and Dengar. He kills them both with no loss to him. He then spreads out the ships. I activate 1 and he flips. Finish activating and get my drain cancelled. By this time I had SAV in hand, so I deploy it and I deploy Sec. Pre. and deploy BF in Slave 1 to Tatooine. Probe. 'nope' ok. Battle, I retrieve 2. destiny of 5. he draws a 2. He forfeits ships and I take no damage. I move Mara to Obi. Draw a First Strike. He Deploys some ships to other systems, and battles Mara. I swing and hit, he misses. I draw a 5, he drew a 3. Mara is the queen. from then on I had the game. Deploy 1st Strike and a ship from reserve (usually Bossk), battle retrieve 3, he loses 1. Lose Bossk to attrition. Battle with Boba retieve bossk and 2 others. Conitinued til he finally dies. I had no cards in my lost pile.
<br/>
FW +37
<br/>
<br/>
Props: A fully functioning game. Everything went perfectly.
<br/>
Slops: I would have liked to end the game by finding his HB.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs a San Diego guy
<br/>
He's Playing SFS and I laugh to myself. Someone said that space would kill my light deck and here I was before that deck. I started Signal for Aim High innstead of Tosche CP. This game went real fast. I would setup for a drain, but the next turn the was an undercover spy at my site. I finally round up the Falcon to destroy a TIE Scout only to see Ghhhk. Then the beatdown. Lat Damage,  Dreadnaught, TIE Scouts, APTW. Loss of 12 after forfeiting pilots. So I spread out on the ground. Lose my It's A Trap in a drain, then get beat down. 
<br/>
FL by 24 I think. I forgot the exact #'s.
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Aim High saved me alot of differential.
<br/>
Slops: The guy was a @#$%. No class what-so-ever.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Guy's HDADTJ
<br/>
Man, I hate Hunt Down. I started Goo Nee Tay instead of CP for Tosche. Sigh. He gets out a Dreadnaught to Kashyyyk his 2nd turn, and we both ingnore Visage. I'm not gonna lose if I don't have to and he wasn't enforcing it. I guess I should have anyway. I finally get some battlegrounds and Ben. Small drain for a bit. Also Spiral with Melas at Kashyyk. He puts Vader in the Med. Chamber and battles in space. I kill the Dread, he kills Melas. He also picks up Vader that move phase.  My turn, nothing sugnificant. (jump to end of game) Final Battle... I have Ben w/ his OG saber, Luke w/saber, and Tawss Khaa. He has Vader with OG Saber, Tarkin in Bliz Scout 1, and Tempest scout 4. He battles and duels Luke. I play courage. He has no interrupts. I lose by 4 coz I drew a 1 a 4 and a 0. Weak. Luke Crosses over. Swing at Vader w/ Ben. 5 and a 5. Vader is hit. Duel Ben. I draw a 1 and a 5. Cancelled by Tarkin. He draw his 2. Mathematically he has already won the duel, but he plays Focused Attack anyway. Swing-And-A-Miss. HA HA!!! But I lose the duel and my life force is gone. 
<br/>
FL by 20 something.
<br/>
Props: This dude was cooler then the last guy I played. and he didn't make me lose to Visage.
<br/>
Slops: Losing 2 consecutive duels and not making us lose to Visage.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Guy's Dagobah Mains deck.
<br/>
I start with CHYBC instead of my starting 3. He starts with something. I forgot what but is was insugnificant. He goes looking for sites while I set up Mara w/saber in the AC. He looks for a site. none there. I look. Tatooine locations and lots of mains. NO! I couldn't fight off an attack like that! I wasn't able to draw any systems to set up any ships and he was killing me on the ground. I fought best I could, but still lost. However, I did manage to track 2 6's. I had IG-88 capture Obi and flip my objective so Ididn't lose to my own objective. 
<br/>
FL by 15 or so.
<br/>
Props: Not many 'cept for IG-88
<br/>
Slops: Not starting the way I know I should have. Secret Plans would let me find a Shocking and then I can track my systems to draw them. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs. Scrubs HB w/Tatooine Celebration
<br/>
Now I didn't care what happened, I was gonna play and have fun. I started my appropriate interrupt for all 3. I setup Mara in the Chamber by 2nd turn with SAV. He looks for system but it isn't there. I lok and see many Bens and Lukes. I get Jade to Pit Of Carkoon and Jabba and Boelo to AC. (i had a Ghhk at this point). He comes down with Ben and Master Luke and battles. Projective Telepathy. Cancelled the battle. He's annoyed. My turn, redeploy Boelo. Battle, bounces Boelo, but not before I retreve 2 force. I ghhk Jabba. I drew a 5 and instead of reviving Luke, he loses Ben. YAH! His turn he moves Luke over w/o cancelling SAV. I battle, we kill each other. I retrieved 2 though. Through out all of this I managed to get BF in S! to Endor and Z in MH to Kashyyyk. His turn, I twi'lek for Battle Order. He deploys another Ben and Luke to AC. Moves Ben to Dungeon. I come down with Boelo (still in my hand) and some other cronies. I deploy Battle Order. Dattle for free. Get 2 back. Kill Luke but lose Boelo. Finally! He get to the point where paying for drains is too much and I win. 
<br/>
FW by 34.
<br/>
Props: Winning by 34. OH YEAH!
<br/>
Slops: Boelo returning to my hand just too many times. Him for losing Ben instead of bouncing Luke.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Mike Girard's Vegas Style.
<br/>
Here I am, a Vegas local playing against an AZ guy's 'vegas' deck. Hell Naw! He asks me for a captive and I give him Orrimaarko. I Signal for Tosche Station. He SCrews Ben out of my hand all game, but I still manage to get a Monk w/Meditation to the AC. I had Aim Hign in my starting hand, so yay for me. He was slow to get out the casino so we had some low stakes sabaac. (I was forced by Frustration to grab that same card, then later a SCrew. As opposed to Sabaac) I lost most of em but 2 or 3. I made him Lose Prescott and One of them was a planned Perfect Sabaac. Thanks Traffic Control! We had minor battles between his EPP Vaders and my EPP Leia. I managed to play It's A Trap to get out of a battle with IG-88 and 4-LOM. I got luke and Melas to the prison, finally and liberated Orri after some battling and chasing. It was a fun game with color commentary by both Girard and myself.
<br/>
FW by 13
<br/>
Props: A Perfect Saaac, Freeing my captive, getting Aim High in my opening hand, and beating the so called 'vegas style' deck. And Girard for being fun to play against.
<br/>
Slops: Ben never seeing the Table
<br/>
<br/>
So I went 3-3 and got a foil Visage in one of my Reflections packs. Yay. Maybe I'll do better at regionals. Thanks to Chris Hines for an awesome tournament. It was well planned and executed. Maybe I'll try to go to the LA GS and the Phoenix GS. We'll see. </font></td>
