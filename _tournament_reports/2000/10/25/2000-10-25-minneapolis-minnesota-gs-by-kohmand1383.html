<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well... it was the week before the Grand Slam.  I had just gotten home from a local tournament, and was figuring out what to play for next weekend.  I decided I’d keep my DS deck (BHBM/Troops/Char Removal)... its like the usual trooper deck, only with Stunning Leader, Set For Stun, and You Are Beaten.  
<br/>
During the next week, I constructed several decks, but chose bring to the GS my Profit Deck and my EBO/SPY deck.  In play testing, my Profit deck could beat most non-confrontational decks, cept those that had fast drains.  My LS EBO Deck was pretty much untested.  It started STRIKE PLANNING/SQAUSSINS/YISYW.  I had 2 ESBs, and 3 Signals, so I always set up by 2nd turn.  I might post it later...
<br/>
<br/>
I got a ride down friday with a Josh Wittanen, and we play tested at Graham Neals house that afternoon for a while.  I played my profit deck, and it did ok, but not great.  That night we went to Josh’s Aunts house to spend the night.  We play tested, and his ROps deck beat my EBO deck, due to a bad draw.  Then, I played against his Endor Ops with it, and beat it, even though I had another bad draw.  I think the deck can do better... he’s encouraging me to play profit the next day.
<br/>
<br/>
Well... the next day came, and I still didn’t know what I wanted to play.  The tournament had a pretty nice turn out... 48 people.  I talk to Andy Newton about my two-LS-deck predicament, and he tells me to play the EBO/Spy deck.  Good choice Andy!
<br/>
<br/>
I’m terrible with names... apologies in advance...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1- EBO SPYS vs Court /Cum and Villany
<br/>
I signal for ESB first turn, and toss my YISYW for Honor Of The Jedi.  I set up at my own pace, blocking his drains with undercover spies, and projections, and the force I do lose, I promptly retrieve with On The Edge.  I do a beatdown on an Abyssian with Ree-Yees with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke With Lightsaber for the site and 13 or so.  I also set up EBO, and am draining him at Yavin 4 and Sullust for 4 a piece... he doesn’t last long.  FW- 2(+18)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2- Trooper Beatdown vs Dagobah Space
<br/>
He sets up some nice activation, and gets Blount and Tycho in their ships to kessel pretty quick.  I’m set at a couple DB’s draining for a tiny bit, and trying to do S&amp;D damage, but I can’t find my 3rd DB to satisfy Honor...  I set down on Tala 2 and Green Sqaud 3 with Bossk/Bus and Zuckuss/Hunter.  We battle, and I make him lose Tala 2 and 3.  At this point I’m feeling pretty good... then his turn comes.  He plops down Wedge, RSL and Hobbie both in their ships, and hobbie has an X-Wing Laser Cannon.  He battles, and pops zuckuss in the head, leaving bossk to himself :-(. 
<br/>
He’s power 20, to my power 5 (I’ll Take The Leader was down), so I lose bossk and 10.  At this point, my force is down, and he’s doing a steady drain up in space... I do all the tiny bits of damage I can but I still... FL by 10.  2(+8)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3- EBO SPIES vs ???
<br/>
I don’t remember this game... but I won... FW by ?? 4(??)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Troops vs Hardcore Mains/Profit
<br/>
Emperor and Janus go to CC DB first turn, and start draining.  He makes a run on them with Master Luke and Luke’s Saber, but its unsuccessful.  Emperor and Janus drain at various docking bays for the remainder of the game.  He flips profit, and I come down with some vader and some troops.  I do some early damage, and he loses some high destiny cards.  The rest of the game is, more or less, him drawing ones, and me draining him here and there... FW +?? 6(??)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5- EBO vs TJ Olsen’s ROps
<br/>
He’s playing a ROps deck consisting of Storm Troops and Ties.  He has Decree/ROps going for a little while, but I flip his ROps a couple times, and eventually break his decree.  I do a beatdown on a couple of his troops a time or two.  He loses Wakeelmui off the top early game, so he doesn’t have any retrieval.  The game ends with me draining at 3 systems... FW +?? 8(??)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6- Troops vs Dan ???’s MWYHL
<br/>
I should’ve remembered his last name... he’s a Squadron Member and a good player... anyways... He sets up training with SOS, and Vader promptly comes down, to create a loss of 3, which becomes 1 after Honor.  He tries to set something up at Rendili with GL/G1 and the Tantive IV, but the Executor comes down, kicks ass, and takes names.  Eventually I have 2 DB’s occupied, and Rendili, with AAA, S&amp;D, and my drains hacking him down.  He flips, and retrieves 10 (I can’t find CBHYBC).  My damage is still too much for him, and he doesn’t get to do anything else.  FW +?? 10(64)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thats that... I go up there, to find I’m 9 differential short of the final conflict.  Poop, suck, crap!!!  Its would’ve been an interesting couple of games versus Grace... but oh well.  I’m still happy with my 3rd place finish.  I play a couple fun games after the tourney and head out.
