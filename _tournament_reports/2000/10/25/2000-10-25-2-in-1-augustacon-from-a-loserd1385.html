<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Augusta Con ,A.K.A The Scrubcon, had a good turnout for the Star Wars Tournaments a EPP overdrive and a constructed after. 
<br/>
The pregame stuff: I test on Thursday night (Friday off) against a few friends and make my fine tuning to my deck. We play till 1:00 in the morning and spend 30 minutes arguing whether or not a just action can happen as long as no one else has followed with another action. once resolved I won the game and went to bed. My light side deck is a EBO matching pilots and starfighters while my dark is a horribly low destiny BHBM. I arrive at the augusta con around 10:00 for the 10:30 EPP Overdrive tourney. 
<br/>
<br/>
The EPP overdrive report:
<br/>
After all the players sign up I realize that I am the Highest rated player there, so much for earning sealed deck points today. I get Light side thinking that it would probably show as usual and get few wins. I have luke w/ saber as my EPP. the notable cards I pulled out of my packs were: Were doomed, 2x it could be worse, 2x collision,2x talz, narrow escape, out of nowhere, hyper escape, trash compactor, and Owen Lars. I didn’t get a 2-0 location, very few cycling destinies, and only two x-wings, no other ships. Forgive me for the brief report but I forget games quicker than most. 
<br/>
<br/>
1st game vs. Chris Mirva
<br/>
    He got Epp Vader in his packs. He started the yavin 4 forest While I started mos Eisley. Early in the game he plays a reactor terminal and figures he will draw up his yavin 4 docking bay so he drops his vader to drain. I leave him alone and drop pops and owen to mos eisley to drain he tries a gravel storm on owen but fails with a 3. I draw up the trash compactor and begin to drain with a talz and trooper. He loses his Y4 DB to a force drain and vader never leves the forest. I spread out on Tatooine and the Death star to win the drain race.

2nd game vs. Nick W?
<br/>
   a Fairly uneventful game. I start Mos Eisley and he goes with DS: War room. I drop Owen and a rebel guard to mos eisley to drain. he drops the junland wastes and a tusken and trevagg and trooper. I track luke with saber draw him up and drop at mos eisley to move with a jawa over to the wastes. They get slowed down but I get out kessel with an xwing to start turning the drain race to my side. I go drain race the rest of the game and win

<br/>
3rd game vs. ???sorry
<br/>
   He starts the DS War room and i go mos eisley. first turn he drops down two more death star sites to give him massive activation and choke me. So I have no playable cards in my starting hand and I keep drawing until I get luke and the trash compactor. Meanwhile  he does little damage to me because he plays a few imps to the death star but he has nothing anywhere else to drain. Once I play the compactor and luke with a few scrubs I take over the death star and drain for two at the reactor and one at the compactor. I simply drain him out this game.

By now I notice many of the players have been winning by an average of 20+ so i get the 3-6th place game for my fourth round.
<br/>
<br/>
4th vs. James Boyd
<br/>
    I love playing James because he always plays many ridiculous ways but none so awesome too bad this one didn’t show that. He plays the war room and I mos eisley. He also drops two more DS sites to begin a choke on me and he drops trevagg to mos eisley to drain for two. on my turn I draw one and wait next he drains for two and I use it could be worse. He slaps Its worse to the table and show me a new meaning to force drain modifier by adding another five to his drain. For a few turns he drains me and I draw until I get luke and a jawa camp. i drop both and chase trevagg around while he drains at Y4 for one and beats me down on the death star. He wins the drain race.

It was rather disappointing to lose my position as ’sealed deck king’ in the area and get 7th of 20 overall. Paul Myers won the tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Constructed deck. Arthur Rhodes and Tony Zamberlan are the notable players along with a few guys from Columbia, GA. 
<br/>
<br/>
1st game vs Shawn Falk’s SYC Ties
<br/>
    I had just changed a few cards to put in hyper escapes to avoid the space beatdown. He deploys saber3 and pilot to his hoth system and next turn I fly tycho in ship up to halt the drain and draw all my force. He thinks he has it made and drops another couple interceptors a dreadnaught and initiates I hyper escape to the docking bay. Shawn questions the hyper escape to a docking bay and it takes the TD a while to decide that I could run to the DB. He leaves Wakeelmui open and I drop tantive 4 and two pilots.
<br/>
He deploys a couple ties to other systems for +alot because of tie system along with a ZIMH to drain at the systems. Later I come down with a liberty, jedi luke, tawss, haven and an empty green squad one for forfeit along with I’ll take the leader( THE admirals order) I initiate and he plays all power to even up the power on his ties. I make him lose a tie or two and I lose nothing plus I play legendary to the green squad one. next turn he drops a few more ties and lat damages my liberty (oww). I have 7 in destiny but I have to lose the green squad one and tawss. Next turn I drop independence and thaneespi and initiate. he loses the battle entirely, never gets back wakeelmui and I out drain him.

2nd game vs. Charlie hunters Hidden base
<br/>
	I know this sounds bad but I remember very little from this game. Maybe because nothing happened.  I probe the hidden base on my first try, beat him in a space battle and show him a new meaning to Your Destiny.

3rd game vs. Adrian Brown’s BHBM
<br/>
	This dude comes down from Columbia ,SC to try and win one of Augusta’s tourneys. Arthur Rhodes told Columbia to go back home  Anyway, he starts the usual and passes his first turn. Next turn I get two sites and draw up a few characters and leave three force with a Signal in my hand. He deploys Darth Vader and GMT to the north ridge but does not move in (I guess he needed a battleground, I never saw a BG site from his deck.) So I signal and get an Ice storm. As soon as he sees the ice storm he moans in terror. Next turn I plop it down to the north ridge and cause the guys to go missing and I don’t have to lose to Your Destiny anymore. That pretty much makes the game. Jedi luke never comes down to the table and I drain massive at the systems while he drains one or two on the ground with mara and stick.

4th game vs. Adrian Brown’s Profit Mains
<br/>
        Guess what, I get paired with the same dude again.  Out of 24 freaking people I get to play the same guy again. He starts profit and I haven’t tested at all versus one of these and it showed.   First of all he doesn’t prompt me about two aliens at the chamber and I forget. So I go with my usual start and he begins to move on tatooine. I drop over at the CC: DB to drain and get Your Destiny off. He deploys jedi luke from reserve for 4 bucks to JP. I already have the crew(vader, janus, mara, GMT, and a walker) at the DB so I deploy another walker to the Tat:DB and move vader and GMT with GMT on the walker. Next turn he drops major (obi, Han, etc.) And Clashes my Lord Vader and initiates vs the rest. He wallops GMT and the walker for 5 battle damage. Lord vader needs backup so I move mara and janus over. Emperor moves to the DSII DB. Next turn he drops a Col Cracken and I try to force fry him, I miss so he deploys a 3-1 scrub and I wait, next he deploys a Leia with blaster and that’s when I barrier . So he doesn’t intiate. He initiates on lord vader and crew for a janus to  the lost pile. He flips profit and damages me away the rest of the game while the emperor runs because he doesn’t have the balls to fight against a weapon and power 9.

5th game vs Fredrick Ealick’s HDDTJ
<br/>
          This kid is doing great by the fact that he is so highly placed at this point in the tourney. He seems to be a newbie and hes doing better than most of the other experienced players. Anyway his deck has a few endor sites but he doesn’t draw a BG early so he drops vader and a few scrubs to get the battleground at the north ridge. I search for an Ice storm and send them to a snowy grave for the rest of the game. Next I deploy HOTJ and hes losing to Visage while im cruisin in space. He tries to drain at endor but EPP han and ECC chewie drop down on 3 troopers. I don’t shoot and draw two destiny I hit him for about 15 BD he loses the troopers and That wraps up the game as I drain away in space.

6th game vs Paul Myers Hidden Base
<br/>
        I usually don’t like playing against Paul but I like playing with him while testing to see what he would do and what I would do. He is the only player that I test with that I had to play this weekend (why him? Why not James Boyd or Carmine Arca?  ) Anyway, I get rocked this game Projections at my DB’s, OTE that I can’t cancel cause I lost my alters in a drain. I can only drain for two while he drains for three at kessel after he flips. I try to drop down and get the HB but he moved it from the last game I played with him. I probe four of five and miss the HB. I get burned by drains and he plays All wings to get big diff.

I thought I had done pretty well until I find out I got 7th of 24 which is low for me.
<br/>
<br/>
The good:

Clay Cushman for another fun tourney
<br/>
James Boyd for showing us that any given day, anyone can lose.
<br/>
My EBO being a machine!
<br/>
Paul for showing me what x-wings are

<br/>
The bad:
<br/>
Paul for showing me what x-wings are(no typo)
<br/>
Getting a low spot because of the diff
