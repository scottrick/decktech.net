<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">hummmm! where to start? The day before iam suppose to playtest and leave to Orlando at 7:00 am but iam want to relax so i decide to play The MACHINE bhbm deck that cannot lose( except if your not lucky and lose a HUGE sac war) and for light side i play my the MACHINE KILLA my mwyhl with twist to totally crush bhbm, raltir and hunt down.
<br/>
At 2:00am the phone ring it is my flight, its cancel and i have to leave at 1:30, she most think iam crazy because i make her repeat 5 time (hey! its 2 in the morning and i was tired ). The flight was fast 4 hour and nothing go wrong. So i arrive at d-con and the first think i see is the decipher cam that was filming me. I met a few of my 99 friend like Koen Mejissen, Marten Loghe and Martin Akesson we play a few game with my ebo with BIG TWIST deck and we go eat.
<br/>
<br/>
DAY 1: i heard a lot of people talking about my ebo deck, WHAT THE F*CK i just played 2 game with it and every body knows it? lucky for me i wasnt going to play this deck:)
<br/>
At the end of the day iam really glad that Dominic and Raphael did it(i was sure they will) but my 2 other friend got screw Joe was 2-2 and check the drop case:( so he cannot play and Martin Paquette was 4-0 and go DQ because he wrote 1 AFA insteed of 4:(
<br/>
<br/>
DAY 2 the real day world championship day 1:i got 7 hour of sleep so that really great since every person who qualified from day 1 got around 2 hour of sleep:(
<br/>
<br/>
game 1 The MACHINE vs Martin Falke( 2015 ) HB a la Falke
<br/>
I was really lucky with the matchup and upset to play Martin first round( since i think he is one of the best player in the world )
<br/>
i put pressure on him early  by deploying emp. Papatine first turn
<br/>
2 turn janus  and vader + saber at d*2:db with papatine them move them at &lt;&gt;db
<br/>
at turn 4 i was draining for 6 and him for 1 and he was losing from s&amp;d and i occupied my 3 battleground
<br/>
win by 23
<br/>
<br/>
game 2 The MACHINE KILLA vs Zach Stenerson( 1963 ) Raltir
<br/>
I love to play against raltir easy game most of the time
<br/>
on turn 5 he was dead i got no card in lost pile retrieve with on the edge, hje lost 12 card to AFA and 10 to uncontrollable fury
<br/>
and i took control of space with super falcon.
<br/>
win by 27
<br/>
<br/>
game 3 The MACHINE vs Gary Carman (2062) fake hb with huge activation and beetdown crew
<br/>
I was also lucky to play my ds against him, since he was packing a lot of stuff to counter my ls deck.
<br/>
we battle here and there i battle damage him for 9 card and drain him out a really close game
<br/>
win by 6
<br/>
<br/>
game 4 The MACHINE KILLA vs Brian Rippetoe (1964) ice plain + defensive perimeter start with sac
<br/>
my start against him was do or do not + wise advise + battle plan, no surprise that he trow all is sac in the lost pile:)
<br/>
 i was draining for 3?(i never won by draining with this deck) and AFA did 12 damage
<br/>
win by 15
<br/>
<br/>
game 5 The MACHINE KILLA vs The MACHINE Raphael Asselin(1858)
<br/>
he is not lucky i got the MACHINE KILLA AND HE GOT THE MACHINE so i won
<br/>
by ?
<br/>
<br/>
game 6 The MACHINE vs The MACHINE KILLA Raphael Asselin(1858)
<br/>
We are playing the same deck and i got the MACHINE and him the MACHINE KILLA he won
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
so right now iam 5-1 and i only have to won another game to make it
<br/>
<br/>
game 7 The MACHINE vs Brian Rippetoe TRM with sac
<br/>
i was in control of the game until he deploy a lot of ship to kessel and we begin a sac war i got 6 and him ?
<br/>

<br/>
and i have to lose 6 card in one big sac war and all of his card go to used pile so at this point he is in control of the game since i dont want to play inteerupt anymore since i only have 4 sac left and he got a lot 
<br/>
i lose by 6 or something like that:(
<br/>
<br/>
now iam 5-2 and i tought at this time that if i lose my last match i wont be in:(
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
he is in control of the game since turn one after 6 turn i got like 15 card in my lost pile and he got 2...this game those not look good at all for me:(
<br/>
but AFA do the 12 damage i need and i got kill lord ( i hate uncontrolable fury )vader and i start draining with jedi luke with is stick
<br/>
and make a few battle with first strike + narrow escape
<br/>
and he deploy vader( i love uncontrolable fury) premiere so i deploy uncontrolable fury and win by 6
