<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After last weekend’s great festivities (LG/SJ Super Saturday), I just had to have more.  So, I decide I want to hit the tournament in Pleasanton at KK’s Komics, Kards, &amp; Kollectibles.  I get picked up from my dorm room at UC Santa Cruz, arrive at home, loan some cards to my brother for the tournament, then after a vehicular confusion, I and my brother jump into my mother’s P.O.S. Ford Taurus and off we are to Pleasanton.  Unfortunately, this Saturday, in Pleasanton, the Foothill Band Review was taking place (something I know a lot about being a 4-year marching band veteran).  Detours everywhere.  Irritating.  After driving around the parade route, we finally arrived at the store, and the tournament got underway about 10 minutes after the TD, Mike Guertin, showed up.

<br/>
My decks:
<br/>
LS - Ewok Agents and Jedi Protectors - Agents In The Court with Ewoks and Graak (LS Mosep) as Rep
<br/>
DS - ISB Biker Gang - ISB using Outer Rim Scouts piloting Speeder Bikes on Tatooine with Scum &amp; Villainy
<br/>
I chose to make new decks for this weekend because I wanted to return to an Ewok deck (of which I am successful with) and my BHBM TIE deck just got too boring and mechanized to play with.
<br/>
Both of these decks will be posted here on DeckTech soon, if you wish to examine them further.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - DS v. Brandon Bale’s Hidden Base fakeout mains
<br/>
I got a decent hand to start with.  I set up 4 ORSs, 2 per Speeder Bike, at 2 Tatooine sites (Desert Heart + Jundland Wastes) to flip 2nd turn.  He drops EPP Luke and EPP Han to Jundland Wastes and clears my side (I drew a 0 for battle destiny), then moves them both to the Desert Heart.  This cost him the game.  For those of you unfamiliar with Tatooine: Desert Heart, characters (except Jawas) must have +1 landspeed to move from there.  He then sets up ECC Lando and Nien Nunb at the CC: Lower Corridor.  I drop Ephant Mon and an ORS on a Speeder Bike at his CC Docking Bay.  So, Lando’s locked in the Lower Corridor.  After that, I Destroyed Homestead Luke, and after a few turns, I drain him out.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 27; 2(+27)
<br/>
Good Things: Total lockdown on his mains
<br/>
Bummers: none
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: If not for that one mistake in the beginning, I might have been totally harassed out of most of my drains, and some battling may have been going on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - LS v. Philip Green’s My Kind Of Scum Tuskens
<br/>
He flashed an SE Tusken as his Rep, so I plan out for a straight drain race.  I pull an Endor site in my opening hand, use Insurrection to pull Endor: Landing Platform, and set up an Ithorian, Kazak, and Graak.  Next turn, the draining begins.  Nothing really exciting happens.  I set up fully on Endor, drive him out of the Audience Chamber thanks to Bo Shuda and Order To Engage (which allows me to cancel Scum), and my drains (especially those from Reserve) waste him.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 31; 4(+58)
<br/>
Good Things: Quick setup
<br/>
Bummers: none
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: You played well, but the deck you used just doesn’t have very good battling capabilities off-Tatooine.  You did get in some nice damage before my drains swallowed you whole.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - LS v. Kevin Shannon’s My Kind Of Scum Abyssins
<br/>
Once I saw the objective and Myo as the Rep, I knew I was screwed.  Kevin had an Abyssin deck going for awhile; JPSD made it so much more lethal.  He sets up his drains, and gets out Hutt Influence so I can’t modify or cancel them.  I got EPP Obi down for some scrimmaging twice, but only delayed the inevitable.  I got in my drains, even after Battle Order hit the table.  A Gifted Threepio slowed him down a little, but then Occupation came down.  Two turns later, I run out of cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FL by 6; 4(+52)
<br/>
Good Things: It was a fantastic game; I was pleased that I was able to maintain stride with a Worlds Finalist
<br/>
Bummers: Everyone crowded around our game @#$%ing about how long our game was going
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: As always, a great game.  You are one of the finest players I’ve ever faced, and most hilarious.  Every game with you is a blast and a riot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - DS v. Kevin Shannon’s Agents In The Court Sandspeeders
<br/>
My first notion is: great!; I’ll be able to set up fast.  And I did.  My ORSs kept coming down, and riding Bikes across Tatooine.  We battled a couple of times, but he only beat me down twice (He forgot to deploy Incom Corporation prior to beatdowns so many times).  All other battles were minimal losses, and others I initiated for S&amp;V retrieval (my favorite was Mosep v. 1 Sandspeeder w/ Maneuvering Flaps; retrieve 2, lose Mosep, retrieve him in another battle).  In the last battle, I was the biggest idiot and scrub you could have seen.  He deploys a Sandwhirl to the Desert Heart, getting rid of 2 ORSs on a Bike.  Next, he battles at the site adjacent to the Sandwhirl.  He asks me if I want to react with my 2 ORSs on a Bike at the other site adjacent to the Desert Heart, and I say, "Sure."  Oops.  That got everyone rolling in the aisles.  This opens up some sites for him to drain at uncontested, but my overwhelming retrieval and large drains wins me the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 25; 6(+77)
<br/>
Good Things: Another fantastic game.
<br/>
Bummers: That last battle
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Same as prior game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - LS v. Clayton Atkin’s CCT Skrillings-Numbers
<br/>
Old school strikes again.  I admire Clay’s use of such great strategies that most have deemed obsolete since the onset of Death Star II.  I got my standard stuff going.  2nd turn, EPP Vader paid a visit and wiped out Graak and an Ewok Spearman.  An Ithorian survived the battle; he lost Vader.  I play Out Of Commission; I luckily get Vader.  I lost a lot to numbers.  A big mistake I made was dropping Figrin D’an to the Carbonite Chamber, then moving him over to free DOS (whom I’d given up as a captive).  He beats me down for my mistake, saying that it would have been more had I not OOC’d Vader.  That made me feel a little better.  We traded drains we’d pay for (Battle Order), then he drops Kashyyyk and fortifies it.  He drains me for free, I still have to pay.  To end the game, he Counter Assaults a drain of mine causing me more than 10 damage; I can’t remember the exact number.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FL by 19; 6(+56)
<br/>
Good Things: A great game.
<br/>
Bummers: Figrin going hardcore
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: As with Kevin, Clayton’s a top player and fun to play.  His calm demeanor slows the game down physically, which is comforting when compared to most other players’ tempos.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - DS v. Jonathan Brookner’s Kashyyyk-start Squadron Assignments
<br/>
After losing to Clay, I thought I’d stay among the upper players, but I get paired with a scrub.  This guy starts Kashyyyk, Squadron Assignments, and some other effect.  This game literally took 5 minutes.  He spread out fast, not worrying about drawing destiny.  He was lucky that I only run 2 starships, neither of which I was able to pull until lategame.  Another no-show all game was Den Of Thieves.  I set up normally, dropped Search And Destroy, and drained him for tons on the ground.  His space drains got big, which worried me, because I was unable to retrieve much and couldn’t hit him for damage in space.  I finally got Zuckuss In Mist Hunter, threw on an ORS pilot and another as passenger, and began visiting his systems.  As his drains dwindled, I kept up my steady barrage.
<br/>
<br/>
Result: FW by 25; 8(+81)
<br/>
Good Things: none
<br/>
Bummers: Beating a scrub; not pulling my ships or Den Of Thieves
<br/>
Compliment of opponent: Tenacious and unconventional.
<br/>
<br/>
Out of 19 players, I ended up placing 4th and winning $5 in store credit.  Not too shabby.  Clayton goes undefeated and wins the tournament and $17.50 in store credit, Kevin Shannon reaps 2nd and $10 store credit, and Brandon Bale pulls off 3rd and gets a See-Threepio EJP pack (to quote him: "Finally I get a @#$%ing Jade Saber.").
<br/>
All in all, another great tournament.  I had fun, and traded for an extra Home One.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading my report.  The next Los Gatos/San Jose Super Saturday (2 tournaments, one morning, one evening) is November 18; if you’re in the area, stop by!
