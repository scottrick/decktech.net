<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well it is my first tournament since September 9th and considering I was away for July/August I am still getting used to DS II. So Decipher killed Rops so for dark I made a high destiny BHBM using Mara, Sim, Janus, IG-88, and bounty hunter ships as my only guys while I use 5’s and 6’s to make them lose battles and force them to lose to duels. For light I use a smodification of a Spaceport Speeders someone gave me the idea for. I think he kinda wants the idea secret so I won’t reveal his name. Since the last tournament the only games I have played have been over AIM or CardTable and I went 4-22 in those games so it shows how much I suck. Thanks to Jamie Giberti (Jeebs), Jonathan Grubb, and the guy who runs SWCCG News Archive, I forgot your name sorry, for those games.
<br/>
<br/>
I get to the store, Grasshopers Comics. I play a few games with Mike Mayrsohn and Bucksun Lee and get a box of JPOTSD and pull crap rares. We end up with 12 players including myself, Derek Halpern, Billy Hauser, Ben Daria, Matt Ehrhart, Sam Diamond, Alex Warshow’s, Bill Power, Patrick Booth, Brad Vogel, Bucksun Lee, and Matt Moss. I am 1703 going into this tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Light pile Vs. Ben Daria’s (1602) BHBM 
<br/>
Starts off with his Mobilization Points, Imperial Arrest Order, and You Cannot Hide Forever to my Mos Eisley, Wise Advice, Insurrection, and Staging Areas. Basically he sets up Palpy at DSII docking bay while I set up for Spaceport Speeders. He deploys Lord Vader with saber and Mara with saber to Endor and moves Palpatine over to meet them. I drop Boussh and give him Luke. He transits to Tatooine DB. I play Spaceport Speeders on Lukes Landspeeder and drop Ben with saber and Orrimaarko to them. I deploy Bacta Tank. I play Clash of Sabers on Vader and battle. Mara hits me, I hit someone I think, and he loses and I make him lose 2 to Orri’s text while I lose Ben to the Tank and Orrimaarko stays. On his turn he beats me up and I stack a card I think. He plays Shut Him Up Or Shut Him Down to try to cancel Bacta Tank but I Sense. Eventually he gets it through and Ben goes bye-bye. I set up with Boussh and Anakins saber and he beats me up there and I stack another card. I eventually run out of characters while he drains me at Mos Eisley. He starts to duel and he wins one and plays I Am Your Father so I lose 2 a turn. I end up losing because of that I Am Your Father. Loss by 14.
<br/>
FL 0(-14)
<br/>
Highlights: I lost by less than 20! Yeah!
<br/>
Lowlights: None except for the undeniable fact that I lost.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Dark BHBM Vs. Bucksun Lee’s (1629) Endor Farm Start
<br/>
He starts Menace Fades, Strike Planning, and Insurrection. I go with Mob Points, IAO, Oppressive Enforcement. I set up Palpy at CC Docking Bay. He drops Joroen Webb, EPP Han, Orrimaarko, and General Lando to him and battles. Force Lightning kills Han but I lose around 9 overflow. On my turn I run away to DS II Docking Bay. He follows. My turn, IG-88, Janus, and Lord Vader joins him. He barriers Vader but I beat up Lando after capturing Orrimaarko. He does nothing on his turn and on my turn I deploy Colonel Davod Jon to Endor I think, move Palpy and Janus somewhere like Cloud City, and deploy Tarkin to Tatooine and move vader over. I drain him and anything he plays gets Sensed/Altered. He gives me Luke and I duel and win everytime. We have a battle in space with his Tantive against my Fett and he loses and stacks a card. Melas goes to Tatooine DB late game but I proceed to drain him out and duel him to death. He kept using profanity at me which was cool. Nothing like Buck calling you names when you Sense a card. I win by 16.
<br/>
FW 2(+2)
<br/>
Highlights: Winning and controlling the whole game
<br/>
Lowlights: Early beatdown on Palpatine and his whining
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS BHBM Vs. Bill Hauser’s (1669) RST
<br/>
I start same as last game and he starts Your Insight, Squadron Assignments, and Strike Planning. He sets up at Endor with Lando and I set up on the ground. I start the drains with Palpy/Janus, Colonel Davod Jon/Vader. He gives me Farmboy Luke. I drop Fett on the Gold Leader at Kiffex  and Sense his Spiral and he stacks a card. He follows with the Falcon and he wins and plays Legendary Starfighter. Dengar in ship, a Dreadnaught, and Zuckuss in ship with 4LOM go after them and I clear out a whole bunch but on his turn he shoots down Zuckuss with an Xwing Cannon and I lose 18 overflow. All downhil now. I try to spread on the ground only to get a beat down by some EPPs. I lose by 13, well played on his part. 
<br/>
FL 2(-11)
<br/>
Highlights: Big battling in space
<br/>
Lowlights: Him beating down Dengar for 18 overflow.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Light pile Vs. Brad Vogel’s (1746) BHBM
<br/>
I showed him my deck earlier so I can tell the suprise factor is gone. Same as game 1 pretty much. He sets up a drain on Endor and I set up on Tatooine. I gave him Luke. He chases me around and I sense some stuff but eventually he Circles Obi so he’ gone. He drains in space at Rendili and at some docking bays. I retrieve some with On/Off the Edges and I Fallene Portal Jabba when he tries to battle Han. I make him lose to his objective. He basically killed me. Full loss by 15.
<br/>
FL 2(-26)
<br/>
Highlights: I don’t know. I didn’t lose by more than 20 so that is good.
<br/>
Lowlights: I lost and my deck is so sucky, what am I trying to accomplish with it anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
Well I finish in 10th out of 12 players. Top 4 are:
<br/>
1. Matt Ehrhart 
<br/>
2. Derek Halpern
<br/>
3. Brad Vogel
<br/>
4. Bill Hauser
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, 1-3, definately not my best performance ever. I get no prize support cause it was all bad CC stuff anyways. I trade for a WB Vader, Falcon, two Evazans, and some other stuff. I want to say thanks to Bucksun Lee, Brad Vogel, Dennis Shea, and Bill Hauser for the trades. My rating will probably drop from 1703 to 1664 after it gets updated. I am thinking of quitting this game which gets even less interesting each day for me. I am going on the 18th so I will see everyone then.
