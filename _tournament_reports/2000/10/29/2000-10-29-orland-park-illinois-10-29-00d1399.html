<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">so today was another tourney...whoopadeedoo.  i have to brush up on my playing since i don’t think i’ve seen a game since d-con. so anyhoo i take my buddy bret with me from normal up to orland (two hour drive) and get there around 8am...’cause i don’t have a light deck yet so i have to make one. DUH!  we drive 100mph cause we are cool. screw you all who drive 55, ’cause sammy hagar is gay.  
<br/>
<br/>
my buddy eric olson is the director today, and he’s sooo cool.  he is 6 cats in a barn (everyone else is only 5) becuase he took my Tauntaun bones Jedi Testing deck to the pinnacle that it stands at right now.  if you don’t know what i’m talking about you can go to hell (well, i guess you don’t have to go to hell...that is unless you simpley CANNOT figure out how a Tauntaun Bones/jedi Testing deck works).  ONLY 10 PEOPLE SHOW UP so this kinda sux...but that’s okay.  we are 5 cats in a barn.
<br/>
<br/>
bret borrows Joe Alread’s court/profit decks (which were used to win Origins this year).  
<br/>
<br/>
i’m running my Blitzkrieg (thanks for the name Girard) deck for dark, and your standard HBase/OMDH/blah deck for light (note: this is pretty uncharacteristic for me to run a standard deck of this type...but it’s the only thing i think can work right now, what with Dark being so lop-sidedly overpowerful).
<br/>
<br/>
game 1:  DS vs. Glen Sutton’s TIGIH
<br/>
<br/>
whoa.  nothing really happens right away, but i lose vader off the top due to my objective flipping as vader captures luke.  vader is put "out of commission" (5 cards in lost pile = %20 chance...not too bad).  same turn:  glen drops EPP leia to Endor DB and fights Lord Vader, drawing a 6 to shoot him.  whoa.  (i later find out that glen only runs 2 6 destiny cards in the whole deck)  45 cards in deck...uhm = about %2 chance (maybe %3) that he’ll either draw a 6 for weapon OR battle destiny.  suck.  so the emperor takes luke, sits at Chief Chirpa’s hut, and MANY walkers participate in pitched battles at Endor:backdoor/docking bay while i lose 3 per turn to his objective and mine.  i bring him down to 4 before losing to both objectives’ damage.
<br/>
<br/>
0 (-4)
<br/>
<br/>
game 2:  LS vs. guy with semi-alan parson’s project
<br/>
<br/>
i don’t know who you are man, but if you DO demo this game like you say you do, then i sure hope you learn the rules some time.  funny thing:  his first turn, he drops Jerjerrod to the DS2 **SYSTEM**  ..that’s right! NO SHIP.  whoa.  he is a squid.  i’m like "dude, you can’t do that!" and he’s like "huh?" so i explain to him why, etc.  so at this point he’s deploying MORE systems than i am.  i get Legendary Gay on Gen.Calrissian in Falcon2k after he leaves a dreadnaught for me to smack on for 10.  then he puts like 6 star destroyers on Fondor.  they don’t move.  he puts Hebsley in the bunker (on endor of course), and i go there with first strike/blount/epp han/ENDOR chewie/epp leia + i have protector, i know, and life debt in hand.  my mains all hit the table VERY slowly, so as not to startle this guy and give him time to play his barrier (or whatever).  he waits for me to deploy ALL, and then says Barrier han, barrier chewie.  wtf.  i let it go.  so i beat hebsley for 5 with leia/blount and move over to where vader is sitting.
<br/>
the following turn, he doesn’t move away from my dudes, i retreive like 9 with OMDH...then i beat him down the following turn for like 48.
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+28???)  
<br/>
<br/>
game 3: DS vs. guy with profit/tat.celebration
<br/>
<br/>
another questionable game.  this guy drops Ben Kenobi/master luke on turn 1 to jabba’s palace.  does he free han?  no.  they just sit there for like 5 turns.  by that time i have walkers on like 3 of his 1/1 tatooine sites and the devastator with 2 random mofos + admirals order at tatooine system.  he ALSO now has like...MEDITATION **AND** proficiency on M.Luke.  he frees han with bousch, then tries to put bousch UNDERCOVER!!! wtf.  NO NO NO i’m thinking WHY AM I HERE?  well it was fun nonetheless!  so luke is now sitting at JPalace with ECCchewie+1 sandspeeder facing Tempest 1/blizzard 2/mofo.  i drop lord vader, capture luke, draw 2 destiny (2x 6) and beat down chewie for like 16.  game
<br/>
<br/>
4 (+48??)
<br/>
<br/>
game 4: LS vs. scott sichta’s court.
<br/>
<br/>
i think olson came over to me at some point and said "that’s Lewis’s court deck he’s running" and i’m like "great i’m a champ" or something gay. i am 5 cats in a barn at this point.  i hang out in space for a bit with HotJ protecting me from his court/S&amp;D for like 4 turns.  i think he’s afraid to spread to 3 battlegrounds.  he finally spreads, so i drop Endor Chewie/Epphan/Eppleia/cracken to attack ECCdengar+dr.E. (normally this is a bad idea, but i got a chance to verify earlier on...the destiny is not so hot) so i fight, he operates on the wookie, despite my ROOOOOOAAAAARRRRR!!!! and i still beat him down with 21 to his 16 power/forfeit for 5 cards...   i’ve retrieved about 10 so far with OTEdge’s, and i keep the pressure on to keep him down to 2 battlegrounds.  there’s a throwdown between Twhass and Mara, mara goes down, flip objective to cancel drains, blah blah blah, retrieve 5, retrieve 7, win by like ...21 i think
<br/>
<br/>
6 (+68??)
<br/>
<br/>
game 5: DS vs. scott sichta’s throne room + heading for the medical phil start.  
<br/>
<br/>
i don’t know what the big deal is for going first here, but whatever.  i get my stuff out, he REVOLUTIONS the ds2 docking bay....whoa.  he revolutions another place...blah.  eventually he moves ALL his guys from various dbays to the ds2 dbay.  there’s a throwdown at the Rendili dbay, luke is captured, i move the emperor off the DS2 (barely escaping a swarm of bad dudes), and drop CHYBC to stop the drain of 2 at the DS2 throne room.  there’s a BIG throwdown at rendili system between 4 star destroyers and a fully loaded home one.  vader/tarkin shuttle up to the system and eventually beat away the mon-cal and it’s homo-squid-squad.  those squids are gay...but it was a good game.  he kinda had me on the ropes with force gen for a bit (due to revo ...surprisingly).
<br/>
<br/>
8 (+80???)
<br/>
<br/>
game 6: LS vs. Glen Sutton’s BHBM
<br/>
<br/>
glen does NOTHING for the first 6 turns but draw.  he’s only activating like 6 when he could be activating 8 (mob.points).  wtf.  squids.  i’m draining for 2 (endor/aquaris) and slowly setting up HBase stuff.  vader takes luke (’cause honor is USELESS against No Escape) and drains for 3/turn at downtown plaza.  i just kinda try and invade the DS2, but i can’t seem to get enough force to do it.  i think i needed like 24 to get 3 mains + a spy...ick.
<br/>
so han/blount go to the DS2:dbay, ig-88 comes to cap han, and take blount for 2 more cards.  glen grabs Throw me another charge AND a few maneuvers, but NOT on the edge.  whatever.  so i drain him out after flipping HBase, + retrieve like 7 with OMDH.  win.  gay
<br/>
<br/>
10 (+98)
<br/>
<br/>
i don’t know how i got 98, but whatever. blah.
<br/>
<br/>
hmmm...not quite the practice i expected for Phoenix, but whatever.  i’ll figure SOMETHING out for the LS.
<br/>
<br/>
thanks to olson for ....NOTHING!!! wtf do you hold these damned things at 9am for?  it’s a damned good thing there was a time change last night, or i might not have made it!
<br/>
<br/>
just kidding!  (you’re 6 cats in a barn, remember?)
<br/>
<br/>
so anyhoo...clint, steve, olson, girard, and me are going to a titty bar or something...who knows.  see you in phoenix guys!
