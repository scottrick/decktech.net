Going into decipher con i was pretty confident. My profit deck hadnt lost a game since i made it and i had a pretty good hunt down deck put together.  I didnt playtest much and that was a big mistake.  Needless to say that after going 4-4 at day 1 of worlds convinced me to be prepared more next year. But anyway, I hook up with TJ and he shows me his ebo deck.  I play it a few times and it gets wrecked. so then he shows me exactaly how to play it and it works like a machine. I still needed to find a team cause a couple of guys from home couldnt make the con. but i can pick up a few team mates. Turns out most everyone is going home the morning of the team event. So i finally decide on the ebo and for dark i play hunt down again. this time its like 100 times better cause i got JOZ tech and no escape and Power of the hutt is a beating.  So i get to the team event and i still need 2 team mates. Its me and James Barrett, we meet two guys from over seas. and we got a team. Now on to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My dark Vs. John Lolli (fake hidden base)
<br/>
<br/>
I really didnt want to play a member of ghetto squad in this tournament but oh well.  i start out by pulling ephant mon and rendili. at the end of my turn john ditches insight for honor. His turn he pulls endor. a docking bay, general lando and crix. puts out honor and passes. I lose one to visage and activate 7 force. Dlots comes out with a saber and i drop no escape. A sac war starts over something and i win. I am having incredible luck and john is alittle frustrated cause everything he tries to do i have a counter for it. Well the turning point of the game was during a battle. I hacked up a guy with vader and drew two 6’s for destiny. He dosnt move away and moves ben kenobi without a saber for some back up. I activate 4 cards and circle ben. John dosnt have a sense and it wouldnt have mattered anyway cause i had a sense, alter and a control. I draw the stacked 6’s and john gets a home one and a destiny 1 character. Obi and 9.  after that it was just him losing to visage and me draining.  Win by 21.
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+21)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning a duel and countering everything he did.
<br/>
Lows: Not much. Looking back on day 1 of worlds and wishing jpotsd was legal. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My light Vs. Hugh Shelton (Hunt Down Anktopot)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok We draw opening hands and i transmission terminated his visage after he activates 1 force. 1 wind chimes and an ishi tib in my opening hand. his 2nd turn he droppes epp vader ozzel and evazan. My turn drop the 3rd ishi tib and set up ebo.  His turn he drops mara and mover vader and evazen to the power generators. My turn I bust. Jedi luke, Lukes saber, obiwan. against mara and ozzel. I start a fight. after the battle is started i clash mara so ozzel cant ghkkkk. hack ozzel up and draw a decent destiny. I make him lose like 10. His turn he does nothing but draw. I activate drop launching the assault. search for home one. drop civil disorder and the home one goes to kiffex with ackbar piloting. I search for haashan. His turn he drops chimaera to satisfy civil disorder and draws up all of his cards.  My turn i drop independance and haashan. start a fight and draw a stacked wind chimes for destiny. My power is like 31 to his 8. GAME. Win by 27.
<br/>
<br/>
4(+48)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Special thanks go out to the techmaster himself. This deck is a beast. also thanks to JOZ. joz teck with clash is awesome. other highlights. whippin the chimaeras ass.
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: I didnt win by 30
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My light Vs. Koen Meijssen (isb space with big drains)
<br/>
<br/>
Alot of @#$% happened in this game. but the turning point came when Koen played both his grabblers on my sense and my wind chimes. He should have grabbed my hyper escape. I was draining for 1 a turn and blocking most of his drains. but he was getting back an agent every turn. Order to engage comes out and i play hyper escape like 10 turns in a row. Someone once told me that 30 cards worth of direct damage was HUGE. I win with 32 seconds left in the round by 11.
<br/>
<br/>
6(+59)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Playing hyper escape like 10 turns in a row. and Boner Biggs saving the day. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Damn i should have played this deck on thursday.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My dark Vs. Markus Wuest (bo shuda profit)
<br/>
<br/>
I can sum up this game in only a few examples. First of all the first time he lost to visage he lost order to engage off the top of his deck. 2nd was a battle involving ecc chewie and that new lando. Lord vader evazan, and mara. I hack up lando and operate. Im draining for 4 at jabbas palace and 1 at rendili. He never flips his objective and i have a very easy game. win by 23
<br/>
<br/>
8 (+82)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Hunt down is so good with these new cards. i dont know what else to say.
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: I actually lost to visage 2 times
<br/>
<br/>
So the tournament ends and i find my other team mates. James had some really bad matchups and equally bad luck. he finished 1-3. My foriegn partners both finished 3-1. Team albany won the glass and our team finished 2nd. we all got jedi knight luke tshirts and a pack of japanese hoth. So i had a good ending to a bad trip. Some personal things kinda put a damper on the whole weekend. but doing well and finishing 1st place individually in the team tournament made me feel better.  The ghetto war world championships got delayed cause ray had to catch an early flight. so i guess me, tj, prasnatch,and ray are co champs. Ghetto squad made it to the finals of worlds and an american finally won a real world championship. I saw alot of different decks and hung out with alot of good friends i havnt seen in quite awhile. If you got this far id like to thank you for reading my tournament report. I tried to remember as much detail as i could but an 8 hour drive sometimes makes you forget things. for those i met and my long distance friends ill see you guys next year.
