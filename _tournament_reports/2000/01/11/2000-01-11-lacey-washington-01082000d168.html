<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I attended the first tournement in almost 2 months in the pugent sound area this past saturday.  I rode down with the man himself, Mike Mikaelian, discussing movies and how 'The Matrix' is just incredible.  I've been busy, and due to unorganized chaos, I played the same decks I've had built for the past month or so.
<br/>
<br/>
DS deck:  You were expecting asteroid numbers (found off my member page)
<br/>
<br/>
LS: Leia goes all the way with Yoda v.2 (v. 1 found off my member page)
<br/>
<br/>
We arrive at 11:00, and comence waiting for a player to prevent byes.  around 11:30 I'm guessing, we start.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  DS vs. George Surplus HB/oops EBO
<br/>
I start Huntdown, he starts HB.  Okay, good, I got my 8 ships in the deck to pound on him.  well, to drains at Endor and Backdoor, and bunker, he'd losing Echo base troopers.  Well, he get's out the echo docking bay, 1st and 4th marker, and goes to play EBO.  Uh, excuse me I say, but you have to have 3 'echo' sites out.  oops.  'No wonder it did so well in testing yesterday,' he says.  I deploy stuff, and beat the tar out of his stuff, deploy 3 ships the urn HB flips, and probe the system.  Drains and visage kill him.

Game 2: LS vs. Mike Mikaelians Nasty TIE bomber deck
<br/>
After playing at work a few times, this deck always kicks my butt.  So I figured, I have to take a new approach.  Make him use his Bomber in space, to get the zeros out of his deck (planetary subjugation, overloads, collateral damage, and Dark path to ensure it.  Nasty.)  Well, Early on, I make one bonehead manuever, and he lets is go buy, and then I make another (I was playing on sheer nerves, I was really spooked)  Well, Mike being the nice guy he is, and telling me that If I win because of it, I'm walking back(kidding) lets me slide.  So, after a few turns, and some Bacta tank action(he is putting in shut him up. . . from now on) I start making him chase me between Milwakki and Death star, So I'm not losing to drains.  Some dudes show up on CC(did I mention it was a capture deck as well?) and start doing some @#$% with me.  well, with subtracting from draw, and sabre hits, and bacta tank, I'm able to take him out there, with a minimal loss of force.  I surprised him when I left his Ties open for a drain, and did a blind surprise assult.  After flipping, I searched my deck, got another surprise assult (retrieved it in the 10) and searched fro it with test 4.  that card prevented 3 turns of drain 2, and I slowly started to get control in battle (Han and luke in Falcon, flipping 10 every battle, and his 0's ran out so he could't over load me.  I eeked it out with my drain of 5 on CC.

Game 3: Lightside vs. Joseph Workman operatives.
<br/>
well, this game wasn't very good for him, the tun the operatives came out, I completed test 1.  The next turn, I lost test 3,4,5 and 1 other card, and then ompleted test 2, explained the ability 6 thing, and commenced a beating.  Tawass in the Audience chamber vs. ability 4, and Melas and Lando to 1 group of ops, and EPP luke to another.  I never lost another card this game.  when he did deploy 6 ability, I barriered 1 guy, then on the next tun, moved away an op.
<br/>
Battle damage killed him before I could flip and retrieve.

Game 4: DS vs. Mike Mikaelians 'Charles Open deck, only better'
<br/>
He deploys to the Theater canceling Visage early.  okay I say, Comehere you big coward, and decide, since I'm not worried about Visage damage, I'm going to go play with myself on Endor.  So Vader sets up camp, and down comes Tawas Kaa.  Battle, I draw 1, he draws 5, Vader goes bye-bye.  OOC played.... and he gets...drum roll please.... There'll be hell to pay.  hehe.  so I drop back on Tawas, kick some butt (not really, I needed to finally use 4-lom to cancel his immunity).  Ben shows up at toshe station, and I drop U-3PO there.  I end up draining at Endor System and Site for rest of game.

<br/>
Break time.  I order a mad ass order of Nachos from the Mexican resteraunt in the mall, mm, mm good!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting tired, and am thinking of dropping, to protect my 4-0 and get my rating up, but decide that's stupid.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS vs. Ryan Tebow HBX
<br/>
Okay hidden base, no problem, right, wrong.  Out of 8 ships in my deck, all I ever see this game is 2 dreadnaught and DIPO.  His X-wings run free in space, draining to there little hyper drives content, while I can't find a battel ground at all.  I end up putting PotF on the meditation chamber for a BG site.  Well, he puts a Ralliter captain on a ship, moves to kessel, and is getting prepped for returning.  but Sectret plans is out, so he can't do the trip just yet.  So, I have 2 cards left in deck.  I activate 2, drain on the executor 'Woohoo, put huntdown out of play!' he yells.  (and then cancel the drain)  pay 1, draw 1.  1 card left, end turn, lose 1 card to visage.  Game.  This game was a fluke.  It sucked. out of final 10 cards, my remaing 5 ships were there.

Game 6:LS vs. Ryan Tebows Huntdown deck...
<br/>
Okay, no TT'ed in opening hand.  He deploy's EPP Vader to the Moisture farm turn 1 (ends up being that he has 3 vaders in the deck, and 3 BG sites... Is this pure luck or what?)  Im my hand, I have an undercover, but no spy.  damn.  Well, I am thrown off my game so quickly here from his lucky butt start, and mine not having a spy, or TT'ed.
<br/>
<br/>
Ends up being that when I finally cancel visage, and knock out all 3 vaders, it was just to little to late.  He had the super musicians at my couple sites, and just knocked me out of the game.  I never even got to try jedi testing, due to Bad feeling start, and massive force

Highlights of the tourny.  My decks playing well first 4 games, and doing as they are supposed to.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights of the tourny, loosing on the basis of bad luck, draws, etc.  I can accept getting out decked, but out lucked is just bull.  3 vaders AND the sites.  And he got both!  Crap.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there is another 3 rounder this weekend in Lake City, so I shall redeem myself.  And then the Grand Slam a week after that, which I will win.(so I hope)
