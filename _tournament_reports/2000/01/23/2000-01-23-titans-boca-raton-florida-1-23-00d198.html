<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I hadn't played a tournament in about a month or so and
<br/>
I had this little pre-tournament party where I had Neal Razi
<br/>
, David Akers , Chris Schutz , Daniel Blackford , and Lee 
<br/>
Edwards over to play cards and mess around. I was messing 
<br/>
around and testing stuff but gave my buddy the deck I was 
<br/>
using in playtesting. I go to sleep at like 5:30 AM and get
<br/>
up at 10 AM. I'm addicted to NFL2K so I just threw together
<br/>
the decks I actually used at the tournament pretty quickly.
<br/>
With only 4 hours of sleep I was actually pretty charged up
<br/>
and ready. Quite a few funny scenarios like Harc Seff's 
<br/>
Armor saving his hide ;)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Deck intro :
<br/>
<br/>
LS - Throne Room thing  normal stuff , nothing really 
<br/>
special.Lightside decks don't deserve a name ;)
<br/>
<br/>
DS - 'Bittersweet Symphony' - Musicians with ECC and EJP 
<br/>
hate. I think I might've missed 1-3 cards that I sketched 
<br/>
for the deck but I couldn't tell. Used new EJP Objective
<br/>
<br/>
Sidenote : Lee leaves his decks at my house , my dad finds
<br/>
it and drives it to the tournament , we go back and look for 
<br/>
it at the house and hear my dad went to tournament , then we
<br/>
go back to tournament. So basically we force the tournament 
<br/>
to start 10-15 mins late. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : 'Bittersweet Symphony'  v. Eric Carbone's MWYHL
<br/>
<br/>
Court of the Vile Gangster nails him for damage. He starts 
<br/>
MWYHL and Goo Nee Tay.  I dump out like Lyn Me , Rystall , 
<br/>
and Boelo or something to retrieve my damage. He says 
<br/>
something like ' oh no , not musicians' hehe ; this might 
<br/>
be the only area in the World where you'll hear that phrase.
<br/>
He passes test one and two very quickly. He's giving me a 
<br/>
lot of force , I'm generating like 14 force a turn. 
<br/>
Basically I get Ak-Rev out and cycle through my deck for the
<br/>
musicians I want. He takes lots of damage from CotVG and the
<br/>
n deploys Captain Han Solo to the Casino. He plays CC Sabaac
<br/>
. He busts and I win the Sabaac. He leaves Captain Han there
<br/>
. I've got a pretty solid group of characters in the Audience
<br/>
Chamber. He draws up his active forceyou probably see the 
<br/>
picture hereElis ,  I drop Fett for free, Jodo Kast , 3-4 
<br/>
Musiciansincluding Rappertunnie. Hit Han with Fett so his 
<br/>
forfeit is 0 , spit and hit him with Rappertunnie so his 
<br/>
power is 0 : Sidenote - Lyn Me would've made his Total Power
<br/>
0 anyway. So its Scum 21 and Han 0 - absolute 0. 21 Card 
<br/>
units of Damage later he's pretty much dead. I have no lost
<br/>
 pile. Win by 29. Record :  2 ( +29 )
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : The huge battle.
<br/>
Lowlights : Smacking a newbie in his first gameat least he
<br/>
 recognized the decktype.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : LS vs.  Andrew Ledwith's Imperial Scrub deck  w/ interesting twists.
<br/>
<br/>
I get a huge jump on generation. He starts Death Star with
<br/>
Imperial Arrest Order.  He throws out Kiffex and I throw 
<br/>
down tough Falcon and spit out Order to Engage. He starts
<br/>
saving up. I'm paying 3 to drain him at Kiffex for 2 but it
<br/>
is worth it and slowly taking its toll. I Tunnel Vision on
<br/>
consecutive turns for 2/0 locations to start working the 
<br/>
advantage.  Murtoc Yine drops to my Farm w/ Jabba the Hutt
<br/>
and Normal Vader but he doesn't kill my Nudj. He Lateral 
<br/>
Damages my Falcon but Captain Han doesn't fear Damage he 
<br/>
laughs in the face of Lateral Damage. I Barrier him here 
<br/>
and there and Order to Engage and my Multiple destinies 
<br/>
( EPP Leia on Spiral , and bunch of other pilots there too )
<br/>
slowly take their toll. He deploys the CC:DTPlaza and I 
<br/>
throw Obi-Wan Kenobi there to finally get past paying 
<br/>
Battle Plan even though it isn't that bad. He throws Mara 
<br/>
down there and battlesI draw a 3 and Mara draws a 0. I get
<br/>
ready to unload on Mara. I deploy Luke , Wedge , Beezer , 
<br/>
Yoxgit . I swing but I miss her and I only draw a 1 , but he
<br/>
 draws a 0 so he has to lose Mara and 7 or 13 so Mara and 7 
<br/>
go down. I now have Battle Plan/Order Fulfilled so I'm pretty
<br/>
 much home free. He pays to drain at the Farm to hit off 
<br/>
some damage. Win by 26 I think. Record : 4 ( +55 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Winning .cracking jokes about Han not caring
<br/>
about Lateral Damage.
<br/>
Lowlights : Beating one of my buddies pretty bad.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 'Bittersweet Symphony' v. Brian Fein's Hidden Base Scrub guys.
<br/>
<br/>
	He starts HB and Insurrection. I deploy Mara Jade 
<br/>
with Lightsaber to Audience Chamber and he takes Court of 
<br/>
the Vile Gangster Damage for the whole game long. I 
<br/>
reinforced it with somewhat of a Musician theme to retrieve 
<br/>
with Rystall. I get out Scum and Villiany and he flips so I
<br/>
 go to probe. I've got the probing machineJabba's Cruiser 
<br/>
+ Jabba + Security Precautions + Outer Rim Scout. I throw my
<br/>
 fantastic fleet at him and probe it out in like 2 turns. I 
<br/>
make a huge mistake when probing though and Mist Hunter is 
<br/>
on the end of a beatdown that takes it an 18 force down. I 
<br/>
manage to retrieve a bunch with Scum and Villiany and 
<br/>
Musicians to do damage but Scrub Pilots add to drains here 
<br/>
and there. If I get First Strike I win this game . Also which
<br/>
 I didn't think of earlier is that I don't remember seeing 
<br/>
Battle Order all game longprobably one of the cards I forgot
<br/>
 to put in or something. Search and Destroy needs to go in 
<br/>
this deck tooLoss by 6. Record : 4 ( +49 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : not much
<br/>
Lowlights : no ground interaction at allI will revise this
<br/>
 deck to force interaction or else. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : My LS v. Daniel Blackford's Ominous Rumors deck	
<br/>
<br/>
	Well first turn I get 8 force. I deploy a 2/0 , drop
<br/>
 EPP Luke at his DB , and do a nudj thing. I hit him for 
<br/>
early damage with the docking bay drain. I get huge amounts
<br/>
 of generation and pretty much do things at will. He throws 
<br/>
Evax across from Luke and gets  Rumors out and moves Evax to
<br/>
 Bunker with Perimeter Patrol. Bothan Spy , Tawss , and 
<br/>
Beezer come in and knock Evax out of there. He gets out 
<br/>
Kessel and I put Red Leader in Red 1 out there. Order to 
<br/>
Engage is out and he comes back with a Dreadnaught and
<br/>
 Arnet piloting it. I 'React' with Spiral and get rid of 
<br/>
Arnet.  I deploy a Landing Claw on RliR1 and pretty much 
<br/>
stick him on the hip. Right now I've totally infiltrated 
<br/>
Endor Tawss , Beezer ,and Spy in Bunker ; EPP Luke , Harc 
<br/>
Seff , Yoxgit , and Jereon Webb at Docking Bay and Clawed 
<br/>
ship on Dreadnaught. He deploys the Bus to Endor and next 
<br/>
turn I 'detach' from the Dreadnaught and drop Loaded Falcon
<br/>
 against the Dreadnaught. I get Draw Their Fire and battle
<br/>
I kill the Dreadnaught for it and a handful after that. I 
<br/>
slide over and sit in front of the Bus w/ Loaded Falcon and 
<br/>
company. He drops  Igar and a pilot in a Blizzard Walker and
<br/>
 battles against Luke. I've got a lot of forfeit down there 
<br/>
and Smoke Screen to kick out the DS pilot. The Bus lands 
<br/>
after loosing 3 for O2Engage and goes with Igar in Walker.
<br/>
 I Rumble at the docking bay for a few turns in a row with 
<br/>
FS / DTF damage and characters dropping all over the place.
<br/>
 Eventually I knock off Igar and it's down to Vader. I have 
<br/>
Yoxgit and EPP Luke across from Vader. I TC a few cards back
<br/>
 and then use 3 to get a green card w/ Yoxgit. I grab Obi's 
<br/>
Saber. Drop Obi-Wan Kenobi and Stick with Luke and Yoxgit. I
<br/>
 hit Vader with a Weapon destiny of 11 , Glancing Blow , and
<br/>
 him drawing a 1 total destiny means he's down a Vader and like
<br/>
 15 force. Win by 28. Record :  6 ( +77 )? Somewhere in there 
<br/>
or so.
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Nothing.
<br/>
Lowlights : Slamming another apprentice , he didn't have 
<br/>
much of a chance.
<br/>
<br/>
Wrap up : I had a load of fun at this tournament and weekend
<br/>
just messing around with cards and stuff. David Akers won the
<br/>
tournament going 4-0 with a nice differential. I came in 4th
<br/>
with my record. I watch as Lee Edwards goes on an urge and 
<br/>
buys a box of Reflectionshe got some really really good 
<br/>
pulls though so it didn't seem like a wasted venture. There 
<br/>
was excellent prize support - Reflections and a bit of EJP 
<br/>
and ECC.  I get the Fett ECC pack and a Chewbacca Foil. My 
<br/>
friend Chris pulls an Artoo Foil , David pulled a Spiral foil ,
<br/>
and Neal pulled a Guest Quarters ( why ? ) foil. All in all 
<br/>
a really fun time.  I thought my lightside wouldn't do as 
<br/>
good as it did but it did okay. The Musician deck is looking
<br/>
 very strongswitch about 3-5 cards here and there and it is
<br/>
set.
