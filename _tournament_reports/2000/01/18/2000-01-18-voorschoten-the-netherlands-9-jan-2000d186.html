<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">	The 9th of January I went to the SW-tourney which was held in Voorschoten, together with Koen Meijssen and Arjan van den Broek. It was almost a month since we played in a tourney and Vooschoten is only about an hour travel away.
<br/>
	There were 14 people, which was nice considering this was the only 2nd tournament that was held in Voorschoten. Bas van Zuilen, the TD, convinced me to write this report (only it is now 15 january) so it's a bit late in the making.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	With the release of ECC, we were thinking of all the kinds of dark side decks that were possible; the light side was more of a problem however. Koen went with Ralltiir Ops (DS) and Meijssen-modified Martin Falke deck (LS) and Arjan with Corulag Ops (DS) and MWYHL with Big Power (LS). We were all pretty sure of our dark side decks, but not of our light sides. Here's what I went with:
<br/>
<br/>
	Light Side: Ralltiir Liberation: Because I believe Ralltiir Operations doesn't suck and in fact demolishes Both Ops decks. No EPP's, but plenty of deploy-2-aliens: Hnemnte, Sic-Six, RFC, Bothan Spies. Skyhoppers and Incom Engineers and Covert Landing to discourage anyhing the dark side puts on my planet. I used some Undercovers, TK-422, 3 ships and 2 landing claws.
<br/>
<br/>
	Dark Side: ECC-modified CCT Musicians. Uses Scum&amp;Villainy and First Strike to retrieve each time you battle. With CCT you don't get no funny tricks that convert your Audience Chamber and you can start with Surface Defense. With musicians, the sum of the whole by far exeeds the sum of the individual parts. On the ground, they rock. Aboard a ship, they are the ultimate forfeit fodder. Mostly you end up wanting to forfeit alot of them so you can retrieve them with S&amp;V. I also use some Bounty Hunters, ability 4 aliens and Outer Rim Scouts to top it all off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 -- Light vs Bart Ouwehands Ralltiir Ops starting Battle Order
<br/>
<br/>
	He deployed Coruscant and Med Chamber in his first turn. Ouch, now I have to take out my &lt;&gt; sites first, because he's got all the force he needs. By the third turn 6 &lt;&gt; locations were deployed to Ralltiir, with my forest and desert converted, and I had flipped my objective with 3 Ops, 2 Buddies and a Skyhopper with a Covert Landing in my hand. He tries to battle me on 2 locations but I manage to survive and from then on I fortified with Hnemte, RFC's and more Shuttles. 
<br/>
	He sets up Imperial Decree with a Dread at ralltiir and another ship at Coruscant. I used GL in Gold 1 with the Claw on his dread to go around Battle Order and Imperial Decree. 
<br/>
	There were some battles on the ground, but most if the time I ended up forfeiting one thing while he had to forfeit 2 things. It was a long game and just before time was called I won with 25.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 -- Dark vs Robin van Beeks MWYHL-Coruscant-Kessel drains
<br/>
<br/>
	He couldn't find his Yoda's Hut, so I got a chance to look through his reserve... I saw alot of GS Ywings, RS Xwings, Organised Attacks and the 3 high-drain planets. Early on I had the Audience Chamber filled with some aliens (Jabba, Greeata, Ak-Rev and some others) and Ability^3 and Scum &amp; Villainy out out and prepared my space force.
<br/>
	He deploys Kessel with 2 ships there, I counter with Jabba's Space Cruiser, ORS, Brangus Glee and a gaggle of Musician Forfeit Fodder. We battle back and forth, and I end up winning that battle when Bossk in Bus shows up. At that time I also set up Search and Destroy with a Presence on the Carbon Chamber. He shows up with EPP Leia and Obiwan at Carbon Chamber. I nabrun some aliens over from the Audience Chamber, deploy IG-88 with some more musicians, battle, capture his Leia and kill Obiwan for +17 battle damage. 
<br/>
	Now he's losing for 2 for drain (Audience Chamber got a Projection of a Skywalker), 2 for Ability and 2 for Search&amp;Destroy per turn, I'm losing 3 per drain from Coruscant.. Ended up winning with 15. Only at the end I remembered (was told) out that Resistance has another cool function that decreases drains to 2, Doh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 -- Dark vs Maarten Rosseau's Ralltiir Liberation Speeders with Anti-Musicians Tech	 
<br/>
<br/>
	No rebels means immedeate flip and a peek at his deck, but no Audience Chamber (essential card in my dark deck) the first turn. I start Battle Order, retreieve my Twi'Lek and start drawing well over 12 to search for my Chamber while he sets up for the flip. I get it 2nd turn after he flips. With close to 20 cards in hand I set up Audience Chamber with S&amp;V, Ak-Rev, Greeata, and start forming 2 battle-teams to go battle him on Ralltiir. One party where power was big, with Umpass and Lyn Me, and another one with Rappertunie (expensive battles) and Nizuk Bek. 	He did a retaliatory strike with Draw Their Fire and Flapped Speeders once on my Rappertunie team, where he had 38 power. I had to forfeit 4 musicians to cover the 20ish battle damage. After that I set up the Cantina with Kithaba, and put a presence on the Chamber. He tried to circumvent Battle Order by deploying Gold Leader to Ralltiir, but was battled away by Boba in Slave I (with a Dodo Bodonawieedo).
<br/>
	In the endgame I had a drain of 3 (farm, cantina and audience chamber) for free while he had to pay for each of his drains. First Strike and Draw Their Fire were both out so with each battle I retrieved 4 force while he had to lose 2. After he spread his forces (so I had no way of flipping his objective back) I initiated some battles with lone characters and that hurt him pretty bad... win by 25.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 -- Light vs Willem Sterk's CCT-Abyssians
<br/>
<br/>
	He didn't start Battle Order, so that was nice... I flip the thrird turn and he comes after me with a Abyssians task force. Luckily I manage to survive it and from then on I fortified my sites, taking care to place Sic-Sixes so that Elis couldn't hurt me. There were some battles but Careful planning and Speeders with the Engineer took care of the Abyssians. At the end I retrieved 5 with the Chimes, and won by 23.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 -- Light vs Koen Meijssen's Ralltiir Ops (starting Battle Order)
<br/>
<br/>
	Good, a matchup for which my deck is designed... Things do not go well, as I draw no ops for 3 turns so I couldn't flip, and draw no Hnemte's. He gets Kashyyyk and a 2/0 site and starts putting power on Ralltiir. Finally with a hand of 25 I draw Arleil (he can search for an op) and get my sites out and flip and the draining is on. He puts down a starfighter at Kashyyyk (the claw doens't work on that) so he drains for free. 
<br/>
	From that moment there were a lot of battles, moving to avoid battles and deploying stuff. Rebel Barrier gets Grabbed. Imperial Barrier also gets Grabbed. I think he also deployed a starfighter at Ralltiir and used Tarkin's Orders to cancel drains. I had to pay for drains, for deployment, and for fleeing from his Walkers. Koen deployed alot of stuff and battled alot and in the end I just didn't have the force to do the drains, and succesfully battle him away where needed. Mechanical Failiure on Tempest 1 with Igar was funny to see, though, but it wasn't enough. So I took a chance and deployed a ship to fulfill Battle Order. Sure enough, Lateral Damage and the Bus finish it off... loss by 9.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 -- Dark vs Willem Sterk's Bothiawui Ops 
<br/>
<br/>
	I start Battle Order and set up a little party (Jabba, Greeata, Ak-Rev) at the Audience Chamber with S&amp;V. He invades early with a Both Spy and ECC Chewie (anti-Stunning Leader tech), battles, misses Jabba and end up forfeiting him for battle destiny (i think). I fortify my chamber and draw abit so I have new characters. He was abit unlucky getting his ops because instead of flipping he deploys 2 Ops with some EPP's and aliens for defense. I deployed a starfighter at Bothiawui, and invade with Musicians, Nizuk Bek, J-Quile and start battling and retrieving. In the end the drains on the Farm, Audience Chamber and Bothiawui (for free) won me the game with 25.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	I ended up going 5-0 with 104 diff, Koen went 4-2 with 1 timed win (one loss to a speeder smackdown by Maarten Rousseau) and Arjan went 2-4 (strangely his only wins with his light side). Bart Ouwehand got 1st place, with 10 (113?) I got 2nd, Koen 4rth and Arjan 12th I think. All in all it was good to talk and trade with other people again, and play a game of course! Thanks to Pieter Heerma for corrections and suggestions... Next tournament,  Grand Slam in Bochum...
