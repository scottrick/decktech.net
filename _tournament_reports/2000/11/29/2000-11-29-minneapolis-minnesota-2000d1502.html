<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here is my tournament report from the Mirkwood tournament that Mike Raveling posted a report from as well.
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing BHBM for the DS with S/A Tramples and Imperial Command.  For LS I played a Twix manis and toys deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Vs. Chad Steger’s Rebel Strike Team deck.  I started and gor Ozzel in my opening hand, so at the end of turn 1 I have Emporer at his chamber, Ozzel at the DB and Rendilli out.  Chad activates and draws up.  Turn 2 I pull the Yavin DB and get a walker there with DS-61-something.  Chad acitvates and saves.  Turn three I look for Hoth DB not there, but Chimera is in my force pile, I draw until I find it, also get Watts, Marquand, Bliz. 1.  Chad activates and puts out madine and some scouts.  My turn I put out Watts Marquand and Ride at Endo Hidden Trail.  Chad put a couple more scouts out, and Luke and for the rest of the game chased me around Endor.  I put Vader and Tarkin at Hoth DB, and saved remaining.  Chad now has Lando Nien Nub and Gold Squad 1 plus Cracken in Tala 1 at endor.  My turn down comes Chimera plus Piett, Chirnaeu, and Cpt. Sarkli.  I battle, play Imp. Command to limit him to 1 and use Emp. Power to draw an extra, I draw 2 4’s to his 2.  I’m immune, he loses, Nien Nub, and tala 1.  His turn he moves Lando to Rendilli.  My turn I deploy Zuckuss and Bossk to rendilli, squash him like a bug.  thats game I win by 15.

<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
My LS vs. Josh Grace Vader vs. the world Hund down
<br/>
<br/>
Turn 1 he activates and draws, I activates, deploy endor, and home 1 DB.  He puts Potf there and draws all but 1.  I deploy luke w/saber to Home 1 Db.  Next run here comes Vader, but not enough to battle.  My turn down comes leia, battle Skywalkers.  I hit Vader, he loses vader and like 9 force, I lose Leia.  I saw 3 vaders hit the lost pile when he was losing so I thought uh-oh, then I drew my out of Commision, play it, not vader damn.  He activates drawsall but 2.  I activate, Drain, draw.  He activates, deploys Vader, battle I hit Vader, He hits luke, both die I lose 2 force.  My turn I activae search for a DB, Jedi Luke is in my force pile, I draw up.  He activates saves it all.  I activate, deploy Jedi Luke w/saber to home 1 DB.  He activates deploys Vader, attempts to duel, I sense, draw a 1 cancelled.  my turn.  I activate, battle vader, chop him up.  I win the battle, luke lives I draw Out of Commision, play it, get Vader YES.  then Josh says "Okay you win"  What??? he flips over his deck only character in it is Vader.  I win by 18
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Jerry Flynn’s old school JP EtE with capturing, vs. my LS
<br/>
<br/>
Turn 1 he gets oput all his sites, and deploys Dr. E. to the AC.  I activate deploy endor, Home 1 DB, and Madine to db, save 1 force.  His turn he seploys Fett w/Gun to back up Dr. E.  my turn, I deploy Jedi luke with daddy’s glo-stik, he plays none shall pass.  I sense it. cancelled, battle, swing at dr. e. hit.  He plays hidden weapons and captures Luke.  His turn luke is put into Jail.  The rest of the game was a battle at the dungeon to release all my captives (at end of all battle I had 3 in there)  I fianally free them with a bothan spy who lived through 2 turns of carnage to free everyone, I spread out through JP and drain him out.  I win by 21.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m 3-0 and have to play Mike R.  I beat him last week with this same deck, so I am hopeful that I can do it again.  Then he puts out X-wing swarm, that is the only weakness that my deck has, and he exploits it.  Mike wins by 13 (for a better review of this game read his TR. It was all sorta a blur to me, I was getting tired and wanted to go home).
<br/>
<br/>
Final review I went 3-1 and finished 2nd to Mike (a ranking I’ve had many times before).  But I had a lot of fun, and played some fun battle heavy games (damn Mike and his cheese:).  So it wa a fun Tourney.  and a final plea to anyone in MN come to these Tuesday tourneys.  It is a very fun informal atmosphere, and we will make you fell welcome.

the guy who just moved from ND and came to play anyways, just cause you went 0-4 doesn’t mean you can’t come back.

<br/>
Ben Johnson, He is our resident Newbie, he comes every week, and gets squashed, but we try to make it fun for him, and he always comes back.
<br/>
<br/>
