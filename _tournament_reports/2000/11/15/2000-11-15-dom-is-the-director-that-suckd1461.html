<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">OK, this is the first tournement that I was supose to be a director It is stupid, I should never had done that. So, the week before, there was a tournement at another shop in montreal, and 1 people show So I hope that because I have more friends, there will be much more people. So its Saturday, I woke up at 9 am just to make that f*cking tournement. So, I arrive at the card shop at 10 :30 , I am with my sister and my girlfriend. I see 3 person ! Wohoo. But wait, 1 of those person is a big fat Juicy Gamorean. He smell @#$%, he is fat like a potato, he is stupid, he is not funny, he think he is good, he got hugly long hair, his pants are jack by his small belt, and I suspect him for being homosexual. His name is Guy and he work at the shop. Now, the second big hamburger dude. This is the Owner of the shop ! He is stupid, he is really gay, he charge 25 cents if anybody wants to use his phone. And I remember when he said rules like, yon cant play in my shop with monnok ! your ban . Anyways, what a stupid b1tch. Ok, the 3rd person is Actualy a player ! Wohoo ! So we are like. Hmmm cool ! we only need 7 more person. So its now 11 am ( the tournement was supose to start at 11) and another small player show so I tell him, that the tournement will not be held. And I play a game against him. 
<br/>
<br/>
I play COTVG with the Sarlac VS His HB with X-Wing 
<br/>
<br/>
So the game start I drain on the ground, and he loose his force for search and destroy and the objective. He flip fast. On my next turn, I monok him lost 2 hyper escape, 3 organise attack, and 4 X-Wing he got barrier. I put Blast door control, BIHT, First Strike, ZIMH. Beatdown. FW + 30 
<br/>
<br/>
So now its 11 :25 and yet another player show. Yannick Lapointe. So, he tell me if I got the MYO japanese that I told him I would bring. He tell me he want him. I tell him I only let him borrow it, because MYO is a God he is desperate, and he start to cry So I made him a proposition he coudnt refuse. If he suck my @#$% 2 times and it was fun, I give him the Myo so we go into the bathroom, and he suck my penis. He was not really good, so I decide to keep the MYO He is really frustrated, and he ask me If I want tu f*ck him in the a$$. So I say sure ! anyways, His butt hole was too small, so I still kept the MYO . 
<br/>
<br/>
Now, he is really frustrated because his a$$ is hurting him. And he know he got annaly rape just for a Japaneses MYO he will never have, and he want to beat me at SWCCG . So we play a game 
<br/>
<br/>
My Light Side Dagoba Fallen Portal deck VS His MAD MYO deck 
<br/>
<br/>
The game start I cant do nothing, he drain me like a mad Its painfull to get jedi luke to jabas palace with none shall pass and no bargainFinaly Obi Wan and Luke are in the Audience Chamber. So he put alot of power and he got like 8 other force left he attack, I calculate his power, Ok, I wont play my narrow escape. @#$% hapen, and he draw 3 huge destiny at each +2 because of the objective  I lost 20 force FL (-44) 
<br/>
<br/>
Another game 
<br/>
<br/>
My Dark side HDADTJ DUEL without any battle ground only a POTF VS his EBO baraguin 
<br/>
<br/>
My deck is tech against him because I play CHYBC and he play only 3 battle ground .So the game start slowly. He put jedi luke to his endor docking bay I elis elrot vader from the north ridge, and play vaders obsession. Focused attack. His destiny is MEGA huge in his deck, mine are only huge, but I have 3 he start at 9 because its jedi luke, I start at 9 because of my lightsaber I draw higer than him. So thats game, I win. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, thats it, I am ready to go f*ck at my house but wait, another player come Its Alex Klamroth, thats cool, It has been a while since I play him. So he wanna play a game, I said, I was gunna go home, but ok. 
<br/>
<br/>
So, we start, I play My DUELER DECK, and he play QMC with SAC and MAIN and weird card. 
<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, fast game, I Put Vader and Tarkin by turn 3. He put obi wan sumwhere. I elis elrot, he play path of least resistance. I move vader to Obi Site. I play The Circle. He senses it. I grab. He Miss. He sense again. He Miss. I play Focus Attack. I Win the duel I then Set the emperor mara jade and evazan at another site, and Janus. He put leia. I think I Elis vader and tarkin, and he play Slight weapon Malfunction. But He still looses 15 force to beatdown FW + 30 sumthing 
<br/>
<br/>
After the game, we take a look at the people that play Warhammer, to reasile that they are all hugly, and dont care about their body smell/apperance. What a Bunch of Geek. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I am tired of playing, and I decide to go shop to Winner and then go home, to play a game on my Sega Saturn ! But before, we go to Mc Donals, and it seems that because of my Bleach Spiky hair, I am a attraction for kids anyways 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok I realise sumthing. Almost nobody play SWCCG anymore, and the only player that still play tournement here are me hmmmm, me, yannick,alex, and 2-3 more guy. Only the player that were good there is never new player and you know why ? ill tell you a story 
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to show SWCCG to my girlfriend, but before, 1 of my old friend ask me to show him swccg again. He had play when a new hope was just released. So I said ok, I will teach you So We play, and with all the rules, the errata, and all the @#$%, even if he had play before, it was too fu*king hard to play That Game is too much complicated !!!! Its almost imposible for someone that never play swccg before to like the game now. Look at magic, pokemon, the 2 game that there is the most people playing those game are basic, easy to play, its really nothing like all the complicated rulings of SWCCG . Actualy what I like about SWCCG is that it is complicated. And thats probably what all the good player like about that game, but its too much complicated to be comercial. Well thats my opinion. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you look at rating of player all top rated player got like 250 games, they start playing a lont time ago. I am the only new player that perform well at this year world championchip. And this is because despite what you might think, I really like that game, and I spend alot of my time thinking about deck, and how to improve my game skills. But I know that there is alot of player that are not as decicated as me to this game, they dont have as much time to spend, aspecially new player since they have almost no attachement to that game. So if someone buy a box af Starwars and try to learn to play, there is like 80% of chance he will try to play, but he will found out its hard to be good, and give up easily. I am competitive, so I like to win, so I never gave up, even when I was getting rape by the good player at that time. Thats why I think SWCCG will die soon because. There is much more player quiting than new player And I dont see what decipher could do to prevent that Its sad but I think it is that way. 
<br/>
<br/>
Its just my 2 cents 
<br/>
<br/>
Dom 
<br/>
<br/>
ps: Here is strategy for the guy that want some, so you cant put 1 star, and say, you got no strategy MEGA COMBO ! Artoo + Fire Extinguisher + Hero Of A Thousand Device + Order To Engage + Yorgit + All My Urching + CC: Casino + Lando Calrissian + Trooper Sabac + Cloud City Sabac = THE BEST COMBO EVER MADE !!!
