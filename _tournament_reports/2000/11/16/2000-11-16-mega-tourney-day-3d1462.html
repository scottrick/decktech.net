<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Wats up?  Jason Ayre again.  Day 3 mega tourney report. 
<br/>
<br/>
We get to the tournament at around 8:00.  I’m actually not that tired and really eager to play.  Casey tells me that he does not care about anything in his WB binder,  and that he could rip anything up and not care.  I point to Obi Wan, he goes no, thats like the one thing I care about.  I call him a pussey or something, he takes out the card, flashes it around, and rips it up.  People start trippin, and Clay Atkins? is all " Oh yah, this is going in my tr, crazy mormon sacrafices Obi wan to mormon god", ehehe it was funny as hell :)
<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to go with 
<br/>
<br/>
LS Vikatin Rin Rin Rin
<br/>
Agents/speeders, uses tessek as rep, and 4 bomars w/ chimes, to get hella mad drains, and if they come down, beat they ass. 11 Sandspeeders, and 9 rebel speeders, start insurecction/staging, and uses all sorts of tech like sandwhirl, boshuda/ote and lots of other bull@#$%
<br/>
<br/>
DS Why Jason Ayre is #225 and 1800 or whatever the numbers are
<br/>
<br/>
SYCFA/Scum deck, go check it out, great deck
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs???  
<br/>
<br/>
Cant rememer the dudes name, or what he played.  I was LS, and he was new, his deck wasnt focused on doing anything, I think he just threw his best cards together.  I was draining him for 9 a turn, game right there. 
<br/>
<br/>
Win By 27
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs ??? 
<br/>
<br/>
Ok I cant remember who I played, or anything.  All I know is that I won . And played DS.  Im in 3rd place now (yippee)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs ??’s Profit
<br/>
<br/>
Ok I remember this game, but not his name.  He starts profit.  I laugh hysterically inside my head.  First turn I convert JP and the AC (I started mara and evezan btw) I grab boelo? from rd, play scum.  He cant deploy any mains other than Master luke (no bargain) and I keep None shall passing him.  I move mara over, he comes down with like twass and melas or something and they get smoked eventually.  Search and Destry comes out, he deploys a guy at D*, so I basically win right there
<br/>
<br/>
Win by 30+
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning by like 37 I think it was
<br/>
Lows:  It was pretty boring
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Chris Shaner’s TDIGWATT/ CC Occupation
<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is his deck is TECH.  He throws down battle plan, grabs bespin (started downtown plaza), and gets CC occupation.  I get my drain of 6 set up at 2 sites, and he is draining me for like 5 with vader and saber and tarkin @ downtown plaza, and some mofo at some interior site (and bespin system), plus Im losing 2 a turn from cc occupation, so Im a hurtin.  I draw for my beatdown, I get a few speeders, man. flaps (incoms already on table)
<br/>
<br/>
So I deploy my flaps next turn, and draw like 5 more speeders (I’m playing 20.)  (Man flaps has to be activated during control phase)  Basically, if he leaves vader and tarkin there he dies, if he moves em, he dies cuz Ill be draining for 9 soon.
<br/>
<br/>
But instead he draws 1 by 1 all his cards, 2nd to last card, ALTER -- @#$% @#$% @#$%!
<br/>
<br/>
He alters my flaps, (o btw he reinforced V+T wit a bunch of fools)
<br/>
I litterally have 12 speeders in hand, they woulda been power 5/6 each :((((
<br/>
<br/>
So foolishly I go down, and get my arse beat.  And get bull@#$% ruling, speeders cant go to Bespin, CC WHY THE @#$% NOT????  There just like fookin cloud cars.  Anyways he drains me out.  Loss by 6
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing against a cool deck
<br/>
Lows: EVERYTHING, specifically my flaps getting altered :) Oh and being to stupid to realize I woulda won if I just lost the speeders to FD’s
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Vs Kris Lavigne?’s Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
I played him last night, and lost because I played a @#$%ty deck (chadra fans BLOW!), so I know what hes playing
<br/>
<br/>
I get my drains set up like 2nd turn,(drain for 6 @ 2 sites), he comes down, beats a bomars ass, and runs inside.  I signal for OTE, and he’s eating it the WHOLE DAMN GAME.  But I’m eating Visage the WHOLE DAMN GAME.  He duels my 1 luke, and game winner is, I’ve got like 7 speeders in hand, hes got vader/blizz 2 at some site.  ALTERS MAN FLAPS! DAYYYYMMMMMNNNNNN!!!!! Thats 2 now!  So he wins by 11!
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing a cool guy, him admitting that hes a lucky @#$% biznitch :)  Him accusing me of trying to cheat, then him trying to cheat the next turn ehehehe (was funny)
<br/>
Lows:  Getting SCREWED ANALLY
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 DS Vs Kyle Craft’s Foreign Hidden Base/On/Off The Edge Mains (cept the foreigns did it wit MWYHL)
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, Kyle tells me hes changed like 20 cards in his deck, and he was talking about the french canadian style of it (And Im familliar with the style since Ive played the deck), so I start Secret Plans, and Kyle gets pissed :)
<br/>
Basically, Mosep and Gallid go down to JP:AC 1st turn.  I none shall pass 5 times this game, get BFHI out 2nd turn so hes paying like 9 for obi, 12 for jedi luke and 8 for EppHan/Leia.  He keeps trying to come down wit Epp Obi, and that costs him 9 force, I none shall pass.  He has very few cards to draw.  I monnok used him once, all the while hes losing 6 off the top everyturn.  The game is over within 10 minutes.  He does eventually come down, but I use the Ezvan / Disarm combo to take out luke and then beat the @#$%nit out of Han.
<br/>
<br/>
Win By 30+
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing Kyle Craft, hes a badass, and beating the player who took 3rd at worlds this year and is number 3 in the region (or is it 2?)
<br/>
Lows:  Beating Kyle again, and knocking him out of final confrontation (he was 4-1 going in vs me)
<br/>
<br/>
So I end up at 4-2 and 90 or so differential
<br/>
I take 6th
<br/>
<br/>
Standings are
<br/>
<br/>
1st Brian Hunter 
<br/>
2nd Kevin Shannon (HUNTER VS SHANNON FINAL CONF AGAIN! GAY!)
<br/>
3rd Chris Shaner??
<br/>
4th ????
<br/>
5th Kris Lavigne
<br/>
6th Jason Ayre (me)
<br/>
7th Tim Guzzman
<br/>
8th Kyle Craft??
<br/>
<br/>
After all this, is the funny @#$%.  Were in the final confrontation room watching the final (for full info read Hunters report), but everyone in the room is makin all sorts of smartass comments. I cant remember all of em but the funniest ones were,
<br/>
<br/>
Kevin shannon was taking HELLA LONG TURNS, everyone was literally clapping when he did something.  He must have counted his force pile 800 times. (the game ended up lasting 1 hour 45 minutes NO @#$%) 
<br/>
But it’s like silent, Kevin Shannon has just counted his force pile 3 times and Clint Hays is all (in some @#$%ed up waterboy voice) "M-my names Kevin Shannon, I-I like it when its my turn cuz it gives me a w-woody." It was SO @#$%ing funny. (sorry Kevin it was funny as hell though :)
<br/>
<br/>
Then some little girl is walking around the room outside where the watching was, Brian hunter just beat kevin down for 15 cards @ Kiffex or soemthing.  Somehow, there talking about Jesus.  The little girl comes up and goes "Jesus died for our sins."  And Jay Webb Goes "no, Jesus just layed the smackdown at kiffex for 15." lol, that was funny as @#$% to.
<br/>
<br/>
Then on the way home, were in like hickville utah or something, at MCdonalds drive through.  The dude hands us our Big macs, says Heres your big macs, then he hands Casey 2 pennys, and hes all "Heres your cheeseburgers."  The guy is standing RIGHT THERE, and caseys all in some weird @#$% voice, " He called the pennys cheeseburgers, WHAT A @#$%ING DUMBASS."
<br/>
<br/>
