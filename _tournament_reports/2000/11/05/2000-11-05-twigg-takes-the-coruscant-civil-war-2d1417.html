<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It all started on Friday 11/3, Michael DAmboise and Ted P. were saying up at my
<br/>
college and then we were off the next morning to Syracuse for the second Coruscant
<br/>
Civil War.  The last to Coruscant battles [Civil War I and the Battle of Midway]
<br/>
were won by my bro Chris little twigg so he was Teds pick for victory.  When the
<br/>
guys arrived we did some play testing and it really felt good to play again, first
<br/>
time since D-Con I really touched my cards.  So mike is playing with palace raiders
<br/>
and baraguains, not a bad deck, but he loooooooooooved it.
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing Twigg Scum, with choice cards like all wrapped up and the Sarlac
<br/>
yes, the sarlac!  For light (Thank you Aaron Kingery!) I was playing a Hidden Base
<br/>
mains deck with retrieval via Our Most Desperate Hour.  Both decks were play tested
<br/>
only a few times, but I felt very comfortable with them.
<br/>
<br/>
So after watching 2 episodes of Jackass on mtv, we slept, woke, and headed to
<br/>
Syracuse.  When we arrived the sewage company was pumping out the card shop,
<br/>
Altered States sewage.  It smelled like a big pile of a-s-s.  But we had stopped at
<br/>
Mc-Mobile and so we all needed to use the facilities, those hash browns always get
<br/>
ya!  So the shop finally lets us in and I make the dash for the bathroom.    Then
<br/>
people slowly arrive.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the big guns were World Champ Matt Sokol, his bro, Dan (great player!),
<br/>
2100+ ranked Chris Twigg, Steve Brenston (w/E-ore, Bongo was retired), Chris
<br/>
Praskac, Michael Daulton, 00 Regional co-champ Pat Ziagos, wonder boy Scott
<br/>
Lingrell, and a lot of other cool guys and gal (Kim of course!)
<br/>
<br/>
The tourney
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Light vs. Brad Kippels (1854) Big Blue Space
<br/>
<br/>
Starts Set your course and he sets up in space fast and starts dropping systems.  I
<br/>
grab dbs and Dagobah and the hut and draw.  His turn he drops chimeria with
<br/>
chienerau, admiral orders and some shmoe  ay Kassyyyk.  I drop Jedi luke and stik
<br/>
to d* docking bay so no emperor, and Obi and stik at Tat Db to drain.  From here
<br/>
there really isnt much to talk about.  He drained, I drained and retrieved with
<br/>
our most desperate hour.  I messed up once and thought too quickly moved before I
<br/>
deployed the effect, and the AWSEOME sportsman that brad is of course he didnt let
<br/>
me do it.  (ive only played him how many times???)  Anyway, the fact that he
<br/>
started battle order screwed him over b/c he could stay at the d* db, I had OTE out
<br/>
and Jedi luke was hitting everything.  So leia in the falcon evades the star
<br/>
destroyers and I pull out the victory.  Bu the teck move of the game was when he
<br/>
had 1 card in hand and 5 force left, (looking to put back to pay for battle order)
<br/>
he plays Imp Command search for an admiral and finds Ozzel, woo-hooo ozzel has now
<br/>
won me my last 2 games (see d-con team event game 4). FW 9
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+9)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning a close game and hitting the Emperor.
<br/>
Lows: Forgetting that retrieval once, could have lost me the game glad it didnt.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Dark vs. Chris Janiaks (2023) Weird Operative HB.
<br/>
<br/>
I pull jabba the hutt to the AC and grab my db and set up court.  He starts
<br/>
deploying systems and looks like he is gonna flip.  So Im digging for security
<br/>
precautions.  Im set up and gailid is doing his thing Ive got a drain for 5, and
<br/>
he is hitting me for 1 here and 1 there.  But then drops operative, speeder,
<br/>
desert, sandwhirl.  Hmmmm im like , what the hell?  He sets up these operative
<br/>
drains on 3 systems with their respective ops and Im getting nervous.  So I spread
<br/>
thin and jump to space, I drop security precaution for pure fear factor.  If he
<br/>
flips, his matching pilots will get their drain bonuses at their systems, but he
<br/>
cant cancel my drains, Hutt Influence, and I would, could probe, and either, battle
<br/>
the hell out of him and retrieve w/ scum or probe correctly and he looses 9 force.
<br/>
So he never flipped and scum saved the day as I controlled a sandwhirl, battled and
<br/>
fought in space, retrieved 9 he lost 3, and that made the game.  I drain him out
<br/>
and my obj does him in. FW 3
<br/>
<br/>
4 (+12)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Barriering his spiral when he reacted hahahaha.
<br/>
Lows: Nothing, good game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Dark vs. Dan Sokols (2032) Y4 mains
<br/>
<br/>
He went 1st dropped 3 2/0 sites and drew.  I set up jabba the hut, grabbed a db and
<br/>
drew, had a barrier so Im ok.  He drops more 2/0s and draws.  I solidify the AC
<br/>
with ephont mon and boelo and draw a bit.  He finally comes to tatooine at the db.
<br/>
I send over a mob squad and sit.  His turn, disarmed jedi luke and dr e went to
<br/>
town.  We fight back and forth on the ground, I never captured anybody so the
<br/>
sarlac never saw the light of day.  Mid-late game he dropped kessel and the tantive
<br/>
with epp han and anh Chewbacca.  I immediately follow with jabbas cruiser, ors,
<br/>
and mara jade.  I play defensively and sit.  He deploys wedge , I barrier him, and
<br/>
epp leia.  Damn!  But he doesnt battle either, my turn I drop bosk in bus and some
<br/>
guys for forfeit.  On the ground we continue to chase each other.  In the end scum
<br/>
and villany and gailid finish him off.  The palace remained secure.  FW 15
<br/>
<br/>
6 (+27)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Scum working like a charm.
<br/>
Lows: Playing someone who lives 3 miles from my house.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Light vs. Josh Paternitis (1904) Bring Him B4 Me
<br/>
<br/>
He pulls emperor and dbs.  My turn I grab Dag, hut, home 1 db and put jedi luke
<br/>
there for mega activation.  His turn he activates draws.  I do the same.  He then
<br/>
drops Lord Vader to Endor Back door.  So Obi and stick hit the tat db and Jedi Luke
<br/>
runs over with Obi.  His turn he drops temp 1 igar and a guy at the Endor db.  My
<br/>
turn Lando with Vidbo, cowboy wedge and techo join at the tat db, bouush goes
<br/>
undercover near vader, and Obi makes a retrieval run.  At this point most of the
<br/>
damage was me sensing all of his interrupts, altering his reactor terminal and my
<br/>
retrieval.  Vader and the walker show up at the tat db and luke joins his father.
<br/>
We play cant and mouse for a bit until 2 climatic battles at the endor Db.  His
<br/>
turn he battled I excluded dr e. and he missed his swings both our destinies suck,
<br/>
but he losses some fodder.  On my turn Blount, ackbar and Chewbacca join the mix.
<br/>
I hit vader, excluded boba fett (also fired at him, woops!) and drew my tracked 6,
<br/>
6, 5.  He lost 26 battle damage.  Game.  FW 19
<br/>
<br/>
8 (+46)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Amassing 56 power.
<br/>
Lows: Playing Josh.  I like josh.  Firing at Boba Fett after he was excluded.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point there are 2 undefeated.  My bro took out Daulton, so it was up me
<br/>
and
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Dark vs. Pat Ziagos (1908) Cloud City Mains
<br/>
<br/>
Same old, same old, jabba the hut to AC and I get a db.  He drops a site (his only
<br/>
one the entire game, leia quarters and grabs bespin.  I secure the AC with ephont
<br/>
mon and boelo and then it gets fun.  He drops epp obi down misses his swing, I
<br/>
cancel his destiny, obi to bubbly tank.  I set up at the sarlac pit with mara and
<br/>
boba and good ol dr e (I have sarlac in my hand now and Im dieing to use him!)  So
<br/>
my obj and search and destroy are eating him away.  He throws guys down, we mingle,
<br/>
no biggie.  My drain with gailid is keeping me ahead.  Jedi Luke finally busts into
<br/>
the AC and clears me out.  Jabba runs, but 4lom has general solo to show for the
<br/>
loss.  I drop solo at the dungeon for 2 force and head to the sarlac woohoo!  The
<br/>
game is close, but my damage and scum would have won it out.  But instead the
<br/>
sarlac, after missing obi 3 times, munched on solo, I got back 1 he lost 8.  A
<br/>
drain or two later, game over.  FW 23
<br/>
<br/>
10 (+69) ß I won a prize from ted.  Guess why??  ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: SARLAC!
<br/>
Lows: None, good game!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 Light vs. Michael Daultons (1988) Bring Him Before Me
<br/>
<br/>
This game was over from the 2nd turn.  I need my retrieval or else I wont win.
<br/>
Turn two, he monnoks both my Home Ones away.  Well good game.  Now let me see how
<br/>
close I can make it.  There were no real climatic battles.  Vader took luke, that
<br/>
dealt him damage, and Order to Engage helped as well.  Melas and Boshek stood their
<br/>
ground against DLOTS with a tracked 6 but he never battled (he knew it was
<br/>
there).   We skirmished, and in one last attempt I threw orrimarrko  down with
<br/>
Melas and boshek infront of hmmm the dark side.  I lost.  FL 13
<br/>
<br/>
10(+55)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Melas has balls of steel.
<br/>
Lows: Home One where are you?
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7 Dark vs. Chris Praskacs (2132) Profit
<br/>
<br/>
This was the best game all day.  Not only was it battling, battling, and battling.
<br/>
Chris was talking in his Bastian voice.  It was awesome.  But as the game started
<br/>
he said he lost an OTE in his last opponents deck.  So, (Brad listen up!) I let him
<br/>
go get it and add it to his deck.  Nothing but love of the game! (I think he found
<br/>
it in his deck box, but still) Anyway we beat the hell out of each other.  Scum
<br/>
was on the table maybe 2-3 turns, he altered it.  I grabbed his. (yoda stew, not
<br/>
ghkk.).  And well we fought.  The sarlac ate crackn and Chewbacca.  Jedi Luke and
<br/>
Ben were disarmed and operated (Chris was like, **** dr.e is the best guy in the
<br/>
game no?!) Haha.  It was a great game with battles.  He sensed my kool interrupts
<br/>
like hidden weapons.  And bouush block my drain at the lower passage but characters
<br/>
and retrieval did him in. FW +22
<br/>
<br/>
12 (+77) ß I won another prize by ted, see if you can get this one? Hint compare 77
<br/>
and 69.  ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: His Bastian Wilkeans impression. LOL Chris is the MAN!
<br/>
Lows: Only seeing Scum on the table a few times.  But a really good game.
<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 people with 1 loss.  Dan Sokol, Daulton and me.  I already played
<br/>
Daulton with these sides so.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 8 Light vs. Dan Sokols (2032) The Beast (Sorry, oddly enough I remember
<br/>
little about thins game)
<br/>
<br/>
Well Dan knows my deck, I didnt realize it was the beast until I verified his
<br/>
deck.  So I set up with mains.  I tie down the sense (by end of game there were 6
<br/>
under the tie down.)  So were going back and forth, back and forth, drains and no
<br/>
real battles.  Im draining him at the death star 2 sites and in space, he
<br/>
dominated the home one docking bay (ballz!) and on Endor and at Hoth db.  I send
<br/>
orimarrko, cowboy wedge and techo, weapon lev mara stick and marko does 2 direct
<br/>
damage.  Im trying so hard to make him battle home one, so I can forfeit it and all
<br/>
his guys at the home one db to die, but hes too smart for that.  Late game he hits
<br/>
me with anger/responsibility.  Im screwed.  I draw, loose 4, get an alter.  I
<br/>
alter anger, (wrong card! Should have altered responsibility).  Anyway, dan also
<br/>
made a small error and didnt move to block my drain with vibro axe lando.  His obj
<br/>
and my drains kill him.  FW 2
<br/>
<br/>
14 (+79)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning a tight game.
<br/>
Lows: Almost losing a tight game!  Dan played masterfully, I give him props!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Well Ziagos beats Daulton (OOCd his vader) and so I take home the Civil War Crown!
<br/>
<br/>
The dinner was great and now for the standings.
<br/>
<br/>
