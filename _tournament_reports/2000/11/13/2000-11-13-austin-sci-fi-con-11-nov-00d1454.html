<br/>
Have a sense of humor and enjoy. This is kinda long But that’s the way it goes.  This
<br/>
tournament was held at the Austin Sci-Fi Convention. David Prowse was there along with
<br/>
Aurra Sing. I’m not even going to try to spell her name, but we all know who she is. 
<br/>
There was a Klingon Cutlery booth, a booth where you could sign up to join the Padawan
<br/>
society ( Great , a religion based on Ep. I, what’s next Jar-Jar in SWCCG, ARGGH too
<br/>
late.) and all sorts of toy mongers and scalpers. We had a modest turn-out of 10 people or
<br/>
so. Chris Gregg was there sporting photos of his cross dressing fetish again. This year he
<br/>
was Aurra Sing. He even gave her a photo that he had signed for her. It was quite the
<br/>
thing to see. Chris kind reminds me of Doctor Frankfurter in Rocky Mountain Horror
<br/>
Picture Show, now that I think about it. Brian Brimel was our outstanding TD, as always.
<br/>
Decipher was behind on prize support,  so he graciously donated some EJP and Enhanced
<br/>
cards for prizes along with a Rebel Gamers of Texas T-Shirt.  
<br/>
I was playing a Court of the Vile @$$ deck that was similar to Steve Lewis’s except that
<br/>
he wins with it and I don’t. Should have left the Rancor in. For light I was sporting a
<br/>
Train to 6 deck that has served me well in the past with a 7 on test 5.  
<br/>
All numbers and names are to the best of my memory as I am horrible with them. Brian
<br/>
will have the exact numbers and was played in his TD report later. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 LS Vs BJ’s construct the DS II
<br/>
<br/>
He seemed very new to the game but was a nice guy. I start the usual training stuff BPlan,
<br/>
Wise advice and the way of things. He played the DS II starting interrupt that lets you put
<br/>
down Moff J and other crap. He was kind of enough to give me enough force to dump
<br/>
DOS and Yoda along with the backpack and yodas hope on the first turn to the training
<br/>
ground. I start with the training ground because I can get my tests into hand so I know
<br/>
where they are. Battle plan prevents him from draining and he deploys some sectors. He
<br/>
has some trouble finding TTO while amassing a the whole Saber squadron at Endor.  On
<br/>
my second turn, pass test 1, deploy jungle, deploy test 2 and ask him if he wants to move
<br/>
it. His turn more sabers, a capital and kessel and maybe Sullust. Turn  I pass test 2 deploy
<br/>
test 3 at my same site and pass it due to WOT and then deploy test 4 at the bogclearing
<br/>
which I had just deployed next door. At the landing platform EPP obi and EPP Luke and
<br/>
clean out Jerejjod and another scrub. Move over to test 4 and it’s his go. More ties drain
<br/>
me at Kessel and finally TTO is all set up. I don’t remember how I lost Obi, but he
<br/>
deploys EPP vader, Igar and Tempest 1 but has no force to battle. Hmm doesn’t look
<br/>
good for just Luke. I hold an On The edge.  So I’m not worried. My loss pile is steadily
<br/>
building as. I fury Vader, sacrifice EPP Luke and wait, In hand I have Wedge, RSL, RLin
<br/>
R1, GLiG1, Home one and the Falcon He moves the DS to Kessel. Great , 2 force loss.
<br/>
That’s what one of my ICBW is for. I just ignore , lose a little more force and set up test
<br/>
5. I use Electrobinoculars to check my destiny. They are great tools for the tracking
<br/>
impaired. Also they are anti Sim and Broken Concentration which can mess tracking.  I
<br/>
have a hard enough time counting how many  trekkie freaks walk by to be bothered with
<br/>
tracking. I hit test 5 with a 7 and am set up for test 6. I retrieve 10 , the on the edge for 6
<br/>
and 6 again (22 retrieved). I ignore his drains at Sullust , Kessel and TTO. Pick up
<br/>
daughter and go to Endor to attempt Test 6. I deploy Han and Wedge in The Falcon. With
<br/>
Test 3 and Yoda at his hut, I am immune to attrition of 8. Cool. GLin G1 flies cover. Test
<br/>
6 is passed in 7 turns. Now the fun starts. He attacks my Falcon with his meager fleet of 4
<br/>
Sabers and 1 Capital. I show him the true meaning of Super Falcon as I announce a power
<br/>
of 34 with an attrition of 21. Test 6 reeks of coolness. From here you can see how the
<br/>
game goes. Leia drains on Endor. Home one comes out in space and I proceed to beat him
<br/>
into a pulp more lifeless than anyone on the WCW roster. But not before I retrieve
<br/>
another 12 cards.   FW 2(+27)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs- Han, wedge and Falcon. New superfalcon. Retrieving 34 cards. 
<br/>
Lows- Starfleet officers that won’t let people touch their phasers?
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 DS Vs Jacob Meyer(?) Deadbolt 
<br/>
<br/>
Great , this could hurt. If you don’t know how this deck works, go read Clint’s post or
<br/>
look in the top 10. Even if you do, court just bends over for it. He gets around none shall
<br/>
pass by deploying to the pit, sets up under the shield with Figgy, Oola and Tala 2 and
<br/>
Blunt. It happens fairly fast. Luke and obi roam Tatooine,   Scum and Villainy is doing
<br/>
it’s Matt Lush impersonation (Stuck rotting on the others side of the planet.). This was
<br/>
bloody. At least I made him lose some force. In an effort to retrieve some, I throw
<br/>
ZuckussIMH  and DIPO against Lando and Nien in ride. Due to my great force generation
<br/>
, or lack of, BIHT stayed in hand. Zuckus canceling his destiny was bad. It allowed my
<br/>
guys to hang around and get beatdown by Home One and Nien who he exchanged for a
<br/>
docking bay. resistance slowed him down but it was only a matter of time. Somehow I
<br/>
only lost the game by 17. 
<br/>
<br/>
FL 2(+10)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs-- Me when I decided to play Court of the Vile @$$. Seeing deadbolt in action.
<br/>
Plenty of time to go the bathroom between games. 
<br/>
Lows-- I was raped so bad I hope I can sit for the next game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS
<br/>
Reid’s Agents in The Court/Elom -- Uh-oh, Do Or Do Not, Yarna and 1 other I don’t
<br/>
remember.
<br/>
<br/>
This is not a good matchup. Reid is young but a good player. Swarms are his specialty
<br/>
and are not to be taken lightly. I had taken out the rancor pit and rancor and regretted it
<br/>
this game. He show Tanus as his rep and the fun begins. Bo shuda Uh-oh all hit the table.
<br/>
He deploys a huge number of sites. Tessek and Rennek in the Chamber. No planets so my
<br/>
Bounty hunter ships become fodder. He wipes my forces out even after I capture Figgy
<br/>
and Master Luke. I had Boushh at one time but EPP’s and eloms freed her, too. The real
<br/>
low came when it was still close and he gifted a Bantha droid. I had Ephant in the
<br/>
chamber to repel Tanus and Artoo but he does nothing for Bantha Droids. That was a
<br/>
sweet move to pull.  That hurt. -2 to destiny and 1 to drains with my whole deck. I had no
<br/>
way left to hurt as he used barraging table and his objective to cancel my few meager
<br/>
drains. A late nar shadda for 5 sealed it at 16 cards. 
<br/>
<br/>
High-- He traded for an Artoo after the tourney, so I won’t be so embarrassed begging
<br/>
gifted next time. He deployed allot (?). Elom swarm with mains is even better with
<br/>
Agents.
<br/>
Lows--Bounty hunter are weak in power against swarms. Mara is allergic to Eloms. 
<br/>
Unless people fear you based on you name, court sucks. That and this objective gets bent
<br/>
over by agents. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS
<br/>
I’ve played this guy at the last 2 tourneys and I can’t remember his name.
<br/>
VS BHBM --IAO, nothing else exciting as it didn’t affect me and I can’t remember.
<br/>
<br/>
He starts slow but puts out a few cloud city sites. I ignore him for the most part as he
<br/>
waits to put Vader down. As I test I decide to pick a  few spots. He is only draining me
<br/>
for 2 a turn so, I’m not hurting there. I had drawn an EPP Luke and pitched him to a
<br/>
drain. Luke then visits Lando and Lobot and clears the casino. He play  Real hero , so
<br/>
Luke dies to attrition. Sound fair to me. I play more aggressively this game. Skipping the
<br/>
boring training details, I deploy Obi and blunt to his throne room to drain and he starts to
<br/>
move Motti and some scrub from CC to get to them. Vader comes down, I give him Luke
<br/>
and a Fury to go with it. 3 fore a turn is great.  But by dropping Vader and a tie at CC
<br/>
sector he Set up dark deal. Nice idea but too many cards. He moves Luke and Vader to
<br/>
the Interrogation room and plays Aiii, Aaa!! Aiigh!! to make me lose 2. He used a few
<br/>
cards that I haven’t seen too much. Against a profit deck he pulled off All Too Easy and I
<br/>
also saw a We’re the bait.  I notice he is pitching sabaccs, so I ‘m glad I killed Lando
<br/>
early. After flipping Test 5, GLiG1 clears the sector, Twass Khaa (13 power with test 5)
<br/>
kills a lone  Mara Jade. Vaders is at the Throne room with Emperor, so I can’t move Leia
<br/>
to do Test 6. He attempts a duel which I lose 3 force for and On The edge the rest of my
<br/>
life force back to win by 32
<br/>
<br/>
Highs-- Twass Khaa laying the smacketh down on Mara Jade. I heard she likes pancakes.
<br/>
He used alot of cool CC cards that I haven’t seen for a long time. Or at least since the last
<br/>
prize support. 
<br/>
Lows--No Test 6. My @$$ still hurt because I know I have to play court again.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
<br/>
TJ’s Blow up the Bunker. 
<br/>
<br/>
This game did not go well for him. I draw Scum in my opening hand with EPP Fett,
<br/>
Mara, Dr. E and Hidden weapons. I just draw and make him lose to my objective, waiting
<br/>
to pounce. An early skirmish at Endor hurt him as Iggy in ship, DIPO and ZIMH beat
<br/>
down Leia in Liberty. He loses both but ditches the liberty to used. I draw a few more and
<br/>
wait. He finally deploys a dressialian commando, a scrub scouts, and General Solo at the
<br/>
back door. I bring down the crew. Hidden weapons Solo, captured, shoot with EJP Bossk,
<br/>
Capture another, Mara slices another, Dr. E operates and 4-Lom cancels the lone
<br/>
Commando text. From here it was drain and spread. Win by 30 
<br/>
<br/>
Highs-- Court still sucks, but rebel strike teams that blows up the bunker sucks worse. 
<br/>
Lows-- Beating a new player to the scene twice. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 LS
<br/>
<br/>
Ted Woodward--HDATJ
<br/>
<br/>
Jacob is undefeated and has won the tourney and everyone else has 2 losses. This game is
<br/>
for second place. Ted is always a lot of fun to play and the trash talking starts
<br/>
immediately. He always plays a space huntdown so I know it will take him a few turns to
<br/>
set up. His turn he deploys a Kessel and Sullust and the DS docking bay. Cool. I
<br/>
obviously need to shuffle better next time as my hand was full of test 1,2,3 but I did get a
<br/>
trans Terminated(One of 3 I play) No Visage for him. Since he started no escape and
<br/>
made my Honor worthless. Test 1, Yoda and DOS all come down. We exchange
<br/>
decorating tips as he tells me how to deploy my dagobah sites and I tell him he need pink
<br/>
drapes in the Holotheatre. He just draw and draws while I test. He drains for one with
<br/>
Lord Vader at the DS docking bay and that is it. I test away and eventually he puts down
<br/>
the Executor with Adm Piett. That drain will be ICBWed several times. And that is it. He
<br/>
puts a presence of the force of Sullust and has a huge hand. I’m not sure what he is doing
<br/>
as he draws almost half his deck. AFA eats at him 3 times while I test. When I do flip,
<br/>
that’s when the fun starts. Leia goes to the docking bay with test 6 and EPP Luke to meet
<br/>
her destiny and passes. He comes at the dynamic duo with Igar  and whoever he could
<br/>
muster. He puts all sections on alert canceling my EPP swing. That’s okay because he
<br/>
draws 3 ones for destiny and his saber. Needless to say 14 attrition clears the site. I set
<br/>
about destroying his fleet in space when he makes a great play. He offers to let me take a
<br/>
move back so I can shuttle over the Falcon on home one to his Executor and I think a
<br/>
Bounty hunter ship. He reminds me that the Falcon can transit with Home One as I only
<br/>
had one force left. Thinking he just wants to roll over and die, I oblige. Sucker. I was
<br/>
feeling a little too @#$%y. He lat damages Home 1, and play Imp Command to give me
<br/>
one destiny. Grrr!! Wedge sucks up the damage. It was a good move and I fell for it. He
<br/>
drew multiple destiny because of his bounty hunter ships but they all sucked. Yoda at the
<br/>
Hut and -1 ate him alive.  But that’s okay, because I On The Edge my lost pile and have
<br/>
no hard feelings. I come back swinging harder than a drunken Jackie Chan and finally end
<br/>
the game. I didn’t even have to hit him with a chair. It was close a few time. Boy do
<br/>
people stare when you jump up and slam your chair shut , making a lot of noise
<br/>
threatening to put some one through the table. Go figure. 
<br/>
<br/>
Highs-- Playing Ted is always fun. Imperial Command rocks. 
<br/>
Lows-- I hate beating some one by over 35 cards but I don’t make the swiss rules. And
<br/>
now I have to listen to Ted complain about how he should be able to duel a trained DOS,
<br/>
again. My head hurts already.  
<br/>
All in all it was a good day. I ended up in second and tok home the shirt that said
<br/>
MWYHL/SYIC on the back. That might be considered irony for all the English Lit
<br/>
majors. 
<br/>
<br/>
Props--
<br/>
Jacob for winning and not beating me worse.
<br/>
Aurra Sing for being a babe
<br/>
Brain for running another great tourney. We actually finished ahead of time. It was great
<br/>
that he kept things running. 
<br/>
Everyone I played for being great guys.(Except Ted for being sneaky, that’s okay, because
<br/>
my wife wants her money back)
<br/>
Chris for not playing. Too busy looking for dresses with Aurra. 
<br/>
Personal Hygiene-- Showering and shaving is unknown gamer tech.
<br/>
Reid for gifting a Bantha Droid
<br/>
<br/>
Slops--
<br/>
Court Of The Vile @$$-- For making me play it and sucking worse than the natural born
<br/>
thrillers. 
<br/>
David Prowse--For being a biter old man who charged Ted twice to sign each side of his
<br/>
giant HDADTJ. 
<br/>
Trek fans that won’t share their phasers or the soap. 
<br/>
Decipher for being behind on prize support. </font></td>
