Hello All!!!
<br/>
<br/>
    It’s been a while since I’ve written one of my reports. It’s also been a while since I’ve played in a Star Wars tournament. I did play in the Phoenix Grand Slam, but I was so busy helping direct, that I wasn’t able to remember enough of my games to write a good report. Basically, I did very poorly at the Grand Slam. =( I’ve also been playing a little Youbg Jedi, but I won’t go into that. =) Well as it turns out, there’s a tournament this week back in Tucson, so it looks like I’ll get a chance to get out of my personal slump.
<br/>
<br/>
   There’s a new director in town who wants to start running regular tournaments on Sundays. So I head on over to Hardcastle Comics and start waiting for people to show up. I see a few familar faces, including Jon Franke and Patrick Gimber who haven’t been to a tournament in a long time. I met with Nick, who’s the new director, and help him out a little with getting started. Then Nick started calling out the pairings...
<br/>
<br/>
LS - Yavin IV Mains and Toys
<br/>
DS - "Brandon Allen’s Big Pimpin’ Down on Tatooine" Deck
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
DS vs Mike Parker’s Tatooine aliens deck.
<br/>
<br/>
   This was the first time I’ve met Mike, and I guess that it was his first tournament also. I started with My Kind of Scum (Ephan Mon) and my 3 effects. He started with only Jabba’s Palace: Audience Chamber. I got set up quickly with lots of activation coming from Jabba’s Palace sites, and Passenger Deck. There isn’t much to really talk about with this game. He would deploy a lone alien, and I would beat it with my characters. Full win by 34.   2(+34)
<br/>
<br/>
   After the game Mike and I talked about what he can do to improve his deck an strategy. I told him a few things he could do with his current deck to improve it without changing it greatly and I traded him a Tessek to help out too.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
LS vs Justin Beal’s Ralltiir Operations with Biker Scouts
<br/>
<br/>
   Justin and I play on Tuesday nights and I know this is going to be a tough game. Justin started with Ralltiir, Bike Scout Gear, Imperial Decree and Imperial Arrest Order. I started with the Throne Room, Farm and Swamp. First turn I deploy a Nudj to both the Swamp and Farm, and I draw up. For his first turn he deploys a Swamp and Sleen to Ralltiir. After a few turns I set up Melas in the Falcon at a Revolved Ralltiir and Ben Kenobi with his lightsaber at a revolved Obi-Wan’s Hut. He flips with Biker Scouts at the Forest, Jungle and Docking Bay and Zuckuss in Mist Hunter at Ralltiir.
<br/>
<br/>
   Ben Kenobi drains for 3 a turn, and I start sending Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight to battle on Ralltiir. Luke, with Anakin’s Saber and Threepio battle Sgt. Elsek and another biker at the Docking Bay. Unfortunately, I’m drawing poor weapon destiny, and I can’t clear the site. Next turn Boba Fett in Slave I and ZiMH battle my Falcon, but the forfeit of the characters is enough for me to survive. (Melas goes to the Bacta Tank.) He battle a few times at the Docking Bay. Eventually, Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and another Sgt. Elsek come to battle. I hit Vader this time, and he played High Speed Tactics to get an extra destiny. He’s drawing huge destiny with Ralltiir Ops flipped, so I have to sacrifice Threepio to the Used Pile and Luke goes lost.
<br/>
<br/>
   I was able to retrieve Anakin’s Lightsaber thanks to Draw Their Fire. So I eventally deploy Melas to the empty Jungle and another Jedi Skywalker to the Forest. I play Gift of the Mentor to grab Anakin’s Saber again. I ’Sense’ his react, play Courage of a Skywalker, and clear the site. (Flipping his objective back.) He ends up moving character in front of me to block my drains, but then Han w/ comes to the Forest and beat up on a lone Mara Jade. Full win by 19.   4(+53)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
LS vs Patrick Gimber’s That Thing’s Operational Deck
<br/>
<br/>
   It’s been a long time since I’ve seen Patrick in a tournament. So all I can do is wonder what he’s been working on during his absence. He starts with Endor Operations, and Operational as Planned to pull the Death Star II, Moff Jerjerrod and Desperate Counter. In my hand I get Momar Nadon, and Obi-wan w/ so I plan on a quick invasion of the Bunker. First turn I deploy a Nudj to my swamp, move it to the farm, and draw up a few. I get Jedi Skywalker and Anakin’s Lightsaber. During his first turn he deploys Moff Jerjerrod, the Death Star II, Desperate Counter, Combat Response, and the first Death Star Sector.
<br/>
<br/>
   Momar Nadon and Luke deploy to the Bunker to battle. (Missed with my lightsaber again!) Be has to lose the site and 5 more Force. After that, I had a drain of 2 for the rest of the game. In the battle damage he also loses a couple of his star destroyers. He tries to useCombat Response to get some pilots in TIEs to Endor, but he keeps missing his pilots. He does finally get Baron in Saber 1, DS-181-3 in Saber 3, and the Thunderflare. I revolve Endor to lower the drain, and deploy Obi-wan w/ to the Cantina. Admirals Chiraneau and Piett deploy on the Thunderflare. He keeps sending the Emperor’s advisors to knock Obi-wan to the Bacta Tank to keep me from draining him at the Cantina.
<br/>
<br/>
   Eventaully, I het Han w/, Chewie w/, and Leia w, and Threepio on the Falcon to battle Saber’s 1 and 3. (The Thunderflare had moved to Kessel to back up Scythe 1.) I draw 4 destinies, and sac Threepio to cancle one of his. I clear the site. Unfortunately next turn he deploys Saber 4 with the TIE cannons to hit me lost. After that, it turns into a drain race. Keep getting Obi-wan sent to the Bacta Tank, but he’s losing characters. I search, but never find my Demotion. Both Force piles are getting low, but eventually Obi-wan stays at Cantina and I’m able to spread out and drain away. Full win by 5.   6(+58)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
DS vs. Patrick Gimber’s Rescue the Princess Deck.
<br/>
<br/>
   Well, as the pairings turned out, I get to face Patrick twice today. Before our first game Patrick told me he would have rathered played his Light Side against me. As it turns out, he gets his chance. Because of a timed win on another game, Patrick is still in second place and a win could give him the victroy. The magic number is 14. (I can lose by no more then 14 and still come in first.)  I start with My Kind of Scum, Oppressive Enforcement, You Cannot Hide Forever, and Power of the Hutt. He started with Rescue the Princess and Goo Nee Tay. I had Mara Jade, Lord Vader and the Emperor in my starting hand. First Turn I pulled my locations to huge activation and drew up. We spent a few turns of drawing up and saving Force.
<br/>
<br/>
   He deploys Luke w/ to the DS Docking Bay and moves over to the Detention Block Corridor. I deploy 4-LOM w/, Lord Vader and Ephan Mon to battle Luke. Destiny clears Luke off, and I forfeit 4-LOM w/. Next turn he deploys another Luke w/ to the DS Docking Bay. I deploy Mosep, Galid, the Emperor, Presense of the Force, and Overseeing it Personally to the Audience Chamber. Kal Fal joins Luke, and they move to the Detentiion Block Corridor. I deploy Vader’s Lightsaber on him and Mara Jade to Jabba’s Sail Barge at Jabba’s Palace. I battle and hit Luke. We each draw a 1 for battle destiny and only Vader is left standing. I get Mara Jade her saber and I start draining away. Obi-wan w/ deploys to the Docking Bay. I move Vader over and play The Circle Is Now Complete.
<br/>
<br/>
   Lando w/ Blaster Rifle deploys and moves over to the Detention Block Corridor. (Freeing Prisoner 2187) He deploys Han w/ to the Docking Bay and moves Leia and Lando over. I battle and ’hit’ Leia. Attriation gets Lando. And I forfeit Vader to over battle damage.  Next turn her deploys another Prisioner 2187 to the Yavin Docking Bay and moves over, to flip his objective. He’s running low on Force, and I’m paying to drain, thanks to Battle Plan so neither of us is deploying. Secret Plans and a well timed Imbalance ruin his Death Star Plans retrienva. I spead and drain at Jabba’s Palace. I send Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith to battle Han and Leia at the Yavin IV: Docking Bay. A tracked 4 chokes Leia and battle damage is enough to all but kill him. Next turn he draws up. Full win by 16.   8(+74)
<br/>
<br/>
I came in first for my second straight local tournament. I’m very pleased, not just because I won the tourament, but because I actually finished better then 50% in one day again which I hadn’t done in a while. Jon Franke came in second, and Justin Beal came in third. I donated Cloud City packs so everyone would get some prize support, and I got 6 pakcs of Death Star II for first place. (Luke’s Lightsaber was the only pull I needed.)
<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank Nick for running the tournament. He did a great job, and I look forward to getting to play in more of them. I want to thank Hardcastle for hosting the tournament. It looks like they’re both committed to starting up a regular tournament schedule in town which will be great. Thank you to all my opponents for great games, and thank you to everyone else for a great tournament. I hope to see all of you at a tournament soon.
<br/>
