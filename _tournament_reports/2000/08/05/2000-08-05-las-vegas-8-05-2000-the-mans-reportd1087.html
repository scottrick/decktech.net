<br/>
<br/>
        Starting out I recieved a phone call from Dan Christy about a cool deck idea for light that would suprise the local dark side players.  He said "John you should think about playing ops everyone thinks its dead and no one will expect it."  I took his advise and built a bothan ops deck.  I had already built a R.T.P. deck and it looked good, but thanks to Shane Watner I decided not to play after being killed by his Bring Him Before Me deck.  My dark deck (R.Ops) I had already set on but needed to make one change to, thanks to Matt Berta for helping me with that.  And I can not forget about Noah Singer.  He provided laughter and amusment to last a life timefor those who know what I am talking about...Bananna Pie.

The Tournament :
<br/>
<br/>
(Of course we have to arive late...Matt Berta.)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: 
<br/>
My Bothan Ops deck vs. Justin Abdallah's Endor Ops deck
<br/>
<br/>
	I managed to get a quick flip and at two sites have Ithorians for a drain of 8.  Justin followed closely behind with deploying bikers and bikes to endor locations.  Then some star destroyers endor with the objectives effects.  With my objective flip his drains in space were cut down.  As a last turn attempt to win Justin trys to block my drains with scouts, it was a good try but I still had the victory.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: Draining for 8 on the thrid or fourth turn.
<br/>
Lowes: Forgetting to put in a traffic control
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+21)
<br/>
Currently 2(+21)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : 
<br/>
My R.Ops deck vs. Robert Corabett's Elom Docking Bay deck
<br/>
<br/>
	This game was doomed from when I first saw the eloms.  Luckly I was able to flip my objective canceling most of his drains.  Slowly I began to weaken those damn power four eloms reaking havok on my planet.  He was able to flip my objective back towards the end of the game and thus draining me out of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: None
<br/>
Lowes: Those damn eloms
<br/>
<br/>
FL ( -13)
<br/>
Currently 2(+8)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 
<br/>
My Bothan Ops deck vs. Brad Bedlion's Endor Ops with Death Star II deck
<br/>
<br/>
	This I thought was a good game.  He had tons of space and drain locations.  He got off that things operational making me lose two force a turn. I got my objective flipped and started draining.  We exchanded battles wining losing and then finally I pulled out a win.  In a short amount of time I might add.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: Hitting lord Vader with a saber
<br/>
Lowes: Getting drained in space for four then losing two to that things operational
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+21)
<br/>
Currently 4(+29)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: 
<br/>
My R.Ops deck vs. Matt Berta's Hidden Base Tatooine Celebration deck
<br/>
<br/>
	One good thing about this game is that the night before I had the honor of play testing against this deck, so I knew the deck.  I started out slow, but flipped with authority.  I had a tempest Scout and two pilots at one site, Tempest 1 and Igar at another, and Vader with Moff at the final location.  Then I stocked up in space with dreadnaughts and pilots.  After a lot of battles and force loss I finally drained Matt out of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: Matt battling with jedi luke and boushh and me drawning a six for destiny then adding two to attrition killing luke, then battling boushh killing her and making him lose 9 force.
<br/>
Lowes: Putting two At-St pilots on tempest scout two then finding out that only one adds to power.
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+28)
<br/>
Currently 6(+57)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: 
<br/>
My R.Ops deck vs. Chris Hines' I can save him deck
<br/>
<br/>
	This turned out to be a close game, but Chris had me beat from the beginning.  I was able to flip and it helped out alot.  I did end up Getting luke with vader but then was shortly beat down by a huge mob of characters. He was able to basically drain me out of the game, but if I would had made some better moves I think I could have won that game.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: Drawing a destiny of ten (Thanks to the objective)
<br/>
Lowes: Not putting in an Alter for Order To Engage
<br/>
<br/>
FL (-5)
<br/>
Currently 6(+52)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: 
<br/>
My Bothan Ops deck vs. Chris Hines' R.Ops
<br/>
<br/>
	Again I have to play Chris (WTF?).  I was also doomed from the start. Chris pulls out Empires New Order and basically just rips apart limb from limb my Ops deck.  I did flip his objective back but sadly I could not keep it flipped.  Chris had my number, he drained, battled, and basically had the perfect counter to my deck.  I think Chris named it A Perfect Counter To John Spadora's Deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Highes: Chris never got the Emperor and Overseeing It personally to work
<br/>
Lowes: Chris retrieved 2 force every time I lost an operative
<br/>
