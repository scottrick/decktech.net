<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Just to set the stage, Mirkwood hosts a Star Wars tournament every Tuesday night (well,
<br/>
except for holidays) for a mere $1, and each tournament typically draws 12 to 20 players.
<br/>
Owing to the frequency and low expense of the tournaments, theyve become great
<br/>
opportunities to play new, strange and fun deck ideas while, simultaneously (owing to the
<br/>
presence of such players as Jim Li, Michael Ravelling and Graham Neal), providing
<br/>
chances to meet some stiff competition.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, on to the rest of the report:
<br/>
<br/>
The Star Wars tournament at GenCon was a dismal experience for me due to the number
<br/>
of rounds (I knew Id leave early as soon as they announced it was 8 games), conflict
<br/>
with other events, sloppy play on my part during one game and a miserable encounter
<br/>
with some fellow who was blatantly cheating. I dont mind losing, but I really dont like
<br/>
playing against someone whos a bad sport or arrogant or just plain obnoxious. This
<br/>
fellow was a terrible sport.
<br/>
<br/>
But I did learn a bit about the meta game, post D*2. I hadnt brought a very good DS
<br/>
deck with me to the tournament, then, and I wanted to integrate the new cards more fully
<br/>
into my deck. Docking Bays &amp; Mob Points seemed all the rage with the BHBM
<br/>
objective, but I didnt have an Emperor. It idea occurred to me, though, to use the 0 side
<br/>
of the Court objective to search for docking bays (instead of IAO, saving me one effect
<br/>
slot), grab Hoths and Yavins, and I could play Imperial Decree (because I love that
<br/>
card).
<br/>
<br/>
So, I threw that deck together without planning to flip it, but I realized a Profit deck
<br/>
could spoil it as it was. I threw in a couple of Trap Doors, the Rancor and its Pit and
<br/>
tested the deck against my LS Training deck. It won 2 out of 3 with Search and Destroy
<br/>
cutting out a good chunk. And it was only a Tuesday night tourney, so that was good
<br/>
enough for me. It would be, at any rate, a fun deck to play, and thats what I was really
<br/>
looking forward to--fun--especially after my sour tourney at GenCon.
<br/>
<br/>
LS: MWYHL, Training Luke through Test 6.
<br/>
DS: COTVG, pull everything from the reserve deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS vs Chads (dont know his last name) BHBM.
<br/>
<br/>
Chads a good guy and seems to play more for moral victories than tourney points. He
<br/>
once played a super-weird trooper deck against me using that interrupt that prevents all
<br/>
movement if he draws a destiny lower than the number of troopers on the table. It almost
<br/>
worked, too. Anyway, I expected something of that style when it turned out he was
<br/>
playing pretty much a straight BHBM mains &amp; toys deck. Though I have to credit him
<br/>
with the idea of using the D*2 anti-ops effect (you know: occupy their system, kill their
<br/>
deck...) to ditch it to retrieve the top card of his lost pile. (It ended up retrieving the
<br/>
Executor for him--which never came into play.) I just waited for Vader to show up and
<br/>
deployed HOTJ which, with Battle Plan, slowed my force loss to a manageable amount
<br/>
while I sped through my tests to flip. I eventually flipped but got only a 4 since I had
<br/>
mis-tracked my 7s, and I still had a couple of force left in my lost pile. He was sitting on
<br/>
Endor with Vader and Mara holding two sites. I left Vader alone and pulled Farmboy
<br/>
Luke back from Dagobah to set down Jedi Luke and Obi w/Saber vs Mara. He removed
<br/>
Luke from battle with You Are Beaten, but Obi hit Mara for enough of a loss that the
<br/>
game was decided. I controlled his Endor system with a multiple-destiny drawing ship
<br/>
and he had to pay to drain for 1 each turn with Vader.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+14)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS vs. Jerome Flynns Profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you can probably tell that this game was decided by a couple of battles. He hit
<br/>
Mara hard with Jedi Luke, early on, for some damage from my life force, but then he
<br/>
Nabrunned Luke w/Saber and Proficiency over to face Vader. Vader then showed why
<br/>
hes still the baddest dude in the galaxy when he Levitated away Lukes 4-power stick
<br/>
and then proceeded to target and hit and beat up Luke (with the aid of Blizzard 2) for
<br/>
something like 13 extra force from the reserve deck. Of course, I had started Secret
<br/>
Plans, so this was a bit of a problem for Jeromes deck, and, in the end, he never flipped.
<br/>
I continued my piddly drains and pulled off a win by 22. Or something like that. All the
<br/>
differentials in this report are estimates.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 4(+36)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS vs Michael Ravellings scrub beat-down
<br/>
<br/>
Michael had some EPPs in there, too, but he lost a lot of them to early damage (Mara,
<br/>
Fett w/Blaster and Dr. E vs Leia w/Blaster--hit, lost; Chewbacca--hit, lost; and
<br/>
Orrimarko). So he was left to play most of the game with characters like Melas and 2/2
<br/>
pilots. However, he must have been playing 4 or 5 Out of Commissions because they just
<br/>
kept hitting me, and I couldnt for the life of me draw one of my two Hell to Pays. Jabba
<br/>
quit for good, then Fett, and... just when he showed up in my hand (typical)... Vader.
<br/>
Uggh. That was killer. So I was left to face his seemingly endless hordes of weenies with
<br/>
the likes of Tarkin, Igar (and wheres his walker?), Dr. E in Blizzard 2 and ECC IG-88.
<br/>
But Iggy proved to have what it took when Michael plopped down Han w/Blaster, Wedge
<br/>
and Momaw to drain at my &lt;&gt; DB on Tatooine where my Iggy was sitting all by his
<br/>
lonesome on the other side. My next turn, Iggy Snipered Han (capture) used the text on
<br/>
COTVG to search for a DB and saw this his weapon destiny were all quite high, initiated
<br/>
a battle, fired to send Wedge scurrying back to the used pile and beat up on Momaw. I
<br/>
moved Iggy over, flipped my objective and started drawing for a Trap Door. Eventually, I
<br/>
drew one along with my Rendili (I had opted to search for the Executor earlier since
<br/>
Michael started Rendez-vous Point w/Insurrection, Strike Planning and Squassi). I
<br/>
plopped down the Rancor Pit, Rancor and Rendili w/Zuckuss (he didnt really have
<br/>
enough force to beat me up there). I dropped Han to the Rancor and expected a quick
<br/>
feeding, but Michael played Fallen Portal--and missed. Han had only stunned the Rancor,
<br/>
who then gnawed on the famed smugglers bones, dropping Michael to something like 5
<br/>
or 6 life force, which quickly disappeared.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 6 (+62)
<br/>
<br/>
I had won that last game by 26 or so, my biggest of the evening, but when the pairings
<br/>
were called out I was on the same side as the player with the highest differential. Oh,
<br/>
well. My LS deck was fairly solid, but I didnt expect that I could win by much.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 (last game): My LS vs Garretts (great guy, dont remember his last name) Ties
<br/>
<br/>
He sacrificed his drains for the first few turns, allowing me to go straight through my
<br/>
tests. He didnt drain until he got out Kiffex and a sizable fleet there. I ended up flipping
<br/>
with Artoo in Red 5 as my tracked 7 and paid 10 to retrieve 6 or so. My next turn, I asked
<br/>
him what his power was at the system, what it would be after he played All Power to
<br/>
Weapons (and I had a grabber waiting for that one), and checked to see how much force
<br/>
he had saved (a lot). I had Home 1 and EPP madness--Han, Leia and Chewie--but only
<br/>
enough force for Han, Chewie and Life Debt. Yet, considering my destiny of 28, I would
<br/>
still be up by enough power at the start of the battle that I didnt figure I would lose by
<br/>
too much. So I battled and he reacted and played All Power, which I grabbed, and I lost
<br/>
Han and Chewie and one or two more from my deck. But he had all his ties there with no
<br/>
capital ship and, thus, no hyperspeed, so I moved Home 1 over to Wakeelmui. The next
<br/>
turn, Home 1 cleared out Wakeelmui with another Han and Leia, I think, and I Altered
<br/>
his SFS. With Aim High in play, things were looking good. I had a good armada of ships
<br/>
in my deck, including the Gold Squadron 1 combo, and we just kept battling according to
<br/>
my calculated terms. Garrett managed to pull off a moral victory when he blew away the
<br/>
Landos Falcon with a Tie Laser; he needed a 5 and got it. Ultimately, however, 2
<br/>
damage each turn from Test 6, Battle Plan and my space armada--which deployed at
<br/>
systems other than his space armadas--secured the victory for me by 13. Or thereabouts.
<br/>
<br/>
So I managed to go undefeated through the tournament with a differential of something
<br/>
like 75, which wasnt very high, at least not for our player base. But Herb Macy, who was
<br/>
sitting at the top table, must have had a squeaker, because I ended up getting first ahead
<br/>
of TWO other undefeated players. Another kid, Jon, had gone undefeated, too. But I
<br/>
knew he had won one game by a mere 4 since a crowd had gathered (with permission, of
<br/>
course) to watch his game when it was the last game running (2nd game in the
<br/>
tournament, I think).
<br/>
<br/>
At $1 a tournament, any prize support is really nice, especially when you pull the Spiral
<br/>
in your one pack of Special Edition.

PS   After the tournament, I played a game with one of my friends, Justin Alfs, whose
<br/>
EBO deck with Rogue speeders ended up killing me by 6 or 7 force, causing me to
<br/>
rethink DS space--five bounty hunter ships and the Executor just arent enough... </font></td>
