Ok,  sorry it's a little late.  I wasn't going t write a tourny report because it wasn't the greatest of tourneys(only 10 people showed up, framingham usaually has 20+).  But then I realized that all the poeple who usausly attend these tournaments would want to know what happened so here goes:
<br/>
10 people showed up, among the notables; Hayes Hunter a 2000+ player, Brian C, Steve Baroni, Paul M and other good(1700+) players showed up.  Steve Brentson, Mike Hawley, And Eric Hunter didn't show up.  The Reason Eric didn't show up was he was punished for throwing his parent's lawn mower into the woods...go figure.
<br/>
I don't think Steve Brentson was punished by his parents, I think he was just lazy.
<br/>
I felt pretty good about my decks, My dark was a ral opps deck but with alot of SAC to help defeat profit.  My LS deck was a dagobah do nothing cheese deck with the super falcon and super red 5.
<br/>
 Game 1--My Dark(ral opps) vs. Steve Baronis' Rops killer.
<br/>
Go figure, I play a anti rops deck in my first match.  He started yoda's hut, the m.points for light side and insurrection.  I started my usual, You cannot hide foreevr, IAO, and oppresive.
<br/>
The way his deck ran was that he pulled docking bays got mad activation, and then got ben and jedi luke to wherever the action was(in this case ralitiir).  He also ran lots and lots of eloms and super falcon.
<br/>
The game started out pretty good for me, I got flipped pretty earlly, he came to battle me early on with epp leia and a elom but failed to inflict much damage.
<br/>
I was draining him on land for a few a turn, but then he got ben, jedi luke and about 4 eloms down to ral.  He the deployed order to engaghe and followed my guys  around, i continued to lose three to OTE, and drain him for around 2-3 pre turn.  eventually i got kashyyyk out with ZiMH but a few turns later he drops the super falcon(i wasn't expectin this.  I got beat up for a few force.)
<br/>
evetually i alterd his OTE.  We battled a few times on ralitiir, he flipped me back.  But in the end it was my own kashyyyk and his super power on ralitiir that cost me the game.  I probably could have won this had i played better but his deck was real, real hard to beat.  full loss by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  fun game, my deck pretty much doing what it's supposed to. 
<br/>
Lows. losing, playing a deck targeted to beat mine.
<br/>
<br/>
 Game 2--my light vs. Steve Baronis BHBM w/12x 7 destiny cards and counter assaults.
<br/>
Noy much to say about this one.  quite possib;y the lamest game i've ever played.  he got dark lord of the sith out first turn, i got out yoda and u. fury out my first turn.  That was pretty much game.
<br/>
I AFA'd him about 5 times, i lost 1 force per turn for not having luke on table(he kept force lightening him!)  I pulled off my tests and locked down his drains. honor helped a ton.
<br/>
He eventually drew up on me because he was getting bored, i had a hand that was the size of kansas. Full win by 6.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: winning.
<br/>
Lows: i suck because i play the lamest deck ever.   u. fury is still a broken card.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-- my rops vs. James ????'s endor scouts.
<br/>
Thois game was pretty much a classic rops wrecks the rebels game, i flipped second turn, he had an armada of ships at various systems during the game, but his low destinys to my rops enhanced high destinies won me most of the battle in space, he never tried to invade ralitiir, and i had the emperor w/overseeing it personally out.  I was draining for 5 pre turn, To his 0.  
<br/>
He eventually got some scouts to endor and drained for a few.  I evetually drained him out.  Full win by 24.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Everything.
<br/>
Lows: nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4--My light vs. Michael Rodriguez's Court/scum deck.
<br/>
Now mike is my friend, and me and his brother ben came to the tourny together. We've played this matchup tons of times, and while mike's court deck is very good, it doesn't stand up well to my light.
<br/>
Ok, he deployed jade to the chamber, i got out the super falcon and wedge to kessel pretty early on.  I inserted a bunch of times, dropped projections wher he was draining, and used it could be worce and we're doomed t cancel most of the damage.  He never came to space to abttle, i draoned him out at kessel.  Full win by 9.
<br/>
Highs:  Winning.
<br/>
Lows: beating my friend who was currently in 1st place.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5--My Dark vs. Mike's TISGIH speeder beatdown deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I play mike again, this isn't good for two reasons, one i don't want to play him again, and two, i built the deck he is playing and know how to beat it.
<br/>
Ok, he started with some effects, i started draining n ralitiir and flipped early, he deployed manuevering flaps, i captured luke with vader and altered his flaps, that was pretty much game right there.
<br/>
He never won a battle, I drained him out at ralitiir and in space, he made various attempts to invade but without the flaps he was helpless. Full win by 25.
<br/>
Highs: winning. altering his flaps.
<br/>
Lows: beating a friend.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6-- My light vs. paul moholic(sp?)' rops.
<br/>
This is the game my ls actually did something. The game started out typically, he flipped early on.  The weird thing is this, i started battle plan, and he payed to drain for all of his drains for 1.  Because of this my AFA's poped up pretty quickly.
<br/>
We had both lost around 10 force, when he decided to drop ZiMH, and another ship to ralitiir and fett to carida.  On my nest turn i dropped luke in red 5, and wedge in red sqd. 1. battled, cancelled his destiny, darklighted spinned mine, i won the battle, he had to lse fett plus 11, and i dropped legendary starfighter.  that was game, i drained at kessel some more, he got some drains off at ralitiir but he was losing too much.  Full win by 11.
<br/>
Highs: Luke and wedge taking care of business.  My light actually doing something.
<br/>
Lows: nothing.
<br/>
So I go 10(+60 something).  That's good enough to get me first place ( Yayyy for me!! My first tournament that i won!).
<br/>
Hyaes Hunter got second, we never played so that was pretty lame.  All in all it was an ok tourny. Hope more people can come to the next one.  
<br/>
