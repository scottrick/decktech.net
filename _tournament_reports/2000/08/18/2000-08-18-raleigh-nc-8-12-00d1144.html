<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> I hear there&amp;#8217;s a sealed deck going on with the new Death Star II, so I gotta go since it&amp;#8217;s the first one in the area. It starts at 10, which sucks for me because I just hate getting up early. But I manage to do it and get to the card shop by 9:50. I get to be LS, which I&amp;#8217;m happy about since I think it has the advantage with the pre-cons. We open up our pre-constructeds and switch our packs but there&amp;#8217;s more people coming in randomly since a couple people thought it started at 11 even though the little hand-out calendar says it&amp;#8217;s at 10. So we finally get set to play our first game at around 11:30.

<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: vs. ?&amp;#8217;s Random Things (1500)
<br/>
 Sorry I forget his name, but he was new and I&amp;#8217;d never seen him before. I could tell he was new because we read off the phases on the back of the DS2 Rulebook. He had a problem with having 4 ability at a site, so I just put 4 ability at all locations and cleaned up his side of the table. I was tracking A Few Manuevers around a couple times, and he thought that tracking was cheating, so I explained how it wasn&amp;#8217;t (which other people also told him) and how you do it. There was one point of controversy in the game, where he deployed Battle Order and ability 3 in TIEs to Endor against my Hobbie in Red 4 and Karie Neth in Gray Squadron 2 . He said something to the effect of, &amp;#8220;I battle for free.&amp;#8221;, which I interpereted as him initiating a battle, so he went along with it (with making him lose 3 Force), but after the game he said he never initiated the battle, but he thought I was &amp;#8220;nice&amp;#8221;, so he let it go. Ummm, sure.... Maybe he was justing saying that he does battle for free there with Battle Order out. I don&amp;#8217;t know, but it&amp;#8217;s his responsibility not to just go along with everything I do. FW by 19.
<br/>
Overall: 2(+19)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Tracking around A Few Maneuvers for at least 3 draws.
<br/>
Lowlights: That &amp;#8220;scandal&amp;#8221; =)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: vs. Chris Harmon&amp;#8217;s Space With Little Ground (1481)
<br/>
 In this game, and game three I chose not to start Menace Fades since it serves no purpose what-so-ever in a Sealed tournament, which I should of realized when making the deck. Chris started Endor, I believe, with Combat Response. My first or second turn I get General Solo with Corporal Midge to the Landing Platform for a drain of two for most of the game. Early on he had a couple ships w/ matching pilots at Sullust, but I dropped Keir Santage + ship and Hobbie in Red Squadron 4 and Squadron Assignmented for Karie Neth in Gray Squadron 2. I battled and he drew a 0. On his turn he deployed Piett and Jerjerrod to my Hidden Forest Trail. Then he attacked me with some capitals and I lost Karie Neth. During my turn I deployed Admiral Ackbar, Corporal Beezer and Sergeant Junkin to the Forest Trail. He forfeited both his guys to battle damage (a tracked 6 for destiny I believe) while I lost Ackbar. From then on it was a drain race, with me moving to Endor and Sullust with my X-wings while he chased me. I was draining for 3 a turn for free, while he had to pay 3 to drain for 1 (2 on the opposite turns). He made a good effort late game by blocking my drain of 2 by putting down a TIE from Endor, but I would always hit it for damage. FW by 9
<br/>
Overall: 4(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Tracking A Few Maneuvers again; winning the drain race I didn&amp;#8217;t think this deck could do; winning again
<br/>
Lowlights: Needing more starships
<br/>
<br/>
After this game, the director says that only the top 2 players for each side get prize support. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: vs. Eddie Brown&amp;#8217;s Near Replica Of Chris&amp;#8217;s Deck But With More Ground (1465)
<br/>
He starts Endor and Combat Readiness for the Ancient Forest. Gotta give your Yuzzums their drain bonuses! His first turn he activates 6 and drops 3 deploy 2 Imperial scrubs to the Hidden Forest Trail. On my turn I put down Corporal Beezer and another scout to his Ancient Forest. On his turn he drains then deploys 2 TIEs to Endor. Since their total ability is 3, I&amp;#8217;m eager to attack. I deploy Keir in his ship and use Squadron Assignments for Karie Neth and Gray Squadron 2 I also deploy Chewie of Kashyyyk to the Forest Trail. I battle at Endor and draw a decent destiny and one stays. I move my 2 scouts from the Ancient Forest to the Trail. His turn he deploys Sullust and a VCSD to Endor. He deploys some other TIE stuff to Sullust and moves the Vic (along with the remaining TIE) to Sullust. He also moved his 3 Imperial scrubs away from my scout team. So on my turn I move my ships to Sullust along with an X-wing and move my scouts to the Ancient Forest. He battles at Sullust and I draw a tracked 6. He moves away again from my scout team to the Trail, so on my turn I feel like ending this. I deploy Sergeant Junkin and a Dresselian Commando to the Forest Trail and battle. I play Insertion Planning and Take The Initiative. I draw a 3 destiny, which becomes a 5 and he loses them all since he drew a 1 (-3 from IPlanning). We fight over Sullust a couple of time and I beat away all his forces with my tracked destinies so I get free reign for draining for 6 a turn. FW by 20
<br/>
Overall: 6(+48)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: This is the first time I&amp;#8217;ve really tryed hard at tracking in a tournament and it&amp;#8217;s really fun! Beating away everything he sent at me.
<br/>
Lowlights: None
<br/>
<br/>
The other top lightside player just got a timed win and we were the only undefeateds. So if I get a full win, I&amp;#8217;m the garunteed LS winner.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: vs. Mike Schneider&amp;#8217;s Space/Immunity To Attrition Madness (1500?)
<br/>
 This game was by far the most fun. He starts Kessel and Prepared Defenses for Battle Order and Combat Response. On his turn he just draws. On mine, seeing as I got a pretty good hand (some pilots, General Solo, Midge, Walex Blissex, and A Few Maneuvers), I just saved up some Force. On his turn he didn&amp;#8217;t do anything, just draw a couple. On mine I dropped General Solo and Corporal Midge to the Hidden Forest Trail. I was trying to decide whether to deploy Blissex to help out any A-wings I put up at Endor, or to just save the 2 in case he wants to fight me. I opted to save 2. On his turn he dropped Tempest 1 and Janus Gree... (ummm... you know, the Emperor&amp;#8217;s advisor =) and battled. Whatever he drew, I cancelled and he was immune to my destiny. On my turn I dropped a pilot for 2, battled for free and cancelled his destiny. He was again immune to my destiny. On his turn he deployed some forfeit 4 guy to pilot the Tempest 1 and battled. I lost my pilot and he lost the scrub. I then deployed another pilot and battled, his was cancelled and he was, yet again immune. On his turn he deployed Piett and battled. I killed off Piett and he drew a 0. So now I finally had him where I wanted him. I had finally realized that I could manage to beat him off of the site if I didn&amp;#8217;t deploy anything and just kept cancelling every battle destiny he drew. So from now on, my 4 force went to cancelling his destinies. It took me a long time to finally find a destiny 3 to kill of Janus with, which was suprising with my deck&amp;#8217;s destiny. So then he deployed a scrub to pilot Tempest 1 and a pilot in ship to Kessel. I finally have my opening. I deploy Chewie Of Kashyyyk (aka - CocK) and battle. I have an overwhelming power and he&amp;#8217;s forced to lose both. From then on, it&amp;#8217;s a drain race, with me draining for 2 a turn, and him draining for 1. He&amp;#8217;s lost both his other systems (Sullust to battle damage, Endor off the top) so we&amp;#8217;re stuck like that, and since both of us are only activating 4 Force, we don&amp;#8217;t have much to draw to help out, unless we want to stop draining for a turn. He knows he can&amp;#8217;t do anything anymore, and I drain him out. FW by 13
<br/>
Overall: 8(+61)
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: We were both activating only 4 Force the entire game!
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: The best damn game I&amp;#8217;ve played in a long time!; fighting over one location for more than half the game is just too cool; non-interactive decks sucks
<br/>
Lowlights: Hard to think of any, but one would be my destinies sucking major ass when I needed them to be good. (BTW, I couldn&amp;#8217;t track any A Few Maneuvers because I didn&amp;#8217;t have the Force to deploy a starship and Mike hadn&amp;#8217;t deployed one yet. So when I did track it to the top after playing it on his TIE, it was a drain race by then.)
<br/>
<br/>
So I win the tournament, and 7 packs of Premiere + 3 DS2 &amp;#8220;rares&amp;#8221; (They thought the Reactor Core was a rare! The other rares were Thunderflare and TTO), which I think is wrong. Giving 7 packs to the winners of each side and and only giving one out to each other player (for &amp;#8220;participation&amp;#8221;) sucks. So did my packs, seeing as the best rare was Obi-Wan&amp;#8217;s Hut. So I only kept 2 cards out of 105 that I got.
