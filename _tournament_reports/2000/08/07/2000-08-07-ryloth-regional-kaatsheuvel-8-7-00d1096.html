<br/>
<br/>
This was my first tournament since february of this year, so to say the least, i was a bit rusty. I knew i really not had a serious chance to win, but i tried anyway, and whatever happens, i get more experience. There were between 30-35 people playing (don't know exact number). I had a hard time deciding which deck to play, but since i wanted to get experience, i decided to use both new objectives.
<br/>
<br/>
LS:
<br/>
There Is Still Good In Him with Squadron Assignments
<br/>
<br/>
DS:
<br/>
Bring Him Before Me with some CC gambling
<br/>
<br/>
Game #1
<br/>
DS vs Pieter Heerma (Profit)
<br/>
<br/>
This was a pretty interesting game. Not that i really had a chance, but i learned a lot. I decided to not deploy any aliens in audience chamber, more so because i only have one (Mara of course). I made a lot of stupid basic mistakes, such as forgetting to deploy Emperor first turn, when i finally did i forgot to deploy Emperor's power, when i finally did that i forgot to use it and so on...
<br/>
He freed Han pretty quick and started to gain drains and of course i lost because of occupation by luke and han. I didn't got my CC: casino and when i did i didn't get Lando. I played with 2 of them both, and if i got them out, i might have started to retrieve.
<br/>
Anyway, i had to do something about his drains, so i deployed Mara and Chiraneau to Master Luke's site. He died, but i forgot to use emperor's power for some big power. I saved some force for the Berriers in my hand, so i hadn't to be afraid for his battle stuff didn't I? WRONG!!! When he started deploying, he deployed BEGGAR. He than used my force to deploy his stuff (including Master Luke out of his lost pile, i forgot that too). I could't barrier him anymore. He killed Mara and a lot of my life force. I tried to get a drain going at Kashykk with Zuckuss in ship, but after a visit of Home One and Boshek he just drained me to my death. I lost by 29.
<br/>
0 (-29)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Pieter gave me some good advice about some cards i might put in and out and some basic tactics
<br/>
Lows: Pretty obvious
<br/>
<br/>
Game #2
<br/>
LS vs Adriaan Goosens (Court of the Vile Gangster)
<br/>
<br/>
Funny, i now played against the other EJP objective. This went very well for me. I started draining right away with Luke, and because he made it pretty clear that he didn't had any imperials, deployed Lightsaber Proficiency on him and moved to landing platform. turn 2 he deployed Jabba (SE) and Salacious Crumb to audience chamber. I deployed Obi-wen with saber there and i actually missed jabba. However, i won on power, so i stacked a card on I feel the Conflic (the only thing that i didn'y forgot ever) and i lost obi + my destiny card (stupid annoying beast). He lost crumb. He did nothing except deploying Bane Malar to AC. I got a lot of force third turn, and was moving in with Han and Leia with weapon. I Know it was a very good battle, and he lost everything + some life force. Then he did something very impressive (most impressive): He deployed IG-88 with gun + 4 Lom with Gun to endor: landing platform. OK, my turn i drained him and the he disarmed my Luke! Very nice, since i was also losing my LProficiency. I drained for a vew turns, and he moved with his droids to AC (he had also deployed an Outer Rim Scout then. I was battling him, and again I Knew it would went quitte good. He captured Nein Numb with Iggy, and further lost the battle. He had also captured General Calrissian during a skirmish, so he flipped. To make a long story short: I won with + 34, but Sarlacc ate Nein Numb.
<br/>
2 (+5)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Almost everything.
<br/>
Lows: That sweet Nein Numb eaten by a Sarlacc. That would surely bring nightmares...
<br/>
<br/>
Game #3
<br/>
LS vs Arjan ? (Set your course for TIEs)
<br/>
<br/>
Everything went wrong from the beginning. I have a hand with only red cards, draw lousy other cards and turn 3 he drains for 6 with one interceptor at each systems. I fear Ghhk and he has quitte a big hand and a lot of force to use it. I tried once to defeat the Ties, but my ships just get barried (I traffic controlled my senses in fear of Monnok). I am dying hard. That's all there is to it. lost with -31
<br/>
2 (-26)
<br/>
Highs: None at all
<br/>
Lows: anything else
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game #4
<br/>
DS vs Rob Bosman (Endor Strike Team)
<br/>
I got a very good opening hand (Lando, Lord Vader, Vader's Stick, and CC: Casino. He deployed a lot of rebels on endor, but drained only for 1.  He was afraid i guess. I drained for 3 on CC (casino + Presence + Saber) and each time when there were 3 cards in lost pile, i initiated CC sabacc. He gained some more drains now, total for 5 (3 after i deployed U-3PO). On 1 moment, he only left 1 card in his reserve deck. That was the end of Lando's Sabacc carreer for the moment. I then had deployed kashykk and Cc central plaza and i drained him to the death. +21
<br/>
4 (-5)
<br/>
Highs: Winning a few Ewok catapults (destiny 7)
<br/>
Lows: My opponent understood that i couldn't sabacc with his 1 card in deck
<br/>
<br/>
Game #5
<br/>
LS vs Johan van der Meer (HDADTJ (!))
<br/>
<br/>
I was not prepared for this deck, altough i had HotJ. He captured Luke fairly quick. I did not get HotJ out, so i lose a lot of force due to Visage. Battled once with Obi, but he got beaten (You are beaten) and I lost 19 force in 1 battle. I didn't stand a chance.
<br/>
Highs: Ehhhhhh
<br/>
Lows: My opponent won
<br/>
<br/>
Game #6
<br/>
Ds vs Vitor Alves Da Silva (There is still good in him)
<br/>
<br/>
Some sort of a shadow match. In my opinion the Light side has an advantage here, because luke no get's captured by every imperial, and both objectives flip. I then lose 3 force per turn. 
<br/>
However, I got out my strike team (that's what i call Mara with stick, Lord vader with stick and Dr. Evazan) together with Lando (i saw him forfeiting a General calrissian, so no danger here) on CC and start sabacc. He drained at Yavin 4 (i needed to get yavin out, because i was low on force) and on Landing platform. I drained by 5 (cc central plaza, prsence, vader's stick and mara's stick). One turn he dropped Menace Fades, and 1 turn thereafter he realized his mistake. He could have deployed it, that would make a whole other game. I played sabacc a lot, and further it was just a drain race. 
<br/>
Highs: I won, and had 3-3.
<br/>
Lows: He had a perfect sabacc once
<br/>
<br/>
I ended 17th with - 12. It was fun to play again.
