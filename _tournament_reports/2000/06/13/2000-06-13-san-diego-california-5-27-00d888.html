<br/>
LS vs. Tom Mascari's ISB effects
<br/>
<br/>
	Hey hey, I get out to start out the tourney with a strong opponent.  Having not playtested my decks too much, i was curious what would happen.  Tom used Twi'leks to pull out every goddam effect known to man.  Blast Door Controls, Battle Order, Reactor Terminal, There Is No Try, Oppressive Enforcement, Secret Plans, and Imperial Arrest Order.  All those were out by turn 3 mind you, BLEH!  He kept dropping sites and the activation got goin.  Finally on turn 4, ben decided to show his wrinkly face.  I deployed him to the tosche station, along with EPP Luke, and Oola.  He saved up next turn as well so I dropped EPP Han and Chewbacca to hold down the fort.  All the while drawing up trying to find a stupid grimtaash so I could knock his hand down to 8 and hit him with oola.  The only guy he had safe from oola was an ORS!
<br/>
	We did a bit of battling and Oola prevailed with Ben and Luke.  Since the game was going slow, I took initiative to spread out a bit.  One turn he finally got more cards than I had force, (still no grimtaash) and I was forced to reinforce all of my drain sites with extra characters.  (this would turn out to be stupid as hell on my part.)  Tawss Khaa was alone at the back door of endor and I tossed down an elom to keep her company.  Next turn down came Igar in a Dune Walker.  A well tracked Twi'lek helped to flatten Tawss and the poor elom got the snot beat out of it, no houijix.  Thanks to the destiny of 5 and 6, I was able to sustain minimal damage losing only 12 additional force after the elom.  I ended up losing the drain race when I didn't have the force left to pay for battle order.  &gt;;(   DOH!  Loss by 9.

Lowlights:  Watching that poor elom get the snot beat out of it

Game 2:
<br/>
DS vs. I-Ming Chen's Profit deck
<br/>
<br/>
	Well, I didn't like my LS deck anyways, but I knew that the DS one was a winner.  As luck would have it, I got to play a mains deck, yay.  Profit none the less so I was guarenteed to get in some dueling.  Started with Mara and Jabba in the AC.  In the meantime, Darth and I were having our issues so he decided to stay hidden in my goddam reserve deck.  I eventually drew up an EPP Vader and had him out on turn 3.  No big loss here, I-Ming Trans Terminated the Visage before i activated a single force.  On turn 1 I dropped reactor terminal, and on turn two I stuck the two torture in my hand, counted my reserve deck, and continued on.  I had him outwitted alrite though, I deployed EPP Vader to JP, flipped, and redeployed the visage.  That may have sounded pretty smooth, but then he TTed the visage again. bleh.  Here's where it gets fun.  Ben Kenobi with Ben's stick comes down to the AC with Orimaarko and 2-1B.  
<br/>
	He initiates and plays weapon levitation to steal Mara's saber, doh, i was gonna use that.  Thankfully he missed his swing at Jabba, whew.  I drew a 1 and he drew a 3 for battle destiny.  Since my immunity wasn't broken, I chose to lose the difference, 4 force + 2 force from Orimaarko.  He lost, revived and gave me the go.  I drained with Darth, then proceeded to battle at the AC.  I weapon Levied Mara' Saber away from Tawss and back to Mara.  Since he had no actions, I then played You Are Beaten on Ben, swung at 2-1B, and knocked out Orimaarko with attrition.  I then payed 1 to move over Darth.  Due to careful counting and planning, I happened to know of two tortures on top of my reserve deck.  During his control phase I lopped off Ben's arm.  (You can never be too careful... besides, nobody else was worth Disarming.)  Confident with two sixes on top, I barely managed to take out Obi with a circle, yay.  That pretty much spelled game as I watched 3 Master Lukes hit the used pile.  Win by 21.
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Using all those interrupts and tracking those tortures over a three turn duration- smooth.

Game 3:
<br/>
DS vs. Zachary Erwin's Numbers with EPP suicides
<br/>
<br/>
	He started out with Yavin IV: War Room and combat readiness.  He fetched farm and jungle and i was confused... no nudj?  ok, whatever.  First turn he dropped that JP droid (8D8?) along with two of the destiny 4 vehicle droids, then picked up.  I took advantage of the free force and deployed EPP Vader alone to the farm and flipped.  He lost from visage and I lost from nothing.  Eventually he tossed me an insert and before it came up I found my torture.  After playing the torture, i counted my reserve and took note of its location.  I deployed Jabba to the jungle and moved into the war room to beat up on droids along with Lando.  He then deployed ECC Chewbacca and battled Jabba.  I lost the necessary force, (he didn't break immunity) and activated.  Since I knew the torture was second from the top now, I deployed 4-LOM with Jabba, battled, canceled Chewie's game text, and drew 3 destiny.  One for my war room text, one for 4-LOM's text, and one for ability 4.  I drew a 3, 4, and the 6 from torture.  I lost 4-LOM for his 2 destiny, and cleared his half of the site out.  Game over.  Win by 26.
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Pure card efficiency of the dark deck.  I had to deploy only 3 different characters through the whole game.... good thing too, i didn't have many characters in the deck anyways.

Game 4:
<br/>
LS vs. Danny Svehaug's Court / Scum &amp; Villainy deck
<br/>
<br/>
	If I won this game I pretty much secured second.  I was kind of worried about the Court of Vile Gangster since I didn't know it's potential and how my LS deck would do against him.  I got control of the Tosche station very quickly.  I sat at tosche station and waited for him to come around.  On turn 3 I tossed a shocking info in my used pile, and counted the cards left in my reserve.  I sat at the tosche station and got out oola.  He was forced to come over since I had control of his hand being able to activate 16 a turn.  He finally lost his nerve and moved Mara, EPP Boba, Jabba and IG-88 with gun over to Tosche station to confront Oola, Ben and EPP Luke.  Patience is a virtue in the game and he found this out when I deployed Chewbacca, EPP Leia, and two eloms.  Since I knew the shocking was on top, I targeted Mara with Leia, bam, 5, hit, yay.  I then got lucky and had both Ben and EPP Luke take out Boba and Jabba.  With everyone but IG-88 hit, I drew destiny 5.  His half of the site was cleared and I revived oola.  Without a character for the rest of the game, it was spread out and drain him to death.  Win by 34.
<br/>
<br/>
Note to self:  Damn oola is powerful... wish she sent em to the lost pile instead of used pile though!
<br/>

6 (+72)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, all in all a good effort that easily secured me second place.  Dark side decks dominated all the games and there was a note-worthy LS X-Wing swarm with MWYHL.  Two rounds was nice I suppose, I like it short and brief.  More to come from the Alderaan region.  Comic Con is right around the corner and I hope to reclaim last year's seat I had in the finals.  Lookin forward to seein anyone who's goin.
