<br/>
Pre-Tourney 
<br/>
I knew that was going to be a tourney because there is one every week in Terre Haute unless there is a convention.   I made my dark side  the night before the 
<br/>
tourney.  It was  a Endor Ops  deck inspired by Kyle Craft's deck and Frank Lamantia's deck also.  It looked pretty tight.   My light side I made a throne room 
<br/>
mains.  I had nothing else to make so i just made it. I arrive and their are 6 people their.  We had to create a ghost player and have the Tournament Director use one 
<br/>
of his friends name.  He called him to make sure that it was okay and it was.  Some good players were Dave Bouffard and Erik winnings.  My rating before the 
<br/>
tourney was 1923.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 
<br/>
My LS yavin 4 mains vs. Dave bouffard (1877) DS start with 3rd anthology Objective with a lot of starships. 
<br/>
Before this game, he debated whether to play tie's or the star destroyers. Luckily he picked the star destroyer deck.   I start the usual stuff and he starts with the 
<br/>
regular stuff for his objective and Imperial Arrest Order.  First turn I activate 7, deploy a nudj, and deploy gold leader in gold 1 to alderaan.  Then i move it to death 
<br/>
star.  Pretty good first turn.  I let him go.  He activated and got out endor docking bay, twi'leked for reactor terminal, and drew the rest.  I drian at the death star for 
<br/>
about three turns during which i back it up with harc seff in gold and Lando in falcon with a hmenthe as a pilot.  I move back to alderaan  because he was saving a 
<br/>
lot of force.  During those turns I also got out all of my sites (10) so i was activating about 16-18 force which helped a lot.   He gets out battle order which turns out
<br/>
to hurt him more than it does me.  He deploys ejp dengar and epp fett to the d* docking bay.  I deploy epp leia, epp han, r-3p0( for protection) and wedge to the 
<br/>
carbonite chamber which i hold for the rest of the game.  I also deploy epp luke against his guys at the d* docking bay and only manage to kill one of them.   Next 
<br/>
turn he deploys  Grand moff and let's me go. I deploy epp obi and clear the site.   He draws ozzel for destiny so obi stays and I move him to the conference room 
<br/>
so i can drain for two.  I am hit and running in space with draw thier fire which is hurting him.   He doesn't drain that much because of battle order while i have a 
<br/>
good space presence and the carbonite chamber under control.  I drain him down to 1 force left then i deployed tantive and battled,I retrieve he loses his last card. 
<br/>
FW (18) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Him not getting systems out early and me getting all of my sites by turn 4. 
<br/>
Lowlights: none 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 
<br/>
My DS Endor OPS vs. Andy McCillip (1492) light side cloud city deck. 
<br/>
First turn I get out ds-61-2 to the bunker, a dreadnaught to kashhyyk, and ominous rumours out.  He started with lower corridor and downtown plaza.  So by my 
<br/>
second turn , I have a drain of 4.  Not bad.  This game was boring with no battles because i got out a potf on endor and kessel out with some ships.  I deploy evax 
<br/>
in a walker to the landing platform.  So here's what the game was like.  First 3 or 4 turns.  I drain of 4 each turn.  He just draws.  For the next 2 turns i drain for 7 
<br/>
because of endor.  He just draws. For the rest of the game i drain for 11 and he can't do anything. 
<br/>
FW (36) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: The deck worked like a machine. 
<br/>
Lowlights:  I didn't feel sorry for him because this guy takes forever just to do his turn.  We would of been done in 15 minutes but he went so slow. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
My  DS Endor OPS vs. Josh clark using chris fielding's name and rating.(1560 or something) MWYHL Mains 
<br/>
This game was a good game during the beginning.  First turn he deploys EPP luke to the docking bay.  Luckily I get admiral ozzel and tempest 1 out and kill luke. 
<br/>
Next turn he deploys farmboy luke and epp leia.  he battles and plays skywalkers. I kill off  luke and i lose ozzel for attrition.  He drew a 0,1, and  a 4.  I had IAO
<br/>
out so ozzel had six forfiet. I deploy ds 61 2 and battle.  I draw a zero and he draws a 3.  He opts to lose 3. Next turn he then revoed my bunker and deployed
<br/>
obi-wan and his lightsaber. He moved leia and and let me go.  I had out come back here you coward so he couldn't drain.  I drain him for 1 for 3 or four turns
<br/>
while he draws and eventually deploys epp luke and orrimaarko.  Meanwhile, He deploys tantive and gold leader to endor.  I deploy zuckuss and bossk in bus and
<br/>
lateral damage tantive.  He has to lose both of them and some overflow.  I move one of them to kashhyyyk and one of them stays at endor.  I deployed crush the
<br/>
rebellion and canceled his revo.  He moved obi,luke and leia over to the docking bay.  I had tons of force because I had never been force drained and I won most of
<br/>
the battles.  I deploy ds-61-3 in blizzard 2 and choker vader and battle.  I only manage to kill off leia but at this point in the game, it doesn't matter.  I am draining
<br/>
for a ton in space.  he draws up next turn. 
<br/>
FW (20) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  I never got force drained at all. 
<br/>
Lowlights:  Him never getting out Han.  That would been a different game because he would be able to draw more destiny and kill my walkers. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 
<br/>
My LS Y4 vs Erik Winings (1817) DS death star start with some systems and a lot of ground. 
<br/>
I know that he is going to start death star so I start with the yavin 4 headquarters.   So i get 1 more force and i still get to go first.  I get a 2 2/0's in my hand and deploy them and a nudj.  This game was also boring.  I activated around 10 the whole game while the maximum he got to activate was 6.  He got out the defensive perimeter so i deployed epp luke and a h'menthe. He only saved one force so i figured that he could'nt deploy vader i would be safe until i could get more characters the next turn.   Instead he deploys mara and gets her saber and battles.  I lose luke and the h'menthe and mara stays.  Next turn i save up.  He drains of 3 and draws.  I deploy epp obi and draw thier fire and battle.  He kills off obi and mara is killed.   He deploys a walker and a 2/2 scrub.  Next turn i deploy epp han, epp leia, melas, and tawss khaa.  I battle and kill off the walker.  I have control of the site for about 3 turns while he draws and saves force.  I deploy ecc lando, wedge,jeroen webb, and tawss khaa.  he deploys jabba the hutt, ig-88 with gun, and epp fett and battles.  He shoots  han and captures him.  I tracked a signal so i shot ig-88. He draws a 0 with hidden weapons so i still have leia.  He shoots wedge with fett.  I draw a 5 destiny and he draws like crap with his 3 destinies.  I lose leia and wedge to cover attrition. He loses jabba because he want's han captured, tawss khaa is there, and he can't over forfiet.  I deploy another liea and a epp luke and battle.  He has to lose 10 in battle damage and I get han back.  I keep draining for 2 until he draws up. 
<br/>
FW(22) 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 
<br/>
My DS Endor Ops vs Dave bouffard's(1877) LS Hidden base with x-wings and proton torpedoes with those interrupts that add 4 to the destiny and make the ship
<br/>
that was hit immediately lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
I start out with oppresive enforcement because i need to grab his damn interrupts. Not much to say. He made most of my starships immediately lost with lose interrupts and i couldn't drain in space. He kept on canceling my drain on the ground with rebel fleet.  This game sucked.  He flipped and drained me for like 7 or 8 a turn.  Sorry about not writing much.  I didn't want to remember this game.

Game 6
<br/>
My LS Y4 vs. Josh clark using chris fielding's name and rating.(1560 or something) DS HDADTJ Duel deck.
<br/>
I knew that he was playing this deck and i had no duel protection.  I got a good start by getting a nudj and searching for a non unique alien with wind chimes.I got a 
<br/>
h'menthe.  I deployed a nudj from hand and got out jeroen webb with the h'menthe first turn canceling visage.  That won me the game.  I drain for two and next turn he comes down with ig-88.  This game had really crappy destiny draws for the whole game.  (Execpt for a duel)  Anyway, he battles and misses a capture by drawing a 1 and then draws a 1 for battle destiny.  I draw  a stinking site.  Next turn i drain for 2 and deploy lando with gun then move them to the meditation chamber. Nothing goes on except a couple of drains.  Then he deploys epp fett and dengar with gun.  He battles and clears the site and he has to lose fett.  I get out epp leia, epp han, wedge, another h'menthe, and R-3P0 to his cantina.  He just keeps drawing.  This is where I made a  mistake.  I deployed bothan and epp obi to the meditation chamber. I battle and he shoots the bothan.  I can't lose obi which sucks.  He has to lose dengar and 3.  Next turn he deploys vader and tarkin and battles. He duels and plays focused.  I draw a 5 and a 5.  He cancels one of them.  He draws a 1,1,and a 5.   If he didn't cancel mine or he didn't play focused, I would've won the duel. He wins by one and i lose obi and 9.  I get to go and draw some.  He asks me how many cards i have in my hand.  I have like 20 so the guy draws up.  I only win by 14
<br/>
FW(14)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Getting two people to the holotheatre first turn.
<br/>
Lowlights. Him drawing up.  I was pissed.
<br/>
<br/>
So I end up winning the tournament because I was the only person to go 5-1.  Dave and Erik went 4-2.
