<br/>
<br/>
Derek Conklin (Provo, Utah) vs. Dan Lujan (La Puente, California)
<br/>
<br/>
Game one*s feature match pitted two relative unknown*s located at one of the top tables. Conklin was assigned to play Light Side and brought his Harvest/Mains deck against Lujan*s Mains on Tatooine which featured a healthy dose of Sense/Alter.
<br/>
<br/>
Conklin started Obi*s Hut and played Careful Planning to deploy Lar*s Moisture Farm. Lujan started Carbon Chamber Testing for force activation and the Audience Chamber. He twileked for Bad Feeling Have I.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan went first, deployed the Audience Chamber with the Obj. text and after a minute*s hesitation brought out Jabba with the AZ text. He drew up the last force and passed the turn.  Conklin activated, dropped Traffic Control and drew.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan*s second turn started with a drain for one with Jabba at the Aud. Chmbr. then continued his aggressive play by deploying DLOTS with saber to the A.C. as well, threatening an early drain of two. Lujan then altered Conklin*s Traffic Control, causing a glance of suprise and ended his turn. Conklin just activated and drew up all his force, searching for his mains.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan*s third turn started with a drain for two, then deployed Tarkin to the A.Chmbr. He also dropped Coruscant. Conklin, still having deployed no characters, tried a Grimtaash lost which Lujan sensed. Conklin, frustrated, deployed Rendezvous Point and in a big defensive move, Battle Plan. Lujan*s turn was a drain for two and having established control simply drew cards.
<br/>
<br/>
On the fourth turn Conklin decided to show up and deployed EEP Luke to the moisture farm. He immediately played an Alter on Lujan*s BFHI which was Sensed. Conklin then added Owen and Beru Lars, played Chirpa*s Hut and ended his turn.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan drained for two, played Presence at the Audience Chamber signaling his intention to control that location to victory. He then played U3PO at the Farm. Conklin had no solution for the spy and on his turn dropped EEP Han to the farm as well then threw out a lost Grimtaash which Lujan had to sense. Conklin then played his money card -- Harvest, but Lujan had another Sense. Frustrated, Conklin ended his turn.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan drained for three at the A.C., deployed Ozzel there and drew his entire force pile.
<br/>
<br/>
On his sixth turn Conklin, still unable to drain, draws and then plays a Harvest which goes through. He targets Traffic Control, EEP Obi, Alter and the other Harvest. Lujan, worried over the recursive Harvest problem went active on his seventh turn. He drained for three and then deploys IG88 with blaster, 4LOM with blaster and Djas Phur to the Moisture Farm and initiates battle.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan lets Conklin take the first action which is Dont Get Cocky. DS cancels Luke*s game text. LS plays Harvest as a destiny adder. DS shoots Han and misses. LS shoots U3PO and hits. DS draws destinyof 3 and 0. LS draws 5, 2, 2, 3, 1 and plays smokescreen on the last to make it a 5 for a total of 13. The Lightside wins the battle 32 to 13. The bounty hunters are all cleared and the LS forfiets Beru. Despite a dwindling force pile, it seems that Conklin now has a chance to get in the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Conklin activates and without U3PO around drains for one at the farm. He plays another Beru and Harvests targeting Harvest, Harvest, Cocky and Gift of the Mentor. He then revolutions the Carbonite Chamber and draws.
<br/>
<br/>
Lujan keeps hitting with a drain for three and then draws. Conklin continues his aggressive play and plays another revolution on Coruscant threating to cut Lujan to 5 force a turn. Lujan Alters, Conklin Senses but Lujan wins the was with another Alter. Conklin tries another revolution but it gets Altered.
<br/>
<br/>
During his control phase Lujan elises Ozzel next door to Obi*s Hut and drains there and at the Chamber for six. He moves Ozzel back and ends.
<br/>
<br/>
Things are getting desperate for Conklin but he drains for one, plays Traffic Control and tries a very important Harvest which gets sensed. Lujan elises Ozzel to Obi*s Hut again and drains for six, then moves him back. Conklin goes for the draw phase Harvest, again sensed. Conklin*s turn was drain for one, Harvest which again is sensed. On his eleventh turn Lujan drained for three. Conklin activated his two remaining force and conceeded.
