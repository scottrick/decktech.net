<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It was my second tournament in Manitoba (I'm from Montreal and out of town for 3 months) There's a few good players around here and Rob Dean, Manitoba's provincial championship winner was supposed to be there. So I had been preparing my decks for a week, I wanted to play something new, tired of the same Yavin 4 deck. But I kinda like my sabacc Epp squad QMC. But I decided to use another light side as well. So I asked asked Raphael Asselin and Dominic Gaudreault for decks ideas and both told me about similar Raltirr decks. So I worked with them a bit and after a few changes, finally got to something I liked. For my light side, I used Raphael's Dagobah visored vision deck, with a change, removed the daughter for a boussh, which has revealed beeing a very good change.
<br/>
<br/>
So I drive an hour to the mall. Pretty nice place. The tables are outside the store, it's cool, it doesn't get hotter and people around can take a look. One guy had a box full of communs are was inviting curious people to take what ever they wanted attracting maybe some new players. Well, I arrive there, I was the first and the shop was closed. damn. I needed a few cards for my light side. Finally the players arrive, the store open and I get the find the cards I need. Rob Dean is not there, and I learn Chirs Orellana is in Calgary for the summer. So, there is no players that I know off.
<br/>
<br/>
So finally the tournament starts and I play my first game playing my dark side against a young guy. I don't remember the name of any of my opponment :-(
<br/>
<br/>
First game
<br/>
Ds against Profit
<br/>
<br/>
One thing is sure. I was not to familiar with Raltirr operations and I misread the objective, I thought I could flip with at-sts at the sites, well now I know. So it took me a long while flipping. He wasn't doing much, he never found his sites, well, except he drew one 2 times in destiny. I battle him a few times on Tatooine. Once with IG and vader on Leia and Calfan, I capture Calfan, he lose Leia plus a few, I lose vader. A bit later he flips, retrieves 10 forces, I never found my secret plan. I drain him on kashyyk and my sites, I manage to flip, I control Ralltir, I put imperial decree, he's not doing anything. I kick Falcon's butt. I lose few forces to the objective but nothing to worry about. I won!

<br/>
<br/>
2nd game
<br/>
LS against same guy, hunt Down duel
<br/>
<br/>
I've never seen the point of his deck, he was playing duel on Tatooine with occupation and tons of low destinies. Well, the game starts, he gets Jabba out with Mara and Ephant mon on AC after a few turns. I put projection of a Skywalker down to prevent the drain. I can't find my visored visions nor a transmission terminated for the visage. He has 13 cards in hand, I grimtashh him used, I play 2 stome piles, (I grabed his Mara's saber) :-)that's why he never found it. He puts vader on table, I put boushh in front of him. so he's not draining there either. I play uncontrolable fury on vader, he cancels it, effective repairs, put it back next turn. Visored vison finally do some damage, I cancel the visage, insert anger fear agression. he puts veers in his blizzard, I deploy there TK422, Bubo eats him, I deploy another projection. On one of my turns the only thing I did was to tell him it was his turn. He keeps losing forces to the fury. he finally gets his tatooine and occupation. he deploys boba fett in slave one. my turn, I play gold leader in gold one with R2. I attack draw a battle destiny of 5, he draws a 4, he lose it I lose R2, play legendary starfighter. He's dying slowly and now I drain for 2, he draws his force pile 
<br/>
<br/>
FW + 17
<br/>
4 +30
<br/>
<br/>
HL: well, again winning with a new deck and have fun seeing the opponent doing nothing. and grabbing the saber :-)
<br/>
LL: well, nothing, oh no, I dropped 2 cards while shuffling my deck
<br/>
<br/>
3rd game
<br/>
Ls against, oh no, Sienar starting with Sienar fleet system.
<br/>
<br/>
This is gonna be a hard game, cause generally tie decks crush mine. he was playing astero√Ød fields, he plays 2 big ones and after a few turns he's draining me a lot. I can't find my cards, and when I get them, he plays uncertain is the future GRRR. But one thing good, he's losing forces everyturn to anger fear agression and I always have another one in my hand. I manage to kill his draw good asteroid destinies every turn, I monok him, he loses 2 ties, and I play 2 stone piles, both when he had 3 and 4 cards in hand. I gotta find a way to make him lose forces. Anger fear are hurting but he could retrieve everything back. So he left a dreadnought alone with a tie, I attacked with lando in falcon,boshek and R2, I won, he took some damage and I played legendary starship, I controled after Sienar. The deploy cost of his ties was 3 now, and cost for drain was 4, so he had to choose to drain or deploy, I was cancelling his drains with it could be worse and I managed to do my jedi test 1. He was loosing at least 2 forces a turn and I was loosing 0. I got my traffic control back from the lost pile, recirculated, and the game was over.

<br/>
<br/>
HL: Hmm, having my super falcon out and inserts reaching top every turn.
<br/>
<br/>
LL: @#$%ing incertain is the future and having such a trouble to have a character to do the jedi test
<br/>
<br/>
4rd and last game
<br/>
DS against, oh yes!! EBO
<br/>
<br/>
This is the deck I wanted to see!! I was sure I'd see one, I had 2 cards in my deck to beat it, imperial decree and search and destroy, they've been pretty useful, and the decree necessary. Well, I flipped on 3rd turn and he played EBO on same turn, he deployed a few planets after that, a few corvettes and shuttled up his characters.
<br/>
I was draining on the ground and I suffered 1 drain of 2. Here comes the cool thing. I deployed 5th marker, making 4th marker a non-battleground site. I play wampa cave, a character there and a at-st on 5th marker, play imperial decree, woohoo, no more trouble, After that it was pretty easy. but he deployed kessel, trying a kessel run, I altered the kessel run, battled a bit in space, did some damage to his corvettes, he was paying 3 for a drain of one, but one problem, where's my search and destroy??? well, it stayed almost all game in my force pile, I was keeping a force for imperial barrier duh!! I noticed it to late! but got it out finally, he lost a few forces to it., well it helped and I won
<br/>
<br/>
FW +22
<br/>
8 +67
<br/>
<br/>
HL: Well, having imperial decree won me the game, this is sure.
<br/>
LL: well keeping one force and it was my search and destroy!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I won the tournament!! My first one!! The store owner took a picture of me, it's a tradiation, they take a picture of every winner and put them in a album at the store. I won a few packs and it was the first time I saw only @#$% in 6 reflection packs, the best card was a white border Blizzard 2. Well I picked my 4th Dark lando in a Cloud city pack.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is about it, this tournament showed me I don't play enough and I should play more cause I can win. I gotta stop doing stupid errors. </font></td>
