<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">League Game #6...or something
<br/>
<br/>
See, local player/entrepreneaur Michael "Saucy" Sinclair is trying to get a protour together, but since he doesn't have the immediate funding, he is running a local one.  Wild cards = tournaments where one person is the wild card and if you beat him you get bunches of league points.  League Games = tournaments that are sanctioned, but also count towards sinclair AZ protour.  League Championship = winner gets like $500 bones and to play the next year for free.  But you have to be invited or in the top number of players in the league standings, plus the tournament is elimination.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...on to the tournament.  I have gone 8-0 in the past two tournaments, let's see if I can keep it up.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks
<br/>
LS - Raphael's Super Secret Canadian Tech Deck
<br/>
DS - Rumours (cause I am tired of losing to destiny draws)
<br/>
<br/>
Game One DS vs. a newbie
<br/>
This kid has potential.  He has some good cards, he just needs to get better ones.  I remind him to force drain and activate and such.  I set up a drain at kashyyk, kiffex and forest clearing.  The drain 10 a turn is what killed him.
<br/>
FW +38
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two LS vs. Don "Nibbles" Anzalone's Hunt Down
<br/>
This kid is good.  He wrecks through everybody and then chokes at the top table, it's all good though cause he is gonna try and represent at the tatooine regionals.  Like third turn, vader comes down with a stick at the downtown plaza.  He drains there for about one turn and Bousch makes a showing w/reflection action.  A couple Anger Fear's and about 12 lost force later the visored visions start to become a factor.  I get rid of some elis's and such.  I am draining at Kessel with falcon/cappy han, tantive with spiral on my back.  He drops zuckass and initiates, I drop spiral, he loses + some force.  Him not being able to get any damage going is what lost him the game.  I retreive a little and he draws up.
<br/>
FW +19
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three LS vs. Brian "Tony" Garrison's Bruen's Ties
<br/>
I told him to start Kashyyk like he was supposed to, he told me it wasn't that deck, so I was relieved.  He started the HFB.  Some Anger Fears got some early damage in.  Obi to Leia's Hut on CC was a drain of one for the game.  Bousch came down to keep the lonely man busy and she reflected on the situation.  Meanwhile back on the falcon, Cappy Han and epp luke were having themselves a good ol' time.  Visored Vision did damage by calling short range fighters and all power to weapons.  Direct damage is KING and this deck is a machine.
<br/>
FW +20something
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four DS vs. Don "Nipples" Anzalone's Hidden Beats
<br/>
So his deck was kinda like Brenston's beats only worse.  I set up some early drains at endor, not going to the bunker for fear of a nabrum (no IAO yet).  He put out the falcon, han, luke and leia.  I kindly reminded him of the gametext of lightside of endor, he couldn't initiate.  I coaxed him into going over to his non-battleground systems and he chased me around there (I didn't want him to drain so I just kept leading him on).  We exchanged ship battles, I always battled cause first strike and draw their fire was on the table.  I was a few of his ships, he did a few to mine.  I got bold and threw mara to the forest clearing with saber.  She stayed and drained for three for the rest of the game.  I iniated with the ship that han was chasing and I had enough to cover the crappy destiny draws he had.  I drained with mara.  He payed to drain, but I had a projected telepathy left so it was canceled.  that won me the game, he couldn't drain next turn.
<br/>
FW +10something.
<br/>
<br/>
so now I am 12-0 in the past three tournaments, raph's deck is a beast.  and I have a good new dark deck in the oven....be sure to be at origins to find out what it is :-) </font></td>
