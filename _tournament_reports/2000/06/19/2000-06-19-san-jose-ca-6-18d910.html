<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Coming to you the day after from my house, its ANOTHER report from San Jose by the Brahma Bull, once again from Comics and Fantasies at 5:30 p.m. Sorry about that....I just got done watching SNL.Another boring week of summer passed, and once again I was looking foward to another Saturday tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
Third Anthology released this week and I was prepared to try out some of the new cards. Didnt like the new DS Objective, wasnt interested in RTP, so I made an EBO and kept the Raltiir thats been having success lately. I talked to friend Matt Smith on Friday, asked him if he wanted to go and he said to call him up tomorrow.....so I slept on it. Woke up the next morning and got several offers to go places, but I decided to stick at home and wait till tourney time and call Matt. A friend came over and we played some Trek, and on my way back from the local store, Matt was at my house so we took off.......8 people made it out to this one, not as much as I'd like but hey, its sanctioned......here we go....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS EBO Blitz vs. Nick Stefanko's DS Court Variant
<br/>
<br/>
This game was a drain race all the way......I set up EBO on 2nd turn, dominated space on the third. He tried to set up drains on Tatooine, knowing how dumb it is to hit Hoth. I controlled Coruscant, Kiffex, and three 2/1 systems for a HUGE drain, and kept all the anti-battle cards in my hand. He spreaded pretty thin, and I hinted beatdown, so he started to move everyone a little closer to each other. I dropped Boushh to stop his drains at the Cantina, but she gets captured via Hutt Smooth, and he starts heading back towards Jabba's Palace to feed her to the Rancor. He settles for the Sarlacc since itll save him a few turns, but it ends up eating one of his own since theres no one of the LS of the site. Leias captor gets eaten, he battles her, and I lose her since shes getting eaten next turn anyways. From there, I keep the space damage, and he dies out by 15.
<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 2(+15)
<br/>
Highs: Speed EBO is back....
<br/>
Lows: Nothing much....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS Raltiir Ops vs. Chris Mckunes LS QMC Cloud Cars
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm....a Mining Colony deck......well this one was in the bag for me from the start. I set up Raltiir 3rd turn, he tries to flip the objective but no luck. He drops ships to Bespin, which I let him have since theres no drains there. He comes down to the Core Tunnel with Pucimir and some aliens, I drop DLOTS and Tarkin to clean them off.....drops a lone Z-95 to Bespin: Cloud City, I drop Fett in Jett, same story. He then tells me he didnt know what Raltiir Ops did....great. Well, if that doesnt cap it for you, nothing will. Win by 29.
<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+44)
<br/>
Highs: Nothing much....
<br/>
Lows: Well if you dont know what an objective does, ASK.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matt and I head to McDonalds for some munchies and talk about our games....were both 2-0 going into the second round, and we expect to play each other. We come back, and to our surprise, we dont.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS EBO Blitz vs. Alex Stefanko's DS Hunt Down 
<br/>
<br/>
Well this game was all a matter of crappy luck. I set up second turn, he draws until then.....I lose to Visage, nothing too big. I drain for some, then it starts happening.....its usually something I dont do, but I decide to lose to drains and Visage off the top......of 2 turns, I lose a grand total of 8 ships and nearly all my anti-battle red cards. Now Ive only got 2 ships on table, and he drops Zuckuss and Devastator with Battle Order and First Strike.....doesnt matter how much running I do, he always has the better end of the stick. So I play smack and run and try to use First Strike to my advantage, but eventually Visage gets the better of me(no more spies) and he wins it by 11. 
<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+33)
<br/>
Highs: Well, Im not hungry anymore, except for revenge....
<br/>
Lows: Well, losing 8 ships in 2 turns cant be good........
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With almost no shot at winning it I decide just to finish out my last game with quiet dignity....Ive got a low score, low differential, with 2 people higher up than me now. It turns out that Im pretty high on my side, Matt didnt win by much and I get another shot at Alex again....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS Raltiir Ops vs. Alex Stefanko's LS Speed Profit v. 0.1
<br/>
<br/>
Well this is revenge.....I set up Raltiir 3rd turn, he frees Han at the same time. I search for Kashyyyk and set up there for a steady drain of 6. He spreads and tries to get more drains and Profit damage done, I set up Decree and hes locked down. I set up at every site, and just wait for his deploy.......I eventually get annoyed of Profit damage and decide to track some destinies and smack Han after seeing him lose 2 to my drains. I Monnok him Lost style, no Its A Trap! or such, so Vader comes down, slices Han, takes out Tawss and  Jereon Webb, and walks outside for the drain. He suicides Luke into him, and ends up losing 4 in the process. The drains last the entire game, he cant keep up....win by 24.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6(+58)
<br/>
Highs: Smack OFFICIALLY laid down....
<br/>
Lows: Nothing much....
<br/>
<br/>
Well it all winds down and there we go.....Matt actually ends up LOSING his last game to Nick, and so I take the tourney to differential, and push Alex and Matt into a TIE for 2nd place. How strange that things just work out for the best.....another day another tourney. Nothing great in prize support, but during the day I DID take out 2 Death Stars with my MBO....that was sweet.... until next time!!!
