<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Alright, I played in a tournament on Saturday but I only went 4-2 losing both times because I was an idiot and a bad player.  So I have been in kinda a rut lately, and recently on a local listserv, the top ten most feared players in the state of Arizona came out and I was only ranked number ten.  Well I guess it is time to show these people how to play once again.....I guess
<br/>
<br/>
Tournament is for Sunday, we have an average of two tournaments a weekend here in the Phoenix area.  Lately it has been three or four.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks
<br/>
LS - Raph*s Direct Damage Deck
<br/>
DS - Rumours(metagamed this one)
<br/>
<br/>
First Game DS vs. Enrique*s Profit/Sabacc
<br/>
Enrique is a very knowledgable up and coming player, he just has the same problem I do, I like to try new and inventive decks.  Well, I teched this game out.  I knew he was starting Uhoh, so my two aliens were Mara and Miiyoom Onith and I started with Sec.Precautions.  A first turn scan netted me a Master Luke and two Landos.  He got out Rkick and I lost most of the cards in my lost pile to sabacc.  With a combination of keeping Onith on tap and the massive drains that I set up, his deck couldn't keep up.
<br/>
Full Win about 20 diff.
<br/>
<br/>
Second Game LS vs. Brandon Allen*s Hunt Down
<br/>
This is one of the better players in Arizona, so I was hoping to do well.  I got the force battery set up on Dagobah and started making him lose to Visored Vision.  He didn*t think this was too cute, so he altered PNPC when vader hit the table.  He drained with vader and he got lost in the wilderness.  Needless to say, Brandon was very weary of draining outside again.  I set up a pretty big armada at Kessel and drained there.  the Anger Fear Aggressions and the drain at kessel were too much for him.
<br/>
Full Win by about 14
<br/>
<br/>
Third Game LS vs. Brian Garrison*s Death Star Deck
<br/>
Brian is a damn good player, he is really becoming a force to be reckoned with.  His deck was kind of a spin off of Brenston*s Death Star Deck.  Well, I got the upper hand early.  The Anger Fear Aggressions and the fact that he didn*t pack undercover spy protection did him in.  This light deck is a machine.  it practically plays itself.
<br/>
Full Win by about 28
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth Game DS vs. Mike Sinclair*s Beast of a Deck
<br/>
Another good player that is making his move.  I helped him make his deck that morning so I knew that a start of Bad Feeling Have I would do him in.  I got the quick upper hand with an imperial at the bunker and boba fett at kashyyk.  He came down with some mofos on spiral and battled, I lost about 6 cards and bugged out. I came back with reinforcements and forced him out.  So the play of the game came when I had boba fett at endor and his armada at kashyyk.  I played lateral damage on his full ship of characters at endor, and deployed zuckass to kashyyk.  I didn*t battle, but I moved boba fett over to kashyyk.  well he had to move to endor and I had a drain of four at kashyyk and tempest 1 w/igar drained at the forest clearing and that was pretty muched game.

<br/>
So I won...but I am still washed up.  Raph's deck is a beast.  It plays itself. </font></td>
