<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I decided that I needed to start playing again, so I can find out what decks I will be taking to Vegas for the Tatooine Regional.  I Show up at Arizona gamer and find Girard and Sinclair waiting outside for me.  We go inside and we see some of the other guys who play here.  we get ready to go.  
<br/>
<br/>
Decks -
<br/>
LS - Jfunkallstar's Fight the Resistance, except I added some cards...
<br/>
DS - Death Star Start Battle Deck.  A SWCCG Klingon deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 DS vs. Michael Sinclair's Dagobah Defense Deck.
<br/>
<br/>
This game went slow at the beginning.  Each of us just activating then drawing up.  I then deployed the Cantina with Vader/Tarkin and Ozzel there and he deploys Orimarrko and Epp Luke and Battles.  He slices Tarkin, I opt to not cancel a destiny and he plays Smoke Screen.  "Shucks!!!"  I can't cancle that, so I find out after the TD finds it in the glossary.  I lose Vader &amp; Tarkin and he loses noone due to a well drawn Dagobah: Cave as Destiny.  I clear the site next turn with Mara Jade and her stick.  I back her up there with ECC Iggy and ECC 4-lom, giving me a steady drain of 3 there the whole game.  He deploys Endor: Back Door and that becomes our new battleground.  We fight back and forth there and he ends up taking it with EPP Obi.  I am now draining for 3 at the Cantina and he is draining for 2 at the Back Door.  he deploys ECC Chewie at Tatooine: Jabba's Palace to try and get 2 more Force loss from me, but I just keep moving Mara and Droids back and forth, still getting a drain of no less than 2 each turn.  I finally drained him out.

Game 2 LS vs. Some Guy's Court Deck.
<br/>
<br/>
I started with the Yavin IV start and he thinks EPP's.  I deploy my first Nudj (Franky the Budwieser Lizard) and Artoo and insert.  Next turn Louie the Budwieser Lizard is deployed along with EPP Obi who clears two aliens from the Audiance Chamber and Obi dies too.  Numbers hit him for 6 and then I dropped Lando in Falcon with Boshek on his Zuckess in Mist Hunter and Dengar in Ship.  I had the Spiral there to take the damage from his destiny, but he loses everything there.  I then have a steady drain of 2 going at Kessel and then drop EPP Han &amp; ECC Chewie at JP: Audiance Chamber and then give him Civil Disorder.  He starts losing from that and from the drains.  Not much else happened in this game.

4(+32)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs Michael Girard's Defense Deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Michael was at 4(+32) as well, so we had to play.  He starts with some crap cards and basically, I didn't do too much to him in this game.  He has asked me to keep his deck quiet for now, so I won't say too much.  Sorry for this short one here.

<br/>
Game 4 LS vs Steven Smiths Yavin 4 Trooper Assualt deck.
<br/>
<br/>
I covered up his Swamp to start the game and deployed Franky, but Bubo came down and ate him, so Louie decided it would be best to stay in the deck.  EPP Luke killed Bubo and then I found out what his deck really was.  He deployed General Tagge then 9 Stoomtroopers and the started a battle.  I Sensed three Trooper Assualts before the battle could continue.  I had Savrip out, so I lost Luke and some guys out of my hand for the Damage.  I ended up getting a drain of two going at Yavin and a Drain of two going at the CC:Lower Corridor.  He had the Necklace out with a Jedi Lightsaber draining for 4 of the Top of my reserve deck at the Farm, so I ended up sending EPP Luke, EPP Leia, and EPP Han on A suicide mission against all them Troopers at the Farm.  I sensed his Trooper assualt again, but his drains had done me in.  It was a fun game.

I finished 5th.  I liked the LS deck, but the DS deck has some issues.  I have more work ahead of me.  Later all...
