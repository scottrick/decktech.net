<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">First off, it was posted that this tournament was to be held at 10 AM and the night before I was still without a light deck. So I set my alarm for 7AM so I have time to make one before I leave. Wake up and make the Info Broker's LS Grand Slam Deck and take my dark deck (possible to post later)to the tournament. I get there with friends to see that the store opens not at 10, but at noon. Thanks TR Brad Bedlion. "But I sent an emergency Email to everyone!!!" Everyone but me Brad.... anyways...

Game 1: My Dark Denial Beatdown vs. Chris Hines' TR Mains
<br/>
<br/>
I start D* with Crush and he's got the whole Yavin thing setup with the forest instead of the swamp. His first turn he gets Luke w/saber to the forest. I take drains of 1 for 2 turns while I mass a Vader, his saber and a couple of guys. I get down and battle, swing at Luke and miss. He plays Force Is Stong. Hits Vader with his swing. All my guys die. None of his. He drains slowly for 1 while I deploy sites and mass a bounty hunting squad. I place a U-3P0 at his forest and he brings out Wioslea to take him away. So Now at the forest he has Luke w/saber, Ori, Wioslea and U-3P0. My turn. Deploy Dengar w/gun, Jabba The Hutt, IG w/gun, 4LOM w/gun, and Dr. E. Initiate a battle, capture Luke, Shoot Orri with Dengar with the help of Surface Defense. Operate. I have 3 destiny but he cancelled 1 with DFTD by sacrificing U droid. Net result, he lost alot. I finally play an evader which e grabbed. he Revo's the farm where I had moved to and my Meditation Chamber. I drain slowly for 1 at the farm, and deploy J'Quille, Vader and Tarkin to the Med. Chamber. Not too eventful after that.
<br/>
FW (+17)
<br/>
Highs: Jabba's Hit squad being so effective
<br/>
Lows: Vader not survivng against the boy.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Profit vs. Tim "Info Broker's" HDADTJ
<br/>
<br/>
A game riddled in controversy. I don't remember much about the early stages of the game, so I'll pickup about midway through. The scenario is as follows. I have at the Tat: DB, Ben w/Leia's Gun, Master Luke (dsarmed), and Han Solo. His side has a Clashed DLOTS and Mara Jade w/saber and OTE on his side: also a Z in Mist Hunter at Kashyyyk.  also have at the Holo Theatre a bothan spy, and Momaw Nadon. I go from deploy phase to move phase and move Luke to JP. I say, "aww man. you won't let me go back phases will you?" (to battle Mara) he says "sorry man. actios are ok, but not phases." (or something to the effect of that). Ok. no big deal. I take the Luke movement back. His turn. He Elis' Mara to JP. Drain for 3. Lose 3 for clashed Vader at DB. He moves Mara in to face Leia who is at the AC. I go and fight Vader, weapon levitate his saber. Gift Of The Mentor. He missed the Han choke. I draw 6 in total destiny. He loses Vader and I bounce Luke. Move Leia away from Jade. His Turn. It is tight at this point. He is thinking hard and counting his force pile trying to setup a huge play. he keeps putting one card back and forth. then finally says, "drain at Kashyyyk". I lose from the drain. He deploys Vader to the Holo Theatre. He only had 6 active and he thought he had 7. He asks if it ok to activate 1 more. My thought is, "it's ok to take back actions, but not phases..." So I had to say no. He has no force left to battle. He loses 3 fr OTE. I get him with drains and Profit Damage. 
<br/>
FW(+6)
<br/>
Highs: Beating a high rated player and having a challenging game. 
<br/>
Lows: Having such controversy decide the outcome.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Profit vs. Chrs Hines' Sienar Fleet Systems
<br/>
<br/>
I was worried coz I had no space in my deck. His first turn deploys a TIE to Wakeelmui to make SFS immune to my Alters. My turn, draw a few. His turn. DLOTS to the Palace. I respond with a Luke w/saber. Battle. Hit Vader. He draws a 0 I draw a 2. Vader and 1. His turn. Undercover spies like never before seen. I finally rack up 10 lost cards and free Han. Prfit damage is offset by his SFS retrieval. Very non-interactive for awhile. I get enough sites where his spies can't cver everyplace and start managing some drains in addition to profit. By now he's got all the major drain systems up and running. I play a Surprise Assult and he loses 8 from it. He in turn plays a Short Range Fighters to retreve 9. It becomes a race and he almost has me. So I draw up an with one card left in my force pile, the last card I draw is  Double Agent. He drains and I lose all but 2 from my hand. My turn. Drain and profit leaves him with 2 cards left in his life force. Double Agent at the Cantina with Boush and his U-3P0. Drain for 2 more. 
<br/>
FW(+1)
<br/>
Highs: Winning a tight game
<br/>
Lows: Stress incurred by being on the verge of defeat...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: Dark vs. Kris Lavigne's Profit
<br/>
<br/>
The same profit that I am playing... what the hell. Anyways, We both keep activating and drawing. Finally I get bold. I deploy Secret Plans, Come Here Coward, Vader with a saber, Denger w/gun, and Ig w/gun. He deploys Boush with her gun. I put dwn 4-LOM w/gun and draw some. He breaks cover, deploys Luke w/saber, Lando w/gun and Orri but not before disarming IG. After the smoke clears, we both cleared each other out. After that I follow up with another Vader. He deploys and undercover spy to stop my drain. then he deploys ben to the AC to free han but retrival is cancelled coz of Come Here Coward. HAHAHAHAHA... My turn, deploy Jabba, Amananan, and Myo to AC. (this is where I mess up hard.) Battle. He frfeits Han, and I say 2 force and he's out of play. and he's like "oh I didn't know that. I'll loose Benm instead". shoulda made him lose Han... But anyway. He puts Uncontrollable Fury on Vader and then it is a drain race. I end up losing by 2. 
<br/>
FL(-2)
<br/>
Highs: Stopping his retrieval.
<br/>
Lows: Letting him have a take back that I shouldn't have allowed.
<br/>
<br/>
So final score 6(+22) and a second place finish.
