<br/>
<br/>
Girard and I head on off to Tucson for another one of Enrique Huearta's tournaments at Kards 4 You.  I am driving, and we are both very suprised that my car makes it down there in average time.  we show up at the the store, see that the YJ tournament is still going, so we walk on down to Target, where I was about an inch away from buying the Lego Millennium Falcon for $100.00.  We then walk back to the store and we wait around, then start.
<br/>
<br/>
LS - Mains &amp; Toys starting with Yoda's Hut and using Super Falcon to swat them damn TIES.
<br/>
<br/>
DS - BHBM High Destiny.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #1 DS vs. Andy Marchantel LS HB w/matching pilots/ships.
<br/>
Andy started using Squadron Assignments to get the SE pilots and their ships.  I set up drains on Endor with Lord Vader and Tarkin and I sent Zuckess in Mist Hunter and the rest of the Bounty Hunters in their rides against his SE stuff.  He was using A Few Maneuvers, about 8 of them for high destiny, but he would never draw them as destiny, just lose them off the top to drains.  The game was uneventful, and I drained him out after killing all of his pilots and ships.

<br/>
Game #2 LS vs. Andres Lopez Endor Operations.
<br/>
Andres is getting really good, infact he has owned me the last two times we have played.  He started with Operational as planned, pulling the DS2, Moff Jerrod or whatever his name is, and Perimeter Patrol.  He dropped Jerrod and Admiral Piett to the bunker, deployed the DS2, a DS2 sector, Kashyyk and drew up.  I dropped Blunt, and Obi to kill them two guys, and Obi only drew high enough to kill one, so Jerrod left the Bunker on his turn and shuttled up to the Devestator at Endor.  I later moved Obi-Wan with his lightsaber to the landing platform for a drain of 2, and then got out the Super Falcon (Capt. han, EPP Leia, R2-D2, ECC Chewie) and attempted to start destroying Star Destroyers.  Well, he had around 11 Star destroyers in the deck, and kept dropping them on the Falcon.  I would draw a 1 or a 2 whenever I drew destiny, so they stayed alive.  I ended up getting drained out.

<br/>
Game #3 LS vs. Daniel Collins SYCFA TIES deck.
<br/>
This time I found all of my ships.  He deployed two TIES the whole Game.  I dropped Home 1, Independance, Biggs, Wedge, and Blunt on a Death squadron Star Destroyer, and a Dreadnaught, and cleared the Sullest System.  Next turn I dropped the Super Falcon on the Flagship Executor and beat it like a small child.  Luke went to the Back Door and drained for 3 most of the game.  after a few battles it just took me time to drain him out.  
<br/>
FW +24
<br/>
4(+40)
<br/>
<br/>
Game #4 DS vs. Scot Vales EBO.
<br/>
This game went rather well for our hero.  I was able to drop Kuckess in Mist Hunter, ECC 4-Lom, Bossk in the Bus, and Fett in Slave 1 all on the Tantive and the Bright Hope, with random jabroni pilots on board.  I burned an extra Force to draw 4 battle destiny, and he lost most of his deck right there.  I had Vader and Tarkin sitting at the Back Door Force Draining for 3, and Mara Jade draining for 2 at the Endor Landing Platform.  I drained him out.
<br/>
FW +13
<br/>
6(+53)
<br/>
<br/>
So I ended up in 4th, Girard got 2nd, even though he went undefeated, but with a smaller differential than Steve Marshal who got first.  We drove back to Phoenix, to get ready for the Tournament at Gamers Edge, on Sunday.
<br/>
<br/>
I showd up at Gamers Edge and the store was still not open. Girard shows up, we talk abit about how we are playing each other this week in our Fantasy Football leauge and then teh store opens and we start playing.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks were the same, but more ships in the LS deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #1 DS vs. Michael R. EBO.
<br/>
I started the game very quickly, getting Lord Vader and Takin to the Endor Landing Platform around turn 3.  He set up EBo turn 4, but on my next turn I dropped Igar &amp; Tempest 1 at the North Ridge with Arnet &amp; Tempset Scout 1.  I moved Tempest 1 to the Main Power Genorators, completing Imperial Decree, so he never got a draining bonus.  He then dropped about 7 systems, with a lone starship at each.  So I dropped Bossk in the Bus, Dengar in Punishing 1 and Zuckess in MistHunter all at Kessel against a SE B-Wing.  I took him for the ship and 17 more Force from that battle.  I then blocked a Drain at Yavin IV with Bossk and one at Hoth with Dengar and Zuckess.  He moved his starships away during his turn, giving me 4 more Force Drain.  I then moved Bossk back to Kessel to blcok a drain there and then moved Dengar and Zuckess to Kiffex tpo block that drain.  Your Destiny did him in, due to him using Wormie to set up EBO and being scared to move him against Tempest 1, even after I told him it would be bad for me.

<br/>
Game #2 LS vs. Wyatt Everet's Biker Scouts with Guns and stuff.
<br/>
Turn two I grimtassh lost his hand, when he had 14 cards in hand.  I made him lose 6 Scout Blasters, 2 Speeder Bikes, and 2 get Along Side That One's.  I was able to keep killing his characters and save mine by using Savrip.  I love that card.  Jedi Luke took on DLOTS, a Biker Scout on a Bike and Sim Aloo, and he made them run from him.  The turn 2 Grimtash did him in.
<br/>
FW +20
<br/>
4(+48)
<br/>
<br/>
Game #3 DS vs. Don Anzalone's EBO.  
<br/>
I haven't lost a game to EBO with this deck yet.  I was able to get a fast start on him with Vader at the Endor Landing Platform  and I began Sensing any attempt to use an Interrupt.  I controled Hoth with some Bounty Hunter ships/pilots, and then controled Cardia with mara Jade in the Chimera.  He beat the hell out of the Chimrea, and then only got in one drain of 6, but I blocked his drain at yavin IV with Zuckess in Mist Hunter, carrying ECC 4-Lom, ECC IG-88, along with Dengar in Punishing 1 with them.  He drew up.
<br/>
FW +13
<br/>
6(+61)
<br/>
<br/>
Game #4 LS vs. aaron McCormack's SYCFA TIES.
<br/>
I added more ships to this deck just because of this guy and this deck.  he beat me last week with his TIES deck when I was trying out a Speeder deck, with a bad hangover.  So I got some ships out early, but he kept sending TIES against Jedi Luke at the Death Star Docking Bay, not taking any damage, retriving one Force, and then losing the TIE to his used pile.  I got GLG1 &amp; Tantive IV to the Death Star and he dropped a Dreadnaught and some TIES Interceptors and battled.  I lost only Biggs who was aboard the Tantive IV.  he did not save any Force and let me go.  My turn I dropped Home 1, Blunt on the Spiral, and Draw Their Fire.  I retrived 2 Force, and he could not play All Power To Weapons, and I drew a 5, and he lost alot.  I drained him from Milwaulkee, the Death star, Kiffex, then from Kessel.  He made one last ditch effort to get in the game by dropping Bossk in the Bus against DS2 Wedge in Red Squadron 1 at Kessel, but I Rebel Barriered him.  Next turn I dropped the Spiral and battled, but he drew a 5 and I drew a site, so the Spiral died.  I moved the Super Falcon up and let him go.  He did a suicide mission with Bossk but I played i Know and I had 39 power at the end, to his 13.  I won.
<br/>
FW +19
<br/>
8(+80)
<br/>
<br/>
I took second due to Patrick Hug beating Don by 19 and finishing with an 8(+86) record.  This is why whenever I run a tournament, it is 6 games so that there isn't 2 people undefeated at the end of the day.  I had fun and played well.  Thanks for reading.   </font></td>
