<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Prelude:  Stayed up waaaay too late and should have got more sleep. But I felt the need to go to 7-11 and get some food and stuff... at 1 AM. Got to sleep around 3. I set my alarm to get up around 8:30 but got up at 9:20 when the phone rings and John Spadora tells me he is coming to pick me up to go to the tourney. Half way there, I realize I forgot the prize support and I have no command cards. So we turn around, go to my house get the stupid CC packs and head to the store to make copies of the command cards. We get to Hobbytown USA around 10:15. Late. Even after I lectured Matt Berta about being there on time. My bad Matt. Anyways, Chris Hines (or Tim Guzman) got everyone ready, had them fill out cards and collected entry fees. Thanks guys. Anyways...

<br/>
There were a wide variety  of decks for only having 9 people show up. Tim had BHBM and a cool Training deck. Chris had ROPS and HB with mains. 
<br/>
<br/>
I saw for dark:
<br/>
2 Court Of The Vile Gangster
<br/>
1 TIE Swarm
<br/>
1 BHBM
<br/>
2 Hunt Down
<br/>
1 ROPS
<br/>
1 Set Your Course (saw Alderaan destroyed twice!!!)
<br/>
1 ISB
<br/>
<br/>
And for light there was:
<br/>
1 Profit
<br/>
1 Training (cool deck Tim)
<br/>
2 Hidden Base
<br/>
1 Dantooine Operations (got matched up Vs. ROPS. It was a slow game)
<br/>
1 Bespin Clouds 
<br/>
1 Elom Beatdown ("Matt’s ROPS Killa")
<br/>
1 Crazy Mains n Toys (what do you call it Noah?)
<br/>
1 There Is Good In Him
<br/>
<br/>
Tim "Info Broker" Guzman ended up winning the four game tourney, even though he only played 2 people (Noah Singer and Shane Watner). Matt Berta took second with Chris Hines in 3rd. The results were as follows:

<br/>
2nd: Matt Berta 6(+29)
<br/>
