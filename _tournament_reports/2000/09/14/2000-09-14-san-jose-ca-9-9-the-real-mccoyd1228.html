Back again, despite the school year starting, I still manage to find some time(its early in the school year) to manage to become a TD in my area, as well as host a few events in these few weeks. 
<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I also managed to get in some action myself at local San Jose, at Comics and Fantasies this week as well, in a tourney ran by Nick Stefanko, his last before moving to Santa Cruz for college.......TR happens NOW.....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prelude
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Schools starting to kick in, works starting to pile, and lifes starting to get hard again, and for some reason I didnt feel an urge to relieve some pressure with Star Wars this week.......having played in several tourneys over the past few weeks(finishing 3-1 in all of them), I decided I needed a break......so I planned to just chill this week and maybe get in some action next week.
<br/>
<br/>
But when I signed up to be a TD this past Wednesday, I had second thoughts and decided I did want to play, and a reminder on the listserv let me know about Nicks final tourney at San Jose, so I decided I needed to be there. Rides was another issue altogether, but as luck would have it, Kyle Ishimaru from Sacto provided(thanks to his friend Chris), and we were off......
<br/>
<br/>
I was too lazy to change my decks, seeing as how my DS was on fire and my LS was solid, I decided to keep BHBM(Who let the dogs out?) and my Throne Room Mains(Brahma Bulls Throne Room v2) and have another go at them. On to the games......
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Games
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs. Phillips Greens DS Ralops variant
<br/>
<br/>
He was pretty new to the game, one of the kids who also goes to the tourneys held in Los Gatos. He had a good jump on me, getting Bad Feelings early and me getting the crappy opening hand. I draw like crazy only to have him Monnok me, and I spend a few more turns drawing. I let him get set up, with Janus alone at one site, Davod Jon at another and a Walker and AT-ST dude in between. I drop EPP Obi, Alter the Bad Feelings, follow with Wedge and Tycho to Janus. I battle, Sense his react, hit Janus and cancel his destiny for a loss of 9. He drains for the next few turns, but stays away from Obi and his crew. I drop Jedi Luke, saber and Lock to Davod Jon, and cause him another 8 point loss and he flips back, never seeing the other side of his objective again. He tries to fight Obi a little, but to no avail, he cant get enough activation to make a comeback. Win by 28.
<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 2(+28)
<br/>
Highs: Getting off on the right foot
<br/>
Lows: Knocking on a scrub
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS BHBM vs. Steve Daniels LS MWYHL Test to 6
<br/>
<br/>
Ah great.....I hate MWYHL.....games are so slow with them. I drop Emporer to a dbay early, and Vader arrives next turn. He hands me EPP Luke, I go back and start dueling. After winning a few duels, he starts looking for Honor, but either activates it or cant find it. He drops RL in R1 to Rendili alone, and Im thinking hes asking for a beatdown, but he says he can take it, so Im like, "OK". I drop Dominator, Ozzel and Bossk to Rendili to start a battle. He reacts with Spiral, I Barrier......hes screwed. I draw high, he draws low, and ends up losing around 11 for Red Leader and one more to Insignificant, which happens to be Honor. He struggles to finish his tests from there, while I continue to duel he continues to train, and in the end I get him down to one force in his entire Life Force, and he ends up stacking it on Test 5, costing him the game(since you must complete Test 5(which also requires stacking a card there because of the objective) in order to retrieve via the objective, the Testing must be finished before the retrieval begins, hence he loses). Win by 18.
<br/>
<br/>
Cumalative Score: 4(+46)
<br/>
Highs: Playing Steve and continuing my record for the BHBM....18-0 and still going strong.
<br/>
Lows: Nothing much
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I end up at the top of the pack, but famished, I go with Steve to grab some grub before the 2nd round starts. We drive throught the McDonalds drivethrough, and Ive gotta say they have the WORST FRIES in the buisiness. The things looked more like soggy noodles than crispy fries when we looked in the bag, and mustve been preheated a dozen times. Fresh and hot my @$$. Regardless of that, we still ate it(hell, we PAID for it, minus well eat it), and got ready for the final round of the tourney......
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs. Brandon Bales DS BHBM Fighters Coming In
<br/>
<br/>
Well if I dont play someone in my car, its just not a tourney. He starts off with Emporer to the DS2 dbay, and backing him up with Sim. I drop Blount there and follow up with Obi and Leia, but Obi runs into a wall(Barrier). He comes down with DLOTS and saber, battles, I swing but miss Palapatine, he swings and hits Obi, and I end up losing everything to his attrition. from there he goes to the sky with Combat Response and Interceptors(did I mention I love these decks?), and I cant find a ship for the life of me. I draw life a madman, and end up looking like one after 3 turns of no ships in my hand except Home One(and after 3 turns of drawing, I realize I didnt drop the Battle Plan I had in my hand 12 turns ago). So I bring Nien to the War Room, Home One to Kashyyyk vs. a lone TIE, backed up with Tycho and his ship, and Falcon in the Hanger......I battle, draw high, he draws low, and loses the ship, and Falcon ends up with Legendary on it, which shouldnt be legal. Legend gets to him, but his drains are hitting me harder, and his constant battles with First Strike on table and stuff wore me down. Loss by 11.
<br/>
<br/>
Cumulative Score: 4(+35)
<br/>
Highs: Playing a good game, despite alot of mistakes
<br/>
Lows: TIEs......is there a cure?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I end up with a loss, Kevin Shannon works his way to 2-1 despite poor health and poor mistakes, Kyle Ishimaru joins the top ranks after beating Steve Daniel in the 3rd game(but.....HOW?).......I expect another round with Kevin, but Im paired with Brandon again. Oh well........time for some sweet BHBM revenge.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS BHBM vs. Brandon Bales LS Ol Skool Both Ops
<br/>
<br/>
I played this deck back in Pleasonton a few weeks ago, I beat it then, and should have no problem against it this time either. Emporer hits the Farm first turn, along with Rendili and a Dbay. I get a GOD opening hand, and with the generation I get I drop Vader to one site, Veer on Blizzard to another and Piett on Tempest to another. He cant believe it, and starts spreading out for the flip. I give chase, and back up Emporer with Janus, and cut his drains to 2 per turn. He demotes Veers for some reason(wasnt this meant for Sarkli?), and it just ends up getting Altered. I eventually pick up Sarkli, and he drops to the system on Dominator with Zuckuss to back him up, and after that, its smooth sailing from there. My drains work again, he cant draw destiny, I can, and I drop scrubs all over Bothaiwui and battle, causing another 6-7 cards to get stacked on Insignificant Rebellion. In the end, I own Bothaiwui, and he cant come back on it, and I drain him out for the win. Win by 26.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6(+61)
<br/>
Highs: Finishing strong....this monster is now 18-0
<br/>
Lows: Sarkli RIPS OPS APART......take it from me, he destroys ops. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Results
<br/>
<br/>
I end up with a high enough dif to earn me the win, and I get prize support early as Im doin a fun game with Kyle Ishimaru. I get another Chimaera, and give my other cards to Nicks friend, since hes new. Nick donates about 10 packs of Cloud City for my tournament the following day, and I stick around for another fun game before we take off for home........DS is now 19-0 after the fun games, and shows no signs of slowing down. 
<br/>
