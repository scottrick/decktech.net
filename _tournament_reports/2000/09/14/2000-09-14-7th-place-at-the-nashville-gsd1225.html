<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I’m playing Profit (Cuz I’m all about money), using Don&amp;#8217;t Tread On Me, for Scrambled Transmission and Ultimatum.  DS is Bring Him Before Me with IAO, Mob. Points and Resistance.
<br/>
<br/>
Only about 32 people there, but quality is huge.  Steven Lewis, Johnathan Chu, Clint Hays, Charlie Herren (Dagobah Regional Champion), Jim Sells, and others.  Chris Prascak flew, while TJ Holman drove 11 hours, from Philly.  What&amp;#8217;s all that about?  There were at least 5-10 other 1800+ rated people there, so I&amp;#8217;m hyped.  I don&amp;#8217;t want to play in a Grand Slam against weak people.  So as long as I win I&amp;#8217;ll get to play good people.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs random.player playing Profit
<br/>
The thing I remember most about this game was that he got The Force is Strong With This One on his first turn, AND his second turn.  I Monnok lost and get two TFISWTO, big surprise, and than on his third turn he gets another one, whatever...  Ben comes down to blocks Lord Vader and Stick drain.  He initiates a battle and I&amp;#8217;m like forget this, play The Circle is Now Complete ending that whole idea.
<br/>
win by 26
<br/>
<br/>
Top table time for me!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs Jim Sells (1872)
<br/>
He’s playing Court, starts Chall and Jabba.  His aliens deploy minus 2 and he converts my Audience Chamber!  I have two twix sites in my opening hand so I&amp;#8217;m activating like a king.  Game progresses, he gets Boelo and 3 or 4 other aliens in the Audience Chamber.  Jedi Luke, with his very own stick, goes to visit the Lower Corridor on CC.  So we drain each other for a while.  Ben comes down, he plays None Shall P@#$%, I Sense and lose 2 for Do or Do Not, Ben’s stick comes down, Boussh comes down, break cover, Boush gets her dads stick, initiate battle.  He tries to trap door Ben, I Sense lose two for DorDN.  Hit Chall, and Boello, Smoke Screen for 6 (Boello can’t cancel that bad boy).  He loses 2 characters to the Smoke Screen, and the two that were hit.  His character count goes from 6 to 2 and I lose no one.  Why, you ask, because Ben Kenobi is the absolute best character in the game.  By busting Han out I retrieve 10, and the game is in hand.  Jim fights it out like a champ, at one point he Trap Doors Han to the Rancor Pit!  I&amp;#8217;m in a total quandary.  During the game I got to check his deck with a verification, and notice Ooota Goota.  So I can Nabrun Han back to JP:AC, or hope he doesn&amp;#8217;t have the Rancor.  Either way Han could eat the big one, and bring Jim back into the game.  I decide he probably has the Rancor, and I PRAY he doesn&amp;#8217;t have Ooota Goota.  Sure enough he doesn&amp;#8217;t have Ooota Goota and Han wipes the sweat off his brow.
<br/>
Win by 21
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs random.1800 rated player (or so he said)
<br/>
He plays Bring Him Before Me.  3rd turn or so Jedi Luke takes his stick to the Lower Corridor, I figure I will let him capture Luke if he wants to.  I will damage him for one on his turn and he can only hit me for two (if Vader gets a stick), and since IAO is down Vader would be stuck.  He takes a different option though.  Lord Vader, with his stick, visits the Aud Chamber.  I am confused, and a little surprised. At this point he has not done any damage to me, and now he is placing his strongest character at a non drain site.  But than I @#$%ume maybe he is trying to keep Han from being freed.  His next turn he tries to drain me, and I&amp;#8217;m like you cant drain me.  He looks shocked, and realizes his mistake.  Next turn Mara shows up with her stick at T:JP, and Vader stays inside.  Early in the game I got Order To Engage down.  I know he is playing Circle, thanks to deck verification, and he had Altered one of my Senses earlier.  Surprising me, because he had started Do or Do Not.  So before I make a move I make sure I have 3 Senses in hand.  Down comes Ben, and his stick, in front of Mara, I’m not going to battle just use my ’escape’ card to jack him up with Order to Engage.  He surprises me again.  After I deploy Ben he You Are Beaten’s him.  I’m thinking to myself, uh....  So he loses You Are Beaten, next turn he loses 3 force to Order, cuz Ben cant be battled duh!  He walks Vader over and plays Circle, I Sense, he Alters, I Sense, he Alters, I Sense, he’s got nothing else.  Mara walks over to the Aud Chamber.  Otherwise I could have busted Han out.  Next turn he battles, I Narrow Escape in front of Mara, and he loses 3 more force for Order to Engage.  He has issues with that mechanic.  I am like whatever, game.
<br/>
What’s up with me not freeing Han for like the 2nd time ever?
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Steven Lewis (2030)
<br/>
Come and Bring it
<br/>
He’s playing HB, this DS deck is less than stellar.  I start Battle Order, instead of Resistance.  The reason is because he played Strike Planning.  That Effect leads me to believe he will pull Endor, and General and ship, for a quick drain.  Which is exactly what he does.  Activate 3 go get a DB, and notice my Emperor is in the 3 force, uh...  Vader, and his stick, went to E:DB early, and he pulls Farmboy on his next turn to start some more force loss.
<br/>
On the good side, I probed his HB on the first try, out of like ten systems on the table.  Game decision that may, or may not, have affected the outcome, he was waxxing me pretty well anyway.  I’ve got 14 force, and need to save 2 for destiny.  Activate 12, spend 12 to drop ship and dude to Bossk’s site, Lateral Damage Falcon w/ Chewie and Han, battle for free.  He plays Alternatives to Fighting, I Sense (goodbye first destiny my first stacked 5), he than plays Spiral, I sense (goodbye all destiny, which was the other 5), he draws 2 destiny totaling 7 destiny, and loses Chewie and Han to cover battle damage.  I have to lose everything or fear a beatdown on a lone Dreadnaught.  I could have simply allowed the Alternatives to Fighting, which would mean I would have 3 battlegrounds to satisfy Resistance (he was draining for 3 at Kessel and 4 some other place and doesn’t have Battle Order satisfied), or never gone to space, and just dropped Tempest 1 and dude to the Back Door.  He wins by 15 or so
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 vs Josh Koziara (1800)
<br/>
He’s testing Luke full, does this game deserve an explanation?  I mean Vader came down 2nd turn and once I satisfy Honor by 4th or 5th turn he loses 3 a turn before my turn starts.  With him losing 5-8 force a turn his deck is crumbling.  Near the end of the game he spends about 5 force with Electrobinoculars to stack a destiny, after which I promptly play Omni Box and ruin that idea.
<br/>
Win by 20+
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 vs Steven Lewis (2030)
<br/>
If I win I finish 2nd, and would be in the duel for the title.
<br/>
He’s playing Court, same setup as Jim’s.  Only this time I’m playing Steven, big difference.  I bust out Han using Someone Who Loves You, retrieving 10 to his surprise.  The game is headed my way, but I had to run to the dungeon, after I freed Han, which just totally sucks.  Because now I cant satisfy Ultimatum, or do Profit damage with Han.  He simply had to big a stack of people outside at T:JP for me to move there.  At the time I had no battle escape cards.  Game settles in and his second to last turn is one of two determining factors that end this game.  He has like 5 or 6 force left, and he will lose at least 5 on my turn.  I’ve got like 13, he hits me for 6 with drains.  I decide to keep Lando w/ Gun instead of my Rebel Barrier.  Down comes Danz Borin, Scum and Villainy, and First Strike.  He retrieves 3 I lose 1.  I guess that Barrier would have helped.  He than steps in front on my drain of 3 at the Dungeon.  My only chance is a Nabrun, although I can @#$%ume he has Oota Goota in his hand.  I look at him and say ’Sometimes it comes down to if you have one card’, he does, game.
<br/>
Lose by 6
<br/>
<br/>
End up 7th, and get a Tarkin T-shirt.  Apparently you could only get a Tarkin T, back in the day, if you were a TD.
