<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Sorry this isn’t as good as my normal TReports but it seemed
<br/>
to go by very fast.
<br/>
<br/>
# of Players : 8 ( Sanctioned )
<br/>
TD : Richard Davis
<br/>
<br/>
Decks : 
<br/>
LS - Scout Craze w/ Good Objective. Lots of guys
<br/>
DS - Anti-Profit.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : My LS vs. Philip Vasquez’s BHBM (1500s)
<br/>
<br/>
	I get my stuff set up right away and drain him with
<br/>
Super Luke for a lot.  I beat him up once at his Docking Bay 
<br/>
and stack 2 cards on my objective. He deploys Lots of TIEs
<br/>
up to Mon Calamari but doesn’t have SFSystems or much. He
<br/>
had like 3 Emperors and 3 Lord Vaders but didn’t really 
<br/>
matter. I win handily by 27. Record : 2 (+27)
<br/>
<br/>
High : Winning
<br/>
Lows : nothing
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : My DS vs. Jeff Alexander’s Good Objective (1700s)
<br/>
<br/>
	Hmm. I get my Tatooine stuff and draw like crazy.
<br/>
I’ve got like a 20 card hand and he’s got lots of space stuff
<br/>
so I’m drawing a lot to figure out what I’m gonna do. Vader
<br/>
and Stick are holding Luke at his Endor Docking Bay and
<br/>
Boelo is in the Chamber while I’m using Search and Destroy
<br/>
to do my damage. Battle Order is slowing the game down which
<br/>
is a bonus in my favor I think. He gets out Boussh and drops
<br/>
a pilot down to fulfill Search and Destroy. I drop Mara and
<br/>
Evazan and I chase him around for basically the rest of the
<br/>
game. He deploys Kessel and move Home One over to Kessel
<br/>
leaving two matching pilots to hold Tatooine. I deploy 
<br/>
IG-2000w/ IG and Fett in Ride and draw a 9 destiny to get
<br/>
rid of Home One and retrieve/lose with First Strike. So now
<br/>
I get free drains. Obi-Wan comes down to run around with
<br/>
Boussh and finally they stand up and are force to fight so
<br/>
I operate on Boussh ( I remembered the +1 from Oppressive
<br/>
Enforcement for Executor and that was the difference ) use
<br/>
4-LOM to cancel Ben’s immunity and Ben’s gone. Search and
<br/>
Destroy and that’s pretty much game. Win by 12 I think.
<br/>
Record : 4 ( +39 )
<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Winning when I had some mistakes , not losing a 
<br/>
battle.
<br/>
Lows : Having to draw a gazillion.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : My LS vs. David Irvine’s Scum deck (2000s)
<br/>
<br/>
	I get setup again and hit him with Super Luke Drains.
<br/>
I send Harc seff and people over to Jabba’s Palace to seal a
<br/>
drain or two. Stack a card here and there and the drains were
<br/>
what really killed him. Win by 18. 6 ( +57 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highs : I think this is the first time I’ve beaten David.
<br/>
Lows : IG-88 captured EPP Leia , IG is annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 : My DS v. Andrew Wise’s Profit Deck (1700s)
<br/>
<br/>
	Well my Deck is Anti-Profit and his is Profit
<br/>
so you probably figure out what is gonna happen. I get
<br/>
everything running pretty smooth and its brutal for him.
<br/>
I think the worst part was Choke Vader w/ Stick versus
<br/>
Geezum and Crix Madine. I choke Geezum which is expected
<br/>
but I go to hit Madine and he plays Dodge. For those that
<br/>
don’t know Dodge subtracts 3 from every weapon destiny so
<br/>
my total weapon destiny is -6 and Crix is value of 3 so
<br/>
I need a 10 to hit him and I get it so he loses like Crix
<br/>
and 8 and then later Vader crushes and Arcona for 6-7
<br/>
more. I also had Occupation and Search and Destroy up,
<br/>
Honor of the Jedi saved him lots of Force as did ICBWorse
<br/>
but the damage was pooring in from everywhere. Win by 32.
<br/>
Record : 8 ( +89 )
<br/>
<br/>
Highs : Win the tournament. First tournament after Dagobah
<br/>
Regionals and I did okay.
<br/>
Lows : Really destroying Wise. 
<br/>
<br/>
I’m sorry this is such a small TReport but it just kinda 
<br/>
seems like a blur so I’ll go with some Tournament Observations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tournament Observations : 
<br/>
-Decktech seems to have a strong influence , little kids had
<br/>
really good decks they just needed to learn how to play them.
<br/>
-Dodge is insanely good.
<br/>
-Profit needs force.
<br/>
-Lots of characters is the way to go.
