<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This weekend a big star wars ccg event happened in Vasteras, Sweden. Even though it was not a real convention, it was called King Con. This was the first big star wars event ever in Vasteras. Four tourneys were planned: 
<br/>
<br/>
-the battle of hoth (scenario, collect &amp;#8220;scenario points&amp;#8221; to win the game by for example crashing a vehicle or eating something with the wompa)
<br/>
-young jedi 3 rounds swiss.
<br/>
-sealed deck &amp;#8211; 4 premiere boosters, one reflection booster
<br/>
-3 rounds of swccg swiss.
<br/>
<br/>
It all started at 12 on Saturday. Around 20 players were estimated, but only 8 players (i think) showed up the first day, some preferred laser tag, others had a hangover.  The hoth scenario was the first tournament. I had spent some time thinking of what to use in this scenario. Since you could only use hoth locations, revolution was an easy choice for LS, dark had to be a defensive deck with LOTS of S/A/C, nightfall, exposure and too cold for speeders. The games are not worth mentioning I think, nothing exciting at all happened. I lost one game, and won the others, and that won me the tournament and a reflections booster I think.
<br/>
<br/>
After that it was time for YJ. Now, this is a swccg site, so I don&amp;#8217;t care about telling you what happened, just that went 4-2, placing 4th. Late the same day, the sealed deck was held. I got to play LS (sucks), but I got the rendezvous point, traffic control, surprise assault, mantelian savrip and a corvette. I put like 15 destiny 6 cards in (droid shutdown, lift tube, a few maneuvers etc.), and based the deck on those cards. With traffic control, I could draw all cards, putting the high destinies back, and when I had the savrip out I could battle him anywhere. The high destinies saved me, and I won 3 of 4 games. Winner of that tournament was Patrik Wallgren (who I bet in my first game). I placed second.
<br/>
<br/>
The first day of King Con was to an end around 11 o&amp;#8217;clock. I went home to eat and sleep, while some of the others stayed at the tournament area playing some stupid card game called doom trooper until half past 3. I had 2 LS decks to choose between for LS: the Martin Falke deck (which is better) and the speeder ops beatdown (clint hays style). I choose the speeders, since I knew the falke deck wont win to raltiir ops, and I knew for sure I was gonna face it (at least my friend Patrik would use it). For dark side the choice was all to easy &amp;#8211; my raltiir ops. I put in a monnok and a masterful move (since everyone thinks I don&amp;#8217;t play those cards). I got to bed early to get enough sleep, sleeping is good for you concentration (at least if you convince yourself it is!).

Sunday morning.
<br/>
<br/>
I come to the convention right on time (10 am). Since some of the players had been sleeping there, it smelled monkey, I hardly couldn&amp;#8217;t breathe. It was also freezing outside, so we couldn&amp;#8217;t keep the windows opened for long. I guess I got used to it after an hour or so, course I forgot it when the first game started. We started like 11 am, star wars players never arrive on time. Now to the games!
<br/>
<br/>
LS Vs Magnus Hansson.
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I see the Bespin objective I think I&amp;#8217;m screwed. Opperatives should have no chance as long as they get it going quite fast, use battle order and stay indoors! howeder, he neither started battle order, stayed indoors nor was fast. I flipped and drained him fast on clackdor, and then I drew for speeders. He just had 2 CC locations in play, one of them exterior. He put out Bewil, Dengar with blaster and one more guy on endor, but Dengar was barriered, and the next turn a I got a speeder- beatdown for 15-something. That was definitely game, after that I drained him to death, I don&amp;#8217;t think he drained me for a single card in this game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +27
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Winning to This deal&amp;#8230;, getting a fair starting hand, and don&amp;#8217;t facing a single cards that this deck does not like.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Not very fun&amp;#8230; this game was over in like 10 minutes.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
<br/>
Next, I&amp;#8217;m pared with Tony, a player who has come all the way from southern Sweden for this even.  I play dark side, so I&amp;#8217;m quite confident.
<br/>
<br/>
Tony plays an alderaan opperatives deck. I star battle order as always against that objective. I get a decent starting hand, and I flip early in the game. At this time I&amp;#8217;m not too sure he plays opperatives &amp;#8211; I haven&amp;#8217;t seen much of his deck, and he plays Tatooine docking bay. He gets some EPP Luke to Raltiir, but forgets the reacting, and he dies accomplishing nothing. I also get Zuckuss in m.h and bossk in tooth to kashyyyk to get around battle order, and for a steady drain of 5. All of a sudden he makes his move &amp;#8211; plays Wind chimes to get opperatives, deploys those with speeders and melas. No big deal, at this time I have searched for what I need, so I deploy and beats most of them away. His next turn he clashes Vader, and battles away tarkin and a tempest scout with ben. In my turn, I battle his last opperatives away with IG88. His turn again: here comes the tricky move: he deploys lots of mains and stuff all over the table, Han at the tatooine docking bay and then our most desperate hour on Han targeting alderaan. Then he transit Han to alderaan, and even though we were not sure this works, I didn&amp;#8217;t mind all too much, since I knew I would not loose any more card this game, and first strike was on table so I could retrieve some. So next turn I drain for 7, battle him at three places, and win the game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +26
<br/>
4 (+53)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: None that I can think of really, it was a good game, even though it was an easy win.
<br/>
Lowlights: ditto.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
<br/>
LS Vs Passi Kohlemainen.
<br/>
<br/>
Passi starts ISB opperations, and once again I think I&amp;#8217;m screwed. However, I neither see a bright center nor battle order as starting effect, so I&amp;#8217;m happy so far. I flip early again, he deploys lots of 2/2 locations, and I discover it is some kind of flipÂ´n drain deck. He drops agents at 3 different sites, plus to a clakdor site. Next turn I drop 4 speeders to his clackdor agent, frozen assets and draw their fire. Passi plays slip sliding away (!) relocating it to the bottom. I battle him anyway, making him loose like 5-10 force (he had some strange interrupt that reduced the battle damage). I draw, and get 4 new speeders. he drains me for some in his turn and deploys a starship to his endor, but still no battle order. My turn, drain for 8, then I drop my 4 speeders at forrest clearing and battle. Same as last turn, he looses some force. I once again draw exactly 4 more speeders, and battle him at another location in my next turn. I drain him for much, and he can&amp;#8217;t stant it for long. 
<br/>
<br/>
FW +20
<br/>
6 (+73)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Same as game 1, I don&amp;#8217;t face any evil battle order or other nasty cards. Drawing what I needed all the time.
<br/>
Lowlights: Well, none really, not a fun game though, but there are seldom fun games with this deck!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
<br/>
DS Vs Patrik Wallgren
<br/>
<br/>
Here comes the big challenge; Patrik is my worst enemy in this tournament. I think I know about what he plays, and I am right: hidden base with 2/2 pilots. I feel confident, I have always won when we playtested before.
<br/>
<br/>
My first turn I get 2 raltiir sites out, along with dagobah cave. I draw for imperials and a fast flip. He deploys 4 systems in his first turn. Now he will get plenty of activation, so I don&amp;#8217;t flip this turn, and keep drawing for AT-ST&amp;#8217;s. In his turn he gets a corvette with 2 ability 2 pilots to raltiir. In my turn I activate, and I have a total of 14 force. I make a big mistake: I deploy Vaders shuttle to raltiir. Rebel Barrier. Ok, I was expecting this, and realize I didn&amp;#8217;t play Oppressive enforcement as I had though of doing. Damn. I decide to pay 3 to grapple the barrier anyway. I now deploy Zuckuss in Mist hunter to raltiir. He says &amp;#8220;it can wait&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; damn&amp;#8230; what is this... I didn&amp;#8217;t think of this card at all! Zuckuss is back in hand, Vader&amp;#8217;s shuttle is facing a corvette with 2 Pilots and I have 3 force in my force pile&amp;#8230; what to do now? I realize this might be game, but I deploy DS-61-2 to the shuttle, with arrest order on table, he may cover for some of it anyway. His turn, he deploys lots of things to raltiir. I play omni box to remove his tracked few maneuvers. He battles the poor shuttle. I manage to draw Ozzel for destiny, so I have to loose 10 force beyond shuttle and pilot. Definitely game I thought when I also threw security precautions, masterful move and shocking revelation to this force loss.
<br/>
<br/>
However, he apparently didn&amp;#8217;t see that security precautions was lost, so I came back to the game. I flipped, so he couldn&amp;#8217;t drain for much, and I got some time to get the right cards and come back to space. He noble sacrificed some character at one time. He deploys Order to engage. I alter order to engage, but wise gets it to used pile, and he tunnel visions for it next time anysay. After a while I get Bossk in tooth, Devastator, Vader, 2 AT-ST pilots as attrition fother. Tracked destinies Gives me a total of attrition 14, and he have to avoid my space fleet in space. He flips, but I don&amp;#8217;t mind probing since I don&amp;#8217;t have sec.prec and he has got lots of systems in play. I&amp;#8217;m desperately looking for battle order, since that one would win me the game. (I have a constant drain on raltiir, he drains for a maximum of 1 each turn). When I finally draw it for battle destiny I track it, draw it and deploy it. I follow his ships in space, and to be able to drain at all he has to occupy one of my raltiir sites, so he shuttles 2 pilots down in front of an AT-ST and a pilot. I activate 5 of my totally 7 life force, deploy IG88 with blaster there, battle, capture one of them and draw 5 for destiny. Game.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +7
<br/>
8 (+80)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Very good game! I was dead-concentrated after that shuttle-incident. Managing to win, despite that beatdown. Patrik not realizing Sec.Prec was lost!
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights: Making a mistake that could have meant a loss.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5.
<br/>
<br/>
LS against&amp;#8230; Patrik Wallgren again. I know he plays an almost identical version of my Raltiir deck, but probably with a few modifications to beat just this deck. I draw a really crappy starting hand (no opperative, just speeders), however, he doesn&amp;#8217;t draw any locations, so that is even. I check my force pile each turn for opperatives, but there is no sign of them. The 4th turn I have maneuvering flaps in play. I decide to draw over the 12-card limit, I think he has got a monnok in his deck, but I realize I have no chance of winning unless I flip. So I draw until I have like 25 cards in hand (13 speeders, 3 opperatives, a monnok would mean a big loss for me. He activates, and goes for something with the objective. He finds nothing and I point out he has to deploy something with it, so he is forced to deploy an AT-ST pilot. He deploys tempest scout 2 to protect him, and then desperately draws for the monnok, but he doesn&amp;#8217;t find it! I feel good!!! Activate, flap the flaps, deploy the vehicle droid and13 speeders for a total of 4 (4) force, mechanical failure, Draw their fire, battle. Total power of 50 Vs total of like 3..GaMe!
<br/>
<br/>
FW +24
<br/>
10 (+104)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: He didn&amp;#8217;t draw the monnok!!
<br/>
Lowlights: what can I say, this deck is dead-booring.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
<br/>
Last game, I have too loose by 30+ not to win the tournament. With my DS deck this is impossible. I get to play Passi again, this turn his Light deck. He plays hidden base with asteroids. He gets it out quite quick, though my alters and starships manage to keep the force loss low. I drain him for at least 4 each turn. He tries with Kessel run, but alter is there. His starships in the asteroids get blown away all the time. He flips the objective, but I find the base (without sec.prec. in play). He doesn&amp;#8217;t really have any power ships, so my ships rule space, and I drain him to death.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +24
<br/>
Total score 12 (+119)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Vader&amp;#8217;s shuttle ruled this game!
<br/>
Lowlights: I was never close to loosing, no challenge.
<br/>
<br/>
I win this tourney, great! Too bad all expected players didn&amp;#8217;t show up, that would have been a lot more fun! I win the King Con Tee shirt (with a picture of king kong being attacked by tie fighters on it, nice job on this one Erik/Emil!). In the prize support consisting of unlimited boosters (yes it&amp;#8217;s true, premiere unlimitied!) I got obi-wan and falcon, not bad! This whole weekend was really fun, hopefully we will see more of those in the future!!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Erik Hansson for the Event, and for letting me borrow those rebel snowspeeders!
