<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This Saturdays Tournament was hosted by Rogue 7, Martin Norris, at Broken Games in Lake City, Washington.  We had 11 players show up, with Endor notibles Mike Mikaelian, and Douglas Harvilla.  This was a 6 round affair, so were looking at a long day ahead.
<br/>
<br/>
Deck Selection:  
<br/>
Lightside, I brought my Profit deck, unmodified (meant to do some manip protection, but, time got away from me.)
<br/>
Darkside.  Destiny adding Imperial madness.  (Huntdown, CTR, adders galore)
<br/>
<br/>
Onto the games: (I apologize, I didnt recored differentials)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1.  Ls vs. Matt Bryants Abyssin Swarm deck:
<br/>
He chooses to start Myo and Jabba in the chamber.  Well, over the first few turns, Im getting set up, while hes just piling on the abyssings in the chamber.  So, Im slowly getting stuff down, (not getting drained, so Im not to worried right now), Boussh comes to play, with her gun, and Im working on getting his none shall passes out of hand (bouncing a free luke for a couple turns.)  So, Im at 10 cards lost, so now is time to act.  I rescue Han, and move away with him and leia. (Narrow escape and fallen portal in hand.)  I get moved outside the palace, evade some peoples (abyssins everywhere), and get an Obi, Luke, Orimarrko squad to the Chamber.  I battle, bounce Myo(this way, I can surprise assualt his 8 abyssins at JP) and Clear a lot of the site, but lose all three.. (this was good though).  So his turn, drain 1, surprise assault, lose 10.  From here, I get order to engage, fallen portal, and luke plinking for 3 in the cantina (drain and flip side loss).  I win pretty easyly, because of crushing, running and lose three damage.

Highlights:  Beating an alien swarm deck, only LS winner of the round
<br/>
Lowlights:  I have to play Harvilla next.  Well, at least its out of the way.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  DS vs. Harvillas Lightside huntdown deck (youd have to see it played)
<br/>
Well, Im playing Doug.   I joke around with him saying, I made this new deck, if it wins, its my Harvilla tech, if it loses, I made it in a drunken stooper  (I wasnt really drunk, but I had some drinks Friday night before I made the deck).  Okay, the game.  He starts the typical MWYHLed and I huntdown..  Okay, so I have a location, but just save up force (he plays 3 obis apperations).  I get out Vader, Tarkin, Motti at Dark Forest I believe.  He drops, Obi, Han, Leia.  Battles.  I play Charmiong to the last, I have you now.  After weapons, and choking, and destiny, Vader and Leia remains.  So I go,  disarm Leia, drop IG-88, battle.  I attempt to capture, and succeed.  So I have now efectivally knocked out most his adders.  Well, I contol the game, my damage at the Dark forest and Is enough to counter his Death star drain, and I put some shmoes to block him on the Big E.

Highlights:  Beating Doug at his own game (force denial and adders) and he himself saying it.
<br/>
Lowlights:  I forgot CHYBC oops!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:   DS vs. James Canova toshe tech deck.(and harvest)
<br/>
Well, I get vader down turn 2, start getting some damage in.  Obi dies.  Okay, Ive nailed him for a lot of force, but here comes the harvest!.  So, Im draining at the hut, hes retrieving at the farm.  Something has to give.  So, I Elsi Vader to the Farm, Disarm Obi-Wan, deploy Tarkin, and Tagge I think. Look at my reserve deck at my destiny (seeing If I want to duel.  Okay, theres a couple 5s, a 6, and the rest are 1s (11 cards total)(crap).   So I wait  His turn, he battles.  I play I have you now, Charming to the last, Dark collaberation, Your powers are week old man.  I get 8 draws, for an attrition of  11 (got those 1s gon, and zeros.)  so, Vader is left, as are Ben, Luke and Han.  So he moves to the cantina.  I have him tell me the order.  Its Obi, Luke, then Han.  So ben moves, and the I V.O Luke (I have focused attack, and I know I have a 5 and a 6 coming.  I draw a 5, 6, 1 and Luke is mine.  So my turn, I activate to the 1, Elsi Vader, Duel Ben, draw a 5 and a 6, and commence beatings on Han.  So, a one turn swing that won me the game.  Huge.

Highlights:  Two Successful Duels.  Yes!
<br/>
Lowlights:  None, it worked great.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  Profit deck Vs. James Canova ISB docking bay drain. (and 14 scanning crews)
<br/>
Okay, James first turn, Hoth Docking bay, Yavin Docking bay, Scaning crew, scanning crew, Sundown on coruscant, deploy coruscant docking bay with IAO, and two ISB agents, move for free to the two rebel base sites, flip.  (WOW!)  Impressed I am.  Okay, so with his HUGE amount of scanning crews, It takes me hella tunrs to get people in play (no shocking to my hand, urg.  Well, In one tuurn, I draw 7 rebels.  He screws them all!  Wow.  Im hitting 10 loss a turn, and finally, get a couple hitters out, and with some narrow escape action through docking bays (Juz ruled yes) and Order to engage,and Fallen Portal, and sheer play skill, I win by 3.  Tough game, that would have been insanely easier with 1 scrambled transmission.

FW by 3
<br/>
Highlights:  Winning a game purely on my playskill
<br/>
Lowlights:  To lasy to change my deck, and it almost bit me on the ass.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  DS vs. Nick Jones Hidden base.
<br/>
Im worried this game.  I have 3 ships in my deck.  Thats it.  Well, Vaders taking his time to come out, so I drop zuckus in mist hunter to Kessel.  So, Vader makes hi appearance on Endor, and Im hitting him with my drain of 1 (hes tableing the 3 from Vader) But visage is doing its thing.  He really slow getting ships out, and I get Mara and sabre on CC.  His turn, he deploys Obi, Luke, and Leia to Maras location.  Okay, let me think here.  If I let this battle happen, Im going to lose a ton, if I duel and win, Im going to win this game, and If I duel and lose, itll still be less than battle damage.  WTF, Duel Luke!  Guess what, I win.  So he decided not to battle.  My turn, deploy forfiet fodder, Battle Obi and Leia (I disarmed Obi) and hack Obi the second try, and know him out with attrtion.  After this, I control the game.  Probe the base, the turn he flips.  As a lst ditch effort, he drops Ben on Vader with no reserve.  Circle.  Game over.

Highlights:  Dueling them both, and winning again!
<br/>
Lowlights.  Being almost caust with my pants down againt HB.  Thank god for Zuckus anf 4-Lom on baord.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  Ls vs. Nick Jones Huntdown.
<br/>
Well suck, Even If I lose this game by a card, and Harvilla wins his game, he gets the tourny.  I must not lose.  Okay, well I start losing to visage for a couple, get my trans term, cancel it.  Drop Luke at JP, go.  (6 cards lost I think)  He drops Vader, Battles, I hack Vader, and play you will take me to Jabbas now to relocate luke to the Chamber (Jabba is there)  Battle over, Vader dead.  Woohoo.  Okay, so I get set up some more, getting Leia at Audience chamber, and Luke back at JP.  Okay, I someone han, flip, deploy Ben and hold position. (also deployed No Disentigrations).  Move Luke Over.  Disarm 4-Lom, thn Clash Jabba.  So now its just 4-lom and Fett vs. the gang.  I play corellian retort, to ass a destiny.  With his destiny, I lose Han, make him lose three to no disentigration, then revive Han with Ben.  So, I begin to spread a bit, and have Luke at the Judland waste blocking a Vader/Dr. E drain.  He drops Tarkin, and battles, I narrow escape away.  (found out later, he was going to duel in the battle)  So, I drop Tamteel, and move luke Over to the waste again.  I clash Vader.  So, he decides to Elis the three people to Jabbas Palace (to Leia) and desides to Battle with Tarkin and the Dr.  so I attempt to crush tarkin (miss) and then I help me obi wan and move luke over.  I bounce Dr. E, Sabre Tarkin, and play Skywalkers.  Lose Tarkin and 10 more.  This assured the game for me.
