<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well seeing as how my week to date has been horrible, with Superman: Ride Of Steel at Six Flags New England crashing and me being sick as a dog, hopefully the release of Coruscant can save the day.  Red84 Josh Radke is running a non-sanctioned Sealed Deck tournament and of course I&amp;#8217;m ready to go.  I get there at about 5:30 after getting sadly lost trying to sneak around rush hour traffic in Bristol.  I hear it from everyone, I get over it, get my boxes, begin opening.  Look at the bottom of this thing for my list of pulls.  While I&amp;#8217;m here I decide to get a box of Raw Deal: Backlash.  Turns out to be a good idea.  But I digress.  6:00 rolls around, people come to order.  It turns out that there&amp;#8217;s 12 players and this is gonna be a short tournament, since people have to leave at nine.  I pull light side out of a hat (rather, an empty box of Coruscant) and sit down with Josh, Charlie Hoffman, and a few other guys to draft.  12 players, 6 people per table, it just worked out.  Notable at the other table were Dan and Pat Long, Steve Brentson, and Frank, our local supplier.  We had 2 Tatooine packs each, 4 Coruscant.
<br/>
<br/>
First pack, Tatooine, it&amp;#8217;s a dark side rare that I laughed at, I think it was A Million Voices Crying Out.  I mumble something about bad quality and grab Mos Espa.  Get my next choice from Charlie (I&amp;#8217;m between Charlie and Josh)  He gives me a Padme.  I smile, take it, pass.  As the packs dwindle, I notice no one taking the podrace stuff.  I decide to mop some of it up, at the very least the high destiny stuff.  Good plan, or so it seemed.  Next Tatooine pack I open I pull Anakin&amp;#8217;s, and pray Charlie gets the podrace.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t, in fact, no one did.  So that strat is dead.  Somewhere in here I remember to get characters with ability regardless and end up grabbing Caldera Righim, Grugnak, Loci, plus some sites and the more useful interrupts.  I ended up getting stuck with 4 rule cards.  Oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
First Coruscant pack, Josh hands me the Jedi Council Chamber.  Bingo, I have a starting location.  I had grabbed Ki-Adi-Mundi from my pack, so I was beginning to get a good feeling.  Got a sense, couple other goodies including Mindful Of The Future and Security Control.  This gives me a bad feeling, if people are passing these, what are they pulling???  Hm.  Oh well.  Next pack, I pass P-60 to Josh.  Even trade I&amp;#8217;d say.  I get passed Madakor, then two consecutive packs with a Republic Cruiser in it.  So I grab those, and I coulda sworn I grabbed Coruscant, but I didn&amp;#8217;t because I&amp;#8217;m a scrub like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Third pack, I open it up and see Shaft himself staring back at me, which of course gets me all giddy, so everyone demands to see what I got, so I flash him, and people don&amp;#8217;t care, because only Josh and I know I have the Chamber, and only I know I have Padme hidden away.  I remember getting Tatooine and Malastare while I was in there, but I don&amp;#8217;t remember much else.  4th pack, I kindly ask Josh for a Qui-gon, but he tanks the play and pulls a Panaka&amp;#8217;s Blaster that he needs for the set.  So of course I grab it to trade it to him later.  I flesh out my deck with some senators, Odin Neslour, and a card which I later learned was 100% tech, Thrown Back.  Traffic control during your opponent&amp;#8217;s turn, I love it.  We customize, which is easy for me, I toss all the duplicate locations, podracing stuff with low destiny, and I end up with about 45 cards for a 40 card deck, which is easy to cut.  I&amp;#8217;m the first one ready, and a little scouting reveals that no one pulled a Maul, so the Padme/Mace trick is gonna work.  Now I didn&amp;#8217;t really look at anyone&amp;#8217;s cards, just yelled over to the other table &amp;#8220;Anyone pull a Maul?&amp;#8221;  They responded with a unanimous &amp;#8220;NO!&amp;#8221; so I assumed it was safe.  Here&amp;#8217;s my decklist:

<br/>
Coruscant: Galactic Senate
<br/>
Tatooine: City Outskirts
<br/>
Tatooine: Mos Espa
<br/>
Tatooine: Watto’s Junkyard
<br/>
<br/>
First game is against Charlie.  He starts the Junkyard (I think, Tatooine site that&amp;#8217;s 2 for dark, one for light)  I draw Ki and Mace opening hand, plus a location.  He activates, he draws.  I activate, dive for a docking bay (Coruscant one) and pop my location, City Outskirts.  I draw 2 of my 5 force, Thrown Back and Padme respectively.  He saves force this time, but deploys the Senate.  I groan.  My turn, activate a bunch, pop Shaft to the Chamber, deploy Thrown Back which he spends a long time reading while I draw up.  I throw back the 7 destiny and a couple other things on his turn.  He pops some senators and TC-14.  We are not amused.  Long story short, Shaft and TC hang out in the council chamber while he drains at the senate and I drain in space after deploying Tatooine, plus Ki-Adi at Watto&amp;#8217;s hood with Padme.  I win the drain war
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+12)
<br/>
The good: Free drain at Tatooine
<br/>
The bad: Beating a friend
<br/>
The ugly: Shaft held at bay by a freakin 3PO clone.  ::sigh::
<br/>
<br/>
Josh&amp;#8217;s game ends up going to time, so we decide there&amp;#8217;d only be one more game.  Which is good and bad, since I&amp;#8217;m tied for top seed, but I wanna play more too.  But I&amp;#8217;ll be content with having cake, but not being able to eat it.  I play against Jeremy Dallaire, another good friend. 
<br/>
<br/>
Same start on my end, he starts Senate.  I begin to cry, since I have a total of 3 senators in the deck.  But I draw Ki again, and get Mace on my first draw phase.  I get all the effects out, end up grabbing squabbling delegates, he was using it too much.  I&amp;#8217;m retrieving like mad, &amp;#8216;cuz I eventually win the senate war and retrieve with the force drain at Malastare/Wookiee senator, also retrieving with Ki at the Marketplace.  I also have Thrown back out.  This one is short, though a possible comeback was afoot when he deployed Naboo and two trade federation ships with some pilots.  I pop Madakar and her copilot, and a Naboo pilot for fodder and hack away, tracking my 7 each time.  I eventually win that war too, don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of cards on table, keep retrieving, painful win.
<br/>
<br/>
FW +26  4(+38)
<br/>
The good: Retrieval does happen in Ep 1 Sealed?
<br/>
The bad: Half my retrieval came from his card.
<br/>
The ugly: I won by 26 in a 40 card sealed deck.  I rubbed it in, didn&amp;#8217;t have to retrieve as much, etc.  
<br/>
<br/>
I come in first, one of two undefeateds.  I get my 5 packs, get a Qui-gon out of it, toss a Panaka&amp;#8217;s at Josh, seeing as how I now have three.  Always good to help friends out.  Everyone had fun, we gotta do more of these.  Now, as promised, my pulls from two boxes, 5 packs, and some trades (not the sealed though):
