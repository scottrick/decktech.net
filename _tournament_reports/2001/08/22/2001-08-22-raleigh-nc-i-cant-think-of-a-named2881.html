<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi everyone, I hope you enjoy my TR!
<br/>
<br/>
Pre Tournament- So like a week ago I&amp;#8217;m at some other tournament, and I&amp;#8217;m playing really good decks, and somehow end up losing a lot but almost beating the state champion and so I come in 13th. This one guy there named Ivan who&amp;#8217;s a really good player was like rating is dumb and stuff like that. And then he&amp;#8217;s like fun is everything and rating is nothing so that was cool. So after that tournament I go home sort of hang around some, then my friend gets back from where he lives in the summer which is like a far way away, and he&amp;#8217;s like one of my only friend that plays and is good so I&amp;#8217;m like happy so now I can play with someone good and stuff and actually lose games and stuff. SO he wants to go a JR. Tournament at the same time as the open. I want to go to the open to see what decks everyone is playing, so I convince him to go to the open. So we make decks, I make the Watto Objective with Orn Free Taa, WYS racing, and Old School TRM (which can be viewed on my page) for backup. Philip (my friend) makes Jedi Council with LS senate and mains, and he has an YMSYL deck from the summer. So we have like a mini tourney with 5 or 6 people, and I win, but I just don&amp;#8217;t feel comfortable with Watto, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;m using Orn Free Taa&amp;#8217;s text right so I start my quest for a new DS. I ask a whole bunch of people online, and look at the top decks but nothing that fit my style and that I could play, so I just decided to try Eric Hunter&amp;#8217;s Da Pretzel Money. I tested it with Philip, but he totally creamed it, so I decided it wasn&amp;#8217;t good for me. So I was looking at all my cards the morning one day before the tourney, and I see AOTBS (agents of the black sun), so I&amp;#8217;m thinking, hey if anyone plays hyper drive thing then I can like get them with direct damage the whole game, but who would play that anyway? Because I&amp;#8217;m so desperate on making a DS I make a crazy AOTBS racing starting presence on the Courscant location where Xizor is so I can always make them lose two on my first turn. Also I&amp;#8217;ve got 4 Makurths, and 2 Palpies, but my biggest mistake was I only used 1 Xizor being that he&amp;#8217;s the only one I could find. So I just count to see if it has 60 cards, I don&amp;#8217;t lay it out or anything like that so it turns out I have like 4 It&amp;#8217;s Worse (3 Combo, 1 non) 7 Twilek Iadvisors, and a whole bunch of crazy stuff. So I test my new dark with Philip, and I beat him by like 30 because he started the council chamber right by my site so I moved there and drained 3. Then he deployed Yoda from deck with Yaora or whatever that Wookie senator is called and Yoda got an imperial barrier. On my turn, I come down with Snoova with Axe, and a Makurth, and I battle, capturing Yoda, so he doesn&amp;#8217;t draw destiny, I get a 6 so that&amp;#8217;s Yoara or whatever and like 9, so I just drain 3 the rest of the game. So Philip&amp;#8217;s like my walkers suck, lemme use your watto OBJ, and I&amp;#8217;m like okay, so he builds a Tat. Occupation Watto OBJ deck. So I play it with his light side and the games pretty close, but I think we quit. So then we go online to see if the tourney is still on, and we get a mail from the director of the tournament (Don) saying that the winning of the tourney gets a box! So Philip and I are like AWESOME!!!! So I make a deal with him that if he wins I get 8 packs since the whole watto deck is mine. So I get an IM from Robert Werbecki and Mike Merletto and they want to barrow some cards, so I&amp;#8217;m like okay whatever. So Philip goes upstairs and starts making some other deck, and I get him to get the cards. Nothing much else happens until&amp;#8230;
<br/>
<br/>
The Tourney:
<br/>
The morning before I call Philip and I&amp;#8217;m like where did you put the cards Rob wanted, and he was like I didn&amp;#8217;t want to find them, so I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8216;what, find them at your house&amp;#8217;, and then he&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8216;no, I don&amp;#8217;t want to&amp;#8217;. So I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8216;fine be that way&amp;#8217;. So his Mom picks me up like at 950 and the tourney starts at 11, so we drive over there, when we could have walked and me and Philip are like the only ones there and were like &amp;#8216;woa, there should be more people if the prize is a box&amp;#8217;, so were about to play but then Philip&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8216;I have such a good feeling about today, I think if I play it&amp;#8217;ll jinx me.&amp;#8217; This really sucks because my DS sort of sucks, and I&amp;#8217;ve only played one game with it&amp;#8230; But I don&amp;#8217;t really care. So like 500 people show up and I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;m gana get last&amp;#8217;. So nothing really much happens so the tournament gets under way. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game #1 My WYS Racing vs. Greyson Thompson&amp;#8217;s HD Racing Duel
<br/>
I start the regular stuff (pod prep, for squad @#$% and all the podracing stuff) tee hee I said ass. He starts HD stuff and Watto Box, so I think he draws up on his turn or something like that. On my turn I deploy Jedi Luke with stick in the cantina for a drain 3, and I notice I&amp;#8217;m not activating that much so I pull Kessel for the extra one (plus the drain 3 later on), and I get HOTJedi out, which like really, really helps. So I&amp;#8217;m sort of scared that he&amp;#8217;ll through down Lord Vader with duel stick, and duel Luke, but all the destinies in my deck are like 5s and 6s so I think I&amp;#8217;m pretty safe. SO he activates some we draw destiny, its pretty close but I think he&amp;#8217;s still winning cause of that first turn stall. So he signals for IAO, and gets out Hoth DB or something like that, and sure enough here comes Choke Vader with a dueling stick, so I&amp;#8217;m like oh god&amp;#8230; he plays obsession, and I&amp;#8217;m like o shoot, he&amp;#8217;s gana win this game, and that will suck, so he troughs the stick to add 2 o each of his totals, and I&amp;#8217;m adding one to mine with Luke&amp;#8217;s stick so I get something like a 2 and a 4 and he gets like a 3 and a 3 or something. So he wins, but then I say &amp;#8216;Hey wait Luke says subtracts 3 from attempts to cross him over&amp;#8217;, and he&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8216; yeah but I think that would mean he&amp;#8217;s just lost or something&amp;#8217;, I sort of think the same but we try to get a ruling from the TD but he&amp;#8217;s no where to be found, so we just ask Adam the state champ, cause his opponent has like 1 card in his deck, and he says that the duel itself was an attempt so he loses the duel, Vader&amp;#8217;s out of play, and he loses 9. So for the rest of the game his OBJ sits on the 0 side, and he loses to visage of the empire. I drain at Kessel he chases me around with some other people including Mara Jade, he plays another obsession, I win again, so my drains do him in the next turn. 
<br/>
FW +19    2(+19)
<br/>
<br/>
Good-Winning against HD Duel, a deck that I was afraid of.
<br/>
Bad-Uh&amp;#8230; I guess Greyson losing to his own Visage a whole lot was pretty bad for him.
<br/>
<br/>
I ask a lot of people if they won and what side they played and like everyone won by a lot with their dark, so that&amp;#8217;s sort of weird and stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #2 My Crazy AOTBS Racing vs. Mike Merletto&amp;#8217;s MWYHL Racing
<br/>
We talked online and he tells me he&amp;#8217;s playing one of Yannik Lapoine&amp;#8217;s decks, I guess its modified with Tatooine or something, because he starts Porace Prep and HOTJedi, I start the regular stuff, Start Your Engines, and presence and Podracing stuff. So I start my turn, he only loses one because of his HOTJedi, I get Guri or someone to keep Xizor company, and tell him to go, we draw race destiny (not in the order of events I just said) I forget what we get but I know I stall him, and I get something like a 3 which turns into a 6. So on his turn he uses the signal to get Brisky Morning &amp;#8216;Machine&amp;#8217;, and deploys DTF and Battle Plan I think from his hand, pulls Jar-Jar out of his deck, and fights my Guri and Xizor, he retrives one, I lose one, he bombs Guri, and because she&amp;#8217;s a droid she dies and Jar-Jar goes to the Jar-Jar tank. On my turn I deploy No Escape, and CHYBC, and ge some guys to the race track, and to Xizors place. Nothing much happens for the next few turns, he inserts an AFA, kills some more with that pesky Jar-Jar, I loses to DTF, he wins the race, uses I Did It, kills Xizor, and does some runs with EPP Obi and Luke with Stick, and uses Resilience to get them back. So I&amp;#8217;m getting him with drains, and he&amp;#8217;s getting me with DTF damage, and AFA every now and then. It sort of seems like my deck has 70 cards and his has 50, because somehow I end up winning by 9 when I barely did any damage to him.
<br/>
FW +9    4(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
Good- Winning against Mike, cause Mike is good.
<br/>
Bad- Uh&amp;#8230; I can never think of bad things&amp;#8230;
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game #3 My WYS Racing vs. Mike Schneider&amp;#8217;s Walker Garrison 
<br/>
He starts YMSYL, Decree, and Abyss I think, I start with the regular stuff, he&amp;#8217;s got a racer, so the first few turns we just build up drains and stuff like that. I waste a projection of a Skywalker cause I think he&amp;#8217;s going to play a garrison, oh well, I&amp;#8217;m getting him for three at Kessel so he plops Executor with MAIH, and Piett, and says my go. I had just lost a Houjix from my hand so I think of a plan. On my go I reveal dash for outrider, and deploy them at Tatooine, flipping my OBJ. So I battle at Kessel, he has like 50 power to my 9 or something, so I just lose it and houjix from my lost pile. So nothing much else happens, I continue to drain at Kessel and at cantina, he can&amp;#8217;t take the drains.
<br/>
FW +16?   6(+44?)
<br/>
<br/>
Good -Winning and now being undefeated.
<br/>
Bad- Undefeated&amp;#8230; Uh oh, I might play someone good.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #4 My Crazy DS vs. Ray Franks&amp;#8217; Profit Scouts
<br/>
I start the regular stuff. He starts heading for the boat, Insurrection Combo, Staging Areas Combo, and strike planning. So I hit him for two the first turn and he gets Crix. I get some guys out to the chamber. Then I think for a second, shoot I forgot to deploy two aliens at start of the game, oh well. So he does some stuff, activates, throws down Obi with stick and Xizor&amp;#8217;s site and slices threw him. I draw 5 and I think he does two, so we both lose our guys. I get some more guys to the chamber, and we fight there some, but he ends up with the site, so I use Twi-lek for secret plans, hoping he would forget about it or something. But the next turn he saves up rather than freeing Han, so I&amp;#8217;m like whatever. So I drain him for two at JP where all my guys are, and he ICBWs it, HAHA! I it&amp;#8217;s worse him for 7 or 9 or something, so he loses a whole lot. I win the race, and he forgets to tell me to use Aim High, but I didn&amp;#8217;t remember either so nothing happens. He starts getting out some guys Jedi Luke and the endor drain guy at the backdoor for 3, and a whole bunch of direct damage. So I&amp;#8217;m only making him lose 2, so we just drain each other, and on my last surviving turn he ICBWs my drain, It&amp;#8217;s Worse for like 5 or 6 or something. But the direct damage does me in. 
<br/>
FL &amp;#8211;? (I want to say 9, but I know it was more maybe 19, 26?)    6 (+24?)
<br/>
<br/>
So sense I&amp;#8217;m such a slow writer I don&amp;#8217;t remember what happened when and in what order but, I think earlier on I&amp;#8217;m about to walk past a whole bunch of movies for rent, and then I hear a whole bunch of laughter and about 20 tapes fall over (see other Raleigh TRs). And me and Martin and Philip and Carson have a Pokemon beanbag fight that has super funny. And I go to buy I can of whoop @#$% but I&amp;#8217;m a few cents short, and the really nice lady at the store lets me go get some money, so that&amp;#8217;s cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #5 My crazy DS vs. Carson Swanek&amp;#8217;s LS Senators
<br/>
I start normal stuff he starts a lot of stuff that I don&amp;#8217;t remember, the podrace is really close but I win playing 3 Hit Racers at the last second. So he has a pretty steady drain, I&amp;#8217;ve got an okay drain and some direct damage going, he battles my Vigo, Palpy, and Snoova, he levitates the axe onto obi, shoots with Lando, and misses, he draws a 4 I think and I draw I 0 I think. So I lose Snoova and run away to an adjacent site. So he kills off my Xizor a few turns later so my direct damage stops. So it looks like a pretty close game but then Carson takes his Palpatine over to my site to drain an extra. At this time I have three cards in my hand all being characters, so I throw them all down and battle. I shoot with P-60, he loses one, I draw high he draws low, that&amp;#8217;s game.
<br/>
FW +27     8(+51?)
<br/>
<br/>
Good- Um&amp;#8230; winning I guess
<br/>
Bad- Nothing really it was a fun game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game #6 My WYS vs. Ray Franks Courlag Operatives
<br/>
So I get out the regular stuff, he doesn&amp;#8217;t have a podracer, but he starts Well Guarded with Twi&amp;#8217;lek, Courlag, swamp, with the Objective. So I start out pretty normally with Jedi Luke with stick at cantina and Mirax (or someone) at Kessel. On his turn he drains he drains for two, so I surprise assault for like 9, he deploys some operatives with biker scout troopers and speeder bikes. I deploy battle plan and look for dash&amp;#8217;s ship by revealing dash, but no luck. So I put him and an RFC and the DB to flip my objective. During Ray&amp;#8217;s turn he drains, which gets a surprise assault from the lost pile, for about 9. He deploys some more dudes to flip his objective. I&amp;#8217;m draining a lot, so is he, but he has to pay with battle plan. So thanks to the surprise assault I win.
<br/>
FW +26       10+(77?)
<br/>
<br/>
Good-I beat Ray and Ray is a good player and I&amp;#8217;m a scrub, now I have a chance at placing good.
<br/>
<br/>
Bad-Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
So I watch the 1st and 2nd players (going into game 6) battle it out for the tournament, if they time out or one of them wins by like 2 then I win the tournament and a box of courscant. But of course I don&amp;#8217;t win, but I do get 2nd and get a Hoth 2 player thing, and some packs.
<br/>
<br/>
