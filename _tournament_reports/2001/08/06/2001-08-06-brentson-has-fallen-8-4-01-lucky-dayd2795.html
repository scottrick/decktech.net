<br/>
<br/>
I didnt think that i would get to play in another tournament until coruscant after my last trip to CT 
<br/>
<br/>
with the kasshyyyk crew.  But since i realized i had this saturday off i figured i’d hit up one more 
<br/>
<br/>
tourney in the current environment and try to take home the foils because the competition would 
<br/>
<br/>
be scarce.  boy was i wrong.  
<br/>
<br/>
I was the first person to show up, and noone else arrived within the half hour.  Then i went to the 
<br/>
<br/>
parking lot to get something out of my car (i was really just bored and walking around) when Mike 
<br/>
<br/>
Pistone (madskills) and Matt McGann and their other bridgewater buddy showed up.  As of midnight 
<br/>
<br/>
the night before, they werent coming. and if they didnt, we wouldnt have had a sanctioned 
<br/>
<br/>
tournament.  so we lucked out.  A few minutes later, a few worcester guys showed up, followed by 
<br/>
<br/>
the schiemer brothers.  So that gave us eight and we were pretty pumped that it was sanctioned.  
<br/>
<br/>
Jared, the normal td wasnt there and johnny rivera (the kashyyyk scrub) showed up to run thefirst 
<br/>
<br/>
half.  We’re all playing a huge Raw Deal game when Steve Brentson comes and screws EVERYTHING 
<br/>
<br/>
up giving us 9 players, a bye, and creating more competition for us all.  but thats not always a bad 
<br/>
<br/>
thing is it???  
<br/>
<br/>
I pride myself on knowing that while i have not broken 1800 i still maintain my status of RATINGS 
<br/>
<br/>
BUSTER.
<br/>
<br/>
MUAHAHAH.
<br/>
<br/>
So after tooling on everything with my sick roaddogg deck we start the tournament.  I get paired 
<br/>
<br/>
against Matt McGann, whose rated about 1575 if i am not mistaken, which i probably am.  I do know 
<br/>
<br/>
however, that he is not above 1600.
<br/>
<br/>
Oh and if youre wondering where the competition is, here ya go: Hayes has no decks made, steebo 
<br/>
<br/>
was in long island, justin desai is a wimp and wont steal his own car from his dad, eric hunter was at 
<br/>
<br/>
gencon as well as RI and NH state champs who will usually make the trek to this tourney.  All in all 
<br/>
<br/>
noone was around.  which is why there are no antics with steve or hayes.  this is the first tournament 
<br/>
<br/>
ive been to without anyone in a very long time. 
<br/>
<br/>
But if you wanna read about some hotness before the TR (which is usually the case when ppl read 
<br/>
<br/>
my tr’s to my understanding, half of my reviews are "pre tourney was awesome") so here we go. 
<br/>
<br/>
So my parents are away this week, and my sister decides to have a party.  Now i know most of you 
<br/>
<br/>
have read about my sister and what my friend’s (justin, hayes, klema, etc) have said about my sister, 
<br/>
<br/>
and i take that, and multiply it by 2340923843, becuase she has TONS OF HOT FRIENDS.  and i got 
<br/>
<br/>
wicked bombed playing beirut (you homo’s outside of new england might call it BEER PONG).  And 
<br/>
<br/>
to top it all off, tons of girls passed out in my bed.  But i was already passed out and i missed them 
<br/>
<br/>
passing out next to me, which sucked.  But to know it happened makes it THAT MUCH BETTER.
<br/>
<br/>
And if that’s not enough, thurs night at steebo’s his mom was teasing me about how everything i eat 
<br/>
<br/>
is very plain so i tell her that im gonna have her take me out to dinner so she can buy me the most 
<br/>
<br/>
EXOTIC and expensive meal i could think of.  its all about the word exotic baby.  
<br/>
<br/>
Also, the night before the tourney, i stayed up talking to twigg about clint getting dq’d and about 
<br/>
<br/>
this chick he’s dating. all in all its not bad and here we go with the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My RANCOURT vs McGann’s WYS Solid 
<br/>
<br/>
So wys is a good deck to play with my rancor, becuase ppl stay on tatooine and i can eat them 
<br/>
<br/>
more easily that way. I drop my dbay behind the Palace and wait for him to deploy to the ground, 
<br/>
<br/>
which is a mistake b/c from now on i should try and take the cantina.  Once i got the palace set up, 
<br/>
<br/>
i just waited.  Early on i stole someone, i think it was talon.  He has artoo/threepio out so he drops 
<br/>
<br/>
melas to battle 4lom (who was escorted) and i had to lose 4lom.  he dbay transited back towards the 
<br/>
<br/>
cantina and i got screwed.  he beat me out of space (which sucked) but i couldnt pull enough ships 
<br/>
<br/>
and its really not that difficult to get rid of WYS ships without weapons, even with dengar out.  So 
<br/>
<br/>
bacially he sets up huge drains.  And i go after him and take out chewie and epp luke before having 
<br/>
<br/>
to make my long and lonly walk to the audience chamber.  I get to the dungeon, drop my guys off, 
<br/>
<br/>
and drop the rancor.  i end up eating luke and talon for a 30 force swing, but his drain of 6 a turn 
<br/>
<br/>
was killing me, and i was paying to drain. in retrospect i shouldve just dropped the virago or 
<br/>
<br/>
something to tatooine to kill battle order, but it did me in.  i had four force left when he had two. 
<br/>
<br/>
which means i can only get him down to one, instead i just dropped epp fett to screw around and he 
<br/>
<br/>
won by 2.
<br/>
<br/>
0(-2)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: eating two guys.  hanging in against a tough WYS deck
<br/>
Lows:  LOSING BY TWO AFTER EATING TWO FRIGGING GUYS
<br/>
<br/>
Brentson lost his first game to mike sciemer, which is very respectable.  Pistone won i think. and 
<br/>
<br/>
thats all i guess.  but that means i would have to play brentson, a man i’ve lost to three times and 
<br/>
<br/>
even titled a tournament report about.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my TEN NUMB SUPERSTAR vs Brentson’s BHBM mains.	 
<br/>
<br/>
So BHBM normally means sac.  sac kills klammrodt style qmc.  Even with WYS as common as it is, i 
<br/>
<br/>
still had a feeling that Brentson would be playing SOME sac, enough to screw me over.  He was, but 
<br/>
<br/>
this game never saw any of it.  I set up in space early.  He pretty much stayed away.  At one point, 
<br/>
<br/>
he went to drop Chimera w/ thrawn to bespin, but he changed his mind and went to carida to satisfy 
<br/>
<br/>
battle plan instead.  He then put bosssk at cloud city with chirnoonoo as forfeit fodder. and was 
<br/>
<br/>
holding the CC Dbay (his) with emporer, janus and guri, with a presence to boot.  i had the three 
<br/>
<br/>
other sites oN CC with leia, luke and Lando + Melas respectively.  He drops Marquand (?) ozzel and 
<br/>
<br/>
veers to luke, i path to leias site.  hes draining me for a ton and its time to make a decision.  Do i 
<br/>
<br/>
go to carida to stop the drain of 1 but give up celebration?  do i go after bossk and give up 
<br/>
<br/>
celebration again.. or do i block the drain of 3 with epp luke and path over.. ill do the luke thing.  
<br/>
<br/>
so i move him over.  But i also drop Ten Numb in his ship to cloud city in front of bossk.  This is 
<br/>
<br/>
funny because i know brentson is scared of the superstar, he has shot down his executors before 
<br/>
<br/>
and he didnt battle me once at cloud city.. and they were there for a few turns straight.  Brentson 
<br/>
<br/>
knows i play rapid fire.. hes a smart man.  So luke gets battled.. i play path MIKE YOU CANT PLAY 
<br/>
<br/>
PATH... the dbay is not interior.  so i swing at palps, hit, draw a 4 for destiny.  i lose luke and two.  
<br/>
<br/>
then he moves marquand and janus in front of leia.  That is waht cost him the game.  I activate, 
<br/>
<br/>
drain, retrieve, and track the six i flipped to hit the emporer with.  he says use janus’ ability.  then he 
<br/>
<br/>
tries to play Omni box.. but its my action.. and i Sorry about the mess janus.  (it didnt matter my 
<br/>
<br/>
destinies were 6,4,5 respectively).  so i drop dash, path over lando and battle.  i shoot marquand, but 
<br/>
<br/>
only have destiny enough for one (not two as lando’s text dictates) and i draw the 5. marquand and 
<br/>
<br/>
11 please.  That puts him down to one force.  he drains me for two on his turn, i lose the last two in 
<br/>
<br/>
my hand and he draws his last one so i cant retreive.  Fw +???
<br/>
<br/>
4(+8)*
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning against brentson, hes good.
<br/>
Lows : Being so excited, that i forgot to count for differential... first time thats ever happened to me.
<br/>
<br/>
So that sucked, cause i mightve beaten him by more than ten, but who really knows. at most it was 
<br/>
<br/>
15, but still.. that five differential at least, plus the one i couldve added from the last game.. that 
<br/>
<br/>
wouldve put me in second for the tourney...but i dont end up in second.. read on.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3.  My QMC vs Pistone’s HD JIZZ
<br/>
<br/>
HD podracing sucks, but as long as i dont drop luke and obi, he cant hurt me right?  WRONG.  I get 
<br/>
<br/>
a terrible start.  i hold bespin, and he drops the deathstar first turn and is getting tons of force.  i get 
<br/>
<br/>
corran to the holothatre, he chases corran with epp vader.  i path around the death star.  hes draining 
<br/>
<br/>
on cloud city (i lost one site early) and couldnt get things going by only holding one site.  So 
<br/>
<br/>
basically he was draining me for more than i was draining him.  Late game i FINALLY got capt han to 
<br/>
<br/>
the death star to drain, but it wasnt enoough, and there wasnt anything i could do.  he wrote a TR 
<br/>
<br/>
about this game, and his is probably better as he won and i lost.  so i lost by alot, i think it was 25.  
<br/>
<br/>
it sucked.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none
<br/>
Lows : Many
<br/>
<br/>
So brentson had the bye, and now i have the bye.. which sucks so i play raw deal with johnny rivera 
<br/>
<br/>
and whoop @#$% with the road dogg.  He has to leave and i take over running the tourney with help 
<br/>
<br/>
from brentson. becuase hes the only one there that has actually run one before.  the round ends, 
<br/>
<br/>
and i get paired playng my Light.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My Ten Numb Superstar vs. Rod’s DS deck that i cannot think of.
<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty i cannot remember what this kid was playing.  i am at the beach writing this, and i got 
<br/>
<br/>
drunk the night of the tourney, so it escapes me.  read the strategy for ten numb superstar..and thats 
<br/>
<br/>
exactly how this game went.  he did no damage to me really.  i mean he did some with drains and 
<br/>
<br/>
stuff, but mainly i just drained and retreived, i was in control the whole game, i was retreiving tons 
<br/>
<br/>
with my edges, and he didnt really do anything.  Oh yeah!  this kid was playing endor ops FLIP with 
<br/>
<br/>
scout troopers and bikes and SCOUT BLASTERS.  which is why i won.  he drained me a lot early 
<br/>
<br/>
game, but he couldnt compete with my drains.  (i again lost a site off the top second turn).  and i 
<br/>
<br/>
just won easily.  no battles took place.  i think he tried to come up against me with his ships once, 
<br/>
<br/>
but they wouldve gotten toasted so he thought better of it.  either way.  ten numb and dash held the 
<br/>
<br/>
system like no others could.  I win by 25 exactly.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: QMC still works, and it shows
<br/>
Lows : Hitting early drains.
<br/>
<br/>
So its game six, pistone and scheimer play for first place, mcgann and brentson play for second, im 
<br/>
<br/>
in the number five spot, but i can bump it up b/c im not playing anyone that was doing that well 
<br/>
<br/>
that day, which helped.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 my RANCOURT vs. Someone’s WYS Solid.
<br/>
<br/>
SO again my rancourt plays wys.  He drops dash early to kessel.  and i go take him out with guri in 
<br/>
<br/>
ship, dengar, zuckuss, and virago sans xizor.  this was turn four.  so i only had to bite the huge drain 
<br/>
<br/>
once ( i controlled the other).  And i smack him out of space and own kessel and tatooine the rest 
<br/>
<br/>
of the game mainly.  On the ground i obviously own the palace, but he is podracing, so i lose 6 
<br/>
<br/>
there.  So now its time to eat guys.  i start battling with jodo and ig, and ig takes ecc chewie from 
<br/>
<br/>
the cantina to the palace all to get eatin by my rancor.  which he does late game for the 20 force 
<br/>
<br/>
swing.  after that he couldnt recover because i owned space and he had a solid drain at the cantina, 
<br/>
<br/>
but thats only becuase i lost 6 characters in the podrace...which was gay.  but i win the game and my 
<br/>
<br/>
diff hits 50.
<br/>
<br/>
8(+50)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: eating chewie, the best to eat for swing purposes.
<br/>
Lows : Not winning by enough
<br/>
<br/>
So brentson runs over to see by how much i won by (he won by 33!!!!)  and his diff was 6 higher 
<br/>
<br/>
than mine (1 from game 1, 5 from the game with brentson).  so i coulda took second, now im stuck 
<br/>
<br/>
with fourth and i get some packs of Death star 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Now in milford, entry fee is two packs.  i was able to convince a couple kids to buy ds2 packs so 
<br/>
<br/>
empporers and lukes could be pulled.  only three of us got these packs, and i did the prize support 
<br/>
<br/>
so that there was one stack with two ds2 packs.  Whichi  got, because i got to pick fourth (behind 
<br/>
<br/>
two tourney foils and three packs of tat) and i pull a jedi knight luke! which is hot.  i also won 
<br/>
<br/>
twenty beans on a scratch ticket and pulled edge’s finisher that very day.  and then of coures i beat 
<br/>
<br/>
brentson and those girls passed out on my bed.  a good day??? i think so. 
<br/>
<br/>
So that concludes my tournament report. sorry if this isnt as cool as the gencon reports, but hey, i 
<br/>
<br/>
try.
<br/>
