<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well after trying to figure out who was going to Levittown with me, it ended up me and bill again. Only this time Bill was on his own for a ride, so there was no long trip to Long Beach before goin to the tourney. So i think maybe i can get some sleep, not happening. i want to change my decks some and add in some Coruscant, but now i am not sure if it is legal. Bill imd me that it is not legal, yet we find out later that it is only not legal for some big event not locals. So i put some cards in my Hunt Down, i mean what else would i play? But want to make a new light deck, something with Politics. Yet end up playing RST again. I figured the two decks gave me the tourney last time, why not do it again. 
<br/>
I am plenty confident in my game play, especially since last time i finished first with a 8(+147) diff. So i clean house for the second tourney in a row, finishing 8(+108), allowing me to walk away with a foil It Could Be worse, Qui Gon, and a few other rares from the new set.
<br/>
<br/>
First Game: 
<br/>
(my RST PodracingVS. Sam Diamond’s False Start Set Your Course Tie Bombers) 
<br/>
Well the night before i was told that RST was big all over (almost as big as WYS) so people answered the deck by blowing up the bunker before i can... i guess i just did not think people would try it, but guess what. Sam did, and he most definately blew up my bunker. At which point i thought my game might be over, so i started to push for podracing (making certain i would not lose that) and find Home One to try to fight off the space. Well i did just that, won the podrace and found Home One (which never left the table). A fully loaded Home One (Jedi Luke/Endor Han/Leia w/ Blaster) seemed to be too much for him. My constant two HIGH destinies, and irritating drain of two (Qui Gon at the podracing areana, and Someone on endor) was just too much. 
<br/>
FW 2 (+26) 
<br/>
Highlights:finding HomeOne and simply beating him out of space (well almost), but it was enough
<br/>
Lowpoints:HIM BLOWING UP MY BUNKER 
<br/>
<br/>
Second Game: 
<br/>
(my High Destiny Huntdown w/ Podracing VS. Alex Warshow’s??? (i think that is his name) WYS)
<br/>
So i do my normal start of Hunt with podracing. We are both losing to Visage early, only i know i am gonna get it back with the race so im not worried so i thought. It takes me a while to find a vader, but Emperor sat at the docking bay (cause he could not get to the cantina he had peeps there) and Maul sat in his ship just fu&lt;king up his ablity to flip and not to mention drain at kessel. Things went this way for a while, and the race took alot longer than i thought. It took me way too long to find my grabber, and he played A Step Backwards a few times. The race finished late game, when we both tied totals and before my move phase i play Podracer Collision!. The game just about ends on that note, full win plus 29.
<br/>
FW 4 (+55) 
<br/>
Highlights:of course getting the win, but also using Maul exactly how i wanted him to be used (no sabers just his ship to maybe screw up WYS)
<br/>
Lowpoints:having the race come too close
<br/>
<br/>
Third Game: 
<br/>
(My RST/Podracing VS. Brad Vogals False Start Dark Deal objective just to Drain in the sky) 
<br/>
I take one look at his starting and think to myself, "Dam this is gonna be a good game." When it actually was simply a dumb drain race, which i had a slight advantage (Direct Damage and Retrieval) the race and the bunker. It took him to long to set up, in my opinion or he might have had a better chance. In the end it was a full win for me plus 27? 
<br/>
FW 6 (+82) 
<br/>
Highlights:WINNING the drain/damage race 
<br/>
Lowpoints:Brad for not knowing that when you start the third game the person with the higher diff is light side, and needing myself and Bill to point it out to him
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth and Final Game: 
<br/>
(My High Destiny Huntdown with Podracing VS. Garth ???’s Thrown Room mains deck) 
<br/>
Well I know Garth and the fact he has not played for a while. We sit down, and the first thing out of his mouth is this "This wont take long.", and that was true. The race was the first thing to screw him up, considering he had Honor to protect from visage. So early on i was losing to visage, but like always did not mind cause i knew i would retrieve it. When the race finished i dropped Vader w/ saber and the Emperor to the race areana, flip and start draining for one there, and one at the holo table. He drops a spy and Obi to the executor site thinkin he will drain, not realizing he cant do it while Huntdown is flipped. In a attempt to get me to flip, he throws down Luke w/ saber to his Farm and kills the nudj. Next turn I drop Maul battle and he misses Maul with the swing, and draws low. Thus allowing me to flip back again. Now the drain increases and the game does not last much longer. Full win plus 26.
<br/>
FW 8 (+108)
<br/>
Highpoints:him not realizing obi would not be able to drain on the executor sites
<br/>
Lowpoints:just about a FLAWLESS VICTORY 
<br/>
<br/>
So i take first along with my tired a$$ and wait around workin in a few trades and a game or two. Bill did rather well this time around finishing fourth (tied w/ someone), but still good. All i can say is, do we all see what this game has come too? nothing but direct damage, it is like playin burn decks.

<br/>
HIGHLIGHTS:
<br/>
-taking a second tourney in a row at tri-county
<br/>
-there being no hour plus break for lunch this time
<br/>
-winning even with someone blowing up the bunker for me
<br/>
<br/>
LOWPOINTS:
<br/>
-brad for not know how you decided who was light and dark at the start of the thrid game
<br/>
-somebody for losing to numbers even though he had the effect to cancel it on table (good job)
<br/>
-another somebody for losing a full 8 force to a carbon freezing, even though he had honor in effect (pretty much lost him the game, so a few of us think)
<br/>
-me for finding out that the dam foils i got (one winning and the other i traded for) are now worth pretty much sh!t on ebay (do i ever feel ripped off after that trade)
<br/>
-me for waking up 15 mins before the tourney started (does the term speeding mean anything to anyone?)
<br/>
-me for playing the same tired a$$ decks, and not finishing a new light deck to play (but who really cares?) </font></td>
