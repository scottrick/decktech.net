<br/>
	About a week ago Brad Vogel and myself made plans to go the Mastic tournament on August 4th. So since Brad didn&amp;#8217;t know exactly how to get out to Mastic we met at Tri-County Flea Market and he followed my parents out there (I*m 16 without a permit so no driving for me yet). We get there at around 11 since we made it to Mastic in like 45 min, when it usually takes an hour twenty min. so we had some time before the tournament. We checked D*s website a few days ago and John Curran posted it saying it starts at 12 o&amp;#8217;clock, well when we got there, it turns out he didn*t post the right time, and the real time it starts at is 2. So we are like you got to be kidding me, so we had to wait for 3 hours. The Raw Deal tournament was before the SW so a lot of people at Mastic play both games and Joe Geffories (sp?) tells us that a 2000+ player from Mass. Is coming to the tournament. During the time we go to 7-Eleven to get something to eat and drink, and go back and play a game. So the time seems to take forever but its finally game time.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks:
<br/>
For light:  I*m going with my QMC that I used at the Levittown tournament, which went 2-0, so I figure since I*m comfortable with it, I might as well stick with It.
<br/>
<br/>
For dark:  I*m using my updated TTO from the Levittown tournament. The updated part is Sebulba*s racer and a few cards to help me against RST.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My light against Steve Baroni*s (2025) Brangus racing.
<br/>
<br/>
	YES!! My first game I get to play a 2000+ player, day is looking good. BTW this was the person from Mass. If any of you didn&amp;#8217;t know. So we both do our things he gets out Brangus to D* I go to Bespin. He "Shafts" ten numb (putting responsibility of command at the Hoth: command center and putting Much anger in him on Ten numb to make me lose 4 force every battle phase (the responsibility of command was a JAP card, but I trusted Steve with what the card said, you&amp;#8217;ll read more about this incident later). So I can*t do much, I*m losing 4 a turn b/c he keeps following me around with Zuckuss in ship and I&amp;#8217;ve lost most of my characters, so I see a loss in my future. He wins the podrace, but luckily for me he forgot to start an effect so I didn*t have to lose 11 from Watto*s Box. Soon enough it happens, I lose by 29
<br/>
0(-29)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Hmmm, at the time I was thinking good game, but again you*ll see about the incident
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  QMC getting its first tournament loss, but at least it was a loss to a 2000+ player
<br/>
<br/>
So now brad and I are waiting for the next game, he won his first, and as odd as it seems out of the 8 games dark won 6 of them.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My dark against Chris Gardiner*s (1392) Obi-Wan&amp;#8217;s hut start
<br/>
	I really didn&amp;#8217;t know what to expect this game. So in my opening hand I get one of the DS2 sectors so for now it seems like its gonna be a good game, I get a second turn operational D*, and I*m draining for 2 at endor, 2 at Sullust and the 2 from X on TTO. (the one drain he got in on me was doubling efforts) Arica was at the revod obis hut stopping a possible drain for 4 and u3po was at the tatooine DB stopping another drain. Then when all his characters were at the DB (he moved them before I put down the U3p0) he demotioned Arica taking away her undercover but EPP Vader and a few Tie pilots (I didn&amp;#8217;t need in space) were with her, so he just chased me around on tatooine, while I was getting him for 6 in space. I just drained him out, I win by 27
<br/>
2(-2)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: My TTO deck, winning another game, it is now 2-1
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: Losing Doubling Efforts on the 1 drain he got in
<br/>
<br/>
 So I go talk to Brad who finished his game all ready, for some reason, everyone*s games were very short. He tells me that he thinks responsibility of command cant go on Ten numb so I ponder over that, And we get ready for the next game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My dark against Chris Weigert*s (1486) profit
<br/>
<br/>
	I was worried about this match up, all though I beat a profit last tournament, with this deck, profit is still good against space. So I start Arica in the AC so I don&amp;#8217;t get drained for 2, But Corran Horn and Calder Righm come down first turn and Corran breaks Arica*s cover. Then I deploy Maul down and initiate a battle, but Chris then tells me I can*t because I need ability less then 8, I read Calder, and slump my head while he laughs. It takes me seriously about 6 turns before I get that damn ball operational, I had everything except for the third sector, which kept going from my reserve to force pile. When I do get it operational, we have a drain race to the end. I*m getting him for 1 at the Endor DB, 2 at Endor, 2 at Sullust and 3 from Doubling Efforts/TTO. He*s getting me for about 6 in drains then about 4 from direct damage, and we end the game with a battle between Ben with saber and Maul at the Endor DB. I lose by 13
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Highs: A great game, that was mostly close all the way.
<br/>
	Playing someone that is really fun to play with
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: I lost
<br/>
<br/>
So between games the only game that isn*t done is Steven B*s, so pretty much everyone is watching that. He gets the shaft (I explained what this was earlier for people that didn*t know) on and the person he was playing was questioning the card. About battling and found out he couldn&amp;#8217;t battle at all at that system. So Brad and I go and read the card after they were done(the English version that they checked) and find out that Ten Numb can*t be targeted. This combo is what pretty much made me lose the first game. During our game he had zuckuss in ship at bespin with my Shafted Ten Numb in blue squad 5 with intruder missile, and Hobbie in red squad 4, and I had a power pivot in hand. I would have cleared the system, got cloud city celebration set up, and would not have lost so much force from the Shaft, I*m not saying I would have won the game, but I think I would have had a much greater chance, or even if I lost the game, I would definitely have a higher differential in the end. I would have really liked to know, what would have happen if the shaft wasn*t on Ten Numb. And I now also know to check the English text on JAP cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS against Dan Agostin*s (1435) BHBM
<br/>
	This game was totally in my favor from the start, in my opening hand I got EPP Luke, Obi, and ECC Lando. He came to Bespin with Flagship Executer with Ozzel aboard, and Chimera. He battles my wedge and dash in matching ships, and with emperor*s power adding a destiny, he takes out my dash in outrider and I take out Ozzel. We then have a few battles at the system, until I clear out his ships, I get CC celebration set up, and get my tracked 7 with off the edge. Then I just drain him out. I win by 37
<br/>
4(+22)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: me winning, and going 2-2 for the day
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  beating a newer player, by that much, but at least he didn*t draw up, I hate when people do that.
<br/>
<br/>
So in the end brad comes in 2nd, and I come in 7th out of the 16, so not to bad. When I got home I checked my rating and I*m now at 1495, 5 points away till I*m back at 1500.
<br/>
