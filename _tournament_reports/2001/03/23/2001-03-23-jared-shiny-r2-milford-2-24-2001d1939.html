<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Milford, MASS. If you want to sit in a cellar with 172 chairs and
<br/>
14 players, TJ’s was the place to be for 2/24/2001.
<br/>
Jared ran a reflections 2 booster draft, all meat and potatoes.
<br/>
We only had about 6 around start time, but eventually got up 
<br/>
to 14 within the next 20 minutes. A lot of returning faces, 
<br/>
not many/any newbies. Mike Schiemer, Hayes Hunter, Brian Ciezinski,
<br/>
John Shapiro, Paul Maholick, Mike Pistone, Steve Anderson and
<br/>
Jared Greenwald to name a few of the players. We drafted at about 
<br/>
1230-1245 -- I was light side - Steve Anderson who sat next to me 
<br/>
got a lord vader foil, the r2 emporer, flagship executor and maybe even a tarkin or
<br/>
walker from what I recall. He easily got the best cards of the tourney. I, on the other hand, got a handful of 
<br/>
horse@#$%. After shaving it down to 40 cards, here was my poor excuse for a deck:
<br/>
The battlegrounds I brought were kessel, tat toshe st, and tat jabbas palace.

Game 1 vs Mike Pistone
<br/>
<br/>
Started witht he Throne each game. Early drain at Kessel for 3 every turn with a lousy y-wing, x-wing and rebel pilot 
<br/>
in the y-wing. We had one brawl on the ground, but Mike just didnt have the
<br/>
characters. Not that I did, but hey, a drain of 1 with a tibby gas miner still works.
<br/>
I won by 28.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 Score: 2 (+28)1
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 VS Mike Schiemer
<br/>
<br/>
I started with the throne room. I activated less than
<br/>
Mike the whole game. He got down endor with a tie scout and a scrub pilot. 
<br/>
He drained for 2 turns but I saved force and plopped down
<br/>
liberty to block. Mike played hoth defensive perimeter and put feltipern trevagg
<br/>
there on a dewback. I told Mike next turn dewbacks can’t deploy to hoth so he lost it.
<br/>
I think he chose to lose because he had a tauntaun skull in his hand.
<br/>
I deployed a rebel pilot to liberty and battled. Tauntaun
<br/>
skull came to save Mike’s battle in SPACE (how silly is that, a dewback carcass flying at the liberty)!! 
<br/>
He placed dewback out of play for +5 power. Mike still outdid me in activation
<br/>
and as I saved he continued to drain at the hoth defensive
<br/>
perimeter. I eventually deployed Leebo, elom, moisture 
<br/>
farmer, and a chadra fan. Mike blew them all off with ponda
<br/>
babas gun on some scrub. Mike was taking drains 
<br/>
of 1 at endor but some of them were getting blocked by
<br/>
stormtroopers and imperial pilots with his
<br/>
strategic reserves (nice card). I played momaw nadon and 
<br/>
a pilot at ds war room hoping for 2 drain and a cloud city 
<br/>
trooper and kitonak at newly deployed CC guest quarters. 
<br/>
Mike took care of the guest quarters with evazan+baba with an imperial
<br/>
blaster. He had a 3 tracked  so he hit and operated on the trooper 
<br/>
and played tauntan skull again and also draw destiny. He got me there for like 8 cards
<br/>
- was a close match up until that battle. The absolute end of the game happened when he 
<br/>
deployed come here you big coward to shut down the drains at the 
<br/>
DS war room. Mike won by 10. Special note goes to Mike who did most of this report
<br/>
on our game. 
<br/>
<br/>
After Game 2 Score : 2 (18)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Paul Maholick:
<br/>
<br/>
Paul and I played a very tight game, with myself having the advatage most of the 
<br/>
time, but having to constantly move away from his bigger chracters.
<br/>
The fun moment in this game was when Kabe stole a jedi lightsaber
<br/>
from Xizor with her game text. Hadn’t seen that before. Almost out of time, I won by 9.
<br/>
Easily the closest game of the day from start to the close, Paul put up a good fight.
<br/>
<br/>
After Game 3 Score: 4 (27)            
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Steve A:
<br/>
<br/>
Steve had huge power cards, but I managed to get that 3 drain at Kessel again which
<br/>
shut him down. Vader showed up at the CC Guest quarters and killed at least
<br/>
5 characters there but never got control and was stuck. Got traffic cntrl down. Won by 13.
<br/>
<br/>
Final score 6 (40)
<br/>
<br/>
I usually do a little better at sealed, I was disappointed at myself with the way
<br/>
me and Mike’s game went at certain points, but all in all, it goes to show that it takes some
<br/>
skill to use the crap I had and still tie for 2nd place. Hayes pissed everyone off by
<br/>
winning yet again. 
<br/>
<br/>
1. (LS)Hayes Hunter 8(something) 
<br/>
2. (DS)Michael Schiemer 6(+40) 
<br/>
3. (LS)Kris Earle 6(+40) 
<br/>
<br/>
I got a stack of r2 lit cards and a few very rare foils for 
<br/>
a prize. I ended up leaving the whole damn deck and cards
<br/>
there after like an a-hole after doing some trading. Me and Steve Anderson went to Wendy’s then
<br/>
I realized I left the deck and cards behind. We went back like an hour
<br/>
after I left them and there they sat. At least those SW players that day
<br/>
were good honest folk. That says alot.
<br/>
