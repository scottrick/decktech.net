<br/>
<br/>
This is my first tournament of 2001, and I went in optimistic. It was a 3-round tourney, so I knew I was in for a long day of Wars. Naturally, with me were the other members of Team Charlottesville, Heidi Farinholt (1766) and Steven Turner (2060). I went in with a fat 1571, packing Court Scum junk and Palace Raider Watch Your Step.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Court vs. Pat Sullivan (1771) QMC
<br/>
<br/>
OK. QMC. Whatever. He starts something, Squad Assignments, and Battle Plan. So I get set up quickly in the AC with Mighty Jabba and Gailid. He brings Melas, kills Jabba, and puts Melas. A new one comes down, this time with Ephant. He tries Savrip, I Masterful Move it. I get Scum down, he puts Obi and Melas to CC. I get Mosep. He drops H1, Ackbar, and Haashn to Bespin, turning Menace Fades on. Boo. He Grimtaash’s me for 2 Maras, 2 grabbers, and 2 None Shall Pass. Boo-urns. I get basically nothing, he sets up Celebration, I manage to shut Menace Fades off for like 2 turns, but in the end it doesn’t matter. FL (-12)
<br/>
<br/>
0 (-12)
<br/>
Good: Masterful Move on Savrip. 
<br/>
Bad: Grimtaash.
<br/>
Ugly: Menace Fades with a system held by Super Home 1 and a Falcon.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: WYS vs. Corey Gorgan (1877) Y4 Occupation
<br/>
<br/>
Aargh. Where’s me damn Ounee Ta? Oh well. He naturally starts Occupation on Y4 and the Forest. First turn, he gets out Wakeelmui, D*2 DB, Swamp, and Veers to hand with Imp Command. I just draw. Next turn I flip with a Raider to the Tat DB and the Super Falcon (Captain, Melas, Falcon), plus I’ll Take The Leader. He drops some TIEs to Yavin and Vader and Tempest 1 to the Raider. Vader runs into the wall. I drop Luke and Chewie and a Patrol Craft to Choke Vader. Chewie gets choked, but Vader gets waxed. He replaces my AO with We’re In Attack Position Now and sets up on Yavin with his Occupation and whatnot. I have a major brainfart and go after the Vader he has rather than the damn generals, and the EtE on the Forest isn’t really helping me. So he gets set up and I’m taking like ten damn damage a turn. FL (-14)
<br/>
<br/>
0 (-26)
<br/>
Good: Well, I flipped early, which was the right move.
<br/>
Bad: I didn’t take over the Y4 system, which would have completely hosed his deck.
<br/>
Ugly: RBO and WIAPN. Damn that’s harsh.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Court vs. Ken Baker (1518) Anti-Scum Throne Room Mains
<br/>
<br/>
He starts TR, Aim High, Insurrection, and Staging Areas. On his first turn, he drops the H1:DB and frickin Yoda and Obi’s Huts, with Melas at the Obi Hut (because he thinks that’ll stop the Court damage). I pull sites and draw. He drops junk to the H1:DB. I drop beats on Melas and move Mara to the AC. Dumb move - should have beaten on the scrubs on Home 1 or not moved Mara away from Obi’s Hut. This would come back to bite me in the @#$% rather soon. He grabs a DB and draws. I get Mighty Jabba and Gailid to the AC. He drops EPP Han, EPP Leia with Anakin’s Saber, Master Luke with Luke’s Saber, and Ben. I nearly crap myself. Thankfully, he only left 1 force to battle - Telepathy saves my ass. I run. He runs Lando, Leia, and Han after me. I drop Snoova with an Axe and battle. He Clashes Snoova at the end of my deploy, Weapon Lev’s Mara’s saber, plays I Know, and draws like 40 million battle destiny. I lose Ephant to Ghhhk, and he loses Leia to my 6 total BD. Then he drains and wrecks my scrubs for the game. 
<br/>
FL (-14)
<br/>
<br/>
0 (-40)
<br/>
Good: No.
<br/>
Bad: Leaving Mara in the Chamber so I couldn’t None Shall Pass anyone and losing a game I could have won with better play.
<br/>
Ugly: Beat squad getting stopped by Projective Telepathy.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: WYS vs. Jeff Thompson’s (1427) Jabba’s Palace start.
<br/>
He starts JP and Any Methods Necessary for the Dungeon and Boba and his gun. He drops the AC and the Dungeon, and draws. Since I got a red hand, I draw as well. He drops 4-LOM and Concussion Rifle (separate) and Boba and Gun (separate) to the Cantina. We are not impressed. I flip with two Raiders in Crafts. He drops All Wrapped Up and 2 Interceptors to the system, and moves Boba and 4-LOM over to the DB where I have the Palace Raider. I drain, drop Dash and Wedge in the Outrider, and wreck him. He drops Djas to the Raider, I react over and draw 3 BD, he hits both Patrol Crafts with Boba’s Gun (dammit!), but loses everything but 4-LOM. I drop Jedi Luke and a stick to the Palace. He draws. I drain and drop Mirax and Melas, kill him for 12. I set up Celebration and Harvest. He drops Bossk with Mortar against Owen and Beru, Bounties them, yet still misses horribly and dies. I drop Lando with BP to the Spaceport DB, I’ll Take The Leader, and Han to the system. He puts Zuckuss and Feltipern Trevagg’s Stun Rifle to the Cantina, but I drain and Celebrate him out. The Death Mark he put on Dash only helped me - lost force from my hand came back with the Celebration/Harvest, and at the end of the game I had no lost pile. FW (+37 [in a row?])
<br/>
<br/>
2(-3)
<br/>
Good: Winning, finally. Getting everything set up just right.
<br/>
Bad: Beating up a newbie.
<br/>
Ugly: Dash and Wedge versus 2 TIEs that don’t draw battle destiny.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Court vs. Robert Lach (1523) HB Squassin Matching Mooks 
<br/>
He starts the straight HB start with Squassin, Superficial Damage, and something else. He gets out Anoat and Chandrila with Dutch in Gold 1 with a Torpedo. I get Ephant and Jabba to the AC. He puts Red Leader and Red 1 to Anoat and Captain Han in the Falcon with Concussion Missile to Kashyyyk. Fett comes to Anoat and wrecks Red Leader. I get Gailid to the AC and move Ephant to the Dungeon with Presence to drain for 4. That, Search and Destroy, Zuckuss wrecking Jek in Red 6 at Hoth, and me probing Anoat and forcing an 8 force loss pretty much finished the game right off. FW (+22)
<br/>
<br/>
4(+19)
<br/>
Good: Winning again.
<br/>
Bad: Couldn’t find Mosepbut oh well. Life goes on.
<br/>
Ugly: Zuckuss vs. Jek. Not a happy matchup.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: WYS vs. Pat Sullivan (1771) Scum Scum with Pote as rep
<br/>
He starts generic MKOS junk. I flip quickly with Raiders. He sets up in the AC with skinny Jabba, Boelo, and Pote. He drops a bunch of Skrillings on a barge, I set up I’ll Take The Leader and Menace Fades. He’s able to beat down a Raider when I forget to leave an extra force for First Strike and decide to Fallen Portal his Merc Pilot and a Skrilling rather than reacting the Palace Raider. I get a couple Harvests off late game, and Order forces him into some crappy battles, but I can’t get my Celebration going, and his drains are just too much. FL (-12)
<br/>
<br/>
4(+7)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: Finishing with positive differential, setting up well, realizing that the deck severely needs Effective Repairs.
<br/>
Bad: Not getting Tatooine Celebration, which would have won me the game. Not leaving an extra force in case of First Strike, which would have won me the game.
<br/>
Ugly: Skinny Jabba. Look at him!
<br/>
<br/>
Well, all in all an OK day. I should have gone 4-2 rather than 2-4, but that’s all my fault - sloppy play has a tendency to hurt me a lot. I got a foil Wicket in prize support (because the dork ahead of me drafted the Red Squad 1 foil, dammit) and trade The Emperor for a Tallon Karde (woohoo.)
<br/>
