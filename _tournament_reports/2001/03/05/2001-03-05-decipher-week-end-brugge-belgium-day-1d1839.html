The Decipher week-end in Brugge was waited due to his interessant prizes: Luke Skywalker JK Decipher Con 2k tee-shirt, Vader foil japanese case topper, a lot of set of Ref. 2 (box topper, expanded universe, combo card), Several pairs of tournament foil (masterful move, the signal, decree and Alter), etc... Deutsch, Netherland, France and Belgium would be reprenseted by their best player.
<br/>
<br/>
We are 6 from France to go to the event and personnaly I had 2 weeks of holliday (I am still at school) for playtesting. So I am ready and my decks also (I am playing French Ralltiir still rocks and French Smugglers are champion "WYS"). A lot of Deutsch and Netherlander are there but Koen Meijssen isn’t there. It doesn’t matter my friend, I will have my revenge (Liege) another day ! 54 players show up for a big tournament with high competition (Bastian Winkelhaus and Martin Falke are also there).
<br/>
<br/>
Light: Watch Your Step
<br/>
Dark: Ralltiir (yes ! Ralltiir)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#1 Light Side "WYS" against a young player "Court"
<br/>
I apply the first turn flip with Palace Raider, Patrol Craft and another smuggler on the 2 tatooine DB for high activation second turn (staging area). I have Fallen Portal in hand but he doesn’t come to me. I set up in space with Dash, Mirax, Battle Plan, Celebration and I’ll take the leader. He eventually comes to space but I crush his fleet and drains him to death on my DB...
<br/>
FW 2(+24)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#2 Dark Side against a deutsh guy who plays DPC Yannick Lapointe lightside deck (hidden base who kills early with 14 battle destinies)
<br/>
He laughts, calls a friend to show him my objective and starts Ounne Ta. No matter, he is dead because I know his deck :-) I don’t deploy my Ralltiir sites untill I am ready to flip. On the first turn I put pressure on him by asking his hand size. He fears Monnok and doesn’t draw more than 12 cards. Eventually, I play Monnok lost and get 2 Leia Epp. I flip with Tempest Scout 1 which is transporting a biker scout trooper and elsek to react for free and make Ghhhk by themself without fearing Clash of saber :-) No beatdown for him this turn and I play Omni box to have a 5 on next turn. He draws and I deploy Search&amp;Destroy. I wait him with one At St on each site, Trample in my hand and a 5 on my reserve deck. So when he tries to deploy his only Han in his deck I trample him. I finish him with my drains and S&amp;D...
<br/>
FW 4(+44)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#3 Lightside against Christophe Vandalem ISB Scum
<br/>
I have a bad starting hand so I draw while he deploys Jabbas Palace and all his sites. Second turn Grimtash lost (taken with Tunnel Vision) and he loses 3 outer rim scout. It will be hard for him to flip. I can now flip on my DB, set up in space with Battle Plan, Menace Fades and I’ll Take the leader (no celebration because he has Endor Occupation in his hand :-). He tries to deploy some ISB agents but I go killing 2 with Lando w/Gun + a smuggler to prevent him to flip. He eventually flips in the end but I still drain and he doesn’t...
<br/>
FW 6(+65)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#4 Darkside against Martijn Peeters WYS
<br/>
Monnok first turn and he loses 2 OOC/TT. I have also Ozzel and deploy him for free to activate with Mob. Point. He deploys Artoo in Red 5 with Luke and moves on Ralltiir. I prepare the flip with my imperials and draw for a ship. I deploy dreadnaught+At St pilot (from the deck) in front of Artoo and flip. I then move on Carida to satisfy Battle Plan. S&amp;D starts to hurt him when we fight a few in space (I kill Dash, Luke and Han so Outrider, Falcon and Artoo stay empty in space :-). He eventually puts Nightfall on Ralltiir and comes with smugglers and an undercover spy but Trample makes his job...
<br/>
FW 8(+85)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#5 Darkside against my master Jimmy Faelens "French Smugglers are champion"WYS"
<br/>
All the game Jimmy wasn’t carefull ?!? First turn he flips with smugglers (on his docking bay and on mine). I deploy At St+Pilot+DS-1613+First Strike+battle. I retrieve one he loses one and his smugglers. He then goes to space with no protection to prevent early flip but I can activate a lot on my DB and even flip one turn after. Then I battle him to death with battle destiny +4. Jimmy always uses his all forces to prevent me to flip but never protects his guys or draws a lot of cards. So I always dominate the game and win easily (sorry Jimmy :-(
<br/>
FW 10(+112)
<br/>
<br/>
Game#6 Lightside against Bastian Winkelhaus MKOS
<br/>
I apply the first turn flip and he tries to chase me from the DB with Xizor. Fallen Portal makes his job... Then he sets up in Audience Chamber but I deploy the "traditionnal" stuf: Battle Plan, Menace Fades, Celebration and I’ll take the leader. Dash Rendar and a few others smugglers guard wisely the system. So I drain more than him and he has to pay his drain that I retrieve. He comes outside with his Barge and some guys. I flee and he purchases me. I kill one guy that follows mine with Sorry About The Bad English/Shock.Rev. and play it again the next turn from lost pile. I put out of play Xizor, Guri and Dengar with OOC but Boelo and Jodo Kast prevent me from drawing a lot of destinies. I never draw Chewbacca Protector (I play it twice) to neutralize one so the game is bored, me fleeing and him retrieving sometimes with Scum+First Strike. This game continues untill the judge announces "Hands Down" ! At that time, a lot of players are looking this game because the winner will gain the tee shirt. I finish my turn and win with 20 forces while Bastian have 18. Very close but I played like a scrub due to the pressure of playing a guy like Bastian. He hurt me 2 times because I was wrong about the rules: one turn I had a patrol craft and 2 Palace Raiders, one inside and one outside. I was convinced I can react by embarking the other palace raider and avoiding weapon. But I couldn’t embark in a vehicle that didn’t react from another location. So he puts Mara+Saber, initiates, swings and plays Dark Strike. Then he draws his destiny and cancels mine with Myo. On this point I was thinking he couldn’t do that because a Myo is ever on table but another time I was wrong... So I am convinced that if hadn’t made mistake on rules, if I draw Chewie or Clash of sabers (to neutralize Boelo or Jodo) I would have won easily...but no matter I am THE undefeated player and win Tee Shirt Luke JK+Darth Vader Foil Japanese !
<br/>
FW 11(+132)
<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow it will be a team event and I am sure Bastian wants his revenge: he is sure he can win against my deck by playing more offensily. So he bets with Jimmy 500 FB and they will play tomorrow :-)
<br/>
<br/>
I will post my report of the team event and my 2 decks later. So be patient !
