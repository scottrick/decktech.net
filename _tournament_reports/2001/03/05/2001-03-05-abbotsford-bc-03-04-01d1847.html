<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, here’s the second tournament of my friend Justin’s trip to Vancouver.  
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night, we attempted to tech out Justin’s decks even more, since now he knew what was going on with them... but our lack of sleep the night before wouldn’t let us.  We hit the sack DAMN early, and just slept till 10 am the next day.  We were picking up Alex at noon, and he knew where this shop in Abbotsford was, so 10 would give us some deckbuilding time.
<br/>
<br/>
Turns out I thought Alex said meet him at one place, but he said another... Man driving around a busy section of town looking for the right place BITES.  We found the guy about 20 minutes late, but it’s all good :)  The tournament starts at 1, it’s about a 45-50 minute drive...  yeah sure we’ll be on time :)  Actually, we ended up having to give the store a call and delay the tournament by 10 minutes or so, but oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
My prediction is that I play Justin once, and Alex twice, since i’ve been told everyone at this tournament besides us will be ’scrubs’.  ah well, such is life.  With us 3, it’s a 10 person tournament, nice and small.  A refreshing break from the bigger ones in Vancouver.  Currently, my rating is 1904, should be going to 1964 from the tournament the day before.
<br/>
<br/>
We arrive at the store, and pairings start... Game 1, Alan vs Alex???? F|_|CK!!!  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : 
<br/>
Al’s super secret teched out provincial LS vs Alex’s (1952) evil Endor Ops
<br/>
Well damn, this was a good game considering my LS was completely untested.  I did some good wrecking, but his imperial command was huge...  It was pretty funny, we began to draw a crowd has all the other games finished.  I continuously heard comments like "Oh man look at those teched out decks from vancouver" and stuff like that :P  Jedi Luke had a good time wrecking Thrawn on the ground, but in the end, I couldn’t hang, and didn’t find enough of my stuff.  
<br/>
FL - 12
<br/>
0 -12
<br/>
<br/>
Man it was quite the game :)  We went through my deck after and thought up some neat changes...  Anyways..
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:
<br/>
Al’s SICK MKOS vs Alex’s (1952) MWYHL crap deck
<br/>
Sh1T  Alex AGAIN.  looks my prediction is coming true.  Any I set up in the audience chamber, and for his first turn watch him deploy yoda and draw up.  My turn, I drain, he loses a DOS... man sucks to draw her.  His turn, he deploys DOS FROM HAND... he drew BOTH in opening hand.  Man that bites.  I do my set up, and get out search and destroy... he deploys to the tat docking to stop it.  He’s got too much stuff there for me to even think of touching him, Ben Kenobi, lando+axe, chewie protector, and some other shmuck.  I end up grabbing both on the edge and off the edge, and the game goes on, both of us pinging away and retrieving.  Master Luke + Stick start wrecking me outside, combined with his 7 on test 5.  Ug.  time keeps going, and we keep playing, pinging away....  he beats up on my abyssin at the passenger deck for like 2 overflow with corran horn, I promptly fight him with the Barge and lose it for attrition, killing Corran.  I put a lone abyssin into the desert, baiting him to get trapped... Ben and some other schmuck follow him in.  I deploy someone else, battle, retrieve, he lose 1, sack both my guys.  Cancel his drains.  He ends up moving Masta into the audience chamber, where I drop 4-lom and wreck him..  He decided to just lose the difference instead of losing Masta to give me the win instead of giving me the timed Victory... i think.  
<br/>
FW + 20
<br/>
2  + 8
<br/>
<br/>
We drew a big crowd again, it was great :)  Someone went "Hey look man, it’s your deck!"   "No mines way better".... "No way man look at them go!"  It was classic!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:
<br/>
Al’s Super Secret Teched out provincial Deck vs Robbie Walker’s (1512) BHBM
<br/>
Hey good I wanted to test vs this deck.  He ONLY started Mob points and imperial arrest order, which is strange... I opted to give him Luke my first turn, ultra cheap to endor.  That’s the problem with BHBM, if they give you luke, your stabbing yourself in the foot.  If they don’t give you luke, they’re kickin’ your @#$% with him, again, stabbin’ yourself in the foot.  I start setting up, and suddenly... "Alter"  WTF!!!! WHO THE FUK PLAYS FUKING S/A !  We have a great time talkin’ smack about how i’ll cancel his sense with my alter :)  He tried to duel my ass, but my draws were way too high for him to even touch.  I got a massive beatdown on him once, but his ghhhk had none of that.  In the end, his drain of one at the endor docking bay couldn’t hang.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 + 17
<br/>
4 + 25
<br/>
<br/>
Alex and I go hit the Subway to get some food... I mention "I played some BHBM deck that PLAYED Sense/Alter!!!! WHO THE FUK PLAYS FUKING SENSE/ALTER!!! I MEAN WHAT THE DAMN SH1T IS THAT!"  Alex thought it was pretty damn funny :)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:
<br/>
Al’s SICK MKOS vs Justin Cachelin’s (1769) Dumb WYS
<br/>
Oh man, talk about crazy predictions.  Travel an hour for a tourney, 3 of the four games are against my travel mates.. ahh well.  
<br/>
Justin played like GOOEY JANK this game.  My 1st turn, i get my sites out... he deploy Melas to my audience chamber, then wedge for 4 to jabba’s palace.. NONE SHALL PASS!  
<br/>
"WHAT!! Why you doing that, that sucks!  it’s wedge!!!"
<br/>
"yeah i know :P"
<br/>
Next turn, Xizor from hand, mighty jabba from reserve, 4-lom from hand... Lose Melas and 16 more please.
<br/>
He tried to set up a presence in space, but I actually found my ships this time, and bossk and Zuckuss had none of that.  He lost too many cards too early, and I grabbed his On the Edge, and just continuously wrecked him on the ground.  We got a nice crowd, as usual, people trying to guess what my diff would be.  I went from 34, to losing some cards, to getting almost everything back, purposely losing characters just to retrieve em. 
<br/>
FW 2 +36
<br/>
6 +61
<br/>
<br/>
So I end up second, and Alex came third.  We eliminated each other off :)
<br/>
<br/>
A little bit of after game trading went on, everyone was amazed at my provincial binder :P  I convinced almost everyone there to make to the trip to the provincials in a month, so hopefully that will go well.
<br/>
<br/>
Well now it’s time to take Justin to the Bus Depot... let me tell you, Abbotsford has THE MOST SCREWED UP road system EVER.  Man you miss a turn, you’d think you could just take the next one and come back around.... Not here, you end up on some damn country road in the middle of nowhere.  At one point we actually ended up in some other small damn @#$% village like 12 klicks north of Abbotsford, and pulled some funny @#$% u-turns.  I think the line Alex yelled out sums it up:  "We’re Tourists!"
<br/>
We eventually found the bus station in the most screwed up spot, it’s like surrounded by all sorts of industrial areas, then Alex and I head back to Van.
<br/>
<br/>
Props:
<br/>
blah.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
Justin for being dumb.
<br/>
The tourney for being too long, I was worn out by the end of the second game.
<br/>
FUKIN SENSE ALTER!!!
<br/>
Abbotsford road system.
