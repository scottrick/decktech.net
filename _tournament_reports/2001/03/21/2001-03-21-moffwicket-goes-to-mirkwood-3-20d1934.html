<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I’m writing this one at school between classes, as I am deathly afraid to post anything from my computer at home.  As some of you may have noticed, I’ve had some computer probs lately, and as a result 3 completely blank reports have been posted.  Rest assured I am not an idiot; I wouldn’t waste your time like that.  And if I really wanted to piss people off, I’d sure as hell post *something* instead of nothing.  Did that make any sense?  I didn’t think so.  Anyway, I’ve given up on posting my version of the Hastings report, and here comes last night’s Mirkwood results.
<br/>
<br/>
Pre:  I’ve grown sick of my WYS, so Garrett talked me into making an MBO deck.  I was planning on using it, but I just barely got it thrown together before the tournament, and the turnout was a little bigger than normal, so I didn’t feel like losing.  I stuck with old faithful one more time.  And since Jim Li’s in town next week, I’ll prolly keep it together for next Tuesday’s match too.
<br/>
<br/>
I can’t remember what order these games took place, but rest assured they all happened.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Moffwicket’s WYS vs. Graham Neal’s MKOS skrilling madness
<br/>
<br/>
I used to think TIE interceptors was the best anti-WYS deck out there, but after beating each of the best Twin Cities’ players’ TIE decks (Raveling, Neal, and Grace), I have since changed my mind.  MKOS skrilling madness is the best anti-wys deck.  Graham took early control of the AC with lil’ jabba, chall, gailid and a few skrillings.  I took the system early, but Zuckuss and Fett drew about 13 in battle destiny to wipe out my fleet.  How did those two draw multiple destinies you ask?  I dunno.  I didn’t catch that until 10 minutes later.  Graham had then dropped Bossk in bus.  He said he’d had all of them the whole game, he just accidentally deployed the wrong one before the battle.  One the ground he took over the other two JP battlegrounds.  My aliens were too puny to beat them, and with No Bargin and no doubt a couple none shall passes in his hand, I knew my mains would never be able to storm the palace.  Harvest couldn’t keep up with his drains.

Good: I OOCed a few cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: He had no lost pile when it ended.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My SYCFA big blue (walkers/tramples) vs. Mike Raveling’s TIGIH random pile
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so it wasn’t totally random.  It was mostly mains (endor chewie &amp; han), crix madness, a couple ishi tibs, hementh, ghoel, and 2--count em’--2 goo nee tays.  First turn I search for a docking bay and notice a vader is actually in my force pile.  I already have tarkin, so I draw 1, and it’s the big bad vader daddy.  He moves Luke out to the db, deploys Goo, and sets crix and an ishi tib at the home1 db.  I have just enough for the dynamic duo, and Luke is mine.  He gets Han and chewie into hand, but doesn’t deploy them.  I don’t drain cuz I get a premonition of Lost in the Wilderness.  Fearing a cheap main beatdown, I deploy Tempest 1 and run to the CC db.  At the end of the game Mike says that he was going to deploy Ghoel, lick Vader (kinky) and pound me.  He takes over endor.  I get Zuckuss in boat and his little pal 4lom to carida and put PotF at the ccdb.  As Mike cycles about 3 destiny 5 interrupts every turn, I wish I had grabbers.  He does a little On the edge action, so I twilek for Something special.  I after saving for a turn cuz of goo, I deploy chirneau in big E with zuckuss.  Then I realize he’s only ability 2, and I just wasted a turn.  I put another PotF at carida, so I’m draining for 3 there and three at ccdb (vader now has a saber).  Crix &amp; co has now moved to the D* db.  I deploy a chicken walker or 2 and try to trample him 3 times, missing each.  Mike deploys Leia and battles, but I react with scout 6 and trample someone.  He loses the battle by 1.  I run away, he chases me off of bespin.  I trample a few more people, we battle a few times, but he never wins a single battle.  Late game he’s sitting just at the CCdb and tries an Off the Edge, but I point to CHYBC and he’s screwed.  I end up draining him out.  There’s a lot more detail I’d like to tell you, but my time’s running out.

Good: beat him for the second time in a row.
<br/>
great game
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: crix is really hard to step on
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: my dark vs. graham’s wys
<br/>
<br/>
we played this match up at hastings, and he destroyed me.  this time, I knew to start with something special.  I scared puny capt han off tatooine with big E and Thrawn.  on the ground, broken con kept away the barriers and fallen portal was useless against my chicken walkers.  Tempest scout 1 stayed alive the whole game.  It was my MVP of this game, trampling at least half a dozen chumps, including the lars.  At one point I tracked destinies to get theron nutt with a 3 and lando with a 4.  Lord vader and saber made a late guest appearance and held down some crucial drains.  The falcon took over the death star, but battle order was out, and instead of draining, graham elected to send suicide luke (bacta tank) after scout 1 over and over again until he learned that scout 1 is invincible.  He never gets to harvest, and I win.

<br/>
Good: finally I beat WYS
<br/>
Bad: ...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: WYS vs. Adam’s huntdown dueler
<br/>
<br/>
I have a god opening hand.  There is no way I can lose this game.  He gets immediate choke vader and stick to the d* db.  I put Dash at the system, and a guy at a db with fallen portal in hand first turn.  Pick up and there’s my OOC/TT.  I set up at every one of my sites with I’m on the leader.  Jedi Luke is hiding from vader in the cantina.  He gets palpy and janus at another of his dbs.  He’s using operational to set up mad destinies.  Then comes mara and turns luke.  This concerns me slightly, but havesting back a 6 and tracking it around for a couple on the edges is the name of the game.  I outdrain and out retrieve him.

FW by about 20
<br/>
<br/>
Good: best opening hand ever
<br/>
Bad: other than turn luke, he didn’t do much
<br/>
<br/>
Josh Grace goes undefeated to win.  Many people go 3-1, but my 3-1 is only good enuf for 5th.
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Grace for winning
<br/>
me for beating Mike and graham in the same day (first time for me)
<br/>
Chad and Jerry for deciding to get into WWF raw deal
<br/>
herb for not being there
<br/>
everyone for great matches
<br/>
Kane for being the funnest multiplayer wrestler
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:  everyone for picking on me no matter what wrestler I was.  I guess I’m that threatening.   </font></td>
