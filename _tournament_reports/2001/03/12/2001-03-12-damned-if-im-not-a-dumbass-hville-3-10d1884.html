<br/>
so pissed about poor decisions/poor tracking I can hardly write this, but here goes 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1  RTP vs Matt P. AOTBS 
<br/>
Poor tracking cost me this one, it should have been an easy victory.  He started out with the whole POTF to the DB/XIZOR to the DB thing and I droped 8D8, a tube, EBG and searched for an escort.  Turn two he drops Paply to the prison and force lightnings Leia...  Not a problem.  I deploy Jedi Luke and a stick to get around VOTDP and We chase our tails for a turn or two before I draw another Leia and escort her into the War Room for a flip.  Now I go on the attack and begin a Death Star Plans Run.  Matt does something that he admits is a first for him in that deck...  he runs.  We both pay for drains for a few turns and I get ready to move the plans to Yavin for what I thought would be 13 which I could pay easily...  tracked it wrong....  I had 14 force left after the move, the bottom one(I thought) would be Order To Engage that I wanted to draw...  it ended up next to the death star plans and lift tube I had tracked as destiny.  Damn it.  We continue the chase for a few more turns as I draw for another Death Star Plans, only this time I have a lot more lost than I could afford for a major run and DS plans for 8 was not enough to keep me alive for too long. 
<br/>
The other thing I forgot(DOH) was that Rogue 2 is manuver 7, which he shot at and drew a 5(should not have been hit) with Dengar in our one major battle.
<br/>
<br/>
FL 0 (-about 12)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  drawing a 16 for Death Star Plans
<br/>
Lows: drawing a 16 when I meant to draw a 13
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2  HDADTJ vs (forgot name) MBO
<br/>
<br/>
He had a really solid deck, and was able to flip MBO and blow up the Death Star with little trouble, but I was way ahead in drains at that point in a rather non-interactive game.  Our early battle was my Boba Fett in Slave 1 vs his Cracken in Tala 1...  He had already flipped so he had decent power, but I drew a tracked 7 and destroyed him.  Boba then retreated to the Y4 DB to wait out the rest of the game. Our late game battle was Boba in Slave 1 alongside Tempest 1 and Igar at the Yavin 4 DB vs his Capt Han and General Calrisian.  I trampled Han and raped the lone General.  Win by about 17.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+ 5-7)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: HD being dominant again
<br/>
Lows: Death Star make BIG boom!!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3  HDADTJ vs Matt P. QMC
<br/>
<br/>
I controlled his CC sites from the first turn on with DVDLOTS... He tried to battle me with EPP Leia and some form of Chewbacca, but TFHGOOTU said nah... At one point the Emperor and Janus were also at CC watching carefully over the mining colony.  Luke came to visit and I considered dueling him, but didn’t.  Then I backed up DLOTS with Dr. E&amp; Ponda Baba plus Mara Jade and her stick, Disarm Epp Luke, he backs Luke up with Wedge RSL and another scrub and battles.  I choke the scrub and forget to swing the saber *coughSCRUBcough* even though I occupied Gall.  I coulda gotten rid of Luke too and left no destiny for Wedge, instead Mara dies to attrition.  He cancles Visage with a spy, but I am not worried, I had a plan for them. Later on he drops Obi and JPOTSD Lando vs DVDLOTS and battles.  I ignore my plan and the fact that I know I can win this battle and decide to duel instead.  No way can he beat me when I have three sevens stacked...I am a DUMB@SS... I should let him try to exclude Vader...  not gonna happen, now I choke Obi, or swing at him and Operate, or swing and Gall text... ANY of the three options leaves me with only Lando to deal with, and power 12+destiny to a 4 without destiny.  Why the hell did I feel like losing a duel *cough!!!SCRUB!!!cough* without Vader, HD dies... Loss by about 19, after he On/Off the edged for 12
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: none
<br/>
Lows: Dominating the game so completely then losing because I am an IDIOT
<br/>
<br/>
FL 2 (-12 or so)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4  RTP vs Matt Reed’s ORS ISB
<br/>
<br/>
Well this should be fun, I have to be faster than ISB, and spies can drop anywhere.  I got a good opening hand and was able to make the rescue quickly, Matt was a little cautious and was ready for me when I got set up.  The game consisted of several major battles with him getting several destinies, but most of them kinda low(ORS and a few low destiny characters) so I would either lose an ability &gt;3 enhanced character(who Obi revived)or abuse the @#$% out of Savrip  and my attrition against him being satisfied by scouts.  The breaking point came when I finally killed Guri and started getting my multiple destinies.  I got in 3 death Star plans runs as I chased his forces about and his Out Of Play pile grew and grew...  Order To Engage came down twice and was immediately canceled BOTH times by Point Man...In a really long game I win by 27 or so.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+ about 16)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Beating Matt, a first for me.  He is so much better at this game than I am.  Tons of battles
<br/>
Lows: He took SSPFT out of his deck at some point during deck building, I retrieved more than the margin of victory.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clay took first place and won the foil, I played like a RETARD and managed only about 5th when I DOMINATED the two games I lost.
<br/>
