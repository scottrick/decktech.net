<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well here’s another weekly tournement from Smyrna.  I was kinda pumped coming into this tourney since in the last two tourneys i got 3rd.  My Huntdown dueling deck needed tweeking so i exchanged the Tatoine Docking Bay for Cloud City docking bay. Also i exchanged the generic docking bay for a Death Star Docking bay.  In my Rescue the Princess deck. I decided to add in a Clash of Sabers and two Fallen Portals.  My rating going into the tourney was 1592.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks: - Hunting With Vader Version 2.0                       = Dark side

<br/>
Pretourney:
<br/>
<br/>
I get to the store around 11 o’clock after a night of heavy playtesting at a friends house.  I play Stephan Micheal so he could test his new WYS asteriods.  I win only because i got CHYBC out and he took out his #’s.  After that I play a game with Kevin out local squadron member but he wasn’t running today’s tpurney.  It was my RTP vs. his AOTBS.  Basicly I set up Menace Fades and started draining then laided my mains against his dude.  I win that game.  Well everyone starts coming in and we get 12 people to play. It’s a four game tournement.

Game 1 :  My Huntdown vs. Michael Martin’s QMC. 
<br/>
Well Michael is the local newbie but he is learning how to play fast.  My opening hand contains DVDLOTS and a weapon lev.  I started IAO, Mob. Points, and secret plans.  He starts QMC - bespin, Leia’s Quest Quarters - Squadron assignments and superfical damage. I drop DVDLOTS grab his stick.  I grab Executor Docking bay and Cardia and deploy them doth.  I make him lose to visage and I say go. He draws 2 cards, saves the rest and loses to visage.  My turn i drain for 2 and drop mara with stick to my CC docking bay inwhich I had gotten using IAO. I draw the rest and make him lose to visage.  His turn he drops Master Luke and Lando with Gun and battles.  He misses the chance to get Mara to my hand and misses the shot.  I strike down Luke with Mara’s stick and Lando dies to attrition.  I am immune to his attrittion so he loses to visage.  My turn i get out my last docking bay and drop Xizor and Janus there.  For the rest of the the game I janus.  He deploys a Correllian Corrvette to Bespin.  I drop Chimera and battle so he loses 3 force.  We battle and he loses 3 force each time.
