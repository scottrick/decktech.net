<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After going 4-2 at my last tournamnet, I wanted to change 
<br/>
my decks a little bit.  I decided on My Kind Of Scum with
<br/>
Skrilling swarm for dark.  For light, I played Quiet 
<br/>
Mining Colony, with interrupts that avoid battling.  This
<br/>
would be my first tournament away from home.  There were
<br/>
only eight players there, that is a bad turnout considering
<br/>
three players came from Cincinnati.  We all came together.
<br/>
it was me, Matt Scott, and Albert(AJ) Klein
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My dark vs. Gary Blackburn (1583) WYS space
<br/>
I start Well Guarded, No Bargin, TINT/Opp Enforcement,
<br/>
and Power of the Hutt.  He goes with Squad Assignments,
<br/>
Scrambled Transmission, and Your Insight Serves you well.  
<br/>
My first turn I deploy Chamber, Jabba, and Scum.  I use 
<br/>
Power to take Bib.  I draw the rest.  His turn he deploys
<br/>
Kessel and Artoo in Red 5 with Farm Boy aboard.  My turn I
<br/>
deploy Lower Passages, with Ephant Mon there.  I also deploy
<br/>
Pore Snitkin and Galid to Chamber.  I deploy a skrilling to
<br/>
Jabba’s Palace and flip.  I deploy Den of Thieves, which 
<br/>
was very usefull.  I move the skrilling to the Lower 
<br/>
Passages to join Ephant Mon.  His turn he drains, I cancel
<br/>
it.  He searches for Corellia and deploys Mirax on the 
<br/>
Skate.  He draws the rest.  My turn I drain for 4 and deploy
<br/>
the Sail Barge to Jabba’s Palace with a Merc. Pilot aboard.
<br/>
I draw and get Zuckuss and IG-88 in their ships.  Next turn
<br/>
he drains, then flips with Han and Chewie aboard the Falcon
<br/>
to Kessel.  He deploys Dash in Outrider to Corellia.  Next
<br/>
turn isn’t the time to go to space.  My turn I drain for 6,
<br/>
deploy Search and Destroy, he would lose one for that the 
<br/>
whole game. I save up.  He drains, I cancel the 3 at 
<br/>
Kessel.  He deploys LEEBO on the Outrider and moves Artoo 
<br/>
and Luke to Tatooine.  I drain for 6 and then attack.  I 
<br/>
deploy my ships, and battle.  I draw Wounded Wookie, and
<br/>
a skrilling.  My 22 to his 8.  He loses them to cover it.
<br/>
I let him go.  He drains, I cancel and lose one.  He plays 
<br/>
A Few Maneuvers and moves the Falcon to Corellia.  My turn
<br/>
I drain him for 8.  He’s almost done.  I move Zuckuss and
<br/>
IG-88 to Kessel.  His turn he deploys Kessel Run and 
<br/>
targets the Falcon.  He plays A Few Maneuvers and moves it
<br/>
to Kessel.  My turn I drain, and play Set For Stun on Han.
<br/>
It works.  So I battle and draw two skrillings.  He loses
<br/>
them both.  That’s pretty much the game.  I retrieve my lost
<br/>
pile with Abyssin Ornamnet and drain him out to finish the
<br/>
game.  
<br/>
FW: 2(21)
<br/>
He never challenged me on the ground.  I had many effects 
<br/>
on the table, soi didn’t win by that much.  It was a good
<br/>
game for me.  I didn’t expect to see a deck like that.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My light vs. Adam Reidy (1437) Bring Him Before Me
<br/>
I start Battle Plan, Do, or Do Not &amp; Wise Advice, and 
<br/>
Squad Assignments.  He doesn’t start anything.  His first
<br/>
turn he deploys Emporer and Emporer’s Power.  My turn I 
<br/>
search for Cloud City and deploy West Gallery from my hand.
<br/>
I draw the rest.  On his turn he deploys Overseeing It
<br/>
Personaly (WTF?).  He draws his force.  My turn I get the 
<br/>
North Corridor and deploy Princess Leia to the Guest 
<br/>
Quarters.  I also deploy Corran to the Corridor.  I draw.
<br/>
He deploys Lord Vader to Corran’s site and battles.  I play
<br/>
Dodge to move to the West Gallery.  On my turn I deploy
<br/>
Carbonite Chamber and Luke w/ Saber there.  I use Squad
<br/>
Assin. to get the Outrider and deploy it and Dash to Cloud
<br/>
City.  I move over Corran to Vader’s site and the Outrider
<br/>
to Bespin.  On his turn I play Path of Least Resistance 
<br/>
during his deploy phase.  He moves over to the chamber 
<br/>
and takes Luke.  I drain for 3 and deploy Anakin’s 
<br/>
Lightsaber on Leia.  I get the Falcon to Bespin and 
<br/>
Celebration out.  I deploy Mennace Fades, Order to Engage,
<br/>
and Aim High.  I move over to Vader’s site with Corran.  
<br/>
He deploys Snoova and Mara Jade to the Guest Quarters.  He
<br/>
battles at Vader’s site.  I play Narrow Escape and move to 
<br/>
Lower Corridor.  Next, he battles Leia.  I fire and hit
<br/>
Snoova.  I draw a 4 and he draws a 5.  I lose Leia and he
<br/>
loses both.  Next turn, I retrieve and deploy Obi-Wan w/
<br/>
Lightsaber.  I play Off the Edge and retrieve 5 with a 
<br/>
tracked I’ll Take the Leader.  His turn he drains, I cancel
<br/>
it with the text of the Lower Corridor.  It goes on like
<br/>
that for a couple of more turns.  I win with no lost pile.
<br/>
FW: 4(52)
<br/>
Again, I deploy a lot of cards.  I’ll have to learn not to 
<br/>
do that.  My interrupts were too much for him.  Cloud City
<br/>
Celebration is cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My light vs. AJ Klein (1588) MKOS alien mains
<br/>
AJ came up with us.  He knows my deck and I know his.  I  
<br/>
start Squad Assin, DODN/WA, and Battle Plan.  He starts 
<br/>
No Bargin, Power, and TINT/Opp. Enforcement. His first 
<br/>
turn he deploys Mighty Jabba and Galid at the Chamber 
<br/>
and draws.  My turn I deploy Cloud City from my hand and 
<br/>
search for Carbonite Chamber and Leia to the Guest Quarters.  
<br/>
I let him go.  He  drains and deploys Ephant Mon to the 
<br/>
Chamber and Chall Bekan to the Lower Passages and searches 
<br/>
for an abyssin.  He flips his objective.  On my turn I 
<br/>
drain for one and he loses the Sail Barge.  I deploy the 
<br/>
Lower Corridor and Red 4 with Hobbie piloting to Cloud City.  
<br/>
I deploy Luke w/ Saber to the Corridor.  I flip my 
<br/>
objective.  I deploy han in Falcon to Bespin.I draw Lando 
<br/>
w/ Gun, Melas, and Twass Khaa.  He deploys Boba Fett w/ Gun
<br/>
and an abyssin to Jabba’s Palace, Myo to the Chamber.  On 
<br/>
my turn I deploy Celebration and play Off the Edge and 
<br/>
target Luke.  Being the dumb @$$ I am, I mistrack and draw 
<br/>
a one.  Luke dies.  Mennace Fades comes down.  I get down 
<br/>
Obi with Lightsaber to the Corridor.  He deploys IG-88 
<br/>
with Riot Gun to the site with Leia, but he doesn’t battle 
<br/>
me.  He lets me go.  I try Off the Edge again and target 
<br/>
Obi-Wan.  I track right this time and retrieve 4.  I 
<br/>
retrieve again with Celebration.  I deploy Lando, Melas, 
<br/>
and Twass Khaa to Jabba’s Palace.  I battle and hit Boba 
<br/>
Fett.  I play the lost part of Sorry About the Mess &amp; 
<br/>
Blaster Profincey.  He is in trouble now.  I draw a 5.  
<br/>
My power is 13 and his is 2.  He loses 9 off the top.  AJ 
<br/>
is almost done.  On his turn he doesn’t drain (Battle Plan)
<br/>
and instead deploys Bossk in Hound’s Tooth to Cloud City.  
<br/>
He lets me go.  I drain, celebrate, and move Han to Cloud 
<br/>
City.  He has about 5 left.  He battles retrieves 2, draws 
<br/>
a 4.  I draw a 3.  I lose two and he lets me go.  I play Off
<br/>
the Edge, target Obi-Wan, and retrieve 3.  I celebrate to
<br/>
retrieve my lost pile and drain.  On his turn he draws up.
<br/>
FW: 6(81)
<br/>
I had another good game with my light side.  He couldn’t 
<br/>
seem to find a grabber to grab Off the Edge.  AJ just got
<br/>
back in, so he forgets stuff sometimes, but I have a feeling
<br/>
he will do a lot better.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My dark vs. Adam Reily (1437) Drain on Endor
<br/>
I started the usual: Well Guarded, No Bargin, TINT/Opp Enf, 
<br/>
and Power of the Hutt.  He goes with Rebel Landing Sight, 
<br/>
and uses Careful Planning to get the Hidden Forest Trail.
<br/>
My turn I deploy Chamber, Jabba, Scum, and Boelo.  I draw 
<br/>
my last cards.  He deploys LSJK, Luke’s Lightsaber, 
<br/>
Lightsaber Profincey, Daughter, and Anakin’s Saber.  I’m 
<br/>
thinking how the hell could he get all those cards even 
<br/>
when I cut!?!?  He lets me go.  I deploy Den of Thieves 
<br/>
(Thank the maker for this card).  I deploy Bib to Lower
<br/>
Passages and a skrilling to Jabba’s Palace to flip my
<br/>
objective.  I deploy Galid to Chamber.  I move over the 
<br/>
skrilling to the Passages.  On his turn, he drains, I use
<br/>
Den of Thieves to cancel it.  He deploys Merc. Armor on
<br/>
Leia and Luke.  He draws and lets me go.  I’m thinking I’d
<br/>
better attack before more stuff comes.  I deploy 8 
<br/>
skrillings and battle.  He hits two of them and plays 
<br/>
Skywalkers.  I play Wounded Wookie to cancel Luke’s text.  
<br/>
His draws are 5, 3, and 3.  I cancel the 5 with Pote.  I
<br/>
draw Wounded Wookie.  He loses Daughter, I steal the armor,
<br/>
and I lose three skrillings.  I move over to the Hidden 
<br/>
Trail.  He drains, I cancel, and deploys General Solo and 
<br/>
Chewie of Kashyyyk to the Hidden Trail.  I play Set For Stun
<br/>
and get Chewie.  He moves over Luke.  On my turn I drain for
<br/>
4, retrieve a skrilling, and deploy the Sail Barge with a 
<br/>
Merc. Pilot aboard it to Jabba’s Palace.  I deploy one more
<br/>
skrilling, now 5, and move away.  He deploys Obi-Wan Kenobi,
<br/>
and makes a huge mistake.  He could of battled, moved away a
<br/>
skrilling to the Landing Site, and beat my @$$, but he 
<br/>
didn’t.  I’m really lucky.  He deploys Chewie again and 
<br/>
moves everyone over.  I drain for 6, retrieve a skrilling, 
<br/>
and run away to the Landing Site.  The game goes on like 
<br/>
this for awhile, but he finaly draws up.  
<br/>
FW: 8(99)
<br/>
I got really lucky when he didn’t battle with Obi-Wan.  I 
<br/>
could of lost that game, but I pulled it out.  Den of 
<br/>
Thieves saved me this game, big time
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My dark vs. Dave Dalton (1907) EBO Ketwol
<br/>
I start Well Guarded, TINT/Oppresive Enforcement, Power of 
<br/>
the Hutt, and No Bargin.  He starts Strike Planning, Aim 
<br/>
High, and Draw Your Fire.  I deploy the Lower Passages out
<br/>
of my hand, look for the Chamber, but it wasn’t there.  So
<br/>
I draw, get Jabba, Chamber, and Scum.  His turn he gets out
<br/>
General Crix, uses the Signal to get A New Secret Base, and
<br/>
takes the Echo Docking Bay and the War Room.  He deploys
<br/>
Crix and Figirn.  He also deplos Goo Nee Tay.  My turn I 
<br/>
deploy Chamber, Jabba, Scum, and Bib.  I also deploy Ephant
<br/>
Mon with Power of the Hutt.  On his turn he takes a docking
<br/>
bay.  He deploys Artoo to Jabba’s Palace.  He signals for 
<br/>
Frozen Assets, I don’t like that card.  He lets me go.  I 
<br/>
deploy Galid, Pote and a skrilling at the Palace and 3 at
<br/>
the Lower Passages, I flip.  I move over the skrilling.  On
<br/>
his turn he deploys Luke with Lightsaber for seven.  He 
<br/>
deploys Frozen Assets.  He battles and hits Ephant.  I draw
<br/>
a skrilling.  Its 12 to 8.  I lose Ephant and Jabba.  He 
<br/>
loses luke and tries to switch with a docking bay, but he 
<br/>
forgot to deploy Ketwol.  He moves over Artoo and deploys A
<br/>
Gift.  That’s not cool.  On my turn I deploy Jabba and 
<br/>
Boelo, but being the dumb @$$ I am, I don’t deploy Hutt
<br/>
Influence.  But the worst thing was, I had it in my hand.
<br/>
I deploy Sail Barge with Merc. Pilot and 6 skrillings to
<br/>
the North Ridge and move in.  He deploys Obi-Wan to the Chamber
<br/>
and battles.  He hits Galid and draws a 3, I cancel it with 
<br/>
Boelo.  I draw a skrilling.  It’s 11 to 5.  He loses Obi
<br/>
and switches with a docking bay.  My turn I deployed two
<br/>
skrillings to the Chamber and moved my four skrillings to
<br/>
the docking bay.  His turn we wager, I win.  I retrieve
<br/>
Galid.  My turn I finally realize I’m an idiot, and deploy
<br/>
Hutt Influence.  I deployed another 4 skrillings at the 
<br/>
North Ridge and moved in.  He deploys Han in Falcon at 
<br/>
Endor.  He also deploys Luke with Lightsaber to help out
<br/>
Crix, Figirin, and Ketwol.  My turn I deploy IG-88 and 
<br/>
Zuckuss to kill off Han.  I draw two skrillings for battle
<br/>
destiny.  It’s 21 to 6.  He lose them buth and a couple 
<br/>
more.  I move my second group of skrillings over and trap
<br/>
him.  I draw Galid.  He battles my skrillings, I play 
<br/>
Wounded Wookie and cancel Luke’s text.  He loses Figirin
<br/>
and I lose one skrillings.  Next turn I drain, battle Luke,
<br/>
Crix, and Ketwol.  I play Wounded Wookie.  I draw a six, he
<br/>
draws a three.  I lose a skrilling, he loses Ketwol.  I move
<br/>
the second group of skrillings in.  He does nothing.  I 
<br/>
battle him and end the game.
<br/>
FW:10(118)
<br/>
This was a tough game.  I should read my cards next time.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My Light vs. Dave Dalton (1907) SYCFA TIES
<br/>
I start the usual: Squad Assign, DODN/WA, and Battle Plan. 
<br/>
He starts First Strike, Moblization Points, and You Cannot
<br/>
Hide Forever.  He gets Wakeelmui and activates.  He draws
<br/>
up.  My first turn I deploy Cloud City and Princess Leia.  
<br/>
I draw up the rest of my force.  He deploys Merreck to the
<br/>
Death Star: Docking Bay.  He gets out Endor and Sullust from
<br/>
his hand.  I go.  I deploy Luke with Saber to the Docking
<br/>
Bay.  I also get out the Outrider with Dash and Horn 
<br/>
piloting to Cloud City.  I battle Merreck, slice him.  He 
<br/>
loses him then he gets OOC.  He deploys a Dreadnaught to
<br/>
Bespin and Fighter Cover.  He puts down an Intercepter with
<br/>
a cannon to Cloud City.  He battles and shoots down the 
<br/>
Outrider.  He lets me go.  I drain for one, than play 
<br/>
OOC/TT and place out of play a card.  I deploy Orrimarko to
<br/>
the Carbonite Chamber and Obi-Wan to the Lower Corridor.  I
<br/>
let him go.  During his turn, I play Off the Edge and 
<br/>
retrieve 4, but he grabs it.He deploys a TIE Interceptor
<br/>
with a cannon to Endor, the same at Sullust.  He puts down
<br/>
The Emporer’s Sword at the Death Star: Docking Bay.  He 
<br/>
deploys another Dreadnaught to Bespin.  During my turn I
<br/>
deploy Hobbie in Red 4 with cannons aboard to Sullust.  I
<br/>
battled and hit the Intercepter.  He deploys U-3PO to 
<br/>
Carbonite Chamber, but he gets Revealed.  He deploys 
<br/>
another TIE to the docking bay.  He battles Luke and draws
<br/>
a three, to my 2.  He loses the Interceptor (no Sinear).  
<br/>
I drain for 2 at Sullust and 2 at two Cloud City sites.  I
<br/>
play Off the Edge and retrieve 4.  He deploys Kashyyyk with
<br/>
an Interceptor and a cannon there.  He deploys U-3PO again,
<br/>
but again he gets Revealed.  My turn I drain and deploy 
<br/>
Twass to the Death Star: Docking Bay.  I let him go.  He
<br/>
drains for 8 and deploys Arica, breaks cover and battles.  
<br/>
We both end up losing our characters.  I drain for 4, and
<br/>
he drains for 8.  It went on like that for a couple of 
<br/>
more turns.  He didn’t get out Sinear the whole game.
<br/>
FL: 10(113)
<br/>
That game could have been a lot worse.  If he would have
<br/>
found Sinear or killed Hobbie, it would have been really
<br/>
ugly.
<br/>
