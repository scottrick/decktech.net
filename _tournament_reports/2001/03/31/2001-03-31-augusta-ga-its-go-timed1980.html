<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Where to start?  Well, a week before was the Jabba’s Palace sealed deck.  I came in first out of 8 to get the Jap foil Vader, mainly because of my Baraguin retrieval and bomaar monks.  Even with that new rule, the LS still has the Power destiny on the flip side, the broken Lando, AND just overall BETTER non-unique aliens like Bomar Monks(huge), Baraguins, Grans, etc.  It was tons of fun though.  So, I had a week to find a DS to play along with Lewis’ WYS Raider deck which I’ve been playing a variant since before he even posted his.  So...I put in a On the edge, Order to Engage, and some other goodies like Visored Vision.  As for DS, I wanted some kind of space deck and I’ve played Ties before, so it was Big Blue Endor Ops.  So it’s friday night, and I am building this thing at 11:00 as Jim and Landon are playtesting Landon’s MKOS with 8 unique Jawas(4 Herats)...I guess he was drunk ;) LANDON, you are cool!!  But he is a smart guy and switched it to a cool TDIGIWATT with Merc. Pilots on Lift tubes(it went 3-0 so I guess it was good!).  So my DS gets finished and at 12:00 at night we randomly decide to go to Waffle House.  We got a silly waiter who hooked us up and we went home to sleep.  
<br/>
<br/>
My parents woke me up at stink’in 8:25 to tell me they were leaving which I already knew and I couldn’t fall back asleep.  So, I played out my DS routine 4 times straight trying to pull Piett and Exe., then Ominous Rumors, then Ex. DB, then put Piett there, then get Merrejk and put him there, and go get a BG System.  So Jim and I go get the Brownie and it wasn’t too amazing, but I did manage to finish it AND get a bite of Jim’s(key)!  
<br/>
<br/>
Decks: WYS w/ Raiders, Crafts, Harvests, a On the Edge too!  Same old same old and I’ve had so much fun with it.  It’s a beast!  Added in Aim High and Ounee Ta just in case.
<br/>
<br/>
DS: Big Blue Endor Ops with 4 Imp Commands.  Chireanu, Prescene Of the F., and Ominous Rumors for high drains.  NO RETRIEVAL which makes it win with low diff(not even no escape or first strike).  
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:
<br/>
My Endor OPS vs. Landon’s Hidden Operatives
<br/>
<br/>
Landon kind of forgot some battleground systems to flip so I helped him out a bit ;) and we’ve never played these 2 decks before(Landon will never play against me, which is completely hilarious) Landon: you’re funnny!.  So I do everything I mentioned above my first turn after Landon replaces a Bo Shuda for another Sandwhirl or soemthing.  And he tells me to redraw and that’s good cuz I redraw and find an Imp Command!  So he keeps on activating his Kirdo III and can’t get his desert stuff out.  He draws a ton and if I had had a monnok it woulda been over but I didn’t.  So I drop executor to ksahyyk, get some commanders at the endor DB for my AO to do damage.  Put Ephant in the Bunker.  Drop a dreadnaught to endor, and a dreadnaught to anoat.  All he has done is set up to deserts w/ Speeders and Ops but I have Battle Order and Decree on lockdown.  So he finally drops 2 Xwings at Endor in front of my dreadnaught and pilot and doesn’t battle.  So I drop Bossk on my turn and battle him to have him lose both wings and Houjx.  His turn he puts a Wing in front of Executor and Piett.  My turn I battle and play Imp Command to have him Houjx again.  Now I’m doing like 15 a turn and probed his hidden base first try.  After bargaining table and rebel fleet delay the inevitable, I finally finish him off for a win by 26.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Never being seroiuslly threatened in space.
<br/>
Lows: None except not getting to see Landon’s deck work.  It woulda played better if he coulda found Kirdo for once.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:
<br/>
My WYS vs. Tony Zamberlan’s MKOS Skrillings(like TJ’s)
<br/>
<br/>
Good matchup which I should win if I get the lockdown going.  I start Squadron Assignments but I lose the Insurrection/SA for Battle Plan and Aim High&amp;#8230;to put some choke on.  Unfortunately me for me, I&amp;#8217;m playing the palace raider @ss deck that loses to monnok as Art informs me.  Which it can I suppose.  So his turn he just activates, gets the Barge at JP, puts the Barge site out and draws.  My turn, I happened to draw insurection so I get my &lt;&gt; DB and drop a Patrol Craft to both my DBs to help against Monnok and then draw the rest.  So I have like 13 cards in hand, NO RAIDERS, and 2 owen and berus.  So he drops like Boelo and Ephant Mon to the AC and puts a Merc Pilot and 3 skrillings on to sail barge, draws.  My turn I drop Owen and Beru to farm, drop Wedge to a craft, drop menace fades, I&amp;#8217;ll take the leader, and the falcon with melas and captain move up from the &lt;&gt;DB to the system to complete the lockdown.  His turn I think he just draws and saves.  My turn I drop a raider into the other empty craft, after he grabs my Control/TV I play my harvest.  But he put out Secret Plans out first turn.  So I drain and he loses Jabba who he doesn&amp;#8217;t have out yet nor scum so I guess he got a bad draw.  Jabba and 3 other cards are in the lost pile and I OOC but miss the jabba(poo!).  His turn, he drops Jabba and gailid into the AC, drops Iggy in 2000 with 2 skrillings and then Z in MH(barriered) and a couple more skrillings in that.  He moves to Lower passages to increase his drains too.  I can&amp;#8217;t clear him off the system b/c he set for stuns my Captain Han like 3-4 times and then battles to retrieve it.  I can&amp;#8217;t find my Outrider or my Celebration so this ends up pretty close.  He grabs my only On the Edge from the lost pile after it retrieves 10(2 times) and then I play Harvest.  I think he knocked me off the system and got a turn of draining.  James calls time and I spend my last turn draining and playing another Harvest.  He has 10 and I have 17.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Got drains of 2 at the DBs, the Cantina, and 1 at the Farm. 
<br/>
Lows: Owen &amp; Beru got scared of the Barge and ran away from it after they finished the Harvest.
<br/>
<br/>
3(+42)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:
<br/>
My WYS vs. Jim&amp;#8217;s Manipulator
<br/>
<br/>
So Jim let&amp;#8217;s me know that I am playing the &amp;#8220;Palace Raider Cheese Deck&amp;#8221;.  I start the Squadron Ass., Insurrection, and Staging Areas.  We&amp;#8217;ve play tested these 2 decks and I normally do well by just sticking to the strategy.  His turn he has no Miyoom to put at the Control Room so he puts Mara Jade there.  My turn I drop a Raider/Craft to Tat DB, a Plain Raider to &lt;&gt; DB, and the Falcon and Captain Han to &lt;&gt;DB then move up.  So Jim&amp;#8217;s now activating mad crazy but he has a bad hand and draws a ton and plays scanning crew on my Jedi Luke and throws down Xizor(barrier) and Guri infront of a Raider.  I drop Tunnel for Owen and Beru and Farm and drop them both, I put Melas in Falcon for Zuckuss Protection and put down the Celebration:Battle Plan:I&amp;#8217;ll Take the Leader.  I also drop Dash and Raider in outrider and Mirax in ship to Rendilli so he can&amp;#8217;t satisfy Battle Plan.  His turn he drops Zuckuss and Dengar to Rendilli but doesn&amp;#8217;t initiate.  My turn I battle there and clear both ships and lose something cuz he drew like a random 6 which broke Dash&amp;#8217;s &lt;6 immunity.  Move Mirax and ship to the Death Star because he can&amp;#8217;t have too much space left.  His turn he drops Chimaera and Thrawn to Tatooine and Battles my Falcon w/ Captain and Melas(which he also Lat Damages).  Well, he draws low and I draw high as usual so he loses the whole ship due to attrition and I lose Melas to cover some Damage.  I continue to run from his Guri and Xizor with my Raider(I move for free, he has to pay 2).  He finally gives in due to the lockdown and him not being able to deal much damage.  Win by 32 due to Celebration and Harvest.  I am now at 5(+74)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Taking over every system and killing his entire fleet.
<br/>
Lows: I hate that stupid Guri!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:
<br/>
My DS Endor Ops vs. Art&amp;#8217;s WYS w/ Raider beats
<br/>
<br/>
Art&amp;#8217;s got a pretty cool LS as usual and I get a do my regular first turn thing with Piett and Merrejk to the Ex. DB and pull Kashyyk.  His turn Melas goes into the Cantina and a Raider/Craft to the Tat DB.  My turn I get the Fondor out and put Piett in it leaving Merrejk alone.  His turn he does a little drawing.  I still think he is playing regular Raider/Craft so I put EPP Vader at the Endor DB and put out my AO, with a Prescence on Tatooine and throw Chireanu in the executor and move it to tatooine to start a drain of 6 and move Merrejk to help Vader out.  His turn after like 2 or so Tunnel visions he drops Jedi Luke and stick, EPP Han(WTF?), a Raider/Craft, and Wedge all to the endor DB.  He battles and blindly hits my Vader with a 3&amp;4(poo!).  Merrejk gets hit and so does EPP Han.   After his 4 battle destinies I am wishing I could play Imp Command with Merrejk but I can&amp;#8217;t.  So, I lose Vader, Merrejk, and 15 off the top all cuz I thought I could control the DB(no barrier or ghhk).  So it&amp;#8217;s basically over and time to try and lower diff.  I putt Ephant in Bunker to use Ominous and start draining for 6 again paying for Battle plan.  He keeps draining for 5 on the ground eah turn.  Well, he is playing 4 control/TV&amp;#8217;s!!!  And I think only 1 or 2 drains of 6 actually hit him due to the dumb controls.  I throw down Chimaera and ozzel with my last 9 force to Kashyyk.   He keeps draining for 5 and I end up with a lose by 24 to put me at 5(+50).
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Draining for 6 a turn at one system, that&amp;#8217;s whack!
<br/>
Lows: He never even had to put a ship out to beat me.
<br/>
Ugly: The Endor Docking Bay scene, I shoulda known better but oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:
<br/>
My Endor Ops(yay!, I get to finish strong with my LS!!) vs. Charlie&amp;#8217;s QMC
<br/>
<br/>
This was the most boring game.  He starts Bespin and the Downtown Plaza to give me 3 force!  I set up extremely fast at Kashyyk, Fondor, Endor, the DB and Bunker are held down with my AO in place, and I also take Bespin to flips him back.  He gets out Bespin CC and that&amp;#8217;s the only site he ever puts out.  He controls it with like bulk freighters and Z-95&amp;#8217;s cuz my capitals can&amp;#8217;t go there.  We battle over the Dowtown Plaza and he eventually kills Tempest 1, Blizzard 2, and EPP Vader AND a bunch of scrubs!  Mainly due to ECC Lando shooting and adding destinies.  So, I got stuck with a Lone Tempest 1 which gets smashes and goes down with another 6 force to bring my win down to 19.  7(+69)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My WYS vs. Carmine&amp;#8217;s Corulag Operatives
<br/>
<br/>
He starts Sunsdown (premeire!) on Corulag and his deck plays any existing DS spy and a ton of ops(one of the best decks you&amp;#8217;ll ever see).  I figure we&amp;#8217;ll time this game out.  My starting hand draw contains Ounee Ta which is all good.  His turn, he puts a couple generic sites and Xizor, Tonnika Sisters, and an Operative drop to the forest.  I start off by Houjxing to cancel his Sunsdown.  Next, I get MY &lt;&gt;DB and put it on Tatooine and throw a raider to each of my DBs, Ounee Ta, and flip having no barrier or portal but this game MUST NOT time out.  So his turn he gets more Generic sites so I can have  more force and then he draws.  My turn, I activate 20&amp;#8230;drain, put Falcon and Cap. To Corulag, Skate and Outrider to Tatooine with Celebration: Battle Plan: Menace Fades: and I&amp;#8217;ll take that leader.  So now I basically automatically win and shift down into lockdown mode.  He drops to cover 3 sites and flips.  My turn I activate insane amounts and out comes the Beru family and Farm(thanks to tunnel vision) and a Raider goes into cantina, order to engage comes out, and Melas(he lost Zuckuss in MH t a drain ;)  and a raider/craft and another raider(all for free &amp;#61514; go to a spaceport site where he has a skrilling and an operative.  He loses both and plays one of his five Ghhks and I move melas to the &lt;&gt;DB and send the remaining Raider/Craft in front of Tonnika and Operative.  He drops Fett in Slave One to Corulag and loses 3 to Order.  My turn I tracked a Out of Commision or something and clear off Boba.  So Carmine has to pay 3 to drain for 1 at his sites and I&amp;#8217;ve walking all over him with Raiders and Order to engage.  For the second time, the raider deck wins without a lost pile.  Win by 35 to put me at 9(+104) which is good enough for second place.
<br/>
<br/>
The standings were something like:
<br/>
Art at first, Me at second, and the rest was(in no particular order), Tony, Tony&amp;#8217;s friend(never got name), James(TD), Landon(3-3), Jim(3-3), Carmine(3-3), Nick, David M.(2-4), Joe, Charlie, and maybe 2 more guys whose names have slipped my mind.  James Barret ran another great tourney and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to some good constructed tourneys in April now that Landon is a TD.  It&amp;#8217;s really cool how TD&amp;#8217;s get to play in their own tourneys.  That&amp;#8217;s about it, hope you enjoyed!
