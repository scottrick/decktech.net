<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This was the first tournament I had been to in about three months.  I got my Reflections 2 box about a week and half ago but I couldn’t play last weekend due to traveling.  I’m terribly out practice and manage to play only one LS game and 4 DS games before the tournament.  One of my friends from Memphis, Ravi Pentapaty, came by for the weekend on his way home from Georgia Tech.  Well me, Joseph, Ravi, Sander Hartlage, John Camp and his Girlfriend Mandy all decide to get drunk.  I eventually end up watching Empire Strikes Back and going to sleep at 3:00 A.M.  I wake up with an annoyingly big hangover the next morning.  I learn after the tournament that the reason John didn’t come was because he and Mandy got super duper drunk and took turns puking on each other all night long.  Mandy&amp;#8217;s roommate went into the den and found John curled up in fetal position laying naked on the couch with puke all over him.  He didn’t remember puking or taking off his clothes when he finally got up on Sunday.  Funny Stuff.

<br/>
Here is a description of my decks:
<br/>
<br/>
DS:  I built an Abyssin Deck for the DS.  It is pretty standard.  No SAC protection except for two grabbers.  I also don’t play any numbers protection because has never been popular at the KGB.  Unfortunately, there is a ton of It Could Be Worse and other cheesy interrupt abuse so two grabbers are necessary.  
<br/>
<br/>
LS:  Hidden Base Mains is my current deck of choice for the LS.  It has retrieval, activation, ground power and a descent amount of space too.  I play two grabbers in this one to but no SAC protection.  Aim High is another important card in my deck due to the large amount of ties and scum lately.
<br/>
<br/>
My roommate Joseph builds a Ewok AITC super drain deck that can drain for four at all his sites.  The only problem is that he built it in like ten minutes so it wasn’t at its full potential.  We leave the dorm, go eat and then head to the KGB.  We arrived only twenty minutes late so we had plenty of time to waste before the tournament started.  There was a large turnout today with the final total being 16.  My rating prior to the tournament is 1678

Game One DS vs. Chris Work(1594) Train to Six
<br/>
Chris is a good player and has been playing training since I met him about two years ago.  It starts with me getting all my sites out first turn and giving Chris enough force to deploy both Yoda and Daughter on his first turn and start training.  I get set up quick with a strong drain and Search and Destroy action.  I also grab his It Could Be Worse early.  He trains quickly but can’t seem to find anything to use to get around Search and Destroy.  He puts down Projections but Hutt Influence nullifies them.  The Surprise Assaults were similarly affected.  He does get in a few force in damage with AFAs.  By the time he passed test five he didn’t have the force to retrieve due to Secret Plans.  After that it was an uneventful drain out with him retrieving a few times before I finally finished him.  It was a very long game though and we almost timed out.

Game Two LS vs. Ryan McLain(1500) BHBM TIEs
<br/>
This is Ryan’s first tournament but he has been playing for fun for a while.  I was worried about numbers but I verified his deck at the beginning of his first turn and didn’t see any.  He puts three Interceptors at Wakeelmui along with Sienar and plays an All Power To Weapons lost, which I grab.  I dropped Ben Kenobi at the Tatooine: DB and Weapon Levitate his saber out of the used pile.  He deploys Vader at the CC: DB.  I give him Luke during my next turn and draw up until I get Leia with Blaster, Chewbacca, Protector and Corran Horn.  He drops some systems and put a Dreadnaught and an Interceptor or two at Endor.  I decide to pay the Emperor a visit and down come Dash, Leia and Chewie.  I think he barriered one of them but I used Desperate Reach to cancel it.  I initiate but draw low while he draws high so I loose Corran to the Bacta tank and he looses some force.   He deploys more ties during his turn and moves Vader to the Death Star 2: DB and the Emperor over with him.  I drain for a total of four and deploy Dash and Corran in the Outrider to attack a single Interceptor.  I was expecting him to react with the Sword or Shield or maybe play some interrupt but he didn’t and lost 11 force.  The game was pretty locked at this point.  I retrieved once or twice and he won two duels but I drained him out pretty quickly after that.

Game Three LS vs. Brandon Ruck (1912) SYCFA Docking Bay Trooper Deck
<br/>
I have played Ruck a few times and it has always turned out bad for me.  His first turn he pulls Death Star: Docking Control Room 327 and a character to occupy it and deploys all the Docking Bays in his Deck with troopers at the non-battle ground ones.  I heard about a deck like this a while back but have never played one before so I am rather perplexed.  I pull my locations and draw.  He started crush so he could pull Evader/Monnok.  So I stay below 13 but I have nothing useful in my hand.  He starts preparing his hand using Reactor Terminal.  I figure any chance I have of winning will be gone soon if I don’t do something so I deploy Luke JK, Ben Kenobi, Lando with Vibro and Mirax Terrik.  On his turn he moves some guys over and deploys others.  At the beginning of my turn I have Vader, Tarkin, Xizor, Guri, and four or five troopers sitting in front of my guys.  I can’t deploy anybody else because Miyoom Onith went through my hand the turn before and I am scared to move because of a Full Scale Alert beat down.  So I do nothing and wait for him to attack me so I can play Fallen Portal.   He attacks and I Fallen Portal two of his troopers, he Trooper Assaults but I cancel it with Throw Me Another Charge and then hit two characters of his characters with sabers.  He plays Jedi Presence and we draw destinies.    He losses several characters but I end up loosing everything.  I probably should of just lost a few force to keep Ben out and revived Jedi Luke and saved another with the Bacta Tank and then attacked again on my turn but I suck so I didn’t.  His turn he drains but doesn’t spread much.  I deploy Squadron Assignments and use it to get the super Falcon and also deploy Home One to set up for a drain of one at Corluag and one at the Death Star.  He can drain for three total at the various DBs on the table but my retrieval and smaller number of cards on the table should possibly makeup for it.  Unfortunately, he drops Come Here You Big Coward and stops those plans, as there is only one battleground system on the table.  I drain at Corluag for a while and try to think of something I can do.  He is canceling my drains by putting a Death Star Gunner on Strategic Reserves and then putting him in his used pile to search for the Superlaser.  I eventually draw up Tawss Khaa and drop her on a lone trooper but she does nothing and gets beaten back to the Bacta Tank.  I drop her again On The Edge to retrieve a few and kill a trooper.  Next turn he moves all his guys in front of Tawss and plays Full Scale Alert during my turn to keep Tawss from moving away.  I draw up with about a minute or two before time is called.

Game Four DS vs. Brandon Rucks(1912) MWYHL with Spies, Visored Visions, Holosite Drains and Kessel
<br/>
I was very annoyed when I learned I had to play Ruck again.  He had been bragging how good his light side was during the last game and one of my friends was beaten by it earlier in the tournament.  I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure what to expect so I put a lot of guys at the Audience Chamber.  He deploys Yoda to the hut and Visored Visioned me.  I spread and pay to drain.  He puts an undercover spy at all my sites except the Audience Chamber because of Ephant Mon.  I put out Search and Destroy and he deploys Honor so I occupy three battlegrounds the next turn and he starts to loose again.  He inserts a few AFAs into my reserve and I loose some force including my Bargaining Table and most of my space.  He becomes tired of my Galid enhanced Audience Chamber drain and Obi with LS visits the Audience Chamber but is barriered.  I battle him, retrieve, he sabers Galid and Houjx away the damage.   He deploys a holotable and drains there for two with Projections.  The turn after that he deploys Kessel and I really begin to miss my Bargaining Table and space cards.  I draw up and find Guri and the Stinger but they are totally useless because Guri can’t initiate battles by herself.  I cancel two of his AFAs with Projective Telepathy and put every single Myo in my deck on the objective to cancel his Kessel drain for three turns.  I also Hutt Smootched two of his spies but he would just deploy a new one the next turn.  It was a long boring game and I had finally locked it up so he broke Boussh cover to protect against Search and Destroy.  I battled him the next turn and finished him off with Battle Damage.

Ruck was not happy, as this was the first tournament loss for with this deck.  He complained that his THIGIH Speeder/Numbers deck would have beaten me.  Grady Hutchins gets his second timed win over Michael Crosby tournament.  So he has six victory points but a much higher margin than Ruck or me.  Ruck gets second and I get third.  Decipher has decided that Knoxville isn&amp;#8217;t worthy of prize support so everyone had to donate a pack for prize support.  Everyone bought Reflections 2 except for Joseph and me because they had run out by the time Jo and me got around to it so our contribution was Special Edition.  The winner got a foil Palpatine, second got Japanese Anakins Lightsaber and I got Choke Vader.  Not a bad tournament although I really want to win one someday.
