Pre-Tourney crap 
<br/>
I hear about this tourney a week or so before and I say well I got a choice I can go w/ my friends to this ghetto ski hill to take pictures for their magazine (I also went there last week) or I can go to the tourney so hands down the tourney wins.   Call up my friend tell him I&amp;#8217;m not going and he says well ok then I have to e-mail Mark Kloida my playtest buddy to see if he&amp;#8217;s going and beg him to borrow me a search and destroy cause I&amp;#8217;m stupid and out of about a box and Â½ of Endor I&amp;#8217;m still not worthy of pulling one that card is cool :).  So I am lazy and don&amp;#8217;t want to change my Throne Room (it&amp;#8217;s on my page w/ slight mods and anyways after you read the TR I doubt you&amp;#8217;ll want to try it anyways) deck and it went 2-0 in the last tourney so I see no need.  For dark I have to bid a sad good bye to Hunt Down because its @#$% and went 0-2 in the last tourney (4 gamers suck but people in our region haven&amp;#8217;t yet discovered the tech of 6 gamers) so I make myself a Rops w/ speeder bikes and At-St&amp;#8217;s which kicks @#$% and I figure that there won&amp;#8217;t be any Ounee Ta  @ the tourney also (Wisconsinites in general aren&amp;#8217;t intelligent did you see that idiot miss 2 free throws GOD I could make those).  So I e-mail our TD and tell him I&amp;#8217;ll be there and I tell him to bring an OTSD that I bought from him a while ago (for $6 how can you go wrong).  Then on Friday night I have to baby-sit my sister which I figure is just another free $10 bucks (she&amp;#8217;s such a little angel NOT!) and for once she goes to bed nicely and I hit the sack at about midnight only to wake up at 7 to the sounds of my yelling dad and my sister running up and down the halls screaming chasing our cat (its like animal abuse peta should visit my house).   So my dad and I exchange some interesting phrases and then he tells me I better get a scholarship to college cause the stock market plunged again.  Then I eat crap for breakfast then my mom gets home from her 4 hr. walk (she&amp;#8217;s in this totally crazy walkathon for breast cancer that&amp;#8217;s like 60 miles over the course of 3 days) so she&amp;#8217;s gotta practice.  I&amp;#8217;m bumming like my bummish self for a couple minutes while my dad moves his work truck and then he decides to take me to the tourney cause I can&amp;#8217;t drive cause I&amp;#8217;m a bum.  So I get there 10 minutes early and our TD gets there 20 minutes late I buy some packs of endor cause you can&amp;#8217;t get those anywhere these days and he calls out the parings and were off (sorry I forgot to mention this tourney is at Hobbytown USA.  
<br/>
<br/>
First game DS vs. Dave Delany&amp;#8217;s Profit (I don&amp;#8217;t know how to spell his name exactly but this is close)
<br/>
Well this guy makes no sense to me but he did trade me that search and destroy before the tourney so he got cooler anyway he keeps complaining cause I play him every tourney and beat him every time.  I&amp;#8217;m a bum and forget to start 2 aliens, not to mention his failure to mention that to me.  So I activate drop 2 twix&amp;#8217;s pull D*II d bay drop the forest to Raltiir deploy the swamp (that card is tech!) and put some bum At-St pilot to the swamp I draw a CHYBC and this card would curse his whole game.  Then I let him go he drops Leia&amp;#8217;s back (what kind of crap is this) and pulls Leia w/ and drops her w/ reflection to the Tat D Bay mumbling something about not wanting to free Han right away then he passes.  I activate drain him for 1 drop the CHYBC tell him to pay the price for his lack of vision he doesn&amp;#8217;t realize what it does so I just let him be stupid and proceed to lay the smack down on his Leia w/ the poor man&amp;#8217;s Mara (Arica) and Blizzard 2 my destiny is a 5 his destiny is a 1 after failing to hit Mara and he loses her and 5 I then proceed to draw about 2 getting Vader&amp;#8217;s stick and The Emperor.  He puts Scout Luke down at the audience chamber frees Han but I tap CHYBC and he says @#$% and he says I won&amp;#8217;t free Han so I ask Derek the TD for a ruling and he says he doesn&amp;#8217;t have to free the captive so Han is chillin&amp;#8217; for the rest of the game.  I then move to control all the sites on Raltiir and get Emperor and God to the Spaceport D Bay Ozzel and Xizor to the forest Vader and saber at the dessert and At-St pilot, Blizzard Scout 1 and Lieutenant Arnet to the Swamp, Blizzard 2 and some other walker at the Tat D Bay and Arica w/ stick at Tat JP my 9 drain against his 2 which is reduced to one because of the obj. In other words systematic win I only had about 5-7 cards in my lost pile the whole game.  
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2(+25) 
<br/>
Highlights: winning 
<br/>
Lowlights: That ruling and him actually causing damage
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS vs. Mark Kloida&amp;#8217;s  (1697) Court Musicians that are kickin it up a notch.  
<br/>
God I have to play him this is about an auto-loss but I figure I might as well fight it.  
<br/>
First turn Baby Jabber and Greeta to the audience chamber and scum cums down he pulls executor D bay and lets me go.  I drop homey 1 d bay and some mofo there let him go. He just drops another d bay and Ak-Rev to the A. Chamber.  Well I just drew last turn and got a corran and taw@$$ khaa so I deploy them to have some fun @ the executor D bay.  Next turn yep you guessed it massive musician beatdown causing about 30 damage I&amp;#8217;m down to about 10 force so I drop Scout Luke w/ saber to the Tat. D Bay and I drain and drain and drain a little more and even make cheap Luke LSJK but eventually I die.   
<br/>

FL 2(-10) 
<br/>
Highlights: you actually think there were some. 
<br/>
Lowlights: everything
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 DS vs. Jeff Timm&amp;#8217;s (1500 or so) Crazy Anoat operatives w/ Wookies crap 
<br/>
He isn&amp;#8217;t new but doesn&amp;#8217;t play often and is kinda bad anyway he starts bargaining table, which I might mention he never used.  Anyway first turn I use my usual start random mofo to the swamp on Raltiir (I also deployed a docking bay and other things) anyway I drop the mofo and tell him to go.  So he saves force and tells me to go.  I go and deploy the spaceport d bay and the forest to Raltiir and I deploy a biker scout who gets himself a shiny speeder bike and I pull my search and destroy which hits him for about 5-6 turns while he saves force during that time I give ozzel tempest scout 2 to ride and tempest scout 5 goes to the dessert along w/ arica and saber and I drop tempest scout 3 to the docking bay w/ kir kanos, The Emperor, and God.  Next turn he deploys a hit crew of general han and chewie of kashyyyk w/ that&amp;#8217;s 1 and I wonder who they found on han chewie also had his bowcaster he intiates I react half of Raltiir to the desert (I forgot I had battle deployment [the AO] on table at this moment) so I draw a 5 for destiny plus I add 3 to destiny so I have about 40 power to his 35 or so after he plays life debt I win he loses Han and I lose ozzel and tempest scout 2 to attrition I move the emperor and his cronies over and alter That&amp;#8217;s 1 and give him the turn.  He then deploys jedi luke, saber DOS and obi there and initiates he plays like 5 destiny adders but I sense 1 and I get a 6 as battle destiny add 2 so I&amp;#8217;ve got 37 power or so to his 50 some I lose kir kanos some other mofo or 2 to cover my @#$% and he loses DOS and all his adders (battle deployment would&amp;#8217;ve limited all destiny to 1).  During my turn I drop about another combat vehicle or 2 and initiate this time no adders and I edge him out by about 5-6 in the battle I then leave him alone at the desert and spread out to drain he can drain for 2 for all I care surprisingly he leaves me and I drain him for mucho force all the time now I might add that he has deployed not a single anoat operative this whole game.  I edge him out by far in the drain race.

FW 4(+15)

Game 4 LS vs. John Rome (1418 or something)&amp;#8217;s Hunt Down Dueler.  
<br/>
John and I share an&amp;#8230;interesting relationship we make wisecracks and insult each other the whole tourney so I don&amp;#8217;t really mind.  Anyway first turn I pull the home one docking bay and put ackbar there.  But just after I activate my first force I make short work of that stupid visage w/ a TT.  I give him the turn and he activates and draws.  My turn I pull Japanese echo docking bay and this sets off a huge controversy john asks do I have the English version and of course I do so I give it to him and he takes my Japanese one out of the protector and puts the English one in so after a 5 minute struggle we finally agree to leave the English under the Japanese so we can check the text then I drop Mirax and give him the turn.  He then lays the smackdown w/ Mara Bossk w/ Gun and Snoova bam Mirax lost and 13 force after that in the course of loosing that force I lose 3 out of my 4 edges so there goes 75% of my retrieval and by the time I got it back it was hopeless.  So then it&amp;#8217;s my turn and I recover by dropping the cantina w/ meals, leia w/ and give her daddy&amp;#8217;s lightsaber and obi w/ a drain, which&amp;#8217;ll go untouched for the rest of the game.  5 turns pass and nothing much happens except I drain and he moves his mofo crew to CC I drop chewie protector and make an off the edge that retrieves an on the edge which next turn lets me retrieve 5 more I now get figrin d&amp;#8217;an and drop him to the home one d bay and make wagers to help retrieve more and more and more I finally get another edge back and I wait for it to come.  In the mean time he has deployed janus and blizzard 2 to the endor D bay so I lay the smack down w/ corran and lando w/ BOOYAH-axe I battle exclude the god and make him lose blizzard 2 and about 4 more.  Then on his turn he deployed bane malar and some other mofo he battles mindscans lando but this sparks another controversy he wants to try to exclude lando but I tell him what are you an idiot and he is of course so then Derek has to waste his time come over and tell rome that he can&amp;#8217;t use the Booyah axe so I exclude bane from the battle (muahahaha) and he comes out the winner and I just lose booyah axe next turn.  I don&amp;#8217;t have enough force to do anything so I don&amp;#8217;t he drains me for about 4 and I have to lose that last edge so I&amp;#8217;ve lost the game Rome had 2 tourney&amp;#8217;s ago beaten mark so I think he might be better than he seems but I still feel disgraced.
