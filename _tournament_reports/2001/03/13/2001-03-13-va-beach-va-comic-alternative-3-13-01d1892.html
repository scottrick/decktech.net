<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok I get to the tournament early to trade for a few cards and there are like five people there.  That sucks.  Well I get the cards I need and then people start coming.  About 15-20 people show up and 5 or so of them are in the top 100.  Cool.  So if I can beat a few high-rated players (my rating going in is 1605) I could gain some major rating points.  I’m pretty confident in my light side deck, it’s a Watch Your Step deck without harvests or palace raiders.  so far it’s undefeated for all of its zero tournament games.  we’ll see how it does today.  my dark side is a bring him before me which i’m not too confident in.  i’d really like to have another emperor in there because i always seem to get the one i have in my force pile.  but it’s pretty decent besides that.  anyway on to the games . . .

<br/>
Disclaimer: much of the stuff in this tr may be in the wrong order but the important gameplay details are there.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My BHBM vs.  Matt Rudolph’s (1649) TIGIH scouts.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok he starts strike planning and the docking bay stuff so I’m fairly sure it’s scouts.  I’ve played him a couple times before and I won easily, but I don’t know how I’ll do now.  I’ve got four walkers and some tramples and choke vaders and stuff so I think I can kill the scouts pretty will.  Also it takes like six of his scouts to equal the power of two or three of my guys so I’m fairly confident.  All I have to do is put the Emperor down first turn at the docking bay to cut off his activation and then next turn put down vader so i don’t lose mucho force.  Easy right?  Well I get crap in my hand, no Vaders at all.  ARGH!  I decide that losing three force will be worth it to cut off his activation early, so I search for the emperor.  It’s in my force pile.  ARGH!  ok that sucks... I deploy dr. evazan and ponda baba to the death star 2 docking bay for activation and throw out bad feeling have I to hopefully slow him down a little.  This sucks majorly.  He goes and puts Madine at the Home One Docking bay and then pulls out chewie and moves luke over to the docking bay.  Now he gets something like 12 force next turn.  That really sucks.  I have a Mara in hand but he saves 1 force and I’m pretty sure he’s got a barrier or fallen portal or something so I don’t go beat up Madine.  My suspicions prove correct as he saves 1 force every single turn through the game and uses the barrier sometime later, but I forget when.  Whatever.  I throw down the Emperor to the cloud city docking bay and then move ponda baba and dr. e to back him up.  draw all the rest of my force and get a vader on the last card.   finally.  He activates all of his force and goes.  He drains me for 2.  I haven’t even made him lose anything yet.  this sucks.  he deploys a bunch of scouts.  i deploy vader somewhere and capture luke.  i get boba fett in slave I to rendili and get a free drain there for the rest of the game.  he gets out chewie and wuta and goes to the back door to drain.  i throw mara down there and move vader over.  he doesn’t battle me and sends vader back to the throne room.  argh!  i move mara over to the docking bay and move ponda baba and dr.e over there too.  i have drain at the throne room for a couple turns, but he gets down honor of the jedi and i’ve already lost no escape.  whatever.  he throws down order to engage and i realize that if i battle him at the docking bay and hit chewbacca with her saber i can make him immediately lost and my power with mara and ponda baba&amp;dr.e will be better than his six scouts.  cool.  of course i forget about fallen portal and the door slams down on both ponda baba AND dr. evazan and they are lost.  i lose mara and 11 force and he stacks a card.  i think i dueled once at the throne room and lost and he stacked a card then too.  he moves his guys over to the back door to drain and i redeploy mara to the docking bay and put the emperor down.  he gets out bacta tank.  argh.  he moves over to fight me and i zap somebody.  i put down some more peeps and fight him and i think we tie.  we battle back and forth there a couple turns and i get janus down and he dies and then i get tempest 1 down and grand admiral thrawn on it or something and that dies later and i put down sim aloo and i stack a couple and he stacks a couple and tries to turn vader but no cigar.  we tied like three battles in a row but he has a seemingly endless supply of scouts.  it’s looking dark and dreary for me.  i’m not making him lose much force at all.  my guys die slowly and he wins another battle and then crosses vader.  full loss by 21.

The Good: uhh . . .
<br/>
The Bad: losing
<br/>
The Ugly: YOUR MOM!  just kidding.  sorry i get bored sometimes writing these things.  gee how about fallen portal?  or how about emperor in force pile and no vader in hand?

Game 2: My WYS vs.  Todd Rowe (1906)  Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
Cool I get to play a high-rated player.  Actually not cool because he smells like smoke.  I hate that smell.  I’ve actually beat him before too.  So I start with the usual stuff, Insurrection, Staging Areas, Squadron Assignments.  blah blah blah.  he starts with docking bay crap and no escape.  he goes and plays operational as planned to get an extra forcee and he puts vader out to the cantina i think.  i put out the home one docking bay then pull out kessel and put dash in outrider there.  he goes and puts tarkin and 4-lom in the cantina with vader.  i play transmission terminated to cancel visage and put chewie w/ gun at the home one docking bay. he puts out another one his next turn but doesn’t do much else.  i put luke at the home one docking bay and wedge on the outrider.  Chewie w/ gun was already at the docking bay but I forget when I put them there.  I move them over to the Tat docking bay and flip.  i believe i played control and tunnel vision a couple of times to cancel the drain at the cantina and by now he has vader’s saber down there, but i can play control and tunnel vision from my lost pile too now.  i don’t remember when i deployed theron nett in red 10 to kessel, but it was there, just hanging i guess.  he deploys dengar in punishing one to kessel.  he deploys chimaera.  i barrier.  he deploys grand admiral thrawn.  he lets me go.  i deploy captain han on the falcon and he barriers.  i deploy mirax terrik on the pulsar skate. he goes and puts out bossk in hound’s tooth but doesn’t battle.  somewhere while setting up for the inevitable huge space battle here i cantina brawled vader with a tracked six and he deployed an emperor to the cantina.  i go and pay 10 force to put down leia w/ gun on the falcon and initiate battle finally.  i play i know to add 2 destiny which means now i get six destiny plus one to power only.  thankfully he doesn’t play imperial command.  i draw my destiny for power only, it’s a six.  i draw my destinies for battle destiny and it is like 6, 4, 6, 3, 6, 2 for a total of twenty seven. needless to say there are lots of sixes in my deck.  he draws a 2, 5, 5, i use captain han to cancel the 5 and make him redraw he gets a 1. hehe.  i lose mirax and the pulsar skate or something and he loses everything.  after that i spread to tatooine and rendili to drain for 5 a turn in space.  he gets a lord vader on the ground he gets ig-88 with riot gun to the cantina then moves vader over to tat db as well as 4-lom and tarkin.  hmm.  i run over to the cantina.  he doesn’t force lightning or sniper any of my guys luckily.  he switches people around.  i played ooc and tt somewhere in here because we were both getting low on force and visage was annoying me.  he puts down ponda baba and tempest 1 with presence of the force at my home one docking bay.  he gets a couple more people down and i run back over to the tat db when he switches his guys up again.  we’re are each draining for like 5 a turn, but i am ahead by a few cards.  i move luke and chewie over to the exec db for 10 force or something then he follows with just vader.  i am fearing a duel but i have a run luke run in my hand which has been there since my starting hand.  turns out at the end he had no duel stuff.  i battle vader and he dies and chewie dies and luke walks over to drain at the meditation chamber and i drain him out next turn for the win.  Full Win by 10.

Game 3: My BHBM vs. Derek Brooks (Gold 49, 1760- something) Watch Your Step
<br/>
<br/>
This is the guy that ran the VA state champ tournament.  That was my second tournament.  ah . . . back in the good old days with operatives . . . wait what am I smoking?!  I HATED operatives.  I smell a little bit of cheese on his breath.  mmm. smells good.  I ask him if he had smoked gouda in his lunch.  The reply is affirmative.  Maybe he’ll think I’m psychic because I know what type of cheese he had for lunch now.  or not.  anyhoo he starts with squadron assignments, staging areas, and DODN/WA.  I think this kind of strange since the back side of his objective cancels sense and alter outright, but I keep my mouth shut.  whatever floats your boat.  i get a god hand.  it looked something like this: Lord Vader, Mara Jade, Commander Igar, Tempest 1, Bossk in Hound’s Tooth, Chimaera, Force Lightning, Janus Greejaatus.  Awesome.  I deploy the emperor to the docking bay first turn and janus greejaatus too.  I let him go.  He deploys Yoda’s Hut and then draws.  I deploy Lord Vader to the death star 2 docking bay then move the trio of them over to the tat db.  he goes and puts out rendezvous point and then puts mirax and an rfc on the pulsar skate at tatooine instead of deploying luke from his reserve deck.  I see no logic in this as deploying luke to the cantina would have kept him from losing three, forced me to go capture luke where vader could possibly be cantina brawled or beat down by smugglers, and cause me to lose 1 force, whereas the pulsar skate only makes me lose 1 force.  whatever.  i go and make him lose 3 then drain him for 2 and then deploy commander igar on tempest 1 to the cloud city docking bay.  i now have mucho activation and i draw for a lateral damage and zuckuss in mist hunter.  i can smell a beating.  he goes and spends this turn giving me luke with saber and drawing.  i go and drain him and i don’t have enough force to battle in space so i deploy mara jade and go get her saber to back up tempest 1.  he goes and puts out han with gun to vader’s site then puts down a ralltirr freighter captain then puts down chewie with gun and another ralltirr freighter captain and wedge.  that could hurt, but chewie gets zapped.  he initiates battle and shoots at janus and connects.  he draws his destiny and gets a 6 and a 2 and plays heading for the medical frigate from his lost pile to add 1 to his destiny.  my power is one more than his so i get to stack a card, but i have to lose janus AND the emperor and all he has to lose is wedge.  my next turn i run vader away to cloud city.  i deploy bossk in bus and zuckuss in ship and lateral damage the pulsar skate and stack another card.  unfortunately i don’t get any overflow damage, but it flips him back.  he goes and moves his guys into the cantina.  i go and put blizzard 2 at the tat db and then give vader his saber and move him over.  he goes and deploys a bunch of scrubs to fight me and flip back, but unfortunately i don’t have any tramples to step on people with. he draws a 1 and a 2 for battle destiny and i am immune to the attrition.  i win the battle and he loses a few scrubs.  i think i forgot to stack a card this time.  he moves his guys at the cantina over to back up the guys at the db, flipping himself back.  i deploy captain sarkli on blizzard scout 1.  i battle.  he smiles and plays fallen portal to get my vader and draws a 6.  he thinks this will make my vader flattened but unfortunately he forgot that lord vader adds 2 to his defense value when he has a saber.  so vader sticks around to hack up somebody and i win another battle and now i have four cards stacked, but i could have one more except i forgot to stack it.  i think he draws up at this point and i get the win.  full win by 23.

Game 4: My WYS vs.  Lincoln Torrey (1959) no -objective Wakeelmui start.
<br/>
<br/>
hmm.  he starts docking bay crap and secret plans.  or maybe it was crush the rebellion.  whatever he deployed one of them with prepared defenses and deployed the other first turn and i can’t remember which was which.  i think he’s probably not playing ties since he deployed IAO and he will pull kuat first turn for activation.  but he doesn’t.  he gets rendili.  i’m confused somewhat but then he deploys kuat from hand and pulls a docking bay, so no he’s got big force set up for the next turn.  he plays stuff like operational as planned and shocking revelation and stuff throughout the whole game.  he also plays a couple of defensive fires which is annoying because he took my bantha droid out of my hand first turn (later he plays lateral damage on my outrider which sucks).  okay i go and pull out my docking bay and put melas at it.  next turn he goes and pulls out more docking bays and puts janus at the death star db.  it would be nice if i had a luke but i dont, so instead i deploy battle plan and theron nett to the home one docking bay (i was going to deploy him to kessel but red 10 wasn’t in my reserve; it turns out later to be good that i deployed him there).  he goes and passes on draining me (battle order came in very useful this game) so he can deploy the emperor.  later in the game he deploys a walker there, but i forget when he did that.  i deploy dash in the outrider to kessel.  on the same turn i put down jedi luke with his saber at the home one docking bay and move the three of them to the tat db for the flip.  he goes and has tons upon tons of force.  he slaps down snoova, gets his ax.  he puts down 4-lom with gun.  he puts down mara jade with her saber.  he puts down xizor.  looks like a beating at the tatooine docking bay.  i’m feeling slightly worried now, but i cross my fingers and hope for the best.  he tries to capture luke with snoova, AND draws a 1 to my 5.  no dice.  i swing at mara and get a 5 and a 2.  she’s hit.  he swings at luke and gets . . . a 1 and a 1.  he shoots luke with 4-lom.  ok so he draws his battle destiny and it’s . . . a 1.  i get a 6 and a 4.  i lose theron nett because he’s a convenient 8 forfeit and he loses . . . EVERYBODY!  that was pretty wacky.  i back up the outrider with wedge as a pilot.  he deploys some stuff in space, i think zuckuss in mist hunter with captain sarkli as a pilot and bossk in hound’s tooth  with guri as a passenger and lateral damages the outrider or something like that (hmm, sounds familiar) and fights me and i have
<br/>
 to lose the pilots on the outrider. and he loses nothing.  that sucks.  he puts down boba fett in slave I at tatooine and i put lando and chewie on cloud city docking bay and move melas over, so now i get three destiny there, and i move luke into the cantina, so now i’m draining for mucho force on the ground.  he puts down boba fett in slave I at tatooine and i try to put down the falcon with squadron assignments but both my captain hans are in the force pile so instead i put dash on the outrider and mirax in the pulsar skate at tatooine and move the outrider over to tatooine forgetting that it’s laterally damaged of course.  he moves bossk in hound’s tooth and zuckuss in mist hunter to tatooine and boba fett in slave i over to kessel.  i deploy captain han (with the tunnel vision i drew, which i then play from my lost pile to cancel his drain at the death star docking bay, but that’s backtracking) on the millenium falcon and battle him and the bacta tank, still forgetting that the outrider is laterally damaged.  i have to lose mirax and he loses captain sarkli.  for some reason i didn’t run away.  he goes and battles me and i forget to play the i know that i have in hand to get leia down and be able to get a destiny.  i have to lose dash to the tank.  next turn i deploy dash on the outrider and run away with the millenium falcon to rendili and dash to wakeelmui.  now i’m draining for lots, but he is draining for 5.  i move dash over to kuat and cancel lateral damage and next turn my drain would finish him off.  he gets the emperor and janus onto the walker, move over to tatooine and gets janus off and walks him into the cantina.  i drain him and he has one card left.  i battle janus, swing at him and hit him.  i draw a destiny 5 to his destiny 5 and he loses janus plus 6 which is game.  full win by 7
