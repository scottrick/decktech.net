  Ok where to start...I just find out that there will be a Playstation 2 tourney in one of the local card stores. Im pumped because I know I can win it if I get the right match ups and if its just locals. Well it turns out me and a bunch of the guys Andy Klema and Cody are staying over my boy Mike "deck" Gemme. This is going to be great and then one-day mike is talking about how Hott my mom is so I bring up his very bang able sister. So Klema is talking about getting with her but im like No cuz Jess has always been mine...well.... anyways we find out she was a couple friends staying over for the night after they go out. Now I start to get ready because I got my interim report and it wasn&amp;#8217;t very good so I was worried I wasnt going to make it and I had told everyone I wasn&amp;#8217;t going, but I talk my rents into letting me go. So I was suppose to be going to Mikes house from a dance that I was going to at my school cuz he was going pick me and his sis up form there but they cancel the dance and I get there at like 5. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well she has some Hott friends over who have me take a picture of them. The best line was when I was taking the picture of them they were like " Were not really sluts we just dress like it" It was great then one of her Hott friends asked what grade I was in cuz I go to a Near bye All boys school.... well anyways I was just hoping she would ask my age but since she knew people at my school I had to confess I was only a 15 year old sophomore...well they leave and we play test. I am kicking @#$% with my Qmc deck it lost one game all night against Cody’s dark deck cuz he got 3 of his 3 ships in his opening hand. Anyways im pretty confidant.
<br/>
<br/>
     Around one or so we go to the near by Denny’s to get the Brownie for the first time. The lady at the place was the ugliest hick I had ever seen and to top it of she had like 6 teeth missing anyways they screw up Mikes brownie and they didnt have any Ice cream so she substituted it with whipped cream. Well for anyone who hasnt had the brownie this thing tastes like @#$%. When mike isnt looking I steal some of his brownie only for him to steal some of mine when I go to the Bathroom. 
<br/>
<br/>
    We get back to his house and entertain the girls while they are begging for us to get them some food. I take this chance to fool around with my light deck and notice that Mikes sister isnt wearing a bra, neither is her friend with a god like body. So I take the time to look down there shirts it was classic. Anyways we go to bed and Mike wakes up mumbling about some Tzvitt tech we all laugh and get ready for the tourney. I go to take a shower and the only problem is there are two doors to here bathroom and you can not lock the one that connects with his sisters room and the toilet is facing right at the door so im paranoid when I take a piss. I get in the shower and its all good. We leave a little while after and get there.
<br/>
<br/>
     When I get there everyone is like oh @#$% I thought you weren&amp;#8217;t going so its great. I have to scramble and borrow cards cuz the TD wont let me play with any of my cards that have writing on them and that&amp;#8217;s lie have my Epps and other @#$%. I wrote stupid things like Obi-Wan with old wrinkly balls and @#$% like that ohh well I finally get my deck list in and im all set. 
<br/>
<br/>
Decks
<br/>
Ds: Huntdown sevens this deck is to be considered unbeatable to the local players including Hayes Hunter.
<br/>
Ls: Qmc Avatar Style it&amp;#8217;s a real good deck and a lot of people I knew were playing MKOS
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my Ds vs. Mike Rodriquez Deadbolt
<br/>
     Just to let you all know this kid looks just like Ten Numb and his brother is a carbon copy of Nien Numb he does this great thing with his lip and its funny as hell. Well I know I have this game in the bag because I have played deadbolt for sometime and I know my dark deck is much faster and can take out his whole fleet in one battle because of my numerous seven destiny visages. I get off to a good start Vader and stick second turn make him loose to visage and drains. He doesn&amp;#8217;t touch any of my guys since he is afraid of loosing a duel. Lets say this deck wins blind duels all the time. On decipher day in NYC I dueled a Jedi Knight Luke with his saber and won by like 3. So basically I sent my Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and 4-lom and Ig88 and wipe out a few of his characters it doesn&amp;#8217;t work out to my advantage only because he plays darklighter spin and has like attrition of 12 to my 14 so he looses a couple characters and I loose everything. I know I wont this because he left and empty ships and I counter assault him next turn for like 10.
<br/>
FW 2 +(23)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Me for winning
<br/>
Slops: Me for not thinking of Darklighter spin. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my Ls vs. Brian Twigg MKOS Fortress
<br/>
     Ok I think I can take him in this game since he is playing MKOS. Well Im wrong I get a god hand with like everything I need minus one card&amp;#8230; So I draw 5 cards on my turn and guess what they are all copies of what I already had in my hand. Next turn Twigg plays monnok and gets 10 cards in my hand. He got 2 Lukes 2 obis 2 celebrations 2 barriers and 2 path of least resistances it sucked so bad. So now I know ive lost since he got rid of my two celebrations and hes is dominating. Well I play the game smart and battle him only on my terms so I can retrieve force. It was hard since he knew exactly what to grab and I had lost 2 paths due to monnok. Well I play the game as good as I can and salvage a 15-card loss.
<br/>
FL 2 +(8)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Twigg for kicking my @#$% and me for keeping it close
<br/>
Slops: Monnok this is the second time he @#$%ed me hard with monnok, Also at NYC Slam
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 MY Ds vs. Cody HDWGITM CC
<br/>
     I know I have this game since he is playing mains on cloud city and I just beat the deck last night by 38 cards. Im hoping for a big win here since my dark deck usually wins by at least 30 in its games. Well im wrong the game is pretty simple I get a good start, as does he. Basically the game was all running around on CC. He always avoided me while I just drained and he lost to Visage. It is impossible to keep visage of the table since I play like 8. Anyways the game is in my favor but I need some differential point so I do a duel at the end non-epic. I only draw a 14 and not my normal 21 since I do not have a Focused attack and he draw a 10. So he looses 4 and I retrieve 4 I eventually drain him out and take the win.
<br/>
 Fw 30 I believe. 4 + (38)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Cody for tracking 2 5&amp;#8217;s
<br/>
Slops: My objective keeping him from draining with Luke on the Executor.
<br/>
<br/>
Lunch Break: This is great after going out side we have a huge snowball fight. Mike @#$%es out on me so its practically me taking on all the twigs. I do get some occasional help from Andy and Cody. We then have another Snowball fight at Wendys and get all snow inside so they get pissed off at me. While we are eating Mr. Twigg (Who is the coolest father you could ask for. Way to go Mr. Twigg) tells about the tourneys they have back at the shop. They give great prizes and really do run a good tournament. So we eat our food and go back to the store.
<br/>
 FL by 2 snowballs that I got pegged with from Big Twigg and Little Twigg
<br/>
<br/>
Props: The snowball fight and Mr Twigg for running real  good tourneys
<br/>
Slops: The snow that got down my shirt
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Ls vs. Chris Twigg Imp Command Huntdown.
<br/>
     This is going to be a real tough game especially since we just got done talking about how good his dark deck is and it hasn&amp;#8217;t lost in like 6 tournaments. I set up rather quickly and get a nice hold of Bespin. I got enough ships so he wont mess with me. The whole game is I running around on Cloud City. I avoided all the battles that I didn&amp;#8217;t need to fight. I thought I had the game at one point when I tried to apply a beat down using Path of Least Resistance and Epp Leia. Well he Imp barriers Leia and I just end up loosing some guys while Vader sticks around. It looked as if I would take that game since he was only draining me for 2 or 3 while I was retrieving that and doing a couple every turn for 2 or 3. I took charge of the game and POLR Luke sorry bout the messed Vader with a tracked 7 and 4 then dropped an Obi and Leia and beat up Fett.
<br/>
FW 16 6+(54)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Chris for playing a real good gaem: Me for playing the best game ive played in a long time.
<br/>
Slops: Not reading Dodge
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 My Ds vs. Brian Twigg Palace Raiders.
<br/>
     Had I been playing a normal Huntdown deck I would have won this game early on. I do like 20 damage while he is setting up and fighting him in space with my multiple destinies. Since I play no Harvest Hate or no React Hate I can fight his patrol crafts and I cant do anything about his reoccurring Harvest. He ends up retrieving all the damage that I do to him and he wins this game. It was not a good game so there is not much to tell. 
<br/>
FL 29 6 + (25)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Twigg for whopping my ass
<br/>
Slops: Not playing any retrieal protection
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 Ls vs. John Mullarky Huntdown imp command.
<br/>
     I wanted to win this one bad since he screwed my bro Mike earlier by surprise assaulting him when Mike had Hutt Influence out but Mike being the scrub that he is did nothing because he did not know his cards. Well this game is another boring game with my light deck. The kid has no grabbers so I totally own him he is doing very little damage to me and I am retrieving my lost pile little by little until Ive got like 5 card left. I cant battle his Vader since he has a I have you know in his hand. I do beat up a couple of his scrubs by using SATM. Well in the last turn he spreads out so I drop random guys and use the POLR in my hand and battle since he has First Strike out. I do enough damage doing this and I retrieve all but one card in my lost pile.
<br/>
FW 31 8 +(56)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: the revenge for Mike
<br/>
Slops: None
<br/>
<br/>
Well the tourney is over and my BOY KLEMA won it all since he kicked Brentson&amp;#8217;s @#$% and then Beat Twigg. He is a machine and is a great player. Im a Little Disappointed since I did not win and I was expecting it but what the hell can u do against a Twigg. Well the day ends its great Hayes Hunter shows up and we all give him @#$% for not coming because he was to stubborn to do some school work. I talk @#$% and say I can school his dark side deck. Well his dad is pissed since we are playing and hes waiting to go so I try to get a quick start and drop Wedge on Ship to CC. Now Hayes gets his only star fighters in his hand and a lateral damage so Zuckuss and Bossk beat up wedge and I quite. Anyways it was a great tourney.
