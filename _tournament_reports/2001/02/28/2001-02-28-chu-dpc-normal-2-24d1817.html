<br/>
<br/>
*****Brief Pre-tourney Notes
<br/>
<br/>
I hadn’t played since Deciphercon much, so I was a little outta the meta. I’m talking to Clint and he tells me this WYS deck Steve Lewis made up. I looked at it and there was so much stuff mixed in that worked with everything else in the deck, in classic deck-genius Steve style. Steve is also convinced a ton of people would be playing WYS with raiders.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways for dark side, Steve and Clint are all about this BHBM TIE insert deck, but I never took the time to playtest it thoroughly so I didn’t know how to play it. So I didn’t use it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Come Friday, Jim Sells, Steve, Clint, myself and Kevin Shannon (who flew into BNA) all pack into a car and drive out.
<br/>
<br/>
On the way there we play the dice game. The dice game is awesome. Everyone gets six die (30 total) and you gotta call how many of one number you think people have total. So if it’s my turn I might call 9 5’s. The next guy has to either call me or raise one of the numbers (to 10 2’s or 3’s or whatever, or 9 6’s). Once somebody is called everyone adds up how many of that number they have (1’s are wild) and if the person calling is right, the person who raised last loses a dice; otherwise the person calling loses a dice. The game is then played until only one person has die left.  So that’s the dice game. I win a game and then Clint wins like 4 in a row, so we get sick of seeing him cheat and stop playing.
<br/>
<br/>
We also make a big deal out of that awesome video Girard posted on Buzz. SOMEBODY SET UP US THE BOMB! Jim gets all pissed because he doesn’t have a clue what we’re talking about and everyone else thinks it’s the funniest thing ever. Steve mentions his girlfriend and Clint and Jim start to bust on him about all sorts of stuff. Anyways the 7-hour ride flies by pretty quick with everyone talking and Clint and Steve arguing about everything. We get to Normal and find out there’s a basketball game goin on that weekend so finding a room is imposslbe. We pass a Denny’s and the four of us want to get the Brownie and Jim doesn’t so we make him drop us off and find us all a room while we increase our chances for winning the next day. So Jim does that.
<br/>
<br/>
******The Brownie
<br/>
<br/>
The Brownie deserves its own bracketed section because it is a religious experience. There is considerable hype over the Brownie and it seems there are two factions: those who stand by the Brownie and those who think it is complete bull. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Brownie is not the Brownie because it tastes great. It’s not because it is a good deal and gives you a good deal of satisfaction from gorging yourself on it -- it’s actually painful and makes you spill your guts half an hour later. It’s not even a Brownie. But it wins games. The Brownie asks for respect.
<br/>
<br/>
We’re in Denny’s and Shannon decides not to get the Brownie. So Clint Steve and I order it and stuff ourselves with the cake and ice cream that is. It is so rich it hurts, but the investment paid off dividends. Look up the final standings between the five of us to see the effects of the 8th Wonder of the World.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, to continue. Jim comes back like 2 hours later and found one free room, so we all go there and crash. I express some doubt about the WYS deck so Steve and I go through and try to find its weaknesses -- what will shut it down? It seems like holding the system is absolutely key so we tackled that. How could the opponent force us off the system? He had Artoo/C-3p0 and the Artoo interrupt that cancels destinies to win the system in the long-run. I didn’t like it. In any case there was the question of TIEs and guns; if the Falcon got shot who cares how much forfeit your guys are? So we stuck in a Hyper Escape to run in case of emergency to the docking bay or any system the opponent gave you. 
<br/>
<br/>
The other problem was ISB. 5d6, or Undercover spies would absolutely shut down your damage. Steve wasn’t too worried about spies, and Artoo/C3p0 lets you attack 5d6. I thought those cards were too one-use-only so I ended up taking them out and putting in I Hope She’s Allright and Order to Engage. These cards were to win a game for me down the stretch.
<br/>
<br/>
********The Tourney
<br/>
<br/>
We arrived a little before 10 am and I said my hellos and such to Ghetto Squad, other people I had run into before, friends from home like Joe Gianneti from Albany, etc. The basement of the place was packed. There were guys from all over there.
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament started a little late but that’s to be expected. There were some announcements about not being afraid to be rules lawyers and stuff like that since we were playing for money. That didn’t seem to be a problem in my games -- people played really straight-up and if they forgot something like the force-generation limiting text on the back of WYS, they generally never forgot again.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the decks I chose were Steve’s WYS, with two cards changed, as stated above: OTE and I Hope She’s Allright for his Artoo/interrupt tech. For DS I decided on ROPs. Why ROPs? Isn’t it dead?
<br/>
<br/>
I had been banking on the meta -- that nobody would play Ounee Ta (turns out several people did, so I got a little lucky I guess) since, although it does different stuff, it was the main reason ROPs faded out. With that out of the picture, ROPs is still a very viable deck -- its Force Drain -1 text is huge against stuff like WYS, limiting its damage to practically nothing, and combined with Decree, absolutely shuts down EBOX. The deploy bonus is tough against Mains, and the Steve Lewis/Clint Hays Biker Scout version is quick to flip and can cause massive damage, and has support damage in many forms, including insert, Ability^3, Search and Destroy, and Relentless Tracking. The deck I played was almost card for card the deck online (Steven Lewis is a genius [world’s deck]), except I swapped in Ghhhk/Those Rebels for Mara’s Saber, Crossfire for another High-Speed Tactics, and Prince Xizor for something else. Corporal Avarik or something. Ghhhk/Those Rebels was primarily for Arcona/OTE, but also to stop a beatdown.
<br/>
<br/>
My games:
<br/>
<br/>
Game One: DS vs David Irvine (2117) EBOX
<br/>
<br/>
Great matchup, or so I thought. I draw Search and Destroy in my opening hand, which rules. Fish for Carida but don’t deploy it. Put out some guys. He goes and fishes out a site and EBG. I flip second turn and set up Search and Destroy for some early damage -- he ends up losing Kiffex and Kashyyyk off the top before he can start to mega-drain me in space. EPP Obi-Wan comes to the 4th marker to hold off S&amp;D, but Arica comes down, breaks her cover, dodges around Obi-Wan’s saber and lives to tell the tale. She moves in to begin setting up Decree, but an Ice Storm chases her inside and Decree is never completed. 
<br/>
<br/>
The game is going splendidly until this point. Then I begin to play like an idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
1) I said one of the best parts of ROPs is the Force Drain -1 text. I guess it’s a good thing I forgot about it the entire game. 
<br/>
2) It’s not a good idea to deploy Emperor’s Shuttle with some guy aboard to a system when you don’t have a Ghhhk in your hand and your opponent is holding an Organized and a couple more X-wings.
<br/>
<br/>
So after about 9 battle damage and about 7-8 cards I should have more in my deck but don’t because I can’t read, the game is close. He has about 7 cards left, 4 Xwings at Ralltiir, Zev and Hobbie at Hoth: Docking Bay (in front of Arica) and lone Xwings at Hoth and Tatooine. I have four sites at Ralltiir, the farthest of which are occupied by a Biker on a Bike, The prefect’s office which has a biker on a bike and the Emperor with Overseeing it, and the jungle with a biker and Prince Xizor (power +1! I remembered that but not the Objective?!!?) He lands three Xwings in front of Emp/Biker, another in front of one of the Bikers on a bike, docking bay transitted in front of the other, and ended his last turn. I had two cards left, and none in hand. I activate, drain for 3, he’s down to 4. Battle in front of Empy. He tries to draw destiny but forgets landed starships can’t apply ability. My power is 9 (biker [3] + bike [1] + Empy [4] + Prefect’s GT [1]). I have 4 sites occupied, so it’s +4. I need to draw a 3 to win. I draw a 4. WooohooooO! If he had landed his fourth xwing in front of Empy, I would’ve lost because I couldn’t read my frackin objective. As it was, incredibly close game.
<br/>
<br/>
Instead, 
<br/>
FW 2 (+2)
<br/>
Total: 2+2
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won! yay. That was all.
<br/>
Lows: Man I suck @#$% at this game. Who forgets the -1 FD on ROPs? Why play ROPs except for that reason? Otherwise all you have is a stinky little deck that plays on crappy sites and has a junky drain at the cost of deploying like 30 cards. Also who puts down a junky ship to stop a drain of 3 (which should have been 2) and doesn’t expect to get beat down in an Xwing EBO deck? Damn.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: LS vs Greg Greensides (1615) BHBM Beatdown.
<br/>
<br/>
I don’t remember much from this game -- Greg is from Quebec and was a cool guy. I drew a phat hand, with the Lars Farm, Captain han and Dash. By turn three I had those two guys in their ships on Tatooine and flipped. He hit me early with Xizor and 4-lom, but after that, I was all over Tatooine draining him, picking off his guys, and retrieving everything. There wasn’t much he could do. He drew up with 4 cards in my lost pile.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+22)
<br/>
Total: 4 +24
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The deck working like a charm
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: DS vs Matt Schmaltz (1792) AITC Chadras/Speeders
<br/>
<br/>
Chadras and Speeders? They get around my deploy bonus! Oh well. I flipped fast (2nd turn), but by then he had Tessek, Flaps, and Kabe in the chamber with Bo Shuda. He came down third turn with 5 Chadras, a flapped Speeder and a Hnmenthe piloting it. High-Speed Tactics took care of the Speeder after he battled and he lost 2 Chadras to cover attrition. My turn, I cleaned up my site. I controlled Ralltiir the entire game and wherever he put guys down, I mopped them up with Xizor, bikers or Vader. Not much he could do after I lopped him off my planet.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+23)
<br/>
Total: 6 +47
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: ROPs is a machine! I couldn’t forget the FD-1 text becuase I never got drained.
<br/>
Lows: None
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: LS vs Geoff Snider (1977) BHBM Big Blue with AO’s and Emperor’s Power
<br/>
<br/>
Geoff is cool and we talk a bit before the game starts. Once it began though it was no nonsense. He got fast on Tatooine with Vengeance and about four guys, after I put down Captain Han and Falcon. Captain had to go to cover battle damage but I took out a guy also (what an exchange). Dash, a Raider and Outrider followed to hold the planet, but I didn’t announce I was subtracting power during the weapons segment so there it was. I had to stack another card but before he came down, I flipped on the ground with a Raider in a craft so between two destinies he had to lose two guys. The Falcon died to cover attrition. The next few turns are all about him winning battles (I stacked about 8 cards), me forgetting one more time to subtract with the Outrider, and Captain Han and the Falcon dying and coming back yet again. I must have run through about 4 named Star Destroyers and 6 to 8 little 2/2 scrubs. But in the end, Tatooine was mine and I retrieved almost every card in my lost pile.   
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 (+32)
<br/>
Total 8 +79
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I could hold onto Tatooine. Every time he lost a card off the top to add a destiny with Emperor’s Power, it was a 6 and he ended up drawing two 1’s a whole bunch. 
<br/>
Lows: He drew 1’s a whole bunch. If he could’ve gotten past the attrition on the Outrider, it would’ve been a much different game. 
<br/>
<br/>
By now, midway through the tourney, there were only 5 undefeateds left (in order): Clint Hays, Steve Lewis, me, Steve Kuperman, and Graham Neal. The Brownie in action! Anyways, onto game 5.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Five: DS vs Steve Kuperman (1963) Tatooine mains
<br/>
<br/>
Steve had beaten TJ the game before so I was wary. But his start threw me off guard: Tatooine: Obi-wan’s hut and Careful Planning for Tatooine: JP. He tried to assure me the deck sucked and worked well against Scum but not necessarily ROps. I was just happy he didn’t start Ounee Ta. Three turns later, I had flipped and was on three sites with Bikers (one was Dresolyn) and the fourth with Janus. Well he came down with Hnemnthe, Chewie Protector and some other guy and battled. I reacted with three bikes (left the passenger at some of the sites for the +1 Battle Destiny) and managed to kill off the other guy. In my turn, Irol and Choke Vader came down, Chewie got choked, High-Speed tactics got played and the Hnementhe got buried under about 18 cards. He could never recover after that.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 +23
<br/>
Total: 10 +102
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I hate Hnennmthms. How do you spell those things anyway?
<br/>
Lows: none
<br/>
<br/>
Clint had beaten Steve, and since we were both DS we couldn’t play. David Irvine had beaten Graham Neal so there were only two undefeateds left. Clint got to play Dominic while I had to match up opposite decks with the eventual 2nd place finisher.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: WYS vs David Irvine (2117) and Balanced MKOS with Abyssins
<br/>
<br/>
The night before I had taken out Menace Fades because the deck performed admirably against Scum without it. Well I needed it the entire game. He comes down fast with Jabba, Scum, Chall and guys at the Audience Chamber and Lower Corridor. I absolutely control the system with all three ships and matching pilots, but who cares? I am getting pounded for 4 (six the next turn and for a while) on the ground. I lost Tatooine Celebration off the top early and my first Harvest got Grabbed. I couldn’t find Control/Tunnel Vision for the life of me, nor Battle Plan which is what I needed the most. I managed to win a few battles here and there, but his losses were offset by his retrievel was Scum/FS, and Jabba’s Twerps. Awesome! Time was running low and we were both playing quickly; I made a few mistakes not leaving enough battle destiny to take advantage of flipped WYS, and forgetting which interrupts were in my Lost Pile and which I had retrieved (I set up Celebration late and that is what kept me in the game). Time got called and I had about 5 cards left in my deck; I got a last-minute drain of 9 off but the game timed out.
<br/>
<br/>
TL 0 -19
<br/>
Total: 10 +83
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Once I set up my stuff with Battle Plan and Celebration, I plateaued, matched his drains with retrieval, and hung on for like 10 turns. If I only had gotten it sooner...
<br/>
Lows: Kicking myself for taking out Menace and putting in junk like I Hope She’s Allright. I was really hoping I would get to use this card against some cheesy TIE deck, but so far it had not seen any action. David played it safe and really well -- definitely befitting of his ranking.
<br/>
<br/>
Clint had beaten Dominic so he was the only undefeated. At this point it was close at the top; he had to play TJ who was sitting in 2nd place. I was bumped down to 5th or so and got paired up with Michael Raveling, the eventual 3rd place finisher.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Seven: LS vs Michael Raveling (2037) SYCFA TIEs and guns with a lot of red cards I have never read before
<br/>
<br/>
His deck is just that: TIEs and Guns off the SYCFA platform with U3p0 and Arica as his only ground and a whole bunch of Special Edition red cards I recall reading at one point but hadn’t in a while. Anyway my hand really sucks normally -- no Han or Dash or any ships -- but I had 2 raiders, 2 crafts, he was giving me 2 force, he pulled Wakeelmui so I smelled TIEs and so I figured what the hell -- flip first turn with a raider and a craft at his DS docking bay and my Tatooine DB. I couldn’t find Spaceport in my deck so he got to verify first turn. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had a good start like that it turned out; he played no guys for ground damage and I cut into his force activation with WYS. I got a few quick drains off, but soon he played Dark Waters on two of my sites, U-3p0 at the Cantina, a TIE every turn to DS: Docking Bay, and a TIE to Dreaded Imperial so all I was doing was 1 a turn at Spaceport DB and he was matching it with retrieval. Worse, he sat on my planet draining for 2 with an Interceptor and SFS -- he also had Fighter Cover out -- and he always saved like 6-7 force and I really didn’t have a clue what he was packing. I figured it was nasty so I didn’t want to come down with Han and crew only to get shot and wrecked by some cards I didn’t know existed. So he started to build up some solid drains; first 2, then 4 and eventually 8 at his systems and mine. I dug deep into my deck and found Battle Plan and I Hope She’s Allright (the latter about turn 3 so he was getting hit every turn, except for the two I forgot cuz I am scrubbish). I also found Order To Engage and Hyper Escape. Harvest got grabbed and so, with no retrieval options left (he also grabbed Nar Shaddah and had Plans out), I was desperate for answers.
<br/>
<br/>
I found that in Captain Han and the Falcon. I had been reluctant to go to space, fearing a beatdown similar to one received in my first game. I could play it in my mind: Falcon/Han for like all the force I had; he responds with a Barrier; next turn, TIEs and All Power and game. But I had no choice: I had to make him pay for his drains and do some damage with OTE. So I came down at Sullust; he had no Barrier; I battled; he played All Power, then reacted with Emperor’s Shield (or Sword, dunno which). I should have Barriered it from Lost Pile but I forgot. Also he should’ve reacted first then All Powered; the TIEs should not have been able to been put in play, but I forgot also. Man, I suck. :) Anyway he lost his TIE squadron to cover the damage. Next turn he paid for drains, battled, and I fled and he had to lose three. I Hope kept pinging away, and so did my drain at the Spaceport. Each turn I would either activate my Hyper Escape or pull it with Mirax. One turn he Ommni Boxed my deck so I had to pull for it. In the end, the last turn, I was looking at a drain of 4; he had 6 cards left. I drained him for 3, and then I Hope hit him for one, so he didn’t have enough to pay for his drain... I really eked this one out.
<br/>
<br/>
FW 2 +2
<br/>
Total 12 +85
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: That was a close one...... he played it really well. The deck looks like such a pile of junk but damn it took me to the brink. I Hope actually earned its card slot! It must have done like 18 damage in that game. Damn, but that’s an efficient card. 
<br/>
Lows: I should’nt have been a puss and not deployed to space fearing a beatdown. Note to self: do not play like a puss. I also sucked. Forgetting stuff in Lost Pile, forgetting Order to Engage when he put a TIE to the docking bay, etc... what was I doing up here?
<br/>
<br/>
Clint loses and so the standings are something like:
<br/>
<br/>
1st/2nd: Clint and TJ, playing each other for sure.
<br/>
<br/>
Me, in third, playing DS
<br/>
Brentson in fourth; us four are the only 6-1’s left (not counting David Irvine who had a timed win), also playing DS
<br/>
David Irvine, playing LS, in 5th
<br/>
Michael Raveling, playing LS, in 6th
<br/>
<br/>
Scott Lingrell is putting up the pairings on the Message board for the last game, and he has me and David Irvine paired up to play again. Well I already played him twice, so that couldn’t happen. So he tells me to go down and let Joe and Mike Girard know. So I do, and they send me back up after curtly telling me they know how to do their job. Okay...
<br/>
<br/>
So the next pairing gets called, and it’s:
<br/>
<br/>
Game Eight: DS vs David Irvine (2117) EBOX
<br/>
<br/>
Wait... I already played this match! So I tell Ron Fonck and he tells Joe, so I get prepared to play Michael Raveling... but instead, it’s
<br/>
<br/>
Game Eight: DS vs Zach Stenerson (1853) Hidden Mains
<br/>
<br/>
Why I didn’t play Michael Raveling? I have no idea. 
<br/>
<br/>
So this game starts out normal... I am putting out my stuff at the DS2 Docking Bay for more force, and he pulls Endor, Endor Docking Bay from hand, Home One docking bay from Deck and Crix Madine there. Next turn I can’t flip but instead put down some guys on Ralltiir to start draining. He puts out Jedi Luke (gets Barriered) at Home One DB with a saber, and transits Obi over to Ralltiir. I flip next turn and we fight back and forth. I don’t really remember the details...
<br/>
<br/>
We are both losing a few cards from the table, and I am hitting him more for drains because of Overseeing it Personally, but he has Harc Seff so it is pretty balanced. I have also deployed more stuff. Well he puts down Order to Engage. I have 5 sites out right now:
<br/>
<br/>
Spaceport DB   Prefect’s Office    Desert   Swamp   Forest
<br/>
<br/>
The Desert, Swamp and Forest each have a Bike and a guy apiece, and no guys for him. He is sitting at Prefect’s Office with Obi EPP, Crix Madine and Harc Seff. I have nobody there. He moves Jedi Luke with saber over to Spaceport DB, which has the Emperor there with Overseeing It, and ends his turn.
<br/>
<br/>
I activate my few and am faced with a decision. Two turns prior I had drawn a 1 5 1 for destiny in that order, and I knew there was a 5 three cards from the bottom. So I stop activating with 6 cards left. I had just killed Leia Han and Chewie in one big battle at the Forest, so I figured his character supply was at least partially depleted. I could either purge the Spaceport Docking Bay of Jedi Luke by slicing him with the 5 and 1 (Lord Vader with Saber in my hand) or hit Madine, draw a 6 for destiny and clear the Prefect’s Office, then draw a 10 against Jedi Luke (and risk losing the Emperor but clear the planet completely). The choice wasn’t tough. So down comes Lord Vader and saber. I initiate at the Prefect’s Office, but totally fail to anticipate a Weapon Levitate. So Vader is sitting there by himself without a gun. Obi-Wan hits him (his destiny was hella high) and I draw a one, as expected. So that’s that. Vader dies and Madine dies to attrition.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have to battle anyways or lose 3 force and can’t move Emperor away anyways without flipping back my Objective. So I battle, knowing that although the Emperor may get hit (and he does), I will draw my 5, make it a 9, and kill off the Jedi.
<br/>
<br/>
So I battle, he hits, and I draw... a 1. Damn! Obviously I put the cards in the battle two turns before back in the wrong order. So in one turn, I am flipped back, he still has his important guys out and my drains are halved (Overseeing it dies). Talk about a beating. 
<br/>
<br/>
So he is draining me for 3 and I am too, but he cancels one of my drains with Harc. During his turn he moves Obi and Harc over to the Desert, and Jedi Luke to Prefect’s. I don’t have much of a hand but come down with Choke Vader to back my guys up and hopefully do some damage. I look at my destinies -- they’re pretty good. So I battle, Choke Harc, and play High Speed to add a destiny. He Glancing Blows my Vader after he hits him, so that Vader was even more worthless than the last. My attrition kills off ObiWan, and his kill off my stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
During his turn, he redeploys ObiWan, plays Draw Their Fire, and then attempts to On The Edge his Luke with Saber. But he mistracks!! And kills off his own Jedi Luke. So now I’m suddenly left with an opening in a game I thought was gone. My drains are still pinging him and I move my remaining bikers far away from Obiwan to dodge Order to Engage as much as possible. Zuckuss also comes down to Carida to drain for more.
<br/>
<br/>
During his turn he redeploys Jedi Luke, this time with Anakin’s saber and cleans off a site, then moves over to block a drain. So he is draining me for one with Obiwan, making me battle somehwere else, and I am draining him for 2. It is really close. I swap a card from hand to Lost and pull Elsek using Carida’s game text, then battle (retrieve/lose), and everything dies. So I suck up a drain of 3 during his turn. During my turn, I deploy a Biker Scout trooper from hand to Endor: Landing Platform to match his drains.
<br/>
<br/>
So now, I have 7 cards left and one card in hand (Biker Scout Trooper). He 8 cards in deck (one active, 7 reserve), none in hand. At this rate he will win by 2. So he doesn’t activate any (doesn’t choose to pursue my remaining Biker Scout on Ralltiir to make me battle with OTE) and instead drains for 2 and 1, then ends his turn. I drain for 3 and he loses off the top.
<br/>
<br/>
I activate all my 5. I deploy my Biker Scout Trooper to Endor, and then move the other for free to his Home One docking bay to increase my drain to 4. I also know in my five cards remaining, there is a Projective Telepathy, and so if I draw it and he doesn’t activate (he didn’t last turn), I will cancel his drain of 2 and get in edgewise. So I draw... and draw... and draw... and draw the last force in force pile... and my Projective is the one force I used to deploy the Biker Scout Trooper.
<br/>
<br/>
So I groan (of course he doesn’t activate), he drains for 3, I lose them, there is nothing I can do with one force left, so I drain and draw up. Game.
<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, I would not have changed the turn where everything died because I couldn’t track, because I would not have known he had a Weapon lev and that I mistracked anyway. But why deploy the Biker Scout Trooper?? It wouldn’t have mattered had I drained for one more anyway. I should’ve just drawn up.
<br/>
<br/>
But anyways...
<br/>
<br/>
FL 0 -2
<br/>
Total: 12 +83
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Watching Luke die to an On the Edge.
<br/>
Lows: Misplaying the end. Zach played a strong game -- careful and doing all the right things. Oh yeah, I also shouldn’t have lost Ability, Ability, Ability. I suck. Losing when the game is so close and it’s the kind you replay over and over to see where you could have played differently and won...
<br/>
<br/>
Clint loses and ends up in 5th, 5 differential behind Steve Lewis, who had a big 32 point win over Steve Kuperman to edge in 4th. I end up some differential behind Hays in 6th, with the knowledge that had I won the game by 1, I would’ve been in 2nd, had to play David Irvine who I had beaten with a good matchup in my favor, and gotten to pick the side. Well, @#$%. That’s the way things go. So David plays Michael Raveling and wins, and plays TJ in the final after TJ trounced Steve with a Grimtaash lost... and the rest is in the books.
