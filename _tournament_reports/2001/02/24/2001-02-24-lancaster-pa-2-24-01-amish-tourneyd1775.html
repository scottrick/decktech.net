<br/>
<br/>
Well, my and my friend were unsure that we were going to be going to this tourney (all
<br/>
going to be our first tourney), because of a number of issues, ranging from my friends
<br/>
guitar lesson to my mom not liking people in general because she is a paranoid skitzo.
<br/>
anyway, I was doubtful we were going until I walked into the store, but happy that I got
<br/>
to go (finally!) 
<br/>
<br/>
--- end pre tourney crap --- 
<br/>
<br/>
Decks: for the darkside I was packing my saber in your eye huntdown, mines the your
<br/>
eyes can deceive you, so it was just a regular hunt down that I&amp;#8217;m never using again.
<br/>
<br/>
for the lightside, I played my non WYS harvest, with 7 harvests, and it was really fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is my first tourney, and therefore first tourney report, so go easy on me.
<br/>
obviously, I am unrated going into this tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
YAY I GOT A RATING, ITS ABOUT TIME. ok, I&amp;#8217;m very sorry, I&amp;#8217;ve just been waiting 3
<br/>
years for a tourney to be near me :-)
<br/>
<br/>
ok, onto the games
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS vs. Gennaro (not sure of his last name, but he&amp;#8217;s a really cool, laid back "I
<br/>
don&amp;#8217;t care if I win" guy) 15?? not sure, he didn&amp;#8217;t say what his rating was, just that it was
<br/>
in the 1500s. he was playing random scrubs in random places
<br/>
<br/>
well, he started the hoth war room, and I&amp;#8217;m thinking EBO, a wacky ebo. and I do my hunt
<br/>
down stuff, and didn&amp;#8217;t draw a vader, but otherwise a good hand. I drew my BB vader in
<br/>
the first force I drew, first turn, lost to visage, and made him lose too. he just went about
<br/>
deploying random sites on tatooine, including the moisture farm, which had me thinking
<br/>
harvest, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t harvest. had me really freaked out. he deployed random 2/2 scrubs,
<br/>
and a madine to the farm, as well as a CoK and a scrub to the audience chamber. he
<br/>
managed to do about 10 force in drains, maybe less to me through out the game, all the
<br/>
while I beat down on his scrubs, crossed Luke with some tracked 6’s, and let visage eat
<br/>
him. not a real active game, but I had fun and won my first ever sanctioned game, by a
<br/>
whole 19 cards! gasp, I&amp;#8217;m not too bad :-)
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win: 2(+19)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: beating up on madine with clash of saber and all that good stuff, and winning my
<br/>
first game
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: relatively inactive game
<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: Gennaro’s deck, it was kinda sloppy, but you’ll get better, Gennaro.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs. Jason McSherry 1700 something’s MKOS abyssians
<br/>
<br/>
well, Jason had MAJOR problems with his MKOS deck, including no abyssians, no abby
<br/>
ornaments, and several other key cards he forgot to put in, as he rushed to just throw 20
<br/>
cards in at the last second, which cost him the game. he basically deploy a bunch of guys
<br/>
on the sail barge, and ran around, while draining at the AC, and the lower passages. I was
<br/>
harvesting like crazy, getting 8 of them off over the game (I only managed to play one
<br/>
before something special planned for them hit the table). I drained for about 10-15 force
<br/>
the whole game, while he drained for about 30 some, all thanks to gailid, but I played 8
<br/>
harvests, and retrieved a WHOLE lot. I placed boelo and xizor out of play with OOC/TT,
<br/>
and it was all good. the biggest battle of the game occurred when he had xizor, boelo, a
<br/>
merc pilot, bib, snoova, and djas puhr on the sail barge, and he initiated against my  lone
<br/>
jedi Luke w/ saber, and freshly stole vibro axe. he retrieved his two for scum (which he
<br/>
did about 3-4 time over the course of the game, very annoying), and I promptly played
<br/>
fallen portal, targeting the merc, and boelo, praying for a good draw. I get a 4, and with
<br/>
the +2, they are both lost, and he’s suddenly screwed. he gets a 2 for his destiny, and I
<br/>
think that I draw either a 2, or a random 6, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure which. anyway, I end up
<br/>
losing Luke, with his saber and axe, and one more, or something like that. Luke never
<br/>
comes back (none of the 3 in the deck :-( ) and I just drain with Ben at the farm (and his
<br/>
saber too) while he drains for about 6 a turn, and I&amp;#8217;m getting 4 back. I beat down on him
<br/>
once or twice, but in the end, it was the 7 harvests that won it. we had time called, and I
<br/>
had played my second to last harvest, and we counted up the cards in our decks, I had 35,
<br/>
he had 19, so I get the timed win.
<br/>
<br/>
Timed Win: 3 (+54)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: Jason forgetting so many key cards
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: Jason forgetting so many key cards
<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: Jason forgetting so many key cards
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My DS vs. James Leiser 1850 or so’s WYS mega tech
<br/>
<br/>
well, James is a great player, despite his rating. he&amp;#8217;s the one that enlightened me, and
<br/>
taught me how to track, so he&amp;#8217;s basically my mentor. he had MEGA tech in this deck,
<br/>
with lots of admiral orders, which I couldn&amp;#8217;t grab, and they added to his drains at the
<br/>
DBays he had. he was draining for about 6 a turn, killing my activation, and beating me
<br/>
in all the battles we had. I got about 3 or 4 drains with vader and tarkin at the cantina
<br/>
with vaders saber, then down came menace, and then bargining table, so that hurt too. I
<br/>
tracked two sixes for Mara to duel jedi Luke w/ saber, he had @#$%ty draws, but we tied (I
<br/>
had a spare visage in hand, which I was gonna track, and I thought nah, I don&amp;#8217;t need the
<br/>
extra overkill, DOH!) so nothing happened, except he beat down on Mara jade with some
<br/>
extra destiny thanks to ralltiir freighter cappys, and I sucked really bad in this game. he
<br/>
played the regular TT, so my this is some rescue did nothing, and I royally crapped my
<br/>
pants when he canceled visage twice. I did land one good battle on his falcon w/ ECC
<br/>
lando and dash. I put a foily lateral damage on it, and then battled with fett in slave one. I
<br/>
drew a tracked 7, but his AO made my total power 12, and he drew two 6s for destiny, so
<br/>
I got rid of his ECC lando, but lost my slave one. closest I ever came to winning a battle
<br/>
against James. he drained a bunch more, and I drew up in the end. full loss by 24.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss: 3(30)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: umm, playing James because he is just generally cool
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: Mara tying Luke in the duel
<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: James’ Regular transmission terminated
<br/>
<br/>
at this point, I&amp;#8217;m 3 with +30 so I&amp;#8217;m totally happy, and I go into my next game with
<br/>
broken confidence, as its against the TD, and I just generally feel bad from losing against
<br/>
James, but I knew he was easily the best player there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: my LS vs. Mike Carr 1500 something’s endor ops no flip
<br/>
<br/>
well, this game was an incredible matchup. he had something special planned for him (I
<br/>
played the only people who had it, just about, it sooooo figures) but it didn&amp;#8217;t matter
<br/>
much. he got to space quick, and decreed, but not before I managed about 20 force or
<br/>
more in drains from the cantina and other tatooine locations with my lightsabers. all the
<br/>
time, he was doing 7 in drains for about 5 turns, but every turn (mine and his) I was
<br/>
playing harvests. in the meanwhile, I forgot to drain twice, for 4 force each time, which
<br/>
sucked. we had but one battle, and it was late in the game, when he had about 5 force
<br/>
left, and I had 3, and it was corran and kal fal, vs. choke vader, I initiated. it was my last
<br/>
ditch effort to make him lose force. I was PRAYING for a 6 which there were a ton of in
<br/>
the deck, but I pulled a 2, and I lost the battle by one, so I lost kal fal, he lost nothing, and
<br/>
that was about it. he drained me for 7 next turn and killed me. there were several things
<br/>
that would have gotten me the win (and second or third place for that matter). I could
<br/>
have drained for those 8 (I even had DRAIN written on my hand in black permanent
<br/>
marker...HOW COULD I FORGET! they was the only times I forgot to drain, how
<br/>
scrubbish) and I could have grabbed that last harvest instead of I hope she&amp;#8217;s alright from
<br/>
my force pile with tunnel vision, but no, I decided to be a scrub and lose by 5, when I
<br/>
should have won.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss: 3(+25)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: HARVEST
<br/>
<br/>
Bad: something special for them
<br/>
<br/>
Ugly: me not draining...ugh
<br/>
<br/>
well, all in all the tourney was great, and I had lots of fun. I didn&amp;#8217;t do too bad, and I came
<br/>
in 9th out of 14 (instead of 2nd, DOH!) oh well, ill be there next month. James won,
<br/>
going undefeated, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure of who else placed where.
<br/>
