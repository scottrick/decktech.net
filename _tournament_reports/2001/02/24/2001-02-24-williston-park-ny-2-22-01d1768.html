Well this was a small 9 man tourney at Grasshopper’s Comics in Williston Park, NY.  The prize support was a masterful move foil for first place and a signal foil for a random player.  So the tourney is supposed to start at 2 p.m., hence it started around a quarter to 3.  So we’re off
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs. Brian Mayrsohn (1469)
<br/>
<br/>
My Hunt Down vs. His Cross Vader Deck
<br/>
<br/>
So first turn I activate five force, after pulling out Rendili, then I play operational as planned giving me 6 activated force.  I drop a Dark Lord to his Endor Landing Platform  and pull out the executor docking bay.  I play weapon levitation finding Vader’s Lightsaber and play in on the Dark Lord.  I flip my objective, he loses to Visage and I’m done.  He only gets 3 force activated which is hot and he can’t drain at Luke’s site either.  For the rest of the game, for some reason, he keeps Luke there and basically does nothing all game.  I build up a force at the Landing Platform eventually ending up with a drain of 5 because of Vader’s Lightsaber, Mara’s Lightsaber, Janus with Emperor, and Presence of the Force.
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+35)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning
<br/>
Lows: Boring Game, being done is less than 10 minutes
<br/>
<br/>
Current Position 2 (+35)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs. Mike Mayrsohn (1641)
<br/>
<br/>
 My Cross Vader vs. His Alien Rep Objective Deck
<br/>
<br/>
Both our first turns are uneventful except for setting up sites.  His second turn, he drops jabba and chall bekan to the audience chamber.  My second turn I drop Obi with Saber(he barriers Obi but I canceled it with desperate reach), Leia with Blaster, and Tawss Kha to the Chamber and battle, predicting me the winner with Tawss. I hit both and smoke screen for a 6 destiny.  He pulls a 0 for destiny and he loses the table and 13 cards.  Next turn he comes down with Mara Jade with saber, and Ephont Mon, he battles.  He swings and hits Leia, I hit both his Characters, then I smoke screen for a six destiny, he pulls a 2 for destiny.  I lose Leia and Tawss, he loses everyone and 9 cards.  On my next turn I drop Orrimarko at the chamber and cancel Scum and Villainy.  He drops Xizor to the Landing Platform and moves over to Chirpa’s Hut, by the way, Luke has been sitting at the Landing Platform draining for 2 all game.  On my turn, I drop Chewie of Kashyyk and General Han to the Hut and battle.  I cant draw because I don’t have 6 ability but I cancel his destiny draw with General Han by using 2 force.  He loses Xizor and 2 cards.  This was basically the end of the game, for the rest of the game I drain at the Landing Platform and the Audience Chamber.
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+30)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning, having an answer for everything he played and every move he made
<br/>
Lows: None
<br/>
<br/>
Current Position: 4(+65)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs. Matt Ehrhart (1932)
<br/>
<br/>
My Lightside Cross vs. His Boom False Start Jabba’s Palace Deck
<br/>
<br/>
He starts Boom set up but I know this deck so I know its false.  He draws up first turn, looking for one of his Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace.  I move Luke over to the Landing Platform after draining for 1 and searching for a D-bay.  He drops Ephont Mon at the executor Docking bay next turn (a permanent activation of 3 force) and begins to set up at the Audience Chamber.  I drain for two and wait.  He drops Vader and a guy or two and captures Luke.  I fight off his guys for a while with Obi with Sabers and smoke screens while he sets up his drains at Jabba’s Palace.  I finally free Luke but by now he has set up a drain of 7 on Tatooine.  I try to go to Tatooine with a few people but they get beatdown.  He drains me dead.
<br/>
<br/>
FL (-8)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing a decent game and going down trying
<br/>
Lows: Losing(obviously), not playing Tatooine: Docking Bay(not for long)
<br/>
<br/>
Current Position 4(+57)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs. Matt Ehrhart (1932).(yes, again)
<br/>
<br/>
My Hunt Down vs. His Speeders Deck
<br/>
<br/>
I know this deck already so I know that he doesn’t have much power that can go interior.  I drop Mara first turn to the Landing Platform and I’m done.  He activates little force and moves over to Mara.  I drop Vader, flip, and move both over to Chirpa’s Hut.  He drops Artoo Undercover and Begins to set up Speeders at the Docking Bays.  I pull out Mara’s Saber and play it on her.  Next turn I sniper artoo and he’s dead.  Next trun he drops Coran Horn Undercover.  I drop Emperor to the Hut.  He plays Obi to the Executor Docking Bay and I feel that he’s going for my Visage.  I force lightning Coran Horn, drain, and play IG88 with Gun, 4 Lom with gun, and Dengar with Gun to Obi’s site and battle, he fallen portals Dengar and 4Lom and kills them both.  I shoot with IG88 at Obi and pull a 7 (a visage) for destiny and Capture him.  He will remain there with Obi for the rest of the game, taking him out of the equation.  He drops Boushh to the Hut next turn and its looking bad for me as he has a drains of 4 per turn and he’s only losing from Visage.  I search for a force lightning and find one.  Then I use reactor terminal to track a 7 and force lightning Boushh.  By now I have a drain for 5 at the Hut with Vader’s Lightsaber, Mara’s Lightsaber, and Presence of the Force.  He cancels Visage but it is too late and I win the drain race.
<br/>
<br/>
FW (+11)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning, tracking good destiny which won the game for me
<br/>
Lows: None, I feel I played rather good game and was satisfied with my performance
<br/>
<br/>
Current Position 6(+68)
<br/>
<br/>
That’s the end of the tournament and I end up being the winner with a differential more than 30 points higher than anyone else.
