<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-game stuff:  Rochester is a small town about an hour drive to the South of the Twin Cities.  I was kinda excited to go this week.  I wanted to prove my Agents of Black Sun deck could win and I wanted to see if anyone could counter my WYS light side which had gone undefeated in four tournaments.  But when Friday night came around I had a bad sore throat and I spent the entire night tossing from one side of the bed to the other.  I got absolutely no sleep.  When Graham called at 8 in the morning I was wide-awake.  I thought about not going but I might feel better later on in the day.  So I decided to go to the Rochester tournament with zero hours of sleep.  On the drive down, I kept drifting into unconsciousness and my nose started to run.  I noticed that talking was hard because of the phlegm build up in my mouth so I kept silent as much as possible.  When we finally arrived at the tournament I felt like the emissions from the backside of a Tauntaun.  For light side I was using my WYS with the only card change an Outrider instead of the Pulsar Skate.  For dark side I was using my Agents of the Dark Sun with some minor modifications.  I thought it would be lucky if I won two games because I couldn’t concentrate on anything.

GAME ON:  
<br/>
Game One: Matt Scherger
<br/>
My WYS versus Matt’s Unorganized Pile
<br/>
This guy started the Coruscant: Imperial Square with Mob Points, IAO, and There Is No Try/ OE.  I started WYS with Staging Areas, Insurrection, and Aim High.  So to start the game he does Mob Points and I have a Nar Shaddaa Wind Chimes which I play.  He takes out Weekulmui and I grab a Palace Raider.  Then I somehow forget that the dark side goes first so I start activating.  He says, "The Dark Side goes first."  Suddenly I feel like I should not have come.  I search my memory banks and they are all empty.  I have forgotten how to play this game.  He is playing the game without me and I forget to check that he didn’t activate for the Cantina.  Something everyone should do when you play a WYS deck.  He deploys Weekulmui and draws some.  On my turn I go into WYS autopilot.  I have played this deck at the past 5 tourneys and I feel like I could run this deck with my eyes closed.  I deployed the Home 1 docking bay and put Palace Raiders down at the Cantina and the Tattoine Docking Bay for the first turn flip.  Now he is activating only 5 force.  I get a few turns in of free draining and he deploys Kuat, Bad Feeling Have I, and Hoth system.  Finally he saves some force so I know he is setting up a hit for my Palace Raiders.  However, I have both Rebel Barriers in my hand so I don’t believe he can actually do anything to me.  I wait to see what he does.  On his turn he deploys Lord Vader with Vader’s saber to the Tattoine Docking Bay.  I barrier him.  Tarkin comes down to join Vader.  I don’t barrier him.  He battles me with a Lone Tarkin and Fallen Portal sends him to the lost pile.  Now it is just Vader alone.  On my turn I deploy Goo Nee Tay.  And have enough force for Lando W/Blaster.  He says I should pay the extra for Bad Feeling Have I and I point out that I did.  I also get a Ralltiir Freighter Captain to join those two.  I battle and draw a 9 in attrition.  He loses Vader and I play Old Ben to save everyone at the site.  Now he is flustered.  All his cards are being sent to the lost pile through my force drains.  He deploys the Chimera with Ozzel to my Tattoine System and I can’t find my one ship.  So I have to eat that drain while I spread out to the Cantina, Tattoine DB, and Spaceport DB.  He gets out Sienar Fleet Systems and deploys an Interceptor at Weekulmui and one at Tattoine.  He must not have realized that my objective cancels Sense/Alter so he didn’t need to worry about me canceling his Sienar Fleet Systems.  He also gets out Dengar in Ship to Tattoine.  Shoot he has backed up his one drain pretty good.  I draw the Outrider and Dash.  They go to Tattoine with a Ralltiir Freighter Captain and Chewie Protector.  Bacta Tank comes out.  Chewie now has 10 forfeit so I figure I can handle any damage he might inflict on me.  I battle the Chimera.  I draw destiny before I do Dash’s game text.  I say that I am using dash’s game text and he lets me do it.  I don’t know if he even knew he shouldn’t have.  My two destinies kill the Tie Interceptor but he also forfeits Dengar for some reason.  I woulda ditched Ozzel instead.  I lose nothing because he drew a zero.  On his turn he deploys Bossk in Hound’s Tooth to Tattoine but I use the barrier I had been saving the whole game.   Out comes another Tie Interceptor.  He doesn’t battle on his turn so I get to on mine.  I draw enough destiny to kill Ozzel and the Tie Interceptor.  He draws enough destiny to get over my Ralltiir Freighter Captain’s forfeit so I ditch Dash to the Bacta Tank.  On his turn he battles my Outrider but draws terrible destiny and I only lose the Ralltiir Freighter Captain.  On my turn I deploy Han With Blaster to the Outrider but don’t have enough to also deploy Dash.  I battle and I finally clear the system with my 3 destinies.  I lose Han to the Bacta tank.  He has no more fight left in him and I win the game. Full Win (+22)
<br/>
Afterwards he tells me that he is relatively new to the game but I am too sick to really engage him in any sort of friendly conversation.  I can’t speak without my voice cracking.  I have to go to the bathroom and blow my nose.  It is freezing in there and I wonder if I am going to catch pneumonia.  Anyhoots back to game 2.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: Andrew Stenson 
<br/>
My Agents of the Dark Sun versus his MWYHL.
<br/>
I have never played Andrew before and he seems to not know who I am.  Oh well.  I start Agents of The Dark Sun with Mob Points, IAO, and There Is No Try/ OE.  He starts MWYHL with Battle Plan, Do or Do Not/ Wise Advice, and Way of Things.  I set up in space first turn with a Stinger to Rendili.  I move Xizor over to the Coruscant Docking bay to activate tons.  He sets up with Yoda on his turn and the training ground.  I deploy Boba Fett in Slave 1 to Rendili and get out Black Sun Fleet. I get in one turn of the Cantina shuffle with the Stinger moving to Kashyyk to drain during the control phase.  He trains test one and I deploy Endor system.  So I am still draining him for 3 a turn.  He deploys Squadron Assignments and tries to go in for Captain Han but he isn’t in his reserve.  I don’t verify because I don’t have the mental capacity to actually use the information that seeing his reserve deck would give me.  On my turn I do the Cantina shuffle and sit at Kashyyk with both ships.  On his turn he gets Captain Han and the Falcon with General Calrissian to Kashyyk but I barrier it.  On my turn I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter, Guri into the Stinger, and 4-Lom on Zuckuss.  I battle and draw my 4 destinies.  I wipe out the falcon and I lose nothing.  His turn he draws up to regroup so I drop down Sullust and am draining for 4 a turn.  He puts up one last fight as the Home 1 comes down to Sullust with Red5w/Artoo and Coran Horn but I barrier Coran Horn.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t battle my fleet.  On my turn I deploy IG-88 in Ig-2000 and then I try to deploy Ig-88 with Riot Gun to Zuckuss.  He catches me trying to have two Ig-88’s on the table at once and I apologize.  I deploy Dengar and the Virago as well.  I now have every bounty hunter ship except Bossk down at this system.  I use Twilek to deploy Come Here You Big Coward.   I battle and with 4 destinies I wipe out the Home 1 and Corran Horn.  I move Boba Fett to Kashyyk to try to set up a drain of 5 next turn.  He deploys the Outrider with Dash and battles my lone Boba Fett.  I lose it and he moves the Outrider to Dagobah System to hide from me.  I use the control phase movement to move Zuckuss there but I don’t have 6 destiny so I can’t do anything to him but I battle and lose 4-Lom.  I move Dengar there to back up Zuckuss. He is at test 5 now and he asks me if I have Secret Plans out.  He laughs and acts like he is actually going to retrieve with his objective.  I say no but that have Come Here You Big Coward.  He reads it and knows the game is over.  I win by +33 
<br/>
I am doing no card tracking at all in these games and I am getting worse.  I feel like I am going to throw up but it I get a Mellow Yellow to drink and then I feel all right.  That beverage must have some medicinal properties.  My hands are twice as sweaty as they usually are.  Ick.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: Chad Thompson 
<br/>
My Agents of Black Sun versus his TIGIH.
<br/>
Chad is dressed up with nice shoes, dress pants, and a dress shirt.  He looks pretty spiffy so he has the intimidation factor going nicely.  He sits down and reveals his TIGIH.  I feel bad because my Agents of the Black Sun deck had its only loss to a TIGIH that generated so much force I could never catch up.  However Chad only starts 2 effects with Heading for the Medical Frigate and does not start Staging Areas.  I start my Agents of the Black Sun with Mob Points, IAO, and There Is No Try/ OE.  He starts with Insurrection and Wise Advice only.  On my turn I look for a docking bay but there is none in my reserve.  Doh.  He looks through my whole deck first turn.  I don’t think he used the info he got from that look because he sure didn’t play like it.  Anyway, I set up Rendili but can’t move the prince to the Coruscant DB.  I draw.  Chad drains me for one first turn and I play Weapon of an Ungrateful Son and he loses his lightsaber.  Then Chad moves Luke over to the Endor DB.  On my turn I deploy Dark Waters to that docking bay and now he is draining for zero.  I get out the Coruscant DB and move Xizor there.  On his turn he deploys Obi with Saber and Kal to the Endor Db and tries to move them all to Coruscant but I point out that it is +8 to move there.  He decides not to do that.  He also deployed the Tattoine DB but never moves there to try to drain.  I set up Sullust with the Stinger.  He comes down to battle me with the Outrider with Melas and Talon Karrde piloting but I barrier it.  My turn I can’t deploy anything to kill his ships as my hand is pretty weak so I run to Kashyyk.  I get out Black Sun Fleet and have to draw up.   He gets a drain of two in on me before I can deploy Bossk in Hounds Tooth with Guri, and kill both Melas and Karrde but the Outrider is still sitting at Sullust which scares me.  Now I have a cantina shuffle going in space.  I deploy the Virago to Rendilli to try to get a free drain of one.  On Chad’s turn he comes down to Rendili with the Falcon and General Calrissian to battle my Virago but that ship has super high forfeit.  I just ditch that.  He moves the Falcon to Kashyyk.  I am just sitting at Sullust now and Chad and I are matching drains.  On my turn I play No Escape to get the Virago back into hand and deploy it down to Rendilli again.  I decide not to waste my Bossk until I can draw more ships to back him up so I have to leave the Falcon to drain me.  I draw but all my bounty hunter ships are hiding on me.  Most of the time I get some back up into my hand by now but I am drawing all my ground defense cards.  So Chad comes down to Rendili with the Tantive 4 with Cracken.  Then he puts out Red5/Artoo and puts down Chewie with Blaster to pilot it.  Expensive.  So he kills the Virago for good and I lose 5 force.  He tries to move to Kashyyk but I point out that he can’t get there with the Tantive 4 so he has to sit.  On my turn I finally can do something and I move Bossk to Kashyyk during my control phase.  I deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter and battle his Falcon.  He has to lose both of them.  He is draining me for one and I am draining him for 4.  Now the game is turning to my favor.  He deploys Dash to the Outrider and I control phase move Zuckuss to his site and I deploy IG-88 in Ig-2000 to kill off Dash and his ship.  Chad deploys Orrimarko to the tattoine DB and now I feel bad because I just ditched my last Dark Waters.  He moves Red5 with Chewie to Kashyyk to try to block that drain and I control phase move Zuckuss and battle him.  I deploy U-3Po on my next turn to block the Tattoine drain and I set up at Endor.  Now I have a drain of 6 to his one and for some reason I never go to Rendilli to kill the Tantive.  Hmmm.  Why didn’t I do that?  I win by+3 
<br/>
He never remembered to make me give him a card for winning a battle.  He probably should have won this game because I wasn’t playing very smart and I didn’t draw the cards I needed.  After this game we break for lunch and I try to eat a bagel to settle my stomach.  It works and I feel better.  Graham says I don’t look very well and I tell him that I am ok.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: Josh Grace: 
<br/>
My WYS versus Josh’s ISB ops.
<br/>
Josh sits down and tells me how Rob "One-Arm" Jeffries had made a deck almost exactly like my WYS deck and Josh had beaten the snot out of him with the very same deck I am now about to play.  Josh flips his objective and it is ISB.  I start WYS with Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Aim High.  He starts ISB ops with Mob Points, IAO, and There Is No Try/ OE.  On Josh’s first turn he deploys Rendilli, the Coruscant Docking Bay, and gets the Cloud City Docking Bay.  He deploys Ozzel to the Coruscant db but then takes him back.  He knows I will get the first turn flip and then Ozzel will be worthless.  So he then deploys Ozzel, Lt. Pol Treidum, and Lt. Tanbris to the Tattoine Docking Bay.  On my turn I get the Spaceport Docking Bay and deploy a Palace Raider there.  I also deploy Ralltiir Freighter Captain to the Cloud City docking bay and get a first turn flip.  Josh activates his 9 but can’t do anything so he draws.  On my second turn I activate and play and Tunnel Vision to get Luke with saber.  Josh saved one force so I think he may have an Imperial Barrier so I use Tunnel Vision again from lost pile to get Bith Shufft/Desperate Reach.
<br/>
 I deploy Wedge, Han with Blaster and Luke with saber to the Tattoine Docking Bay.  He has no Imperial Barrier so I wasted the Tunnel Vision and my once per turn use of a lost interrupt.  I battle and hit Lot Pol and chop Ozzel.  I play Slight Weapons Malfunction.  I draw my 4 battle destinies and clear the site.  Josh has to lose some.  On his turn he deploys the Emperor to the Ds2 Docking bay with Janus.  He puts down an Undercover spy to the Cloud City Docking Bay.  So I move the Freighter Captain to the Spaceport and Josh follows him.  I am draining him for two and he is draining me for zero.  I get out Goo Nee Tay.  Josh’s next turn we get into a rules discussion about whether the Emperor can activate an extra force while WYS is out.  I already asked about it on the list-serve and you can’t.  I deploy two Patrol Crafts and I use one to move the Ralltiir Freighter captain to the Tattoine DB.  Josh follows him with the Undercover Spy.  I then move Han and Luke to the Cantina and use the landspeed of the Ralltiir Freighter Captain to move back to the Spaceport Docking bay.  Now his undercover spy is blocking nothing.  He moves the Emperor and Janus to the Spaceport Docking Bay with Tempest 1 and breaks the cover of his spy and moves him over to the Emperor and Janus.  On my turn I deploy another Wedge and a Palace Raider inside the Patrol Craft right in front of the Emperor and Janus and I move out Han and Luke to the Tattoine DB and put Han in the Patrol Craft.  Both Josh and I know that I have a Don’t Get Coc.ky in my lost pile.  If he battles me I will react to his site with the Patrol Craft and draw 6 destinies.  So he builds up his forces there while I am draining him.  He finally flips his objective by amassing guys at the Spaceport Docking Bay.  I put Chewie Protector at the Cloud City Docking Bay and Josh puts U-3Po to join him.  Then I put Melas, Talon Karrde, and a Ralltiir Freighter Captain at the Home 1 docking bay and move them to the Coruscant DB.  I have been eyeing that drain of three at the Coruscant Imperial Square all game.  He deploys Mara Jade with Saber to the Cantina and I move Han and Luke into the Cantina.  I also move Wedge and Palace Raider to the Tattoine docking bay.  I move my Coruscant boys to the imperial Square.  Josh gets his drain of 3 on me at the docking bay and moves Mara out to join my two wimps.  I then battle Mara and draw my 3 battle destinies to kill her for good.  I then play Old Ben to save both characters and move them in front of the Emperor and Janus again.  Then I move Han and Luke back out to the Tattoine Docking Bay to sit in the Patrol Craft.  Josh tries to follow me to Coruscant with some walkers but my two battle destinies kill him off.  I get that drain of three at the Imperial Square.  I move Han and Luke over to the Emperor’s site and leave a wimp alone at the Tattoine docking bay so that Josh can’t run away with the emperor.  He battles me and I play Don’t Get @#$%.y from the lost pile.  He loses everything but the Emperor.  That was pretty much game.
<br/>
I win by +27 
<br/>
After this game I feel like throwing up.  Josh is a tough competitor and playing him has made me flustered.  I am really feeling weak now.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game Five: Graham Neal 
<br/>
My WYS versus Graham’s Brangus Glee superstar
<br/>
Graham tells me that his deck has about a 60% chance of beating my WYS deck and that he hates playing against it.  I start WYS with Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Aim high.  He starts SYCFA with IAO, Mob Points, and Battle Order.  He starts Battle Order because he knows it hurts me.  He might have done that against all his other opponents too but he has played against my deck before and knows that I am weak in space.  He deploys the Death Star:Warroom and gets out Weekulmui.  I think that he made a Tie deck to counter my WYS deck.  I Nar Shadda Wind Chimes to get a Palace Raider.  So on my turn I deploy the Home 1 Docking Bay and get a Palace Raider at the Death Star DB with a Patrol Craft and Tallon Karde at the Tattoine DB for the first turn flip.  He puts down Dr. E and Ponda Boba at the DS docking bay but I barrier him.  On my turn I deploy Han with Blaster to the DS docking bay but he barriers him.  What a time to have no Bith Shuffle/Desperate Reach.  I deploy Draw Their Fire and battle anyway to kill Dr E and Ponda Boba.  On his turn he draws.  I move Han to the Ds Warroom to get a proper drain going.  He deploys First Strike and Boba Fett with Blaster comes down.  I barrier him and this time Graham has a grabber for my barrier.  On my turn I deploy Luke with Saber to the DS Warroom and battle.  He plays Put All Sections On Alert to cancel Luke’s game text.  I draw destiny anyway and Boba Fett dies but not before taking Han with him.  Luke is left alone.  On his turn Sim Alloo comes down to the Warroom and Arica joins Karrde at Tattoine.  He battles my Luke and I lose 2 while he retrieves 2.  I chop Sim and we clear the Warroom.  He doesn’t leave enough to move Arica on my turn.  So I move Karrde to the Spaceport docking bay and draw.  Graham spends his next turn drawing.  I deploy Melas into the cantina and draw.  Graham puts down Vaderw/saber at the Cantina and battles Melas.  He chops him and I play Heading For The Medical Frigate from the lost pile so I only have to lose a couple and he loses Vader.  I deploy the Outrider to the Spaceport DockingBay and fly Tallon Karrde and a Ralltiir Freighter Captain up to Tattoine System.  For his turn Graham deploys Sienar Fleet Systems and deploys the Emperor’s Hand to the DS Docking Bay.  I use my last barrier on it and stack it on the grabber.  On my turn I battle his ship to retrieve two and he loses two.  Graham deploys Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to battle at Tattoine and I lose Tallon Karde.  He also breaks Arica’s cover.   I deploy Wedge and another Tallon Karde to battle her and I get Dash to the Outrider.  I battle at both places and Graham loses everything from the table.  Graham is using Put All Sections On Alert to retrieve the two Death Star docking bays almost every turn.  He starts using his characters as hit squads because they do not stay on the table for more than a turn.  However, my smuggler’s forfeit is so high that I never have to lose more than one smuggler so I can continue to drain at every site.  I drain Graham out. +14
<br/>
Josh Grace is really mad now because I guess he tried to battle the Rancor with Blount, Leia w/Gun, Chewie Protector and General Solo and failed to kill it.  So the Rancor ate all those guys with Court of the Vile Gangster out.  Ouch.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Six: Graham Neal
<br/>
There are no other undefeated players right now so I am almost guaranteed first place.
<br/>
My Agents of the Black Sun versus Graham Neal’s EBO done RIGHT
<br/>
This is the match up I was hoping for.  Graham said that my Agents of the Black Sun deck sucked and I was dying to prove him wrong.  Here was my chance.  I start Agents of the Black Sun with IAO, Mob Points, and There Is No Try/ OE.  Graham starts the Main Power Generators with A New Secret Base.  On my turn I get out Sullust and put the Virago there.  I figure that Graham will wait to battle me until he has EBO up and running.  I move Xizor to the Docking Bay.  On his turn he gets the Hoth Warroom and the Echo Base Garrison.  He also grabs Hobbie.  He deploys Rebel Fleet.  On my turn I get my drain of two canceled by Rebel Fleet and I back the Virago up with Boba Fett and Dark Sun Fleet.  I draw.  Graham sets up and draws.  We each have about twenty cards in hand.  Graham leans forward and I get to look at his hand.  I see the green of an x-wing laser cannon.  A lot of players do this and I always look at their hands when I am given such a chance.  Sometimes they try to adjust how they are sitting and so they are more focused on moving then that they are on that they are revealing their hand to the opponent.  I am taller than Graham so if he moves his cards forward a little bit I can see them.  I am taller than most SWCCG players are too.  Anyway, I draw up looking for an Overload and I get one.  I get Imperial Decree which I deploy next turn.  He finally gets Ebo set up and deploys about 6 x-wings to battle my two ships.  He has two X-wing laser cannons.  I try to Overload one but draw a 5.  Damn.  He shoots my Virago and I play Ghhk/ Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us.  He has used all of his force so I can battle his ships without fear of the x-wing cannons.  On my turn I play First Strike and then No Escape because I know Graham has Hyper Escapes and I want to be able to cancel them.  I then deploy Boba Fett, Ig-88, another Virago, and Dengar against his fleet of x-wings.  Graham later told me that he had a barrier in his hand but didn’t use it.   I battle and draw a total of 12 in attrition and he has to lose 3 x-wings.  I lament the fact that I could not get one more in attrition to kill off another x-wing.  I move every ship to Endor so that he can’t battle them.  On his turn Graham deploys Hoth, Kashyyk, Yavin-4, and Tattoine.  He also puts Boush down to visit Xizor at the Docking Bay.  He moves an x-wing to each of system except Endor.  I control phase move Boba Fett to Tattoine and battle his lone x-wing.  He tries to Hyper Escape but I play my Rebels Won’t Escape Us to cancel it.  He then tries to play Out of Nowhere but he doesn’t have enough force.  So one x-wing dies and he loses some force.  I then move my fleet to block one of his drains.  I move Xizor to try to run from Boush but Graham had one force left to move her.  Dang.  I draw.  I have Imperial Decree set up but I am stupid and moved every ship in front of an x-wing so I don’t control two systems, only one.  Graham drains me for a total of 7.  Shoot.  I made a mistake there.  He deploys more x-wings to the vacant systems.  On my turn I control phase move Boba Fett and deploy Bossk In Hounds Tooth to one of his x-wings with the laser cannon.  I battle with Boba Fett and he Hyper Escapes to where Bossk is.  I battle with Bossk.  I draw a five and kill both x-wings.  Only now do I realize that the other x-wing shouldn&amp;#8217;t have even been in that battle.  It couldn’t have been in two battles in one turn.  This time I make sure I have control of two systems and get Imperial Decree into effect.  On his turn Graham tries to break Boush’s cover on the control phase but I ask the tourney director and he says only on the deploy phase.  Nice try.  He drains me for a measly 3 force.  On my turn I control phase move Boba Fett and deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter.   I battle a lone x-wing with Boba Fett and he reacts with the Spiral.  I Imperial Barrier the Spiral so he is still stuck in that battle with a single x-wing he plays Out Of Nowhere.  I lose Boba Fett.  I battle with Zuckuss and kill another of his x-wings.  We each have no cards in hand and few cards in life force.  After another turn of me control phase moving and battling he only has one place where he is draining me. That is my Sullust because of the x-wing with the Laser Cannon.  I only have a few force left and so I move Guri in Stinger during the control phase to battle.  I retrieve one and he loses one.  The Stinger dies.  After the game Dion says to look at Guri’s text and then I realize that the Stinger can’t even battle with Guri aboard.  Oops.  On his turn he drains me for two.  On my turn I drain him out.  I win.  Full Win+4
<br/>
<br/>
Post-Game Stuff:
<br/>
I am the only player to go undefeated so I get the Darth Vader Japanese Foil which will go on sale at Ebay and two packs of Reflections 2.  On the long drive back to the cities my nose starts running like a faucet and I need about thirty napkins to dry it.  I drop all my tournament winnings into the snow and wrecked all my Reflections 2 cards.  When I get home I really feel bad and feel like I am going to pass out.  A giant headache forms and I almost regret going to the tournament.  Then again there is no feeling like going undefeated through 6 games where you play the best players.  It was worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
