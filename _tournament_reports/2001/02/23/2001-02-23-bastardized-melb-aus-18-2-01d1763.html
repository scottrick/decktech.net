<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This is my first tourny report so if its bad please tell me where to improve so the next one will be better
<br/>
Anyway it was held in Melbourne Australia at Australia on Collins and consisted of 4 open and 4 sealed games.
<br/>
Sealed consisted of 40 common, 40 uncommon and 5 rares of black bordered premiere plus a starship from otsd.
<br/>
Pre tourny stuff.
<br/>
Well it was announced that our TD Terry was running a sealed/open event on a Sunday with the prizes as EPP leia for highest light player and EPP Vader for dark. Of course there was another prize of a lord vader, and a set of young jedi rares from the menace of darth maul. So I was hoping to go light and of course got to. For construction the TD split up a set of black border premiere and I got to use a luke skywalker, Force is strong with this one, two nabrun leids, and two surprise a$$ualts so I built it with high destiny cause we also got the reactor terminals and traffic controls as well.  Turns out Luca made it too late so he didnt get to play in it and that meant the only real competition was from Derek who managed to get Obi wan (joy!).
<br/>
As for the open Luca was sick of me playing my bastardized hunt down and wanted me to play something else so I wanted scum and got lazy so he built it for me (yay) and it looked great although he coulda put in a reactor terminal. Anyway for light I was using an untested Watch your step, which was a big mistake cause I had a few problems with it I should have stayed with the bastardized throne room deck I have which is posted. Sorry if I screw up the names I am too important and all I think about is women and no women play this game so if the names are wrong dont think I care ok(j/k).  Off to the games:
<br/>
<br/>
My Sealed light side VS Daniel Robertson dark
<br/>
Well this guy is the best player from Geelong and he traveled down to get revenge after me going there and winning the tourny undefeated so it looked to be an interesting game.  He starts with kessel and I start with Tatooine Mos Eisly seeing as I did not get the yavin war room. First turn he basically deploys a tie and gets the drain of one all game and he backed up with an ISD. Tallon rolls are dangerous so I never go there. I drop yavin:DB and bo shek at tat. he takes my docking bay and its a sorta drain race. his two my one. he then puts general tagge at tat and lets me battle of course he has a lone warrior. I battle and he plays it but I drew a six to his four total or something like that we lose it all and i play old ben and revive him so I get my drain still. He drops death star detention block and i shuttle over and I get figrin down to eisly with luke to retrieve but he doesnt last long cause he set for stuns luke and beats figrin with a imp pilot and praji he battles draws a four so his total is five and mine is one all I lose is figrin? thats odd isnt it usually figrin and about ten?. its getting close so I use my surprise assualts and make him lose four to each. nabrun over and take out a few guys clear sites and then luke makes his appearence again. I win the drain race and thats game. I win by ten

<br/>
My ls sealed vs Chris prout
<br/>
Well this is the kid of derek and he plays damn well(his young and his dad is too good so he teaches him) He starts kessel as well and takes control of that with like a tie advanced and a isd and a fighter. I get yavin iv system and take that with pops in a ywing and an xwing there. We all get people in the mos eisly and the td, luca, and stuart come and watch. they all laugh at what chris has in his hand and it turns out to be a mining droid and a mine. So I battle to get rid of most of my characters and recirculate some sixes. the mine goes off and kills kabe, a trooper and a guard. he drops the prophetess and he has her and the droid. Stuart asks me if I tracked and I go nah but some how when he does drain there his power total is one so i a$$ualt it and draw two sixes so he loses eleven my turn I track it cause I have two and put everything back he drains I do it again and he loses another eleven. I win by 20
<br/>
4(+30)
<br/>
<br/>
My LS VS Duncan from geelong.
<br/>
Well he starts the war room and basically this game is not good cause I have no force to activate not much happened and I suprise assault him for like eleven and sixteen so I win by 15
<br/>
6(+45)
<br/>
<br/>
My Ls VS Andrew leung?
<br/>
He was suppose to leave before we start and I thought that Derek would take the epp so I had to convince him to stay and he did. that was the good news. 
<br/>
Well he starts with kessel and and I start the same he dominates this game and so I am thinking I shoulda let him go eventually im running out of force and I keep 1 force active all the game so he worrys about the assualt and eventually it goes off and I take him for about 15 or something so he drains at the next site and im down low. next turn i activate one and he drains and I assualt and end the game to win by 7.
<br/>
8(+52).
<br/>
So I wait and Derek loses so I win the tourny and get a big head. epp leia is mine and I am happy. John lampe tells me he lost so I could win and I laff cause he lost to a little kid by one (he beat another in the open by 47 and the TD made him apologize cause its too bad and shows he is unfriendly)
<br/>
Anyway me and luca start a friendly game my WYS vs his Court of course I am getting creamed but then the td saves me and calls the pairings. Of course my first game is:
<br/>
<br/>
My WYS VS lucas court.
<br/>
Well we laugh like gimps and then I whine a little cause Iv lost this already.  I start with mirax and pulsar at corellia and he drops zuckuss or something and I get out rider and he loses some he gets search and destroy and ability ability ability going and i am screwed eventually he retrieves alot of his lost pile and I get beaten too a pulp and fall back to earth. loss by 27
<br/>
0(-27)
<br/>
<br/>
My MKOS VS whozzamabob? MWYHL starship stuff
<br/>
MWYHL makes me snore. he sets up wrong and it takes him a while to get his tests near done. I flip my obj turn two. he comes with jedi luke and I nsp him deploys next turn and I smack him lose an alien luke stays myo is on obj (canceled destiny) and next turn he battles and I use it again luke stays my lost pile has two cards I battle luke and he loses that and two more while my lost pile is gone and myo is in my used for forfiet. He ends up getting to test three and I win by 27.

My MKOS VS someone I dont know using an endor deck.
<br/>
Well he didnt start anything and I was thinking what the hell is he doing he gets scrubs to endor and Bubo is chowing like a dog on heat. Xizor is kicking in and he never gets a battle destiny my lost pile is empty and I cant wait to use prepared defenses used hahahahah. I win this one by 28?
<br/>
4(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
My WYS VS Marcellos(spelling? who knows who cares?)BHBM
<br/>
Well he gets the empy to cantina with ozzel so I come in with luke first turn miss the saber swing he sensed the force is strong with this one so sac is screwing me till I flip. He has no retrievel engine or protection so I give him luke put dash in front of vader at the db. he drops jquille. I portal and vader goes luke comes to daddy and jquille turns blue he loses that and eleven.Dash takes off and luke goes to cloud city., Off the edge gets me about ten back and I am still in the game but eventually he gets me and I lose by about 10
