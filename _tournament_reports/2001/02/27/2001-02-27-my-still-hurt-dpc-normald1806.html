<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">That was my worst tourney since Origins 99( 18th place)...after a my 2000 dream year, where my worst tourney was Origins where i finish 5th...i was hoping to continue this dream year by at least finishing in the top 4.
<br/>
Our trip start thursday when me, Dom and Martin Paquette left Montr√©al at 6:30 pm for this mud hole call Normal...after driving 9 hours we decide to stop in a parking slot to sleep a little, 4 hours later( and 2 hours of sleep for me) we wake up and go eat at Harveys...we all order usual stuff except for dom who want tomato slice, the waitress ask if he want something else but dom says no only tomato slice in a plate:)
<br/>
5 hours later we finally arrive at Normal and decide to get a hotel but all are booked up because there a bowling tourney and a basket ball tourney, i hate when thing like that happen. after 2 hours we finally find a hotel but we have to drive 30 min on the highway to get there:(
<br/>
After taking shower and a few hours of sleep, i want to play another ls, because iam afraid its not a good idea with all those guri flying around, but after some talk i decide to keep it since it will take people off guard
<br/>
LS = HB for activation, with 2x luke, 2x leia, 2x chewie, 1x han with 46 yeah you have read it right 46 interrupt and it can kill on turn 3.
<br/>
DS = balance MKOS, with 4x myo and 2x abyssin
<br/>
<br/>
1 game LS vs David Lankton set your course tie
<br/>
on turn 4 iam reading for the kill, he got zuckuss in boat, dengar in boat, 2x tie interceptor...i deploy frozen asset, falcon, ( get ready to see the biggest mistake ever, even a monkey with half a brain on crack woundt do a scrub mistake like that) general solo, chewie, leia, luke( of course since iam a dumbass han and chewie are piloting...yeah i know iam a scrub...come on stop laughing now. draw their fire and i attack play all the adder and draw my 14 destiny + the card that triple damage....he is about to pick up is card when he says with a big smile wait i have zuckuss all your destiny are 0, i want to shut me with a gun but nobody have one so with all my character on the table and only red card remeaning in my deck i can do nothing except insulting my self.
<br/>
FL 0(-21)
<br/>
<br/>
after that round every body talking about or ls deck since i was suppose to kill him in 10 min and dom also kill is opponent in 10 min
<br/>
<br/>
2 game DS vs a little cheater dont remember is name
<br/>
he was always looking at the card he was putting in is use pile, but i didnt matther since he was 10 years old.
<br/>
i have bad feeling have i plu no bargain on the table so he want to kill my abyssin in the sail barde and pay 20 to deploy gen solo + chewie of kashyyyk but i projective telepathy the fight and he dont have any force left
<br/>
next turn i deploy my beetdown squad andand when i initiate he have 2 force in is force pile, i look at him and says you didnt have any force left so he put them back in his reserve, so the fight continue i capture chewie and battle damage han for 28
<br/>
FW 2(+35)
<br/>
cumulative 2(+14)
<br/>
<br/>
high: winning by alot so my early lost by 21 dont hurt
<br/>
lows: playing a cheater
<br/>
<br/>
3 game LS vs dont remember is name sorry:( MKOS
<br/>
i kill him onturn five since with no bargain my character are expensive
<br/>
FW 2+30
<br/>
   4(+44)
<br/>
<br/>
4 game DS vs Zach Stenerson HB mains
<br/>
that was a close game and i made my second mistake of the day:( but that was my last:)
<br/>
he deploy is squad out side of the palace and move them in front of my abyssin and bib in the barge + he deploy frozen asset on my 25 force pile so i cannot deploy my beatdown crew and i have 6 force left in my reserve
<br/>
so during my turn i decide to not activate and i force drain during my move phase i look at my force pile and look at the barge in front of the squad and says " iam the biggest scrub in the universe i dont deserve to win anything today:("
<br/>
so he attack i lose everything + 1 force but my obj flip back( that was the first time i saw this happen)...iam mad at my self because i make stupid mistake( and iam not even tired...maybe iam a better player when i dont have a lot of sleep?)
<br/>
after a few battle and few retrieve i finally win this game by 16
<br/>
FW 6(+60)
<br/>
<br/>
5 game LS vs T.J DS MKOS skrilling
<br/>
all is card have something funny on it... but t.j have beat Dom who play the same deck as me
<br/>
i do my best but he have too many skrilling and cancel my drain of 2 every turn and have a power of 9999999999999999999999999 in the AC so he is drainning of 3 but i it could be worse is drain of 2 so iam loosing 1 a turn and he is canceling my drain with den of thieve
<br/>
after alot of turn like that iam hoping he is going to run off of skrilling but he is playing 16 so i have hard time doing damage....after a few turn he have 22 force left in is force life and i have 22 but the next turn he retrieve for 9 with abyssin and he dont have to pay for battle plan any more
<br/>
FL 6(+46)
<br/>
highs: really good game, but t.j knew how to handle my deck
<br/>
<br/>
iam now 3-2 and i blame myself for playing like a scrub
<br/>
and iam sure i dont have chance.
<br/>
<br/>
6 game DS vs Tim guzman WYS palace raider
<br/>
Tim is a good player and gave me hard time.
<br/>
We both retrieve alot and battle alot after a tough game i win it by 11 i think
<br/>
FW 8(+57)
<br/>
<br/>
i feel sorry because i didnt read the new combo card set for stun &amp; control...the old set for stun cost 2 and the new combo cost 3
<br/>
and during or game i play it like 4 time and always pay 2...i dont think it would have chance something but i still apologize(sp?) to tim
<br/>
<br/>
me and dom have both still have good chance of placing in the top 4 so we are hopping 
<br/>
<br/>
7 game LS vs Dom MKOS
<br/>
that is pure @#$%...not usual @#$%, evil one the most evil @#$% ever:(
<br/>
he have the matchup in is favor but i hope he is going to do well in top 4
<br/>
we both draw or hand and when i look at it...my eyes cant believe that the most awsome hand this deck can have
<br/>
and iam ready to kill him on turn 3 but i dont have enough force to deploy( no bargain)
<br/>
next turn iam ready but i just hope he wont deploy bad feeling have i and if he have a none shall pass i will have to kill hem in turn 5
<br/>
he activate and deploy more character to the AC and draw yeah! he dont have it
<br/>
during my turn i deploy my squad and yes he dont have none shall pass so is power is 28 + 40 of forfeit but i do a battle damage 0f 116 so he dont have enough force and die
<br/>
FW 10(+90)
<br/>
<br/>
high: winning big so i have excellent chance of making top 4
<br/>
Lows: knocking off dom...playing a friend always suck nut
<br/>
<br/>
8 game ds vs Raveling WYS raider
<br/>
Fung was not with me during this game...and the winner will be in top 4
<br/>
first turn i grab gay-lid with ac and boelo with power of ta mere
<br/>
and with a none shall pass in my hand i fell ok WRONG!
<br/>
Raveling first turn deploy wedge at the tat:db, lando with gun + f captain at the chamber battle shoot gay-lid and i can is biggest destiny
<br/>
after the battle i have nothing on table and he occupies to battle ground next turn i draw...he drain for 3 and deploy more scrubgler
<br/>
i clean one site ...he drain for 5 and deploy more and more and more...i cannot take this huge drain any long and i die
<br/>
FL 10(+70)
<br/>
<br/>
i go outside and scream my frustration out and iam very disapointed
<br/>
but @#$% happen and iam the only one to blame in my @#$%ty performance
<br/>
<br/>
T.J is the man and after playing alot of good player and wipe every body @#$% in the top 4 and win the first DPC
<br/>
Congrat you really deserve it.
<br/>
<br/>
after the tourney we go to the wall mart with the squad to have some fun but after having too much fun they call the security because some of us had open nerf gun and start shooting in the alley:)
<br/>
so we get out fast before the security catch us and after waiting outside the cop arrive and watch us.
<br/>
<br/>
we get back to the hotel and watch meet ball that @#$% is funny
<br/>
<br/>
the next day we are too tired to play in the team event and decide to leave.
