<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">TR coming at you from Warmasters in Pleasanton, located in
<br/>
Northern California.  22 people showed for Carl "Mike"
<br/>
Hardy’s tournament.  I was using EBO for light starting
<br/>
Battle Plan, Insight, &amp; Wise Advice (deck listed on my 
<br/>
member page).  For dark I used Court starting Mob Pts, No 
<br/>
Bargain, &amp; POTH (but I varied my starting effects a little).
<br/>
The Court deck is modified from the version on my member
<br/>
page, but its similar.  
<br/>
<br/>
If its been a bad day for you, you should read this because 
<br/>
you can laugh at how bad a day it was for me.  But it was 
<br/>
still fun.  If it hasn’t been a bad day for you, you can 
<br/>
laugh and say how its good that days like this one don’t
<br/>
happen to you.  It was a 6-game tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. Matt ??’s AITC Chandra-fans
<br/>
<br/>
I deploy Kuat (for activation only) using Mob Pts, then 
<br/>
deploy Xizor to the Chamber.  As expected, he pulls BoShuda
<br/>
and puts Tessek at the Pit, then moves him to the Chamber so
<br/>
as not to lose 1 to Court.  I pull the Barge and deploy an
<br/>
ORS on it, move Xizor over.  I get Hutt Influence ’cuz he’s
<br/>
got Bargaining Table out now.  I head over to Tat DB (which
<br/>
I pulled), and get more activation.  So we both draw and 
<br/>
deploy....then he deploys a sandwhirl and moves it to the DB
<br/>
to make my guys go missing.  Then I inform him that they are
<br/>
safe at a DB since it is interior.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so sandwhirl goes lost, he deploys a skiff w/ANH 
<br/>
Chewie w/ his bowcaster and some Chandra-fans.  I deploy 
<br/>
Mara w/saber &amp; Dr E, then move the Barge over with J’Quille
<br/>
&amp; Jodo, while leaving some guys to drain at the DB.  So 
<br/>
during his turn I Disarm &amp; operate on Chewie (the barge is
<br/>
safe now), he deploys EPP Luke to kill 2 guys at the DB.  I
<br/>
have Zuckuss (w/an ORS), Dengar, &amp; Bossk in ships at Tat, he
<br/>
deploys Home One, Hass’n, and Thaneespi and battles.  I lose
<br/>
an ORS, he loses it all when I draw a 6 &amp; 4 for destiny.
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I set up Scum w/an ORS in the Chamber, and take
<br/>
control of all Tat sites except Pit of Carkoon.  If I had
<br/>
setup Occupation it would’ve been much quicker, but Chandra-
<br/>
fans suck, especially since he never got Kabe to the 
<br/>
Chamber.....and he never flipped.  Win by 32.  2(+32)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Taking out Home One so fast.
<br/>
Worst: Not getting Scum until late game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs John Monroe’s Hunt Down (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, he starts Decree once he sees EBO.  He gets Vader &amp;
<br/>
Tarkin out 2nd turn to the DS DB, I get ANSB 2nd turn.  He
<br/>
drops Tempest 1, Emp, Janus &amp; Sim to the North Ridge, moves
<br/>
them to the Generators.  I drop Iceboy in Rogue 1 to the
<br/>
North Ridge to flip him back.  We both lose to Visage all 
<br/>
game, I lose a bunch of xwings from my hand (i don’t want to
<br/>
lose EBO to Visage or a drain).  At first he couldn’t get
<br/>
Decree going, but later he just kept dumping guys on Hoth &amp;
<br/>
moving them in (so they couldn’t be Ice Stormed).
<br/>
<br/>
He also had mad force activation, so he was paying for 
<br/>
drains while I was draining for free.  Later he got Bossk
<br/>
in space, but he died after 1 turn.  Then Zuckuss came out
<br/>
late game, after he had cancelled my Incom Corp (my speeders
<br/>
couldn’t defend the interior sites).  I had no xwings left
<br/>
to deploy to him, so he was able to drain for free now.  
<br/>
Even though we’re both losing to Visage, I’ve deployed much
<br/>
more than him and he wins by 17.  2(+15)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Luke chilling at the North Ridge.
<br/>
Worst: Him getting Decree to work in the late game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Alfred Dong’s HDADTJ (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)
<br/>
<br/>
All I have to say is this was a repeat of last game.  I 
<br/>
finally get a signal on my 3rd turn, only to find ANSB not 
<br/>
there.  He doesn’t get Vader until 4th turn, I get ANSB on
<br/>
my 5th turn.  He deploys *only* to Hoth, nowhere else.  So
<br/>
my speeders can;t hang with all these characters.  He flips
<br/>
once Vader’s at the Ridge, but he marches vader into Hoth.
<br/>
Iceboy In Rogue 1 comes down to flip him back, then I move 
<br/>
into Hoth as well.  Luke later died, but Vader never came 
<br/>
out from the shield to flip Hunt Down.  
<br/>
<br/>
So we;re both losing to Visage, and he’s got Decree locked. 
<br/>
I can’t defend my interior sites, the best I can do is 
<br/>
deploy Boushh to block a drain.  I find out he’s got no
<br/>
ships, but I’ve already deployed too much and I lose by 14.
<br/>
2(+1)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: None, except maybe keeping Hunt Down on the 0 side
<br/>
Worst: Letting him set up Decree.  Couldn’t stop him.....
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Shawn Ely’s WYS (Squassin, Battle Plan, ??)
<br/>
<br/>
I thought this game was locked.  I had never lost to Shawn’s
<br/>
WYS deck, and never came close to losing.  He played much 
<br/>
better this time.  He converts my Chamber &amp; gets BoShuda 
<br/>
there.  I deploy the Barge and a couple aliens aboard.  He 
<br/>
drops Artoo and plays a Gift, so I’m gonna be hurtin’ in 
<br/>
battle destiny.  He deploys some guys to the Cantina and 
<br/>
drains me for a while.  He gets Pulsar &amp; Outrider to 
<br/>
tatooine, I deploy some ships to the DB then move up Dengar,
<br/>
Bossk, Zuckuss, &amp; Jabba’s Cruiser w/ORS &amp; Brangus piloting.
<br/>
<br/>
After a couple turns, he clears me out of Tatooine and sets
<br/>
up Celebration.  I’m paying for cheap drains, he’s draining 
<br/>
for free.  I close the differential gap when I Elis a crew
<br/>
over to the cantina where I exclude all but 1 Ralltiir 
<br/>
Captain and he takes like 15 battle damage.  Now I’ve got
<br/>
like 8 cards left, he’s got 5.  A couple turns later, time
<br/>
runs out.  Lose by 11.  His celebration had 
<br/>
retrieved 9 force for him.  2(-10)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Showdown in the Cantina.
<br/>
Worst: Losing my space fleet.  1st time WYS has beaten my 
<br/>
space fleet.  Because of that, he got celebration.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs Tim Greene’s AOTBC (starts POTF)
<br/>
<br/>
He gets the 1st turn flip and deploys Guri to Xizor.  I lose
<br/>
some force, then get Luke &amp; Hobbie in Rogue 4 to the North
<br/>
Ridge to flip him back.  Later, EBO is up and running.  He
<br/>
drops Jodo w/blaster rifle to Rogue 4 and shoots....he draws
<br/>
a 4, which barely hits the speeder, making Luke &amp; Hobbie die
<br/>
in flames.  He Ghhkks the damage.  He’s losing a lot to 
<br/>
drains in space though, so he puts Virago &amp; Stinger to block
<br/>
2 different drains.  Well, he’s probably got Ghhkk, so I 
<br/>
don’t overdeploy to beat them down.  No Ghhkk!!  Damn, I
<br/>
Should’ve deployed more.  Anyways, he still loses about 20
<br/>
force altogether and the next turn the drains kill him.  Win
<br/>
by 27.  4(+17)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Beating down Virago &amp; Stinger.
<br/>
Worst: Jodo shooting a maneuver 6 speeder.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs John Monroe’s HB Mains (Insurrection, Staging
<br/>
Areas, ??)
<br/>
<br/>
This is a rematch from last tourney, where my Sarlacc ate 
<br/>
his Jedi Luke and EPP Leia and I won big.  Not this time.
<br/>
I deploy Jabba to the Chamber, he drops EPP Obi there.  Not
<br/>
enough force to battle though.  I drop a Merc Pilot for 1, 
<br/>
Snoova for 1, get his ax and capture Obi, flip. Nothing much
<br/>
happens except he gets Falcon w/Capt. Han &amp; EPP Leia aboard
<br/>
at Tatooine.  He OMDH to Alderaan for 9 force.  Oh no...I 
<br/>
can’t pull my ships when Court is flipped.  So I finally
<br/>
feed Obi and its looking good for me again.
<br/>
<br/>
Many of my ships are lost though, so I give up on Tatooine.
<br/>
Its his system, so its only a drain of 1.  Now he’s got
<br/>
Jedi Luke, Lando w/ax, Corran, and my U-3PO that he stole
<br/>
w/Corran at his spaceport DB.  I have Xizor, Mighty Jabba,
<br/>
4-LOM, Boelo, and Snoova there and battle.  He weapon lev’s
<br/>
the ax away, fallen portal on 4-LOM, clashes Xizor, 
<br/>
excludes Boelo, swings and hits Snoova and I’m left with 
<br/>
Jabba &amp; Snoova (who is forfeit = 0) so I lose like 15 force.
<br/>
He drew a 5 &amp; 6 for destiny, IIRC, while I drew a 1.  I’m
<br/>
still draining for more though.
<br/>
<br/>
Later, I think I’ve won when he’s down to 2-3 force, I’ve 
<br/>
got 7-8, but he OMDH again for 9.  Shortly thereafter, time
<br/>
runs out.  Another timed loss for my dark.  Lose by 12.
<br/>
4(+5)
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Eating Obi-Wan (the Sarlacc did, that is).
<br/>
Worst: The showdown at the spaceport DB.  Disastrous.
<br/>
<br/>
You know, even though I did poorly, I still won because I
<br/>
traded for some really good stuff.  I was so happy about my
<br/>
trades I think I got a little distracted (I just need to 
<br/>
make excuses on why I lose!).  Well, it was my worst
<br/>
tourney ever, and I got a R2 pack with nothing great in it.
<br/>
<br/>
But still, it was fun and hopefully you enjoyed reading it.
<br/>
Now I need to remember how to win games again........Mike </font></td>
