[Pre-tourney]
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so Saturday finally rolls around (its been a long week for me) and I dont really have any decks to play.  Ive dabbled in Court a little bit and still have my Hidden Mains. I playtested them both against eachother and they did ok. The Court usually squeezed out by a little bit.  I was thinking of using Watch Your Step, cause apparently its nails, but that deck just makes me feel somewhat vulnerable. So Im off to SilverKing Comics with a Court deck and Hidden Base Mains. Blah.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Pairings are set and we get underway....
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 - My Dark vs. Jamie Abels [1912] Obis Hut Mains
<br/>
<br/>
Great, first game and Im going against Jamie. Im starting No Bargain, TiNT/Op. Enforcement, and Power of The Hutt. He starts Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Strike Planning.  First turn I get Mighty Jabba and Ephant to Audience Chamber. He pulls his 2 Generals, Madine and Solo, and I drop JP from hand, go for Lower Passages and I got all
<br/>
my sites out first turn :-) He activates, deploys Tatooine DBay, loses to Court and draws for a while. I drop Scum and Boelo to AC and draw some. He finally does something and
<br/>
deploys Madine to Carkoon, pulls Geezum and moves to Hut.  Mara and Dr. E follow, battle, retrieve 2. Swing at Madine....1...2.....wouldnt have made a difference. He
<br/>
jumped the gun and played Swing and a Miss, but took it back cause it wasnt enough anyway....he loses Madine and Dr E bites is, who gets nail by an Out of Commission. Oh
<br/>
well. So he continues to draw and stuff while losing to a Obi Hut drain of 4 and 1 at the AC. I drop Snoova and Ax to Dbay where Geezum is, he gets a Barrier, move Mara over.
<br/>
He drops Ben and Gen Solo to Hut and drops a Soro Suub and moves Geezum away. Im still going around draining, and he is now too. He deploys Harc Seff and is like cancelling all of my drains, and apparently Hutt Influence doesnt prevent that. :-(  After a few battles he gets me and drops Order To Engage and moves to meet up with Jodo and Mosep...a very non interactive game with him tracking and retrieving every turn using Figrin.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 23
<br/>
<br/>
0 (-23)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Blah
<br/>
Lows: Losing
<br/>
Props: Jamies a good sport and really fun to play against.
<br/>
<br/>
Time to climb up the Ladder of Jizz
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - Light vs. Joe Shnaudts [1500] Bring Him Before Me
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, its this kids first tournament ever and some guy gave him a Bring Him Before Me deck to play with. Most of the game Im telling him what to pull and what pretty much
<br/>
most of his cards to, and I remind him to force drain, cause I mean, theres no point in me just beating this kid. I would rather help him out than feel bad about it afterwards. He put up a decent fight. We both get set up and drops Emperor and Sim Aloo to D*2 Dbay and draws. I get Luke, Rebel Scout (Yea, I play with one, just cause of BHBM) and his saber to Endor: Dbay and put the pressure on him to be captured. He sets up some Royal Guards and Pikes and moves them over with Sim Aloo to my Cloud City: Dbay. I draw, drop Ben and his saber to Tatooine: Dbay and Chewbacca Protector to Endor:Dbay. He deploys Lord Vader, Darths Saber (yea, the crappy one), captures Luke, deploys Snoova, cant find the Ax, he battles, hits Chewbacca, but doesnt make him forfeit 0, so he covers everything. Then I relocate them both to Throne Room. My turn I drop DOS, EPP
<br/>
Han, and Orrimarko....Ya, I know I shouldnt but its like the 8th turn and we have 15 minutes left. I start tracking and playing On the Edge to boost my differential. I beat
<br/>
Snoova for alot and my drains do him in and so does his flipped objective.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 38
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+15)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won and helped out a new player with the game instead of murder him from turn one.
<br/>
Lows: Not many actually. 
<br/>
Props: Joes a cool guy. I think he will turn out a pretty good player, if he uses his own decks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - My Light vs. Lee Fisks [1503] Agents of the Black Sun
<br/>
<br/>
Man, this was an Old Fashioned Star Wars game here folks and Ill tell you why at the end of the game detail. He starts by deploy Coruscant Dbay and Emperor there. I deploy
<br/>
Tato: Dbay and Endor: Dbay from hand. He activates and draws for a while deploy some locations. I drop Lando with Ax and Tawss Khaa to Tatooine to put some pressure on him. He deploys like 2 Makurths and Jodo to Tat and moves Xizor there and flips. My turn I put down some cards to start tracking with and deploy Jedi Luke with his Saber and flip him back, move the Tatooine crew to Endor and swallow his drain of 1. He then drops like 2 Vigos, Bane Malar, and Snoova to Endor, doesnt battle, moves his people over. I drop Daughter and Anis saber, Ben and saber to Tat, EPP Han to Endor with Chewie Protector, move Ben over and let him go. He battles, uses 1 to Scream with Makurth, tries to Hidden Weapons Luke, draws a 1. I slice up Xizor, Snoova, and Bane, play Gift of the Mentor....my destinies were the ones I tracked 6 6 5 5...I end up with 60 to his 44, so he has to almost clear his site, except for Jodo and a Makurth I think. So I track the 6s back around play On the Edge twice, retrieve my lost pile and let him go. He knows the game is over either way so he battles my crew and ends the game. THIS was old fashioned Star Wars CCG. You get all your people at one location, Ill get all my people at one location and we battle till one of us dies :-)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win By 40
<br/>
<br/>
4 (+55)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won.
<br/>
Lows: None really.
<br/>
Props:...Lee....you bought a case of R2 and you still suck....I guess the cards dont make the player after all eh? ;-)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lunch! Head on over to Subway like I always do, get a footlong Subway Melt and 2 Chocolate Chip Cookies, but the guy somehow conned me into 3 Cookies...oh well.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - My Dark vs. Chris Treventhans [1454] There is Good in Him
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is so unfair for Chris. We played this exact matchup, with the same decks last week. Oh well. Forgive me for this short detail it was a non interactive game. I get Mighty Jabba and Ephant to AC, drop Mosep and Gailid, Fett and Dr E to Carkoon cause I *know* he wont come to Tatooine, so hes losing to Court and mad drains. He sets up
<br/>
Captain Han and General Lando in GS1 at Kessel, but I pull Virago from deck, deploy Xizor in it, Zuckuss in Mist Hunter follows and he loses a couple. He deploys Dash in
<br/>
Outrider, I Set for Stun Captain Han, so he still doesnt get a destiny. He forgets to reduce my power and he loses the Falcon. I eventually beat off Dash and I do him in with drains and Court damage.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 18
<br/>
<br/>
6 (+73)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won again.
<br/>
Lows: We knew how this game would end.
<br/>
Props: Chris isnt a sore loser, and hes a hell of a bargainer when it comes to trading.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 - My Light vs. Blair Franklins [1638] CCT w/ Jabbas Prize
<br/>
<br/>
Crap. He took Han. First turn he gets Lando to Prison and follows up with Lobot...damn. I get started and draw for a while but he keeps Monnoking my damn hand to used pile. I
<br/>
drop Daughter and Yoxgit to AC and start the drains there, while Guri is on her way to deliver Hansicle. I dont have any way of releasing him :- Oh well, Im about to play
<br/>
Choke on Lobot, replace with Lando w/ Ax and deploy Corran and beat the crap out of Lobot when he deploys Ephant ...damn you Blair Franklin, damn you. So I drop Ben to
<br/>
AC, move my crew over. He Force Lightnings Ben and Dengar hits him with a 1 ..a freakin 1....(YCHF is out) Ouch. So we rumble a little more and hes retrieving one a turn with me doing some On the Edges, eventually he squeezes out a win.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 11
<br/>
<br/>
6 (+62)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Losing to Blair is ok with me. Hes a cool guy and good player.
<br/>
Lows: I lost to Blair :-)
<br/>
Props: Blair......
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 - My Dark vs. Blair Franklins [1683] AITC Speeders
<br/>
<br/>
Yipee. Speeders are kind of easy to beat if you know what to do. (No offense Blair). So I start off with Ephant and Mighty Jabba and Scum out turn 1. He activates, deploys some
<br/>
sites, and loses to Court. He tried to Signal for Honor, but the 3 force he used for The Signal contained the Honor. Next turn I deploy Lower Passages and Cantina, Mara and
<br/>
saber go there followed by Dr. E, deploy Search &amp; Destroy and he goes. He loses a little more for Court and  S &amp; D. He finally gets Owen &amp;  Beru to Farm, then drops like 1
<br/>
Sandspeeder at each site. Xizor and Dengar drop on 2 Rebel Speeders, he Houjixs while Im retrieving with Scum. He then beats down on them for like 30, but they cover all but
<br/>
4 overflow. So now its a drain race with my winning it.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win By 13
<br/>
<br/>
8 (+75)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Sweet, I beat Blair.
<br/>
Lows: Acting like a wuss against a speeder deck, but hey, thats how ya have to play sometimes.
<br/>
Props: Blair....
<br/>
<br/>
