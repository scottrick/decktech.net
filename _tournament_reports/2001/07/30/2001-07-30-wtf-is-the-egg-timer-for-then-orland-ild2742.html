<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well I see everyone wrote about the Joliet report I will not bore anyone buy telling my very unimpressive 3-3 job at that place.  Main thing kupe extends his wins over me by like plus two so aganist him in tourney play it is like 0-9 life time.  Other than that the tourney was normal.  Here it goes then.  Saturday night after the tourney we decide to play spades because i’m back in town for the weekend.  The hutt and a few of my D+D friends go to big burger first and then we hit the booze store.  It is like 45 + dollars in booze then we go to Mikey’s for the spade playing.  Well I drink way to much and spend the night in drunk mode.  The hutt drive my car to the mall to get his car at around 12:30am.  Half way to the mall I say pull over and guess what...throw up like three time about 300ft from a cop who had someone pulled over.  Well we get to the mall and I drive home and spend the next three hours puking and poping a blood vessel in my eye.  Yes Ron there is blood in the whites of one eye right now.  The mourge kids where loving it by making fun of day two of the hang over.  Well I wake Sunday morning at 9:06am WTF I have like 24 min. to get dressed and to Ron’s just to make it to this tourney.  I’m drunk and I can’t talk from to acid that f ucked up my vocal cords but wars makes the man so I go in the same clothes that I wore Saturday night,and to top it all off there is puke on my pants. WTF.  Well I get there and take much verbal abuse from the Jtown homies.  It is Ron,Brian,Olson,and me to the Orland park tourney.

Games:  Today I’m going to play Odds and Pods for the dark side and Lewis HBX for the lightside with some small meta choices for Franks TIE bombers.  I hate Bombers because the beat everything by blowing up interior sites.  Anyway remember that these games are under a hangover and I still did good.
<br/>
<br/>
Game1:  Mike Stock’s vs. Odds and pods
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hate pod racing so much that I had to race for both sides today.  Joe would be happy both sides are useing racers and f racing interupts.  In the end I win, he plays It could be worse, i play it’s worse and after two failed senses he looses the race for 21!  Pods are gay.  He has ben abd Jk with sticks at the tat DB draining for four to vaders two at the CC DB.   He moves them over and someone like me because I blind choke Ben and play I have you now on Jk for 14 attrion. I redeploy vader and finish the game off with just Han and Vader on the table.  He did steal Vaders stick twice with weapon lev though.
<br/>
Fw 2 I forget the diff ok it was hard enough playing.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : mike stock’s cct vs. HBX
<br/>
<br/>
This was another bs pod race that took an hour the finish with but both of us did like fifty mistakes and I drunk cheated and he forgot that sebalba could cancel my race destiny and I win by like two.  he really won and I feel really bad because I was all my fault.
<br/>
Fw 4
<br/>
<br/>
Game three: Frank A. Night of the living TIE bombers vs. HBX
<br/>
<br/>
This game made me the most mad I have ever been in the game we play and are draining battling and retrieveing when I hear the egg timer go off on franks turn.  I still get a turn and place Bonta oop to retireve four and one for I did it!  i count I have fourteen to his 10 or 12 but Olson says we will finish the game out. I’m f ucking pissed and ask anyone who was there, THROW the HBX deck across the room with two foil Jk’s in it.  i walk away to pick up my deck and my self respect leting Olson know how I feel with some choich words.  
<br/>
Fl -20 4+ some thing
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  Frank A WYS vs. Odds and Pods
<br/>
I win the race he plays It could be worse I play it’s worse he plays it’s a hit to cancel it.  He looses 11 and then 19 to inserts in the next two or three turns and vis is killing him.  After like three turns of being flipped he plays ooc to cancel vis and I still after all the gay interrupts he plays win by like 3
<br/>
Fw 6(+6)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well I hope you all rate this good and forgive me for losing my head and being a @#$% but what is the egg timer for then any ways Olson?  see you’all in a Few.  And remember skin slip is a sign of decomposition.  It sucks to fix it believe me. </font></td>
