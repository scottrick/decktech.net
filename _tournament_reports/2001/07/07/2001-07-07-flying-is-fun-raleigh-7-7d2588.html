<br/>
Pre Tournament Crap: 
<br/>
Well the day of the tournament my family was supposed to be in the mountains, but my Dad&amp;#8217;s nice enough to wake up at 5 AM and drive me back to Raleigh. 
<br/>
	My decks are: light side: my tosche station deck that can be viewed on my page, updated with Tatooine cards.
<br/>
	There&amp;#8217;s a story that goes a long with my dark deck. I start making a hunt down, and it really sucks, it lacks the things that hunt downs need (Maul, x2 Visage, Executer: DB, ect). I think an Mkos deck with, only a few non-uniques to flip and just alien smack down with scum. So I give a call to the closest comic book shop from where I live (20 min away). I ask if they have any JPOTSDs he says &amp;#8220;Uh&amp;#8230; yeah&amp;#8221; so I convince my Mom to drive me all the way to Boone. When I get there I look around some and, see some cool swords. I ask the dude at the desk if the have the JPOTSD and he hands me a box of plain JP, and I&amp;#8217;m like this isn&amp;#8217;t the sealed deck, and he&amp;#8217;s like oh, and I&amp;#8217;m like you said you had one, and he&amp;#8217;s like hold on. So he gets the guy in charge, and he says &amp;#8220; See these are the &amp;#8216;core decks&amp;#8217; (as he points to the starter decks) and these are the expantions (as he points to the JP packs, there&amp;#8217;s no such thing as a JPSD&amp;#8221;. And so I&amp;#8217;m like I bought one. Well I couldn&amp;#8217;t get my hands on MKOS in time so I go with my POC hunt down.
<br/>
<br/>
The day of: I wake up at 5 AM with my Dad and start back to Raleigh for the tournament. On the way I slept some, and listened to music some. We arrive home at about 830, I check my planetarion account (planetarion is about the best online RPG, go to planetarion.com and join), and checked out some decks on decktech. Then I call some of my swccg friend, they were all asleep or late for something, so I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m going in alone.&amp;#8221; We arrive at the store at about 940. It opens at 10. So I go to the near-by Wal-Mart and buy some really cool shoes. 
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament:  24 people show up, that&amp;#8217;s a lot more than I imagined. I pay my entry fee, and start trying to do some trades, the pairings come up too quickly. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My Crap Hunt Down vs. Jeremy Woolard&amp;#8217;s (1500) crazy alderaan operatives.
<br/>
He starts goo ney tey which really pisses me off because now I can&amp;#8217;t flip first turn. I activate pull D* DB, and we both lose to visage. He deploys a site with his objective  and a hydroponics station with the farm he started with, he draws up, we lose to visage. I can&amp;#8217;t really remember the next few turns, but he tries to flip with lone ops, I tell him the operative rule. Then I flip. The rest of the game was pretty much me showing off the power of 4-LOM, and how much fun killing operatives is. 
<br/>
FW 2(+27)
<br/>
Good: Winning with a total piece of crap.
<br/>
Bad: I won by too much, now it is my destiny to play someone really good.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 Tosche vs Adam Weinstein The State Champion&amp;#8217;s (1810) fun BHBM
<br/>
I knew it, the state champ, crap. I hear him say his deck is a fun deck, and it&amp;#8217;ll probally lose some. So I&amp;#8217;m like good! He starts the reg. BHBM crap, I start Tosche, careful planning for Outskirts. On his first turn he deploys Palpy to the station. I activate 5, and use outskirts to pull Ben, I&amp;#8217;m like crap I&amp;#8217;m not ganna be able to activate nothing. He sets up pretty standard for BHBM, Vader at a DB with his stick some dudes at DBs. Eventually I gather up enough force to kill old Palpy, and start some mad activation. About that time he looks for a DB but can&amp;#8217;t find one. I verify his deck, my eyeballs nearly fell out of their sockets. I see like 4 ugnouts, 2 Carbon Chambers, and a few Paly&amp;#8217;s Prizes. I&amp;#8217;m like oooooookkkkkkkay. I give him Jedi Luke, and start draining some on tat. We sorta just drain for a few turns. Then he deploys like all the CF stuff and I&amp;#8217;m like uh oh, he freezes Luke, I lose 8. He puts the emporer&amp;#8217;s prize on palpy (that he redeploed to the TR). Eventually he gets vader there and makes me lose 11 to prize. We pretty much have a drain race from then on. Untill he drew a six for BHBM destiny. FL 2(+16)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: It was pretty funny getting frozen.
<br/>
Bad: I think he actually missed crossing Luke, but it was only like a 3 card diff than what it would have been.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 Tosche vs. Jonathan Rivera&amp;#8217;s (1500) CC ISB.
<br/>
I&amp;#8217;m a little worried going at the beginning of this match, I didn&amp;#8217;t think about ISB protection. I start standard crap for Tosche. He starts that bounty hunter thing and pulls boba, his gun, and a prison. On his first turn he deploys Xizor to some CC site. I do the thing with outskirts, and move obi to the station. He drops some ISB dudes, I kill them, we drain back and forth, he flips. He made one big mistake, he left a lone ORS, I naburn, kill em for like 24, game. FW 4(+44)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: Killing that ORS.
<br/>
Bad: None
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Hunt Down vs. Eddie Brown (1444) TIGIH Odds
<br/>
I start my normal stuff, he starts pods, and EBG. He gets some droids out with EGB. I get Vader out and cancel EBG with an altar, and capture Luke. He draws an Odds for pod destiny so I just deploy Palpy and 4-LOM to reduce the lose. I drain him and get so freekin scared of that odds. He deploys Obi, Leia, and Orri, he doesn&amp;#8217;t have enough to battle. I run away. He wins the podrace by like 2. Then, the turning point of the game, odds come up!!! He loses 7. I beat him down with Mara and some other people. And a big drain race starts. He loses 3 a turn, me one. I have three battlegrounds so his honor doesn&amp;#8217;t do much. I pretty much drain and Visage him out. FW 6(+54) 
<br/>
<br/>
Good: Winning, making him lose to his own Odds.
<br/>
Bad: None 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 Hunt Down vs. Ryan Obman (1663) QMC
<br/>
I hate QMC. We both start standard stuff. I deploy Palpy to his Guest Quarters first turn. He deploys some 2/1 sites and Corran to the Visage place. I get vader out, and the game is looking pretty good for me. He comes down with Han with gun and SOS with stick, and beats my dudes up. He flips over QMC. He drains at the Executer some and at CC, its pretty hard to handle. I come down with a beat squad including Vader, he barriers, I battle NE way. I have to lose all my dudes. Next turn he beats up Vader like its no one&amp;#8217;s business. He drains some more. That&amp;#8217;s game. FL 6(+20).
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6 Tosche vs. Chris Harmon (1637) Blow Away SYC
<br/>
I&amp;#8217;m like okay, you win, cuz my deck like totally sucks against SYC. But I decide not to give up, he could be like horrible at making SYC decks or something. I set up with Qui at the station with his stick draining 2. I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find NE of my spies, but I make some trouble with Luke and Obi at the D* . He sets up some space and is draining like 4 a turn. I finally get a Corran Horn into my hand along with a Twass Khaa  and Liea with gun, I drop them at a site where he has two gunners. BOOM ones hit, the other dead to attrition. He tries to kill me with a Mara and Vader running around, no success at killing them. He tries to blow alderaan up, with one gunner, he gets a total 9, but wait! I control his D* weird site, -1 for him!!!! NO FLIP!!!! AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!! I get my drain 2 tat site out  and move Qui over there, and I drain at the death star. And have a whole crap loada fun with Naburns. FW 8(+42)
<br/>
<br/>
Good: I BEAT THE ODDS AND KILLED A SYC BLOW AWAY!!!!!
<br/>
Bad: None
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Post Tourney:
<br/>
I place 8th out of 24, one of my best placings ever. I get a Big MWYHL and a D*2 pack that has a Green Squad 3 in it. I hang around and make a huge trade for one of my Palpies.
