<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, it had been 5 weeks since I had been to a tourney.yes, you heard me right. 5 WEEKS!!! I was about to pass outits not like I haven’t been playing cards. My friends and I get together almost every night of the week and play cards.it’s just there is something about tourneys, and I know you understand what I’m saying if you have ever been to a tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I brought the 2 decks I built maybe a week or so ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Light Side: QMC Nexis Style with some of my own added tech and on the edges
<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side: BHBM Sith Podracing with heavy Siths (4 vaders, 2 mauls, 2 maras, 2 palpys)
<br/>
<br/>
I threw in Guri to deal with WYS, because Burger is playing WYS every time I come up to Toronto. 
<br/>
<br/>
So it was Friday and I was at my friend James’ house me, him Andy and Kyle were over playing cards, when Andy phones his dad to see if we can get a ride to the tourney (I’m 16) and don’t have my g2. his dad agrees to drive us (thank goodness) and so the next day we head down to Toronto. I lent Andy a crap load of stuff for his Light Side Pile, while he lent me a Palpatine. It was just me and Andy due to space in the car. So andy arrives at my house to pick me up 20 mins late but hey at least I’m getting a ride! We get stuck in a traffic jam on the way into Toronto (what a surprise!) so we show up at Nexus X on Bathhurst and Bloor (right beside the world famous Honest Ed’s!!! lol). We get there at 12:50 or so. And the tourney begins at 1:00pm. We run over to McDonalds and try to get the quickest lunch possible. I end up getting the slow, (I’m new and I’m trying) lady who is confused when I tell her to shake up my quarter pounder meal. Its some thing at McDonalds on right now where for an extra 59 cents you can get a milk shake in stead of your drink. So I scarf down my food in like 3 minutes and we run back over to Nexus. We get their 5 after and we say hi to Andrew liu and the rest of the Toronto crew who actually recognize us. So we wait around for a while I buy 2 packs of reflections 2 and I pull mostly jankI do get a General Calrissian foil but that’s about it so onto the tourney.

Game 1: My Sith BHBM Podracing (1651) vs. Andrew Meyer’s (1645 or so) copy of Lingrell’s rebel strike team. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, from the second I saw this matchup I knew I would win, as my dark eats RST for breakfest. James plays this deck and I do not recall when I haven’t beat a RST deck by less than 20. Anyway I pull out palpy and deploy my main man down to the landing site to cancel his gametext there. Did I mention I start Bad Feeling Have I, so I knew he would be taking a while to set up and by then I would rule the bunker with an iron fist. He activates, deploys Ou Nee TayAlter (he has no protection) altered. I love sense and alter maybe i should change by name to Spencer Sense Alter. Its catchy. Anyway I deploy sim aloo soon afterand he follows with the bunker and blount, g solo, and Orrimako. So next turn I activate count my force and see that I have 12 or so. I pull out my best friend elis helrot, I draw a zero. So Empys mother drops Empy and Simpson Aloo. Off at the bunker. Than Empy’s best friend Darth Vader comes down to join empy, I deploy his saber on him. And add Ponda Babba/Dr. E to the crew. I intiate battle, swing at Orrimako hit him, operate and draw 2 destiny a 4 and a 5 sweet. Add 1 to each with vader so that’s a 5 and a 6my power is 30 he draws a 6. damn, and then his power is 13 he forfeits all and looses a few overflow I lose mr. Simpson (ALOO). I deploy maul to the podrace arena, oh yah he won the podrace after drawing 5’s and 6’s for every draw. Anyway maul is draining and I am draining for 1 with the saber at the bunker. And slowly he is hurting. He comes down with Jedi Luke and Owen and Beru to the back door. Vader says hi to his owen, and asks him how life is being force-attuned. And owen replies, please don’t hurt me. And then dr. evazan starts @#$%ing at luke. Anway I move vader and baba &amp; doc over to there site. Next turn, he sits there knowing his time is coming soon. By this time he has lost plenty to battles, drains and me sensing and altering most of everything. At one point in the game he starts up the out of commission engine from a luke and beru drain, the turn before I move vader over. He was hoping to out of commission vader and then somehow kill him off the board to avoid every seeing the coolest kid in school again (vader). So I sense it and grab itdone and done. Wow, grabbers are great and well senses are better. I never saw another out of commission for the rest of the game. Though he did loose 5 or so to drains and overflow. Anyway, next turn Mara comes down to join vader and ponda &amp; doc to help the beating of the nerds. I initiate battle swing at luke, hit him and operateand that’s game he packs up as he knows that the I will most likely hit beru and owen and then beat him by over 20 in that battle and he has about 5 life force left. I count my life force.FW +22.
<br/>
<br/>
2(+22)
<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: Complete Domination, sensing, altering, grabbing and sensing, elising for free, operating quite a few times.
<br/>
<br/>
Low’s: Not winning the Podrace.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My QMC Ball Style (1651) vs. Quoc Phan’s Build the Death Star II (1635)
<br/>
<br/>
I get said up fast start draining him for a ton and retrieving. He starts the building. Mid game DVDLOTS comes down to cloud city for a whileI kill him after a turn or two. I also saw Maul part way through have a little tour of Cloud City. Mostly a draining race till he finished building and he moved the death star 2 over to bespin ... (I could just see the death star 2 coming to cloud city."talk about a civil disorder!". So I have Outrider, Dash, Falcon, Captain Han, Red Squad 1, DS2 Wedge. He deploys down. Some named ties with matching pilotslike all those death star 2 tech ties. Like baron sootir fel or whatever. Anyway I was feeling good till he put sfs cannons down. And intiates battle. He pays 3 and hits the outriderits lost. Then he plays all these little interrupts and wins the battle when he draws a 4 and a 5 for destiny. His ties are immune to attrition from the interrupt (the dark side version of organized attack, except for ties). Anyway. I forfeit red squad 1 and wedge. Next turn I throw down a Intruder Missle on the falcon and initiate battle. I fire one of the ties and hit it. I play power pivot and make another one power zero. So I win this one by a few but have to loose the falcon and han to attrition while he looses one tie. I never took bespin back over. After that I drained for a quite a few while I lost tons to that operational as planned crap. And then I see DVDLOTS battle. He chokes Puccimir Thryss! Damn it! He is loosing maybe 3 from my drains after that while loose like 8. but my out draining at the beginning one me the game in a close finish at FW +6.    
<br/>
<br/>
4(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: Getting Set up so fast
<br/>
Lo’s: Letting Bespin get taken overnever underestimate the power of gay ties.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My BHBM (1651) vs. Jeff Peck’s WYS (1745)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I knew this wasn’t a good matchup from the start. His WYS is a machine and there was nothing I could do. I won the Podrace. I had a good ground force rolling. He set up in space and just waited. Now because I am not too uninformed in swccg I started bad feeling have I, even against wys. This prevented the use of the beatdown tripler. I have a bad feeling about this. So I didn’t have to worry about that. He had red squad 1 and wedge with a x-wing cannon at kessel draining, as well as red 10 and theroen nett at Tatooine with a x-wing cannon. And I knew he was playing heavy power pivots. So I stayed away for space. I had Palpatine and Guri down at the cantina. Tech. And the tech of all, DVDLOTS and his saber and Dr.E/Ponda Baba down at the Tatooine docking bay. I get out search and destroy with a smile on my face. But then he comes out with menace fades and throws down mos eisley with a couple of smugglers there to effectively put menace fades into play as well as keeping himself from loosing force to search &amp; destroy. Well wasn’t that great I move the vader crew over to battle but the just shuffles over to the cantina, and throws down a smuggler or two more to effectively overpower me at the cantina. Then I come down with mara and maul to kick @#$% at the cantina but he barriers them, and I cannot play sense because of the flipped WYS objective. I chase him around a while but he just is playing controls and then from his lost pile to cancel my drains. I chase him around for a while but there is nothing I can do so I decide to take my chances and spread out a little as he was doing the same to slow down my drains. Then he deploys like 6 smugglers down to maras location and that is game. He wins by 15. FL -11.
<br/>
<br/>
4(+17)
<br/>
<br/>
Hi’s: my teched out ground forces
<br/>
Low’s: I was just out played, nothing much more I could have done. Maybe an attempt to come to space. Damn I should not have taken that overload out of my deck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My QMC Ball Style vs. Guy I know from a Hamilton tourney (sorry I cannot remember your name)(rating of maybe 1600+ - sorry I have no idea)BHBM deck.
<br/>
<br/>
My starting hand was balls. It was that bad. I got the outrider and dash with elyhek rue on it too down to bespin. I set up and flipped. He came down with empy, vader, and one of the named royal guards with a force pike. I was retrieving away. And pathing all over the place. But he just focused everything on the ground at first and seemed to slowly kill of my guyz. When he took over the bespin system late game that really hurt. I knew I should have backed up the outrider but I couldn’t because I was too focused on keeping my guyz alive on cloud city. By the time he took over bespin I had lost most of my ships and it just wasn’t pretty. I tracked a 7 in some well timed battles on cloud city too lower the differential. This one came down way too close for comfort! FL-4.
<br/>
<br/>
So at the end I was 4(+11) (not bad considering I played 0 scrubs, and everyone I played was way more experienced than me, I have like 21 tournament games or so..) I win a pack of Endor and pull the DS landing platform FOIL radical! not. The prize support sucked, but other than that it was a good experience. And I beat two good players.
