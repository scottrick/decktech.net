Game 2 my lite vrs joe shnaduts court capture deck. 
<br/>
I start pod race but he has subablas pod and he stops me from drawing densitys when where are tied but then we forget too pod race so i end up betting him in the podrace. Mean while i have ebo set up but i dident have any systems out except kiffex which i had lost yavin 4 and hoth to drains but i retrive them and put them out. joe is sorta a begginer and does not no the power of e bo and was betting me drops zuckass in mist hunter and battles agienset my 4 x wings. i play the one card that lets me have immunty to attreion and adds on to power to my ships. + ebo and incom i bet him by a lot he loes zuckass and 20. Well he has a crappy bountey hunter with mandlorien armor so down comes qui gon he hidden wepons he draws a 2 and capturs. then he starts envadind hoth but by the time he finshes the drains are heavy and i all wings reported in i win by 30.
