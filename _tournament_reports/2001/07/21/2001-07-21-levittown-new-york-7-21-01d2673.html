<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> Let me just say this is my first TR. After reading so many here on DeckTech i noticed that word seems to leave those annoying tags. After going over the report here on decktech, i havent noticed any tags, so i dont know if they will come up when your reading it or what, so if there are alot of tags, im sorry, also telling me how to get rid of those tags (if they show up) would help a bunch

Pre Tournament Stuff
<br/>
<br/>
                   Well the night before (Friday the 20th) my cousins slept over my house for Saturday&amp;#8217;s tournament. This is their second tournament and since they don&amp;#8217;t have to many good cards I make their decks. We play test until around 11:30, and I&amp;#8217;m a little bit nervous with my dark deck, but since I figure I wont be able to make much better I stick with it. So we get to Tri-County about 10-15 min. early so we just sit around. My cousins buy some packs but didn&amp;#8217;t pull anything special, each got a padme, but that&amp;#8217;s about it. As time goes on more people show up and there is a total of 17 people, which means Brad Vogel the TD couldn&amp;#8217;t play, stupid TD rules. Also going into this tournament my rating is a low 1438
<br/>
<br/>
My Decks:
<br/>
<br/>
LS: QMC: nothing special about it, just pretty solid.
<br/>
DS: TTO: As I said before I was nervous with this but I had faith in it.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS against Eric Vanderbeck&amp;#8217;s (1497) Dark Deal
<br/>
 	Eric is my cousin, so I knew I would have a 1st game win (not b/c of his playing skills but b/c this is my deck, and I know my QMC can beat it). Nothing big happened this game, he took over the sector and system early and I had the sites, but then I came out with ten numb in ship and wedge in ship with a x-wing laser cannon and intruder missile (can&amp;#8217;t forget that lovely card Power Pivot) to knock him off Bespin. So I got &amp;#8220;Cloud City Celebration&amp;#8221; going retrieving 5 force a turn, and with my Paths and power on Cloud City he couldn&amp;#8217;t set up dark deal or knock me offthe sites. So I won by 27

Highs:
<br/>
	Me wining my first game
<br/>
Lows:
<br/>
	Having to face my cousin
<br/>
<br/>
	In between game 1 and 2 Brad says there&amp;#8217;s a lunch brake, so my cousins and I go downstairs and get some sodas. When we get back up he tells us he made the pairings, so when we check them out, I see I&amp;#8217;m in second and I am up against Matt Ehrhart. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS against Matt Ehrhart&amp;#8217;s (1947) RST racing
<br/>
	As soon as I saw him take the RST objective out of his deck, I knew I was in big trouble. Whether it was racing or just a plain RST I knew I had to build that ball fast. First turn I get Moff. Jerr. to the bunker with &amp;#8220;Endor Shield&amp;#8221; out, and I begin to search for my stuff. On his turn, he deploys LSJK to the back door and moves him to the bunker. My turn I know Jerr. is pretty much screwed so I pull the second sector then move him to the landing platform. His turn down comes Qui-Gon, with saber battles I lose Jerr. and a few overflow. So now I&amp;#8217;m wondering how the hell am I supposed to get this thing up, I haven&amp;#8217;t pulled Commander Merrejk yet to get systems out, and all I have out is Endor and D*2. So all I have is a drain of 2. He attempts to blow the bunker like 4 times before he finally blows it, so I have to lose 8 force and he retrieves 8 force. After that I finally get Merrejk to the podrace arena and he pulls out Sullust. He wins the podrace, so I lose 6 force, and he retrieves 6 force, which gets him back his whole lost pile (unbeknownst to me at the time when I lost my 6 cards off the top of my reserve the D*2 reactor core was in the group). So I know I lost this one, and all I&amp;#8217;m going for is a lower loss differential. He deploys EPP Obi to the podrace arena and battles Merrejk, so I now lose even more force. I have a pilot in hand so I attempt to find the ship (with Combat Response), but it isn&amp;#8217;t in there, while I was looking I noticed the Reactor Core wasn&amp;#8217;t in there, so I&amp;#8217;m thinking its in my force pile, I draw all the cards in my force pile, and am shocked that I don&amp;#8217;t have it. After that he just drained me out. After the game I look in my lost pile and notice It&amp;#8217;s in the middle of the pile, stupid me. So I lose by 39!!!!!!!

<br/>
	Hmm can&amp;#8217;t seem to think of anything
<br/>
Lows:
<br/>
	Me being so stupid, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have won, but at least I wouldn&amp;#8217;t feel so dumb
<br/>
<br/>
	So I&amp;#8217;m kicking myself, for such a stupid act, but no time to get down, time to play the 3rd game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS against Peter Purpura&amp;#8217;s (1489) RalOps
<br/>
	So this game my third effect instead of Wise Advice combo was Ounee ta, just for the extra activation. The beginning was uneventful, pretty much he flipped his objective and I flipped mine. He deploys Vader, Tarkin, and 4Lom with gun to CC, I spend a lot of the game running from them, using Paths, Narrow Escapes, and regular movement, but always making sure I occupied at least 3 sites, for some good retrieval with celebration. In between this time I try to off the edge but I fail twice. I&amp;#8217;ve never missed a off the edge before, usually I track a 7 or 6 or other decent destinys but this time I draw two ones. I blame it on me constantly having to use Keeping The Empire Out Forever and reshuffling my deck, but oh well. So I keep running around avoiding contact, so the tide of the game wouldn&amp;#8217;t turn on me. Then when I finally manage to get all the remaining low destinys out of my deck, he drains me then draws up so I cant retreive any more. So I win by 12

<br/>
        QMC doing a great job today
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:
<br/>
	Off the Edge for making Lando with gun and Qui-Gon lost.
<br/>
	Peter for drawing up, but I guess it was smart for a few differential
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	Now I&amp;#8217;m happy, two wins is fine with me, I&amp;#8217;m even in the count so this next game will either put me in the negatives or in the positives. I&amp;#8217;m hoping positives, but have a feeling its gonna be negative.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS against Ray Calderon&amp;#8217;s (1386) Profit
<br/>
	I&amp;#8217;ve played Ray before, at Golden Memories, and despite his 1386 rating I know he&amp;#8217;s a good player. So he is playing Profit and after play testing against my cousins profit deck (well mine but he&amp;#8217;s using it) I know this is gonna be a tough game. So I do my normal stuff, get Moff to the bunker with Endor shield, get my sectors and have a second turn TTO (because I had a sector in my opening hand). Ray deploys EPP obi, master Luke, and Caldera Righim (sp?) to the Endor docking bay. Which now that I&amp;#8217;m thinking about it, I don&amp;#8217;t know why he did this. So Mid-game Han still isn&amp;#8217;t freed I have secret plans out and Arica at the landing platform. Since I control space, draining for 6 a turn and him losing 3 from direct damage from TTO, I decide I have space in my grip. So I deploy maul and 3 of my pilots to the audience chamber so he can&amp;#8217;t retrieve any force or free Han. He deploys a few characters to try to knock me off but Maul and the forfeit fodder I put with him was just too much. I win by 15
<br/>
6(+15)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:
<br/>
	Me winning 3 games
<br/>
	TTO winning a game
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:
<br/>
	Not pulling Commander Merrejk, looks like 2 in a deck isn&amp;#8217;t enough.
<br/>
<br/>
	So I finish 4th out of the 17 in attendance. Matt Ehrhart takes first with like + 100 something differential, taking home the foil Empy. So now I don&amp;#8217;t feel to bad about the loss. Hopefully this is my first step getting my rating back above 1500
<br/>
