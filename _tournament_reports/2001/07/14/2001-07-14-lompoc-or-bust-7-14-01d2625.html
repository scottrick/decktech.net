<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings all and welcome to another tournament report by me. First off I would like to say that it’s been a while since I’ve been to a tournament to play in so as it stands I am still a little rusty, but ah well it’s for the game and I need all the playtime I can get so that I can be ready for the ComicCon this upcoming weekend. So here it goes.
<br/>
<br/>
I was at work when Sean Campbell, tournament director in Lompoc asked me if I was going to come to the tournament and if so to bring "The Signal" FOIL that I owe him for the "Sense" FOIL that he gave me to give out as prize support at my last tournament. So I told him that I wasn’t sure if I was coming and if i didn’t I would either send it to him or give it to one of the players that I knew was going. So I asked Chirs that night if he was going and he said that he would have to get back to me and he did and said that he was and then I said I was thinking about it and so after all that thinking I decided that I wanted to go so I did. I made sure that I had "The Signal" FOIL with me and I met up with the people that we play with on Thursday and tried out my decks. My Dark "My Kind Of Maul" and Light "Rebel Strike Team While The Race Is Going". So I played them over and over and myself and a friend of mine Alex have been working on them for quite sometime trying to ’TECH’ them out to the best of our ability both decks have something going for them. Dark has alot of counter stuff and high power and destiny adders... as well as some fun ’techy’ stuff... Light has high destinies to win the race and pretty much sits on Endor and force drains where they can’t be modified or cancled. My Dark Side starts both games with: Jabba’s Palace: Lower Passage, MKOS, Tatooine: Desert Heart, Prepared Defense, Secret Plans, Crush The Rebellion and You Cannot Hide Forever. My Light Sides starts: Endor, RST, Endor:Landing Site, Podrace Prep, Tatooine: Podrace Arena, Anakin’s Podracer, Boonta Eve Podrace and The Shield Is Down.
<br/>
<br/>
So I get up early on Saturday morning cause the tournament was supposed to start at what I thought was 11:00 so Marco get’s to my place late, that in turn makes us late, but were lucky for that cause the tournament started at Noon, but either way I go and pick up Aaron and we cram in my jeep, now keep in mind my jeep doesn’t have a back seat so Marco, being the short one of the group ends up in the back, lying down so that no one will see him especially the cops, and we head over to Chris’s place for the ride to Lompoc. Now as you all know I hate going here cause the drive is so boring, but this time it was a little more fun cause we got to listen to FAITH NO MORE and I like them and also, Marco, Wilson (who Chris picked up) and Aaron all sit in the back (short people belong in the back when two older, taller people take the front :) ) and we arrive there albiet what we thought late, but in fact early so we head over to Taco Bell for some lunch, well Chris, Marco and Wilson do and get me some Soft Tacos and a drink...their great. So we wait and finally Brian, Ed and Sean show up and we get things underway.
<br/>
<br/>
First game: RSTWWTR vs Ed Herrera’s Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
Ed sets up the normal stuff and I do as well I never even looked at what he started except for the fact that Epic Duel was out so he was going for the Dueling version. He didn’t have a Podracer so that guaranteed my victory their... we start the race on his turn. Ed draw’s a site and decided to put it in his Used Pile I draw a 4 and 1 and he drops a couple of Docking Bay’s one of which he got (gee I guess I remember that he started with IAO) well he drop and then I pick up my hand and lo and behold a Out Of Commission/Transmission Terminated there... so I play that cancelling "Visage Of The Emperor" and don’t worry anymore cause I have some spies in my hand just in case but VOTE never comes back. Apparently he plays with only one...at least that’s all that I saw. So I go activating and getting my stuff out I "Throw Me Another Charge" getting my third Explosive, then I drop Strike Planning and get General Solo and General Madine into hand and then tell him to go. We again go and I again draw some good destinies and he doesn’t bother stacking the card their for the race and then Force Drains me so I loose fromt he top and it’s a character no biggie cause next turn or two I will have blown up the bunker and won the race getting me everything back. He draws up getting some stuff and doesn’t do much else and lets me go. I drop Lt. Blount, Gen. Solo and Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight inside the Bunker w/the three Charges there and then drop Crix and Craken at the Rebel Landing Site and then say go. We race again and again I draw a 6 and 5 this time almost winning but unfortunately I will have to wait one more turn...only 23. So he drops the Emperor to the Bunker, Aurra Sing and Darth Maul and then let me go. So I activate, I force drain at my sites and then draw a 5 and 6 for the bunker and CABLOEY!!! I get my lost pile back and he looses 8 (of course I forgot to make him drop his hand like a fool) But I move for free, Luke, Han and Blount to the Bunker and there I drop Chewie and then initiate a battle I draw another 6 for destiny and he draws I think a 2 which doesn’t matter cause were all immune...but even if we weren’t I still canceled it with Gen. Han just to reduce the power. So he looses Maul to the lost and I OOC his pile getting something useless... His turn he activates, picks up Vader with the Obj, then drops him with a stick to Back Door. I was fearing the VO but he didn’t do that so he battles and I play "Too Close For Comfort" to make him spend the 2 or cancel since he didn’t have anything the target was cancled but his destiny was a 1 and mine again was 5. Vader decided to hang and the Emperor went buh-bye.. Oh yeah I also won the pod race as well getting back my Deactivate, Explosives and 1 card that he Force Drained me for... then on my turn I drop Obi-Wan with Lightsaber battle and beat out Vader...Ed tries making a comeback, I have Obi and a scrub just sitting on Endor, he goes for a Blind Duel w/Focused and draws a 1, 2, 1 and I draw a 5 and 6 thus winning the game cause he lost Vader.
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 37
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning the Duel and both the Podrace and blowing up Enodr’s Bunker
<br/>
Lows: Non really.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: MKOM vs Chris Schweyers RST
<br/>
<br/>
The game started neither of us Podracing, Chris hates PRing... I love it. Either way I drop Emperor first turn to his Rebel Landing Site and get a FL he sits there for quite sometime doing nothing. Chris starts activating, starts setting up his stuff but gets a craptacular start...he drops Artoo In Red 5 w/Tycho @ Endor and sets up Meanace Fades I have Darth Maul with Lightsaber, General Veers and Dr. E sitting at the bunker and we wait a little more. He moves out of the bunker and I like and idoit follow him so we do that for sometime... I finally get a Lateral Damage out on the R2 in R5 targetting Endor, he draws a 2 so it’s good and down comes Chimera and Thrawn to sit for the game as I get rid of Tycho and just sit there force draining... Other than that Chris gets out all his power characters, we battle back and forth alot but in the end making a couple of mistakes I forgo the Bunker and he get’s in and makes it go CABLOEY!!! and that makes me loose the game cause now he has more cards and more characters back and forth till he traps me at Endor: Chief Chirpa’s Hut and that’s game.
<br/>
<br/>
FL: 7 (2+30)
<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: Non really it was a good game
<br/>
LOWS: Staving off the Explosion and then forgetting to stay there and letting him blow it up...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: RSTWWTR vs Wilson Fishers SYCFA Big Blue
<br/>
<br/>
I like playing Wilson so that I can help him or him help me cause he’s got the potential to be a great player, a little weird (yes Wilson your weird) but a good player. So we set up and starts Podracing as well and of course stops me the first turn, however he does start with Mobilization Points and I don’t have DDTA in my deck so he fetches something and gets the Flagship Executor. So I’m thinking big space so I will just do my thing and go from there... I set up my usual on Endor and he sets up and saves I set up some more and also, I make the come back for racing. 2 5’s then 2 5’s again then I "A Step Backwards" him and bring myself to the victory in the Race... and then I blow up the Bunker and again I FORGET to make him Dump his hand. In space however he’s starting to build a good fleet but the lone BFiS1 comes out and I drop the Independence and Lt. Blount there and then I go all out and loose Blount and Independence because of his 5 destiny draw but BF goes buh-bye... a few turns later I get out Home One, Haash’n, Chewie Of Kashyyyk, Cracken and Threepio W/Parts Showing on Home one and start contesting him in space...retrieving 2 a turn (1 for the Scout and 1 for having a ship in space and controlling a BG putting the bottom of my force pile on my used pile) and I eventually take the lead and beat down his space fleet... finally showing me that this deck is indeed a beast and I will definately take it to ComicCon with me. So I win again with this deck.... now undefeated in 12 games and 2 tournaments.
<br/>
<br/>
FW: 30 (4+60)
<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: Winning against Podrace deck with mine
<br/>
LOWS: Beating Wilson
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: MKOM vs Sean Campbell’s AITC (Caldera Rep) - Oh yeah my rep is Prince Xizor
<br/>
<br/>
We start and like before I get Emperor in my opening hand I drop him to my site fearing that he maybe playing Sandwhirls but I never saw one come out of his deck. Either way we play back and forth and back and forth...the games were kinda sketchy to remember...but I do know that i played Sense &amp; Recoil In Fear 3 times and I kept getting some good stuff...but that stupid Goo Nee Tay (that’s what I shuold have Alter’ed) Ah well live and learn for not remember it so far to my right. The two highlighs... I dropped Dr. E in front of Qui-Gon Jinn w/stick, and moved Darth Vader w/Stick over and then on his turn his first action was to get something out of his lost pile... a Talz and mine was Disarm and then operate on Qui-Gon. His best action (before I mention my other one) was screwing me out of my destiny cause of Lando W/Axe and him making me draw my last Destiny which would have cleaned the board cause he said....Nah I won’t bother then saw that I had one then said oh wait I will...so that was a$$...but Maul stayed to live a little more...and my other sweet move (Asides from Restraining Bolt on TWPS) I Sandwhirled his Ben, Padme and Bmoar Monk and my 4-Lom...then it got Threepio next turn... the clinher in the game was when I forgot to move Emperor to Vader and Dr. E and then Dr. E and Vader to his site so that I could move them over next turn and block the drain and then win... (DAMN!!!! I just remember’d right now that it was a Force Drain -1 there Sean... so it would have been for 1 not 2) DAMN!!!.......... ah well live and learn I only lost by 4.
<br/>
<br/>
HIGHS: Sandwhirling his guys and Dr.Eing his Disarmed Qui-Gon
<br/>
LOWS: FORGETTING....damn!
<br/>
<br/>
Well all in all at least Santa Barbara took first WOOHOO!!! Chris....although I should have won that game. :) But he took it, Sean took second and I took third (differential) packs were distriubted and I got 2 of Tatooine: Something Stupid and Padme...Chris got the Alter FOIL and Sean somehow got the The Signal FOIL - and Marco go a$$ed out of not being able to get it. What’s up with that Sean - I thought that he was supposed to get something.
<br/>
<br/>
