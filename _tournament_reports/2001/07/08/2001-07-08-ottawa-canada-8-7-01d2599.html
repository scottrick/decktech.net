There’s alotta Pre Tournament stuff so if you wanna skip it it’s labeled Tournament Day
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Well this all starts back the week after Rampo. I checked out those lock decks I put them together for the tournament that weekend and then the Thursday ERRATA grrrrr so being so busy that week I decided not to go to the tournament cause well i didn’t have ANY Tatooine ready decks together.
<br/>
The next couple weeks were finals and well i had 5 to write it sucked hard so that killed two weeks of my life no cards lost the girl (Russian girls get reeaally jealous long story) And well missed the post Tatooine wave of ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
Onto this week well I’m taking summer school in OA chem cause i got a 70 and well you can’t get into premed with a 70 in OA Chem so. I lucked out with that class though 9 chicks 8 of them hot, it’s like a buffet. So anyway I ended up getting one of them of course and saw Shrek cause well i had a feeling seeing Kiss of The Dragon wouldn’t be a good idea, Shrek was actually funny so.. that went good.
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday I was thinking i should start on decks for the tournament on Sunday but yeah nuts to that I’m going to go play Tennis. So my plan was me and all my friends go to the university and play tennis there but nooooo they wanted to go to the place where my old gf works. Luckily she wasn’t working so scene averted. I got home and well I needed decks I’ve been working on a CCT deck that uses Emperor’s Prize and All Too Easy, but i couldn’t find a CCT in my binders so I had a problem there. For light i had nothing i had a Slave Quarters start deck but i thought it was trash so I go online and luckily Alex Tennet is on so I ask him if he can give me any ideas and he gives me one that’s so amazing in my opinion (but how i didn’t think of it.. ah well I’m Canadian that might be it) a ANSB Podracing deck, So I thanked him and went off to put it together. I grab all my deckbuilding boxes and binders (which for some reason they are missing my CCTs) I get all the cards together i scramble around my room looking for EBOs cause once again they weren’t in the boxes but I managed to find them. I had some concerns that the deck was too slow cause I didn’t use EBG, but i went with what i had cause well it seemed to work fine when i tested it. Then onto my Dark I gave up on the CCT but I looked through and i saw I’m Sorry and thought Heeyyy this could work. So I grab TDIGWATT the CCT deck and try to make it into a dark deal deck. In testing it worked well and pretournament it worked well too so i felt i was set. So I go out and hang with some friends for a while until i start thinking yeah I’m tired time to go.

<br/>
&lt;u&gt; &lt;b&gt; Tournament Day &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/u&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
 I get up around 10 do all the usual morning stuff, give my decks a quick look through get some money from my parents to buy some more clothes and head off. So I take the loser cruiser on the way get some cute girls number and then get to the store. See well about an average turnout, I play a few pickup games to work out any bugs (unfortunately I got god hands in these games so I didn’t find the bugs that were there). Some people who I haven’t seen in a long while decided to show up so I see a possible challenge today. And to top it off I find out that starting this tournament we pay five bucks of the total winner gets half the rest goes into a pot so that makes things interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
 So here’s a breakdown of what i played
<br/>
 DS TDIGWATT with the inclusion of All To Easy and Emperor’s Prize
<br/>
LS ANSB Podracing with 4 A Step Backward which helped out immensly
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my DS goodness vs Steven Sai’s MWYHL test to 5 mains
<br/>
 I honestly played this game with too much caution which screwed me differential wise but here’s the lowdown. I get an opening hand with Palpy, EPP Vader and Mara plus her stick and a POTF so yeah that was sweet. I pull out my two CC sites and Bespin deploy them, deploy palpy to the carbonite chamber and let him go. His turn I grab I have you now, he Puts out Yoda with a buncha training jank on him along with training area and jungle and lets me go.I drain him,deploy EPP Vader and POTF to the Carbonite Chamber get bespin from my res and deploy it then draw up all but one (which was a mistake because that one was the only dark deal that i put in there and it stayed there most of the game) I drew up First Strike, Bad Feeling Have I and Aurra Sing and some interrupt which i’ve forgotten about. His turn he brings down DOS starts training her with JT1 and lets me go. I spread out first to two sites to drain Aurra and Mara at one and Vader and Palpy at the CC waiting for Luke to come along. He deploys Padme then gets Qui Gon and his stick to Mara’s site, he battles weapon levs (i couldn’t play mine grrrrr damn dot) slices mara and Aurra dies to attrition. I can’t have that I Ounee Ta to get back Aurra deploy her and Iggy to Qui Gon’s site, battle take Qui Gon’s stick, wish i could target padme but noooo her stupid text) I end up losing both of them to attrition though crappy forefit.  So his turn, he drains me, i thinking i wouldn’t be able to pull it off this game lose my last Emperor’s prize from my hand as one of the two i lost. He deploys JK Luke to the CC into palpy and Vaders waiting hands grrr why did i lose my Prize. So he battles swings and hits vader I Hit luke with Vader and All Too Easy him. Next Turn Padme dies to an EPP Vader but she kills him with a Warriors Courage to get destiny but in the end he loses to my drains. I win by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
I made way too many mistakes this game forgetting about First Strike’s text completely about 4 times which cost me a good 10 force, not having more than one dark deal meant I didn’t get that out to flip so he’d lose force to All To Easy. But it was over. Plus he did kinda get 10 force back from Flipping MWYHL cause i for somereason took out Boring Concentration last night
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+7)
<br/>
Highs: I pulled off All To Easy
<br/>
Lows: I played like a dumbass
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My ANSB Podracing vs Martin Leblanc’s BHBM 
<br/>
<br/>
 So yeah I get to play the guy who usually ends up winning the tournament cause he beats me by a small amount.. and with a deck i haven’t had a chance to test in serious play yet. But as we start things go well. He deploys palpy first turn to CC DB as well deploys Rendili (he’s usin Mob Points Still)  and starts asking me if i want to come down there.. I had EPP Luke Leia Han and Skywalkers hell yea i did. I obviously didn’t have enough force for this so i just pull out my echo sites deploy the one from my hand and draw up. Being an idiot i didn’t start the podrace right away so now i start he flashes me but he draws a Vader so whatever, he deploys a Vader to CC w/ palpy and lets me go. I decide against the beatdown after i grabbed my 4th site and EBO and well he Uncertain is the futured me and this slowed me down somewhat. He continued the build up at the DB adding Janus TS4 and Vader’s stick to the fold by the time EBO is set up things are looking a little thin i have about 10 cards for podrace destiny cause i managed to pull alot of mains and both falcons for destinies a few times and my lost was getting a little high so winning the podrace the following turn was alot of help.  The 6 force from the Podrace and 4 from I did it helped quite a bit. The rest of the game really was me draining at North Ridge w/ Qui Gon and EPP Luke and my spiral being chased between Tatooine and Hoth (the Tatooine is going to be switched out for Kiffex) it got lat damaged twice so I had no choice but to run. He brought Mara down to NR killed luke but she died too, and I ended up losing cause he was winning his Duels with BHBM cause i decided to give him Luke.
<br/>
FL 0 (-8)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: It essentially worked like it was supposed to but the Uncertain is the future is what really killed me
<br/>
Lows Getting hit with an uncertain is the future 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My EBO vs Kris Bourgeon’s BHBM
<br/>
If your expecting anything cool to happen from this game well you’re nuts Kris is one of the worst players in the area and if it wasn’t for me playing around with him and Chimera w/ Thrawn And Piett + Imp Commands hassleing me for two turns it woulda won by 30 some but
<br/>
<br/>
I won by a pathetic 17 
<br/>
4(+16)
<br/>
Highs: How easy that was
<br/>
Lows: having to play some loser
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 My DS vs John Cain’s Outskirts/Toshe start
<br/>
 Another god hand for this deck.. but there was a big problem the SM was sitting right beside us and he’s like Oh yeah this is the Emperor’s Prize, All Too Easy deck that these guys were talking about right?(The two people who saw it were both Martin and Martin P but John didn’t know about it)  I was about to leap over the table and kill him for that, It doesn’t work if they know from the start to not put Luke at the CC. So my amazing hand kind looked a litte bit bad cause i had both Prize and ATE in my hand but Vader n Palpy were both in there too. So I grab all my sites deploy Palpy bad feeling and first strike (which i sooo used this time around). And let him go. He activated and let me go, i’m like ohhh k. I deploy Vader grab Bespin from my res let him go. He deploys Jedi Luke with Outskirts and moves him to Toshe. I drain him for a few put POTF on the CC Mara goes down with her stick and i send Mara and Aurra out to drain (deja vu). He just drains me I lose Prize and ATE deploys Kal Fal Cantina and EPP Han and Leia and he draws up and has no force.. sweet. So I drain him send Iggy and 4Lom to go teach Han and Leia a lesson, cancel Leia’s text he misses iggy capture han draw crap destiny and i have to lose 4 lom and he loses the I know he was going to use..sucker. His turn he deploys the farm and Owen/Beru and harvests.. I had no grabber so grrrr. I set up dark deal and was eventually draining for 13 but because of his harvests and his own drains on Tatooine which i didn’t have people to deal with I won by a pathetic 8 (man i sound like that Weakest Link lady when she says how much money they banked... damn i need help)
<br/>
<br/>
so yeah 6 (+24) That’s probably my lowest differential in a long long time so obviously I made too many mistakes and my decks need a litte work.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Standings
<br/>
<br/>
Martin Leblanc 8 (+63)
<br/>
Martin Prud’homme 6 (+ 42)
<br/>
Myself 6 (+ 24)
<br/>
and 11 other people who didn’t come top 3
<br/>
<br/>
So I intend to work both of my decks to a better state than the night before mix together they both are cause they both have killer potential, they just need the kinks worked out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok now the Props and Slops
