My rating: 1665 after 98 games
<br/>
Well my last tournament was way back in January at Grasshoppers Comics in Williston Park. They haven’t been getting 8 people to any of their tournaments since January and now that Brad Vogel became a TD, he scheduled his first one for July 7th at a weekly cardshow. So about a week before, I finally pick up my box of Tatooine and I start to make decks. I want to thank Jon Grubb for helping me even though I did bad. I settle on SYCFA flip for dark and a pile type deck for light. The night before I change my mind and make a WYS deck at 2 AM. I wake up at around 8 and leave for the tournament at 10 ’o clock so I can get there early. I pay my 5 bucks and buy 3 packs of Tatooine and pull a Qui-gon. NICE! Well 3 of Brad’s friends are there, Wayne Cullen shows up with his 2 cousins, and some Mastic people come like Phil Pipitone and John Curran and Joe Guiffre. Now I change my light deck back to the pile thing and we wait for Sam Diamond and Alex Warshow to come like they said. Also Steve Moriarty was supposedly coming but he didn’t. 
<br/>
<br/>
- Real stuff -
<br/>
Game 1: My pile almost copy deck VS. Greggory Zinn’s (1500) YMSYL 
<br/>
Well I get paired up against Brad’s friend and this is his first tournament. He starts 5th Marker, Mobilization Points, YMSYL, and IAO. I start Slave Quarters, Insurrection, Don’t Do That Again, and Scrambled Transmission. On his turn he pulls Executor DB and the 3rd marker and he deploys the Hoth docking bay from hand. On my turn I pull Shmi and naked 3PO and pull Shocking Info/Grimtaash and I think I get out a grabber from reserve with Don’t Do That Again and I get my Home One docking bay. On his turn he deploys Presence of the Force on the 5th marker and he gets out Merrjek and Piett to the Executor docking bay but I use Shocking Information so he can’t pull a system. On my turn I revo his 5th marker, get out my Tatooine docking bay and I draw some. He goes and deploys Ozzel to the Hoth docking bay and transits Merrjek over. Now my turn a big beatdown occurs. Lando with Vibro Ax, EPP Luke, and EPP Obi come down to Piett’s site. I hit him and play Gift of the Mentor and he loses 19 overflow. I use someone to get rid of Ozzel and Merrjek later and I get out my Goo Nee Tay. He puts out Blizzard 1 at the 3rd marker with Veers inside and he gets out Vader with Blizzard 2 to that site too. He also has a Blizzard Walker with Chiraneu and Evax inside at the revo’ed 5th marker. I am losing I think 7 a turn while I’m draining for 1 at the Echo docking bay and 1 at the Tatooine docking bay. I deploy Qui-gon, EPP Leia, and Chewie, Protector to battle at the 5th marker. He loses his guys there but I get Ice Storm’ed later on. It’s now late game and I am using We’re Doomed and draining for 2 and he’s draining for 2 and causing 2 direct damage to me. I lose We’re Doomed off top though and then he just kills me with his drain of 5 and his direct damage. I lose by 4.

FL 0(-4)
<br/>
Highlights: Beating down Piett for 19 overflow
<br/>
Lowlights: Ice Storm and losing We’re Doomed off top
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My SYCFA flip VS. Sam Diamond’s (1498) Tosche Mains
<br/>
Well we start off the game joking about how Alex will hunt me down and kill me for playing space and he starts usual Obi’s Hut/Tosche Station while I start SYCFA, A Million Voices Crying Out, There Is No Try/Oppressive Enforcement, and Mobilization Points. I just deploy the Conference Room and Rendili first turn and he deploys EPP Luke to Tosche Station and draws. I set up with DS Gunners and Ozzel at the Conference Room and I have the Superlaser out. I also get out U-3PO. He plays Sorry About the Mess on U-3PO and deploys EPP Han to the Lower Corridor and Nabruns Luke there. I get out IAO and Emperor with Janus and pull CPI and get ready to blow stuff up. Then he drains for 2 and I lose CPI from hand and I’ll just pull it from lost. But no wait! Sam plays Sense &amp; Recoil in Fear and CPI gets lost in my reserve deck! Ahhhh! Now he spreads out on Tatooine with people and sabers and Luke gets Lightsaber Proficiency on him. I am losing 5 to drains and I finally blow up Alderaan. I have Resistance limiting his drains a little and I have EPP Vader at my DS docking bay to stop I Hope She’s Alright. I flip and get out some SD’s and retrieve some but it’s a little late. He claws one of my ships and just Senses my Ghhhk &amp; Those Rebels Won’t Escape Us. Godherdt is somewhere in my lost pile. We have a last battle with his Gold Leader in Gold 1 with Chewie aboard against my Tyrant with Thrawn aboard. I cause 9 overflow but he just loses 1 and tosses Obi with Savrip. Then he drains me out. I lose by 25.

Highlights: None
<br/>
Lowlights: Recoil in Fear

<br/>
I now proceed to go with Sam across the street to Nathans and we bring back stuff and eat. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My SYCFA flip VS. Wayne Cullen’s (1442) Harvest deck 
<br/>
Well I start my usual 3 effects (SYCFA helper, SAC killer, Mob points). He goes for Slave Quarters and Careful Planning for Lars’ Moisture Farm. He sets up with Shmi and naked 3PO and I set up with gunners at the conference room. Superlaser comes out and Alderaan goes boom. Janus and the Emperor are out and I am getting cards I need. I have drains at Kashyyyk with a Presence of the Force there and Rendili. He is trying to Harvest with people at the farm but Something Special Planned for them is out and he only uses 3 of them all game. At one point he plays Thank the Maker but he drew 6 and couldn’t pay for Secret Plans. He is draining for 2 I think at the Cantina and U-3PO is blocking his drain at the farm. I just drain for 11 at Kashyyyk, Corulag, and Rendili. I win by 21.
<br/>
FW 2(-8)
<br/>
Highlights: Winning I guess
<br/>
Lowlights: Not much interaction
<br/>
<br/>
At this point both Pipitone and Curran are undefeated but they both played the same sides in game 3 and can’t face each other.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My pile crap VS. Joe Guiffre’s (1587) YMSYL  
<br/>
Oh great another walker deck. I start Insurrection, Don’t Do That Again, and Scrambled Transmission and he goes for There Is No Try &amp; Oppressive Enforcement, IAO, and YMSYL. Pretty much same as game one, he pulls the 3rd marker and Hoth docking bay and on my turn Shmi comes out and 3PO is in my force pile so I convert his Hoth docking bay and revo his 5th marker but he has a Presence of the Force there. He puts Piett and someone out and I go beat them up for some overflow with EPP Luke, Obi, and Han. I get my 3PO out and I’m draining for 2 at the Tatooine docking bay with Qui-gon and stick while he isn’t doing much right now. He then deploys Merrjek and Thrawn to the Slave Quarters but all I lose is Shmi. Then I chase him around with Qui-gon for a bit. Then finally Jar Jar and Lando with Ax come out and exclude Thrawn and get Merrjek for some overflow. Ice Storm gets my guys on Hoth and he starts drains of 2 and 2 (The MPG was out so the revo’ed Ice Plains was drain -1 for him) and I am losing 2 to YMSYL. I use EPP Leia to kill Thrawn who was still there and then that is pretty much game. He has lost like half of his deck to battle damage and my drain of 2 with Qui-gon has cost him about 8-10 force. I lose my 6 card hand on his turn and then drain him out for the win by 22. 
<br/>
FW 4(+14)
<br/>
Highlights: Lots of battles even thought most were one-sided
<br/>
Lowlights: None
<br/>
<br/>
I end up trading the Qui-gon I pulled earlier for a BB Premiere Luke (I had no premiere Lukes). Phil leaves early and he ends up taking second. The following are the final standings.
<br/>
<br/>
John Curran 8(+88) 
<br/>
Philip Pipitone 8(+84) 
<br/>
Sam Diamond 4(+28) 
<br/>
Alex Warshow 4(+20) 
<br/>
Joe Guiffre 4(+17) 
<br/>
Chris Wo@#$%a 4(+14) (ME) 
<br/>
Brian Zinn 4(+6) 
<br/>
Eric Vanderbeck 4(-14) 
<br/>
Gregory Zinn 4(-22) 
<br/>
Tim Jamilkowski 2(-48) 
<br/>
Wayne Cullen 2(-87) 
<br/>
Keith Vanderbeck 0(-86) 
<br/>
<br/>
Joe and John leave early too so John gets the foil Clash of Sabers and Joe gets a foil Obi. Everyone else gets 4 foils. I got lightside Kiffex, Force Lightning, Main Course, and Artoo in Red 5. I close out the day with trading. I traded Sam 2 Stone Piles and Rebel Base Occupation for Anakins Racer, Fighter Cover, and OOC/TT. I traded Alex Fett in Slave I and I got a Revolution and an Effective Repairs. Then I traded Brad my Maul and Aurra for EPP Leia and Padme. I also gave Brad a Sith Probe Droid for two YJ foils. I think my rating is going to drop about 30 points or so. Wow, 4 tournaments and I’ve lost 80 rating points. I think everyone had a pretty good time and I look foward to the one on the 21st. 
<br/>
