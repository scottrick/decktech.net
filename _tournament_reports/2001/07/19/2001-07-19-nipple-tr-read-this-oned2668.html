<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Sorry about the other one folks, spelling was just too bad so I decided to post it again.  Still alot of bad grammar and stuff in this one but this one is at least readable.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 All right. Where to begin? It all started about a month
<br/>
                 ago, I saw the posting for a CT tourney so for the past
<br/>
                 two to three weeks I had been bugging my buddy
<br/>
                 and candidate for coolest man alive, mike gemme to
<br/>
                 drive down there. Road trips are fun so he is like ok i
<br/>
                 am in and since he was in so was steebo...steebo
<br/>
                 and deck, deck and steebo. Kinda like batman and
<br/>
                 robin, no more like Spiderman and harry
<br/>
                 osborne(more on this later). 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So Friday the 13th rolls around and I take the train to
<br/>
                 hayes’ house and we meet up with pauly m and do
<br/>
                 some playtesting. I playtest a solid wys and decide
<br/>
                 to play it rather than my crusty dagobah. I play
<br/>
                 huntdown racing for dark cuz i am a retard...friday is
<br/>
                 kinda boring but whatever it was also sorta cool.
<br/>
                 Well we drive to gemme’s house and just as we get
<br/>
                 there mike’s sister and her hot friend
<br/>
                 mckensie(mike’s sis is also hot for those of you who
<br/>
                 have been living in a cave) walk out.  Anyway they are leaving
<br/>
                 and because of hayes’ horrible parking they come
<br/>
                 over and talk to us for 2 seconds and this is
<br/>
                 great...mckensie is like "good luck tomorrow" and i
<br/>
                 just wink...ds testing--sometimes you don’t need to
<br/>
                 say anything. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Well I get inside his house and take a dump in his
<br/>
                 bathroom which is connected to his sis’s room with
<br/>
                 no lock so I am paranoid even though she isn’t even
<br/>
                 home but whatever. I play mike a few times and he
<br/>
                 eats all my guys with his sick rancourt deck that he
<br/>
                 built because he saw this little kid eat like qui gonn
<br/>
                 jedi luke and obi at a local the week before...I am
<br/>
                 like play this deck tomorrow because it is hot. Very
<br/>
                 good against anything that goes to tatooine and
<br/>
                 good against space too because of court game
<br/>
                 text...weakness could be qmc though. 
<br/>
                 Well mrs. gemme walks in and i am stunned by her
<br/>
                 beauty, she is blond and hot...not unlike mrs. baroni
<br/>
                 and i am shocked that i haven’t heard of her beauty
<br/>
                 and great breasts...what the hell steebo! 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So the plan at this point was to drive to andy klema’s
<br/>
                 house that night and crash with him in ct so we
<br/>
                 wouldn’t have to drive to ct in the morning.  So we
<br/>
                 leave around 11 and have a cool time in the
<br/>
                 car...hayes constantly pressures gemme to go
<br/>
                 faster but gemme is chill and just takes it easy. we
<br/>
                 go in the carpool lane, we drive through the ghetto at
<br/>
                 70 mph. We try to mack girls but it is too late and
<br/>
                 we can’t get out of the carpool lane anyway. We get
<br/>
                 to klema’s house and end of story. 
<br/>
                 we play more games and i forget exactly but i win
<br/>
                 about 2/3 of my games. me and gemme decide to
<br/>
                 go to bed around 3 and we get put in his den which
<br/>
                 might double as his meat locker but whatever....I go
<br/>
                 get blankets for me and gemme and when i get back
<br/>
                 Gemme is like, "did you get it?" as he waits on his
<br/>
                 bed. I just burst out laughing because it is a like a
<br/>
                 condom commercial and i honestly laugh for like
<br/>
                 45 minutes. We try to sleep but it is way to cold so
<br/>
                 around 7 Gemme and me get up but are still in bed
<br/>
                 and Gemme is like, ’"wanna play a game" I am like
<br/>
                 ok he is "like lets go"  He takes off blanket and has
<br/>
                 decks in hand It was hilarious...you kinda had to be
<br/>
                 there. but it was damn good. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 After that we just chill to it’s time to go, we see this
<br/>
                 teched out picture of Andy when he is three years old
<br/>
                 but yet still has his beard so it is all good. We leave
<br/>
                 kinda late and we hit traffic but we make it ontime
<br/>
                 and I say we are all going to play ourselves and this
<br/>
                 turns out to be prophetic.  Bah i am getting
<br/>
                 bored...--the games 
<br/>
<br/>
                 I am running solid wys w/o dont do that again
<br/>
                 because I am dumb. And huntdown jizz for dark. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 game 1--my dark, gemme’s wys solids. 
<br/>
                 Well it cool that we finally get to play each other but sucks one
<br/>
                 of us will have to lose the first game...going into this I
<br/>
                 feel kinda uneasy and think he will beat me because
<br/>
                 he runs 3 a step backs and can play them from lost
<br/>
                 pile. So I think about starting someting else and
<br/>
                 not watto’s box but I say phuck it and lets go for the
<br/>
                 gold(mistake #1). We it starts out relatively normal, I
<br/>
                 invade the cantina and he takes space...he draws
<br/>
                 very good for his race and I draw good but then draw
<br/>
                 a 1 which sucks. The race is mad close and we are
<br/>
                 trading drains, but here is the situation: If I win the
<br/>
                 race I win the game. If he wins the race, the game
<br/>
                 will be darn close. Well anyway he wins the race
<br/>
                 despite some pretty teched out moves by me. I flip
<br/>
                 him back though by getting maul in space, he needs
<br/>
                 to find melas asap...he does after about 3 turns of
<br/>
                 doing nothing but drawing. That is pretty much game
<br/>
                 because  he has space and every time a try to duel luke he cancels it.
<br/>
                 Very good game and i made close to no mistakes,
<br/>
                 but huntdown podracing doesn’t fare to well when it
<br/>
                 loses the race. Full loss by 14 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Highs: great game...mike is the man. 
<br/>
                 Lows: nada. 
<br/>
                 Other: best feeling loss I have ever had. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 so Hayes beats mr. @#$% himself shaun macarthy
<br/>
                 by a bunch. Klema wins, steebo wins...bunch of
<br/>
                 scrubs win(conn has a lot of really poor players, i
<br/>
                 mean just there scrubs vs. our scrubs, our scrubs
<br/>
                 will win). 
<br/>
<br/>
                 game 2 i want revenge and get matched up against
<br/>
                 some kid’s sycfa flip. 
<br/>
                 The kid knows the game well and blows alderan, but
<br/>
                 i have the following out, mad ships at tatooine, i’ll
<br/>
                 take the leader, han at the cantina, luke at the
<br/>
                 middle docking bay with saber, and melas at the
<br/>
                 other docking bay and run luke run in hand...damn that is good. drain 8 a
<br/>
                 turn...game over in like 10 minutes. 
<br/>
                 Full win by 36. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Highs: winning 
<br/>
                 lows: does this prove anything? no. 
<br/>
                 other: I on the edge’d my luke to kill him so I could
<br/>
                 retrieve more... 
<br/>
<br/>
                 hayes won again, beating andy, gemme beat a kid.
<br/>
                 steebo beat somebody who i guess was supposed
<br/>
                 to be pretty good. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So 3rd game i get to play Brian Holingsworth (sp?) klema
<br/>
                 tells me he’s good. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Well he is playing hayes’ pile with docking bays...I just
<br/>
                 drop my guys to the race arena, so when i cause the
<br/>
                 22 force swing, i all of a sudden have the only battle
<br/>
                 ground on the table with vader, palp, maul and iggy...
<br/>
                 he tries to fight me a few times with twass khaa..wtf?
<br/>
                 I just dominate, he cant retrieve because of chybc...i
<br/>
                 only activate 3 a turn but yet i dominate...Oh well.
<br/>
                 Win by something like 36 or 38? 
<br/>
                 Highs: domination. 
<br/>
                 Lows: bah 
<br/>
                 Other: His deck (ls) had beaten a kid by 42
<br/>
                 prior...hehe funny. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So gemme lost, steebo lost, klema won, brentson
<br/>
                 won, hayes won. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 In between games we go to mickey dees and i get a
<br/>
                 big mac and it has a monoploy sticker on it...one of
<br/>
                 the green ones. I figure i will put it on my nipple. I do
<br/>
                 it and tell gemme he is like, yeah, tat is
<br/>
                 funny...not! thinking how it is lame that i didn’t
<br/>
                 actually do it. whatever. We get back and i get
<br/>
                 paired up against steve valee’s hoth deck steebo
<br/>
                 style. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                 Right off the bat i think i am @#$%ed because i don’t
<br/>
                 play don’t do that again and without it it is a bad
<br/>
                 matchup for me...well the game starts out alright
<br/>
                 despite his mad undercover spies, i manage to get
<br/>
                 out some drains and he drops down like 3 star
<br/>
                 destroyers at tatooine and lateral damage, i barrier
<br/>
                 but i am still @#$%ed at the system...about this
<br/>
                 time, hayes ask me to take the sticker off my nipple
<br/>
                 because he needs it. I do it while i am deploying jedi
<br/>
                 luke and hand it to him....next thing i know,
<br/>
                 everybody in the store, except my opponent, is
<br/>
                 laughing like mad men...ok end of story. 
<br/>
                 Well i battle his walkers with jedi luke and @#$%
<br/>
                 and am close to killing him with drains on hoth but
<br/>
                 then i make the mistake of a lifetime and leave my
<br/>
                 guys at the 5th marker, both han and luke, (my two
<br/>
                 edge guys). So he ice storms and i say control from
<br/>
                 lost pile to cancel it, he says ok but it still makes
<br/>
                 ’em missing, i say no, we call over
<br/>
                 somebody(mularky?) and sides with him...i look for
<br/>
                 hayes or brentson to side with me but they left the
<br/>
                 store or something..GAY. whatever, i still coulda won
<br/>
                 but with his drains at tatoooine and 3rd marker he
<br/>
                 makes short work of me...full loss by 12. 
<br/>
                 Highs: nada 
<br/>
                 Lows: plenty...i would have won by 20-25 if i don’t get
<br/>
                 assed by ice storm. I made other mistakes too. 
<br/>
                 Other...32 rating points...no! 
<br/>
<br/>
                 gemme lost again to somebody, hayes beat klema
<br/>
                 again. brentson won, steebo lost. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 I play steebo next...basically he is playing the hoth
<br/>
                 deck, some shady @#$% was going on with him but
<br/>
                 i wont go into that ’cuz i dont want to diss on my buy
<br/>
                 steebo, plus it didn’t effect the outcome of the
<br/>
                 game...He drops 2 ships early and lat damage on
<br/>
                 theron nett...i lose him and like 8 force. I try to pull
<br/>
                 the win outta my @#$% by playing celebration and
<br/>
                 @#$% but he is too strong in space and all my
<br/>
                 pilots are on the wrong ships(wtf?...dash on the
<br/>
                 falcon, melas on wedge’s ship and wedge on the
<br/>
                 skate). It was a cool game with alot of interaction but
<br/>
                 basically every battle i either had to lose a guy or
<br/>
                 2-3 force and i couldn’t handle it...late game garrison
<br/>
                 wins him the game. Full loss by 18. 
<br/>
                 Highs: Playing steebo 
<br/>
                 Lows: I hate the hoth deck! 
<br/>
                 Other-hayes own again as did klema, gemme lost
<br/>
                 again. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Well i am pretty depressed right now, i am 2-3 but i
<br/>
                 knowi will win my last game becausei get paired
<br/>
                 against some newbie...Not much detail on this one, i
<br/>
                 duel luke, he loses 18 force, i win the race...win by
<br/>
                 33? 
<br/>
                 Highs: nada 
<br/>
                 Lows: i had to explain to him what an objective was. 
<br/>
                 Other...see what i mean about ct? 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So i finish 3-3...not very good but i had fun. My rating
<br/>
                 will suffer a 60 point hit. So the tourney is over,
<br/>
                 hayes wins it going 6-0 plus 151(!!!). brentson is
<br/>
                 second steebo 3rd. mass in 1st and 3rd
<br/>
                 place...ohhhhhyeaaah. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 So we wrap up the tourney and i sell a qui gonn to a
<br/>
                 kid for $30 so i can now eat...me, hayes, steebo,
<br/>
                 deck, oakes(male striper/td down in conn...maybe
<br/>
                 you’ve heard of him?) and klema head off to
<br/>
                 applebees. On the way me and gemme have a
<br/>
                 discussion about ds jedi testing for women vs. ls
<br/>
                 testing for women. The conversation is cool esp
<br/>
                 since we are in separate cars...i tell him he is turning
<br/>
                 to the darkside and he is like, noooooo! 
<br/>
                 We get in to apple bees and our host/greeter is mad
<br/>
                 hot and gemme gets his moves in with her and i give
<br/>
                 him props for that. We take our seats and talk
<br/>
                 testing and somehow racing gets mixed
<br/>
                 in...everyone is all about how gemme is dominating
<br/>
                 me but honestly our waitress is balz and both me and
<br/>
                 gemme just dont bother after a while because she is
<br/>
                 just plain nasty. Everyone is like gemme’s testing is
<br/>
                 so much better, and i am like, maybe you lose a few
<br/>
                 games with ds testing but, every once and a while,
<br/>
                 you get the full win by 46  and it is all worth
<br/>
                 while. Everyone laughs, then thinks about it and is
<br/>
                 like, "true". We talk some more about how gemme
<br/>
                 should be spider man and not tobey mcguire and
<br/>
                 how steebo is harry osborne...klema’s gotta be flash
<br/>
                 tompson, and i am james dean even though he has
<br/>
                 nothing to do with spiderman. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 We also realize(or i realize how teched out my
<br/>
                 phone number is. Here is why, i say some how,
<br/>
                 somewhere, there is game of star wars going on
<br/>
                 where a guy is drawing nine battle destinies in this
<br/>
                 oreder, 617, 566, 4046. Everyone is like you are
<br/>
                 homo and i am all proud of my phone number
<br/>
                 because all the numbers are legal destiny numbers. I
<br/>
                 make fun of gemme and hayes because they break
<br/>
                 the rules with just their area codes(978...what the
<br/>
                 phuck is that? you got two illegal numbers in just
<br/>
                 the area code!!) 
<br/>
<br/>
                 Well we eat our food and gemme flashes the
<br/>
                 applebees but read his tr for more info on that...we
<br/>
                 leave and try to flash some more but it doesn’t really
<br/>
                 work. 
<br/>
<br/>
                 We head back to mass....we try to mack these
<br/>
                 blondes in a convertible but some harley type dudes
<br/>
                 get to em first(my ds testing buddies no doubt). We
<br/>
                 eventually pull up to em but they ain’t that great so
<br/>
                 we say phuck it. Ride home was cool though. Major
<br/>
                 props to gemme for driving. 
<br/>
                 I ended up sleeping at hayes house on sat night and
<br/>
                 am the king of saying card titles to match the mood
<br/>
                 that night, like eric is putting cream cheese on
<br/>
                 a baggle and i am like, you may start your
<br/>
                 landing...i dunno, it was good. Next morning i go to
<br/>
                 the train station and go back to my house and sleep.
<br/>
                 good weekend.
