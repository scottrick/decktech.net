<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well its been while since I’ve played in a tourney, and with Origins a week away, I had no idea what to bring.  My tried and true ISB/Scum deck showed how dead it was after tatooine came out when I lost at gaming night to Tatooine Mains.  So now I need a new Dark Deck.  I was also toying around with a WYS Podracing deck, but I suck with WYS apparently, as I got eaten alive at gaming night with that.  Good thing gaming night isnt sanctioned, or i’d be at about 1300 :oP.  Well after some deliberation, and some tech talk with local badass Blair Franklin, I build a Tatooine Mains Deck that starts Tatooine and Combat Readiness for Jabbas Palace.  As for LS, well, at 9am Saturday Morning I quickly re-assemble my Tosche Mains deck that I won with at the last Silverking Tournament, but I changed a few cards toi accomodate Tatooine, namely switching my Starting Location from Obi’s Hut to Slave Quarters ands adding Shmi and Naked Threepio.  I dont own Qui-Gon so I guess I’m outta luck there.  Anyway, I hop in my car and make the 10 mile drive to Westerville with my gas needle solidly on E the whole time... yikes.  So after much praying and talking to my car, I coast into the Comic Town Parking Lot.  There are 6 people already there when I show up, plus Roger, but he doesnt want to play if he can help it.  We wait about 10 Minutes and Kyle shows up so we’re sanctioned and Roger doesnt have to play.  Off we go.
<br/>
<br/>
Round 1:
<br/>
My DS vs. David Willis’ Slave Quarters/Podracing Start.
<br/>
<br/>
Well I purposely didnt include a podracer because trying to take on a dedicated LS Podracing deck w/o a dedicated DS Podracing deck is pretty pointless, you’re going to lose the podrace.  So while he starts racing, I get my JP sites out.  He drops Shmi to the Slave Quarters and gets threepio.  He then Deploys Artoo out of his hand.... I’m thinking some sort of techish Bad feeling Jank, but I decide to be bold.  Mara comes down, pulls her saber, and hacks artoo, I dark Strike him and Shmi and Threepio Die to attrition/damage.  Meanwhile it seems that he is getting all of his Mains as podracing destinies so after 4 turns of racing he has a total of like 15.  Talk about bad luck.  While this is going on I set up Vader/Tarkin/Saber/Gailid/Presence at the Audience chamber for a phatty drain of 4.  He deploys Outskirts and Quigon with Talon Karrde to set up a drain, but I dont like being drained so Maul and his Stick show up, Slice Quigon and I play I have you now to add a destiny and again, he fails to crack my immunity.  By now I have board control on the ground but he has the Liberty and Independence at Tatooine.  Here is the tech move of the game: Maul is at the Outskirts next to DB94 so I take the drain for a turn, then deploy Zuckuss in Mist Hunter to DB 94, move Maul over, and Take off to the system! He cant believe it.  So now he has no drains, still hasnt won the podrace, and now I have Emperor and Janus with a presence at Lower Passages so I’m draining for 9 a turn.  Late game Thrawn and the Chimaera come down to Tatooine, and Zuckuss lands Maul at Jabbas Palace. we have some skirmishes at tatooine but he doesnt crack Chimaera’s Immunity and his ships die to my 2 Destinies over 2 turns.  I set up Tat. Occupation but I drain him out before he takes damage from it.  FW by 27.

<br/>
Highs: Maul in Space... TECH!
<br/>
Lows: him drawing crap for podrace destinies... I hate rotten luck like that.
<br/>
<br/>
So after round 1 I’m in 1st place.  Woohoo!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My Slave Quarters Mains vs. David montiero’s Hunt Down/Podracing
<br/>
<br/>
I have heard about the famous Hunt Down/Podracing decks but I have never seen one in action.  First turn I terminate Visage (Woo-Hoo!!)so he Twilek’s for no Escape picks it back up. I just deploy Threepio and draw my first turn.  2nd turn He deploys Vader to Tosche Station, Visage, and draws.  My 2nd turn I Deploy Corran Horn to the Holotheatre and cancel Visage again. He comes down with Emperor and Someone else (Tarkin?) to back up vader.  So now hes draining me for one.  I drain at the holotheatre but he counter assaults and I lose 2 (grrr).  Next turn the same thing happens only this time I lose 3 (grrr grrr).  He wins the podrace and retrieves 11, I lose 11 (GRRRRRRRR).  Now I finally have cool cards in my hand but I am WAY behind in force.  I get ben and Luke with Sabres and Owen and Beru to Lars’ Farm and Harvest for 4 and On the edge for 4 with a tracked 5.  He moves the bunch over to the Farm and we skirmish.  Meanwhile, I have actually been draining at the holotheatre so he is losing force, but he still has the advantage.  Mara comes down to the Holotheatre but fails to find her stick, so Corrant dies to attrition but no damage.  Here is the turning point of the game: He tries to Duel Ben since Ben Lacks a saber, plays focused attack, and draws 0,1,3 which becomes 1,2,4 so he has 13.  I draw 6,3 so I have 17 and Vader goes down!!! He has to lose 6 and I am back in the game! My turn I bring Down Han w/Gun and clear the site on his side and Luke Stays.  Now he is on the ropes, and I spread out and drain for about 6 a turn and retrieve 5 with a tracked 6 and finish him off.  FW by 14.

<br/>
Highs: Coming Back! 
<br/>
Lows: None, I squeaked by on this one.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m in 2nd place because Justin on differential.  That means I have to play him, which means I get to get dropped like a bad habit :oP
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS vs. Justin Danenburgs Hunt Down/Podracing.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I get totally wrecked this game.  Lets just say that I put Jedi Luke out, and he gets beat down for 10 cards, then I lose the podrace the SAME TURN and lose 11 more! This is like turn 4!!! I set up Owen and Beru and JP lando at the fgarm and harvest, and OtE.  I get Honor out and turn Visage into a LS card for about 6 turns while I get ping drained.  IG-88 and ECC 4-LOM come down to the Farm.  Lando gets his text canceled, O&amp;B get captured and Lando Dies to attrioion while I dont even get a destiny!!! WTF?! so now I really am dead and just trying to make him los as much as possible.  I send Han and Leia on a suicide run to block a drain at the 3rd Marker against Emperor and Janus.  Janus Dies.  Han dies.  My turn I threepio to get my 2nd Han and re deploy, battle, Emperor dies, I play end of a reign to make him lose 2 or 3 and then he drains me out.  FL by 19

<br/>
4(+22)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Acheving my lame goal of getting him below 20
<br/>
Lows: Name it, but 21 force in 1 turn definitely hurts
<br/>
<br/>
SO I drop to 3rd place, but Chris Trevethan played Dark last round so now I have do play Justin again! ARRRGH!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: my DS vs. Justins WYS/Podracing
<br/>
<br/>
Well my Starting location gets converted by his objective... blah.  But its all good.  First Turn Maul comes down to the cantina with his Saber. EPP luke tries to take him out but he misses, I hit, and play I have you now for 3 Destinies, forcing him to houjix.  2 Turns later Vader and His saber and a presence have joined him.  I would hold on to that drain of 5 for the rest of the game.  He wins the podrace, but CHYBC cancels his retrieval.  By now He’s set up Wedge in RS1 with a cannon and Dash + Random smuggler in Outrider.  I go to tatooine with Thrawn, Chimaera, and IG88 in Ship.  He Moves Dash Over to block my drain.  I deploy Guri and Battle, draw 3 destinies, he draws a zero(Rock!) and he loses random smuggler to attrition.  His turn he deploys Melas alongside Dash.  I move Chimaera and Iggy over to kessel, letting Dash have his drain of 1.  Emperor comes down with Janus to the DB.  I battle Wedge at Kessel, he shoots at iggy and misses, I draw 3 destinies and he has to lose everything and houjix out of his lost pile.  at this point I have 8 force left.  He drains at JP, AC, Lower Passages, and Tatooine.  I have 2 left, he has 3 left.  he studies the board for about 5 minutes (we’re nowhere near time) and look at me and says "If you hadnt made me lose my houjix I could of won by landing outrider and moving melas into cantina, but as it is, you got it." WOOHOO!! Great game. FW by 2
<br/>
<br/>
6(+24)

<br/>
Highs: beating Justin.  He has got to be the worlds best unknown player.  He is a total Champ
<br/>
Lows: none, it was a great game.
<br/>
<br/>
So after its all said and done I end up 2nd.  I could of been first if I beat Justin by 29 or more, but... um.. yeah.  I forget the rest of the standings, but I think Montiero was 3rd, Trevethan 4th, Kyle 5th... dont hold me to that
<br/>
