first a bit about the trip
<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday - Thursday: Ok Lodi Crew is going to comic con. Awesome. Eskimo, Shrooms, Stamacko, Steph and I are all taking the long @#$% drive down to San Diego from our little dinky central valley home of Lodi. Stamacko @#$%s out and rides down to con with Eskimos parents. He says something about how his dad doesnt like me or some BS. Anyways me and Shrooms being the only drivers stay the night at my girlfriends house and plan to head out the next morning at 2:00 AM to avoid the heat. Well we get about 1 hour sleep because we are so excited and leave the house at 2:30 AM. All of us being in our teens have never taken a road trip and arent even old enough to get the hotel for ourselves (Eskimos parents to the rescue) and dont realizes how far it really is to San Diego. Anyways Thursday morning we are driving along I-5 and realize we are in the middle of nowhere. This stretch of land is about 150 miles long and has dead nothing in it. There are signs on the road saying things like 70 miles till nearest gas and the such. This area quickly became known to us as the NOTHING because thats exactly what it is.
<br/>
<br/>
Enough about the trip. We get to Con around 11:00 and hang out for a while at the decipher both signing up for the coruscant prerelease and starring at Aura Sing (you know shes hot when even the girls stared). Eskimo get there around 1 and we head up for the prerelease at 2:30. We meet all the other nor cal players there and shoot the breeze for a while then the tourney gets under way. We all get seated (around 70 of us) and the unwrapped packs of coruscant are handed out and 4 packs of tat to each player. I get dealt dark side and start the deck building process. I ended up with a lot of characters but they all sucked. The guy across from me (light side) looked at his cards and gave up. He ended up with a total of 9 characters some of which were doubles. So there I sit looking at my steaming pile of sealed deck ( I got all the tatooine rares but it was you may start your landing and million voices crying out) and they pair me up with another player whos opponenet dropped upon construction. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game one
<br/>
<br/>
I start the steaming pile off with the naboo battle plains. Its a double icon site for both sides but I have secret scrub tech in mind for it. He started with the city outskirts. Like I said I ended up with a lot of small little common characters. What I really liked was that the Nemodian pilots deploy for free to naboo are non-unique ability 2 and I had 3 or 4 of them. I thought that in a 40-card deck with so little activation it would be awesome and it was. Every game I played I had one or two of those little guys in my opening hand. This first game I dropped two of them for free and then drew the rest. He sat there and stared at me then drew a few.
<br/>
Next turn I drained and dropped a few more characters as back up. It was basically like that the whole game. I ended up winning by 22.
<br/>
<br/>
Game two
<br/>
<br/>
Stamacko had gotten light side and had had a win by 23. It always happens no matter what someone from the same crew always ends up playing. Even in a damn sealed deck. So Stamacko and I get paired up at the top table. He starts out with the slave quarters and I do my crazy naboo Plains start. We draw our hands and low and behold 2 neimodian pilots. Luck is awesome aint it. So I drop my O 2 scrubs and begin the killer sealed deck early drains. Unlike the other guy however Stamacko fights back. He had pulled some really good cards like queen funky hair and young LS emperor. He drops them too the senate and a few scrubs against my scrubs. This isnt good. I know I had a few senators in my deck and an unending supply of dark side alien scrubs so I drop my wave against him at the plains and draw a few after I hit him for like 6 battle damage (dont laugh that&amp;#8217;s a lot in sealed deck considering that when you draw your first hand your already a fifth of the way dead) I draw a few and get those senators I knew I had. So I look at the senatorial cards and all their BS and find a way to make senators disappear and make me win. There is a card where I take one of mine and place it in the used pile and make the same happen to any character at the senate. So I do that till there is only the one good senator VS my 3 scrub senators. Beat on his kill one of mine (they all forfeit for like 7) and win the game from force drain and scrub battles by 9.
<br/>
<br/>
Game three
<br/>
<br/>
About now I think Im hot @#$%. My scrubs are owning the board this was and that. So they call of the pairings and I end up with this guy from Arizona I think and I think to myself Alderaan pride worldwide. Just like the movie aldreaan got its @#$% kicked here too. This guy had gotten an awesome pull. I pull off my scrub start once again and think I am the man. On his turn he drops a few sites and draws one leaving two. So I thank him for the extra force and drop glamma gleemort or whatever his name is being wary of what I need in case I need it somewhere else. Mistake. All those Jedi council members that can deploy else ware came and said hi to my scrubs then on top of that he drop some scrubs. I got cleared from the site and never recovered. He had like 2 ki audi mundi, Mace, Padme, Obi, Jar Jar and some gungans. I lost to freaking gungans. I almost cried. Gungans are supposed to die not win. Anyways it was a fun game and I ended up losing by about 12.
<br/>
<br/>
Game four
<br/>
<br/>
After losing to the gungans I dont think it can get any worse. I was wrong. My next opponent pulled the Jedi council chamber as a start. Kudos to him. I got so force choked by that site. He had a huge force pile while I was struggling to get anything. I couldnt pull any sites and only drew high deploy characters. He started to drain me faster then I could deploy. When I finally did deploy Lathe he got major owned. There is a wookie senator that deploys for 3 and power 5. How wrong is that. So I activate my every turn I can and deploy two characters and a weapon. This battle would have given me a fighting chance if anything. So I initiate and fire my blaster. I draw a site. I was pissed. So I figure my destiny will be good anyways. Site. WHAT. THE WHOLE GAME THE DON&amp;#8217;T SHOW AND NOW THEY ARE DESTINY. As you can figure out I lost the battle and eventually drew up. He won by like 20 something.
<br/>
<br/>
So in the end my scrubs went 2-2. It was fun and couldnt wait till Saturday to do it again. Coruscant is going to be an awesome set. Finally one that everyone can be happy with and not so much BS. Read my next two Comic Con TRs when I post them. Later
