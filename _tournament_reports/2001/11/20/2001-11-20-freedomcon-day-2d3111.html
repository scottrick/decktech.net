<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">After qualifying for Worlds over the summer, I (Matt Scott) had pretty much decided that I was going. A lot of my friends were along for the ride as well, but most of them bailed when D-Con was cancelled by Decipher. In the end, only I and two of my buds made the twelve-hour drive to Virginia Beach as the lone players from Ohio. We had been messing around with decks for a few weeks, but had pretty much decided on high-destiny Hunt Down Duel and WYS Raiders. Each seemed incredibly solid. However, upon our arrival late Wednesday night/ early Thursday morning, the testing and pick-up games tat followed told a different story. Neither deck ran quite as we wished them to. So I spent Friday trying to come up with something better for myself while my friends played in the Qualifier. I had little trouble developing a fast Dark Side Saber Combat Racer, and it seemed like a monster. Light, however, sucked total ass. I had Hidden Base, Senate, Beatdown, Saber Combat, and all forms of racing, but none of these decks really did anything. Very late on Friday I came upon the idea of a Test to 1 EPP deck with direct damage and a powerful space theme. I only had time to run through it 2 or 3 games, but it seemed to be there, especially against Hunt Down and Saber Combat. I finally had two decks that seemed solid, so I was ready for Saturday&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: 
<br/>
My Light vs Steven Harpster Hunt Down Duel 
<br/>
<br/>
I started Don&amp;#8217;t Do That Again, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Draw Their Fire. He started IAO &amp; Secret Plans, Mob Points &amp; YCHF, and Crush. He pulls I Have You Now with Crush while I grab Legendary Starfighter and Honor Of The Jedi with my Effects. He gets the Death Star Docking Bay out and deploys an EPP Vader there to flip his Objective. I grab Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut and set Yoda down there. I deploy Honor and draw into some space. I deploy my Battle Plan shield as he activates and he pays 3 to drain for 1. He deploys Emperor Palpatine to back Vader up, and draws a few. I garb the Training Area, Test 1, and Daughter, getting them all down to the table. He activates 3 to uses We Wish To Board At Once to get No Escape to stop my Honor Of The Jedi. No big deal, I just Terminate his Visage. He deploys the Holotable after grabbing it with masterful move, but puts nothing there, knowing that Honor reduces the drain there to nothing. He also deploys Mara Jade with Vader and Palpatine, deploying a new Visage which is cancelled by me again. He deploys Drop! To track some mega destinies for battle and duel, so I know I can&amp;#8217;t go to ground with Luke or Obi. The Visored Visions begin to kick in here, making him lose 1 here or there for Vader&amp;#8217;s Obsession, Masterful Move, and We Wish To Board At Once. I complete my Jedi Test to nullify the effectiveness of Mara&amp;#8217;s Lightsaber, and deploy Home One with both major Haash&amp;#8217;n and Corran Horn aboard. I deploy Uncontrollable Fury to EPP Vader, which makes him lose 2 force at the end of every single one of his turns for the remainder of the game. He responds to my ships by bringing Bossk and Zuckuss to fight. He draws two tracked 5&amp;#8217;s, so I must lose Hash, Corran, and Home One even after reducing his attrition against me by 2. He loses Bossk, leaving Zuckuss alone at the only system on the table. I activate my entire Reserve Deck, totaling 19 force. I deploy Ways Not Make One Great on Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut to make things a bit worse for him, and then spend my 19 deploying my second Home One and a Captain Han in Falcon to Rendili. I cannot battle, but this worked out just fine. He drains for 1 and gets EPP Maul aboard Zuckuss to soak up some forfeit. He battles to stop any further ships form coming down on my turn, and he only needs to lose Zuckuss and Maul after a good destiny draw. However, I lose nothing and make him pay with my Legendary Starfighter. At this point, I have 18 in Life force and 5 or so in hand. He has about 25 left in reserve and 10 in hand. However, I pretty much have things taken care of at this point. He deploys Visage to have it Terminated again, then drains for 1 every turn as he loses 2 to Legendary and 2 to Uncontrollable Fury during each of his turns. I drain for 2 and hit him with a few Visored Vision (I got 3 Obsession&amp;#8217;s one time after he put them back with Drop!) and It Could be Worse. The game proceeds this way for several turns with no more interaction until I drain him out. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 13. 2(+13) 
<br/>
<br/>
I was behind, but once the direct damage got rolling it worked perfectly. I did foul up by losing Kessel form my hand early; would have roasted him in the end. Came back after being well behind early, and was able to slow him down to a crawl. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: 
<br/>
<br/>
Dark vs Steven Harpster Hyperdrive Racing 
<br/>
I start Racing and Watto&amp;#8217;s Box to his Racing and Goo Nee Tay. I start the race and get Emperor Palpatine to the Theed palace Generator. He can only draw and deploy A Tragedy Has Occurred defensive shield before letting me go. I hit him with a drain and draw a 7 in the race, bringing my total to 14 to his 11. I use Collision (which he grabs) to get a 6 off his Racer. He gets Padme to the Junkyard, ad uses her to deploy Qui-Gon, who gets his Saber. However, he cannot drain there due to my Objective, so I know that I have some time to set myself up. I draw up to 23 in the race, and then deploy Lord Maul and Saber to the Generator Core after getting in another Emperor drain. He deploys Panaka, Melas, and Tawss Khaa to the City Outskirts to get some draining in. I drain and win the race. We retrieve and lose, then I save a bunch and let him go. He drains for one, then deploys Padawan Obi with Padme, giving him his Saber. He moves Qui-Gon over to the Podrace Arena to get some drains in at the Junkyard. I activate and now have a huge amount that I have been saving. I drain for 6, then deploy EPP Vader, Dre &amp; Evazan, and Fett Bounty Hunter to battle his Padawan and Padme. I fire at Obi and hit him, making him immediately lost. I draw 3 destines, and end up with 35 power to his 3. he loses 28 off the top after forfeiting Padme, but this puts him at 0 Life Force, so I win the game. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 30. 4(+43) 
<br/>
<br/>
The race helped to wreck him along with my big drains, setting up for the big beatdown to end the game. The combo of Vader, Evazan, and Fett is incredibly good. He couldn&amp;#8217;t even get one card stacked on Credits Will Do Fine. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: 
<br/>
<br/>
Light vs Nick Jones (1869) Hunt Down with no Epic Duel 
<br/>
I start Draw Their Fire, Don&amp;#8217;t Do That Again, and Insight. He starts No Escape, IAO &amp; Secret Plans, and Crush. He grabs I Have You Now with Crush, and gets Vader down to the Death Star Docking Bay to flip on his first turn. I Terminate Visage before I have to lose any Force, and it is my turn. I deploy my Battle Plan shield, then grab Yoda and Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut. He drains and I lose Honor from my hand as he started No Escape. He proceeds to deploy another Visage to the Holotheatre, and deploys Emperor Palpatine there as well. I Terminate second time, but he cancels with Holonet Transmission, which I grab. I get out Training Area, Daughter, and Great Warrior. He Masterful Moves for the Holotable ( I Visored Vision, he grabs) and deploys it with Image Of The Dark Lord. I have lost Honor from my hand, so must deal with the drain of 1 all game. He also deploys Evazan &amp; Ponda along with 4-LOM to protect Vader. I Tunnel Vision for Uncontrollable Fury (Wars Not Make One Great was in there; I am a dumbass), but he cancels with You Are Beaten before losing any Force. I complete my test and gather my space fleet. I find another terminated to cancel Visage, but he deploys another on his turn, along with the Cloud City East Platform, with EPP Maul there. I deploy EPP Qui-Gon to smack Maul up, and we each lose our guy, with me using Resilience to get Qui-Gon back to my hand. He drains and does more Visage damage, and had about 25 in Reserve and 5 in hand to my 15 in reserve and 10 in hand. I get Kessel and home One down on my turn, with Han and Falcon in hand for the Legendary. He never comes, so I get to drain for 3 all game. He drains for a few and I cancel Visage again, but he masterful Moves for another. I It Could Be Worse the Visage loss; he plays It&amp;#8217;s Worse to add 5 to my loss. Luckily, I have another ICBW, and it gets my damage down to 3. I deploy Lando Scoundrel and Qui-Gon to his Cloud City Docking Bay to satisfy Battle Plan. He sends ECC IG-88 down with P-59 and successfully captures Lando. However, I hit P-59 and he draws low enough that Yoda reduces it by 2 and keeps Qui-Gon on the table, to be accompanied by the newly-released Lando, while he loses both droids. Visage is eating me up, and I toss my last Trans Term after seeing him Masterful move for yet another Visage. He moves to block my drain every turn, but neither of us will split our forces. I am getting in 3 every turn, and we are both losing to Visage as he drains for 2. His final turn, he has 4 cards left to my 2. I drained last turn, using 1 Force, so I was unable to move my squad away from his. He battles, retrieves 1 and I lose 1. Ending his turn, we each lose 1 to Visage and he wins the game. If I had one more car, I would have drained him out on my turn. @#$%. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 3. 4(+40) 
<br/>
<br/>
So many minor mistakes cost me the game. Losing Honor from my hand, grabbing the wrong cards with Tunnel Vision, losing Trans Term for my hand instead of canceling Visage, not trying to blow the Holotable away with my tracked 5 ( I never even thought about it, and the judge mentioned it after the game), using ICBW on Visage instead of an unmodifiable Force drain. I had my chance, but gave it away. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: 
<br/>
Dark vs Nick Jones (1869) HBX 
<br/>
<br/>
I start Racing and Watto&amp;#8217;s Box to his Strike Planning, Insight combo, and Squad Assignments. I start the race and he decides not to stack at all. I get Palpatine to the Generator and let him go. He gets an X-Wing to the R point, then deploys Endor and moves the ship over. I garb my Battle Order shield after I drain for 2, then I deploy Lord Maul after racing some more. He pays to drain, then deploys Kiffex and Corulag, an X-Wing to Kiffex and one to the R point, then moves his ships as to drain for 3 next turn. I drain for 4 for 2 turns while he drains for 3. I then choose to win the race and empty my Lost Pile, adding a significant amount to his. He deploys Tibrin and a new Tatooine, deploying and moving an X-Wing to Tat, and 3 more to Endor. He uses his once per game All Wings for 7, and lets me go. I see that he has been losing his space cards the entire time and has no Force saved, so I bring Zuckuss and 4-LOM to mess him up. He uses Houjix, but I have stopped that drain and move to the next system. He flips to stop my space drains and flies away from Zuckuss. He pays 6 to drain for 2 while I pay nothing to drain for 4. I get Maul&amp;#8217;s Saber very near the end, and use it for 2 turns to drain for 6 each turn and drain him out, all the while following an X-Wing around with Zuckuss. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Win by 30. 6(+70) 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: 
<br/>
Light vs Brian Hunter (2340) Dark Deal 
<br/>
<br/>
I start Insight, Don&amp;#8217;t Do That Again, and Draw Their Fire. He starts the Upper Walkway as his site and gets IAO &amp; Secret Plans, I&amp;#8217;m Sorry, Combat Response, and YCHF &amp; Mob Points. He grabs the Carbonite Chamber and West Gallery, while I get Legendary Starfighter with Don&amp;#8217;t Do That Again. He proceeds to deploy his 2 Cloud City sites, the Bespin system, and the Blockade Flagship. He reveals Baron Fel to put him and his ship down at Bespin with TIE Cannons. He grabs the Executer after he recirculates. I activate my 7 and realize that I can get all of my testing stuff out on turn 1. However, BOTH of my Dagobah sites are in my Force pile, so that idea is shot down right away. I draw up for them and he goes. He activates 3 Force and uses We Must Accelerate Our Plans to get They Must Never Again Leave This City. He then drains for 1 at Bespin and grabs Cloud City. He draws a few and saves a few. I activate my 8 force this time, and deploy both of my Dagobah sites. I&amp;#8217;m still ok, since I got my Test in my draw last turn. SO I go to deploy Yoda and Daughter, and this time BOTH of them are in the Force pile. Once again, I must draw everything up. He drains for 1 and then sets up Dark Deal with the following: Saber 3 and DS-181-3, free Executer to back his Saber 1 at Bespin, EPP Maul at the Carbon Chamber, Piett and Dre &amp; Ponda at the West Gallery, and Blizzard 4 to the Upper Walkway. I go and deploy Yoda and Daughter from my hand, but he uses I&amp;#8217;d Just As Soon Kiss A Wookiee, returning Daughter to my hand. I deploy Wars not Make One Great and then I draw a few more and luckily get 2 Control &amp; Tunnel Visions. He pays 5 to drain for a total of 11, but my 2 Controls mean I lose 7 Force total. He grabs Mara with Blizzard 4 and deploys Cloud City Occupation. I get my Daughter and Great Warrior out for free, then deploy EPP Luke to his West Gallery. I battle and hit Piett, then draw destiny to kill his Evazan. He loses both guys and I lose Luke, using Resilience to get him back into my hand. He goes and drains for only 8 this time, but the Occupation of 3 hits me. I draw for Great Warrior and get a 2 and 3. Wow. I look through my deck to see 11 5&amp;#8217;s and 3 destinies less than 5. I am annoyed. I deploy Kessel with Home One to try and at least do something. He just drains and Occupies again, then deploys EPP Vader to his West Gallery before loading up the Executer with Saber 1 and sliding over to Kessel, moving Saber 3 up to the Bespin system. I finally complete the Test, then deploy EPP Luke to face EPP Vader. He uses Kiss yet again, and I also move Home One to Bespin and away from the Executer. He drains and Occupies for only 7 this time, and shuffles his ships again. Luke comes down for free on my turn, but by this time he has deployed the East Platform, and has slid everyone one site over, making Luke alone where he deploys. I move over to face Vader, and I continuously evade in space, until I can get Captain Han and Falcon down near the end of the game. He battles and hits Luke, using Dark Strike to end the battle immediately. His drains and occupation wear me out, and he cycles back whatever he can as the game winds to a close, with him battling me and wiping me out with my own Draw Their Fire. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 20. 6(+50) 
<br/>
<br/>
What horrible luck, being delayed 4 turns form completing the test. I then got wrecked by my own Draw Their Fire, and just ended up way too far behind to mount a serious comeback. My horrible luck costed me a chance to win this game, or at least to stay in and compete. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: 
<br/>
Dark vs Bastian Winklehaus (2201) QMC 
<br/>
<br/>
I start Racing and Watto&amp;#8217;s Box to his Squad Assignments, Menace Fades, and Keeping The Empire Out Forever. The Guest Quarters is his starting site. I start racing and deploy Palpatine to my Generator first turn. He sets Dash down and deploys his Battle Plan shield, as well as the West Gallery with his Objective. I get Maul down to the Generator Core and race some more, while he chooses not to stack any destiny during the course of the race. He deploys the North Corridor with his Objective, then flips with EPP Leia to the Guest Quarters and EPP Obi to the West Gallery. I pay to drain and hold off on racing until I have lost some cards to retrieve. He gets Celebration out and deploys it to his system with Wedge in Red Squad 1. I drain for 4 and save a bunch. He deploys the Upper Plaza Corridor with Pucimir Thryss there, then moves EPP Obi over to protect him after deploying Melas to the West Gallery. I choose not to drain, instead dropping EPP Vader, Dre Combo, and 4-LOM. He Paths away and I use 1 Force to grab. He drains and Celebrates, then deploys EPP Luke and Corran Horn against my force. He Clashes Vader before battling, but I Stunning Leader when he initiates to stop the pain. I pay to drain, then move Evazan and 4-LOM away from Luke and Corran, to the site next door with his EPP Obi and Pucimir. The race ends, but he has just deployed his shield to suspend Watto&amp;#8217;s Box, and his Aim High shield. I retrieve nothing and he loses only 6 Force. I use Blow Parried to grab the top card of my Force pile, and he just kind of stares at me funny. I am puzzled, so I just go on and end my turn by canceling Celebration with the Masterful Move combo. He grabs it and I deploy my Code Clearance shield to stop easy retrieval of Celebration with Edges. He drains and deploys a second Celebration, then uses Sorry About The Mess to kill 4-LOM then @#$%slaps Evazan with a battle and Run Luke Run. I lose Evazan and 14 cards after he is hit, while he loses only EPP Obi. I then have my Vader alone as he moves Corran and his guys around to cover the North Corridor and his other two sites. I pay to drain on Naboo, then pay 3 to drain at Vader&amp;#8217;s site, while he uses 1 Force to cancel. Wow. I suck. So I move EPP Vader over to the Upper Plaza, but he keeps moving everyone away, knowing that he can cancel my drain every single turn. I drain him down to 10 cards, but he then retrieves 3 with Celebration and 5 with On The Edge right before draining me out. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 18. 6(+32) 
<br/>
<br/>
After the game, he asks me if I had the Blow Parried I my hand when he played Clash. I said yes, not understanding what he meant. Then he asked why I didn&amp;#8217;t use it. I was about to say that I DID use it, until I realized what he was talking about. Blow Parried cancels Clash Of Sabers. I can hardly believe it. For the second game in a row, something catastrophic prevented me from competing and possibly even winning the game. I may not have won either game, but I would have had a decent shot each time. I am incredibly annoyed by my gayness, but decide to hang in and play to see what I can salvage out of this. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 7: 
<br/>
Dark vs Chris Praskac (1989) Throne Room Choke 
<br/>
<br/>
I start Racing and Watto&amp;#8217;s Box to his Insight, Battle Plan, and Insurrection &amp; Aim High. He goes first and proceeds to use Speak With The Council to deploy the Jedi Council Chamber, then deploys the Home One Docking Bay from Reserve and Home One War Room from his hand. He Tunnels and then deploys Yoda&amp;#8217;s Hut and Goo Nee Tay. He deploys EPP Leia to my Generator Core and ends his turn. I am in shock. What a day. I start the race, but he deployed Anakin&amp;#8217;s Racer, so I use 2 of my 7 Force to stall him. I then deploy Dre to the Core for 4, thinking I&amp;#8217;ll just kill Leia and stop his drain. Whoops. I battle ad she just hits him, sending him to the Used Pile. I am stupid. I then play We Must Accelerate Our Plans to grab a Collision, despite the fact that I will go on to get 7 Force the remainder of the game and was playing a Throne Room deck. I must be retarded. Anyway, he drains for 4 and brings Yoda, Master Of The Force down with Leia to flip my Objective after Tunneling and deploying the Hoth War Room and Docking Bay. I go and draw another @#$%ty race destiny to let him nearly catch up. I then use all of my Force to deploy Palpatine to the Generator, with the fact that he cannot drain escape me until I ed my turn. He drains and stacks Obi-Wan there and deploys Honor Of The Jedi. I get lord Maul down and beat Yoda in Saber Combat, causing him 4 Force loss. I stay because of the Stunning Leader in my hand, I know I can survive and stack 2 7&amp;#8217;s on Maul to beat Yoda by 5 or more. However, he then pulls his only Sense out of the deck and battles. He cancels Stunning Leader and spanks Maul after hitting him with Obi&amp;#8217;s Saber and seeing me miss twice. He loses EPP Leia and I lose Maul and 9. I go and win the race, 28-27. he deploys his racing shield, and then his loss of 1 (half the difference between race totals) is reduced with Honor. I cannot retrieve due to Aim High, soothe race essentially has no result. I must draw as I could not even deploy the Maul in my hand. He drains again and then deploys lone Corran Horn to my Arena to add a bit to his drains. I deploy Lord Maul on my turn and win another combat with Yoda, making him lose another 4 cards. I have Stunning Leader, so I keep Maul there to stack cards and whack Obi in Combat next turn. But don&amp;#8217;t worry, he played Sorry About the Mess and killed Maul right away. He then drained for a few turns while I had to toss the characters that I couldn&amp;#8217;t even afford out of my hand, all the while staring at my Emperor at the generator not doing anything all game long. He drains me out after a prolonged period of me drawing and trying to save some, and him draining for 4. 
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss by 22. 6(+10) 
<br/>
<br/>
The little mistakes tore me up right from the beginning and I deny myself the chance to compete in yet another game that I could have hung in. I am feeling bad about my horrible play, so I just drop there and go out to eat, ending my atrocious day at 3-4 +10, losing my final 3 games. 
<br/>
<br/>
I hang out that night with some buds an have to wake up at 7 am on Sunday to make the trek back to school. All in all, the Con and Tournament were run well, and I had a lot of fun despite my less than stellar performance. 
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who was there and thanks for reading.
