<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, so I didn’t really have any choice whether or not to come to the tournament so I build a impressive Watto deck that hasn’t lost yet (at least I don’t think it had) and a great Obi’s hut/Toshe station/mains and toys deck without any space. On friday I wentwith Cat to see Monsters Inc. which was really really good....but the Episode 2 trailer was better.  Later that night we went to see The One.  It was good I guess, impressive fight scenes and stuff, loud people sitting behind us going "Ooooohhh.....Ahhhhh....OUCH!" every punch so I wasn’t to happy about that.

<br/>
Saturday-
<br/>
<br/>
I wake up, get dressed, take a shower, and I’m off.  I get some new sleeves then I go to Cat’s house.  We head off and pick up Dan in Carpinteria and go down to the tournement.
<br/>
When we get there there is no one execpt us, but in a while a few people show up (I’d say around 12) and our other tournamnt director Sean Campbell (owner of the KABOOM! No R3 deck on decktech) gets there an we’re ready to go.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:
<br/>
<br/>
My lightside vs. I forget his name but he was the same age as my sister (1988).
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I start my Hut and Gas Station, he starts This deal is getting worse all the time and the Casino.  I wonder whether or not he is Sabaccing or not, ethier was I have the definsive shield card for it.  I get Ben Kenobi and Jar Jar to the tosche station.  He play a Battle droid and Captian Peillion, he ends his turn, I remind him that he dosen’t have Ability to draw destiny, he says "No....the driod gives me a destiny!" very defensively, I say "Sorry, read the card" I made him play...not to badly though, I play Qui-gon Jinn and battle, I draw a 5 he loses both from the site.  The rest goes sort of down hill for him from there.  He did control Bespin: Cloud city for a while but it was no match to my force drains of 8 per turn.

Game 2:
<br/>
<br/>
My darkside vs. Cat Ceders Senate....thing...
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have played against this deck before and I know what it dose.  He played Naboo as his starting location.  he kept  on losing two force insted of paying. He played Wedge Anitllies, RSL in Red Squadron 1 at Naboo all by his himself.  Big mistake Cat! I save up A LOT OF FORCE and play Executor and ZIMH.  Battle, I think I drew a two, so he lost both the ship and Wedge.  Then he played Corran Horn against Mara Jade, her lightsaber and Watto at the junkyard and battled....ok....I swing and hit him, I remind him he has no destiny, so thats corran and I think 5.  I played Battle Order defensive sheild card and that was pretty much game.

I got a bounty for that game which in my packs I got cr@p.  I finished that game quick so I made a Taco Bell run for everyone. I came back and saw that they only gave me one soft taco.  So I ate my soft taco, that is all I’m going to have to eat until 7:00 or so.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:
<br/>
<br/>
My Lightside vs. Randy’s Watto deck.
<br/>
<br/>
He had me for the first 8 turns and everyone around me thought the same thing, he thought that, and I thought that.  I didn’t get any characters for a long time.  I did get Luke Skywalker Jedi knight down vs. His Dad with lightsaber.  I battle, he plays I have you now and gets three high destiny, swings at Luke and it hits him, thats Luke and 10 battle damage. Later on I get 3PO w/nakedness and draw Watto’s Junkyard.  I get out Brisky Morning Munchin’ and I get Jar Jar, Luke and his Lightsaber Verses Emperor Palptine and Watto.  I Jar jar bomb Watto and deal 6 overflow to the Emperor. I end up Jar Jar bombing another Watto and the new Boba Fett (highlight of the day). I keep killing off stuff, and end up winning by 14 or something.

High: Randy played the best game I saw that day, he seriously should gave won that game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:
<br/>
<br/>
My darkside  vs. Chis’s Lightsaber combat deck
<br/>
<br/>
Lightsaber combat is the stupidest objective in the game.
<br/>

I needed to get back to Santa Barbara by 7:15 and Chis needed to get back as soon as he could. I was in 2nd but then we chose to play two more games, both of which I played against lightsaber combat after the 2nd game I told Cat that if I play another lightsaber combat deck that day that I was quitting the game, so I would like to make a announcement at the end of this article.  But both games I lost, I got pats on the back for only losing by 2 against Sean in the last game and I was told everyone else lost by 30, 28, 31, 27.  Wow..I feel great at this moment, I drop from 2nd to 5th, I am put under pressure because of time, and I am more frustrated at this objective than ever.  Well, I am tired and hungry and I want to just go home.  I get chosen for the random pick for the Darth Maul w/lightsaber so I’m pretty happy about that but it really should have been givin to Chis due to his great playing that day.  
<br/>
<br/>
So I go home and watched Sherk.  It’s pretty good.
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to say thank you to Cat and Sean for running the tournament, the players who helped me along in the years, extra special thanks to Lance Dettle for getting me into the game.  But until they change Lightsaber combat in some way I would like to hang up my ultra-pro box.  I doubt they are going to make any changes to the deck but I would like to be heard.  If you want to read more into what I think about the objective than read the article I wrote about reflections 3.

Thank you,
