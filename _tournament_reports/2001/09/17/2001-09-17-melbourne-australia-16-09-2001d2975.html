<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hi, everyone this is my first attempt at a tournament report and my memory is a little hazy, so please be considerate. 
<br/>
  Ok, I rock up to Australia on collins street for terry’s sealed/open tournament for my first tournament since the continental champsionships of which I performed below expectations.  Anyway, I rocked up at about 9.00am so I could play in sealed as well as the open.  There were only 12 players for the tatooine/coruscant sealed tournament and several of the high class Australia players were absent, so this was my chance of gaining an early victory and a confidence booster.  The cards I received from the tournament director Terry Lyons included boonta eve podrace, sebulba, the unique ISB jawa, the new darkside 2/0 location (which is called the flagship control room I think).  Anyway I was almost able to play a darkside podrace deck but I didn’t receive the podrace starting interupt (damnit!!!!).  However Terry was kind enough to give us another 100 cards each, of which I was able to construct a darkside sernator deck (with all the right ingredients). 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 vs Dereck Prout
<br/>
<br/>
Damnit!!!  How come I have to play one of the top players with an objective I had very little experience of playing with.  Anyway, I made too many errors in deck construction that shone through in this game, and Dereck played well making no mistakes. Full loss by 14.
<br/>
<br/>
Score:  0 (-14)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 vs Ronnie Wilcox
<br/>
This game was close drain race, but with some well needed changes before this game (more senators!!!) and the assistance of motion supported I was able to scrape out a win by 4.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 2 (-10)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 vs Steve (something)
<br/>
<br/>
This game was a breeze as I blocked his drains and caused horrific drains with motion suppoted and using 3 force to eliminate two cards from hand meant an easy win by 14.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 4 (+4)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 vs Stuart Caldwell’s Hyperdrive deck
<br/>
<br/>
An extremley close game in which it tookle three or four turns to flip my objective (12 senators in a 40 card deck, WTF !!!).  Anyway, the game turned out to be a drain race in which he kept pinging me for drains on tatooine of which one I managed to cancel) and then hit him for motion supported drains on Naboo (I had the "lose 1 force for each Naboo location you control"senator at the senate) to give me the edge.  Anyway I managed to slug out a 1 force win, much to the anguish of my opponent who had realised he had missed out on top position for lightside and I tooke top place for darkside (yipeee)
<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6 (+5) 
<br/>
