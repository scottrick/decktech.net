<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tournament report is more on what we did that weekend, but I’ll try to put as much game info as I can.
<br/>
<br/>
It all started with my bro asking Kyle Craft if he wanted to stay at our house for the wekend of the DPC. He said ok, then he told my bro that he was supposed to take care of Hayes and he was coming on friday night, so we’re like, ok, I guess we can go pick him up. I knew this was going to be an interesting weekend because I jus moved to Aurora, Colorado and our stuff was coming in on saturday morning as we were going to leave for the DPC. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, we left for the airport after grabbing my friend Jayson, bro, and Kyle. When we got there, my grandpa parked tha van and told us to go grab him. So we go in and have to ride the train thingy to the gate he was coming in. By the second stop, no one was in our car, so I started pole dancing on the Poles you hold on to, what I forgot was that the other cars could see in to our car so when I stopped, everybody was looking at me like a freak, but I thought it was all cool. Well, we get to our stop and we jump off, we get to the gate and I decided I wanted to make a big commotion when he got off the plane and like act like he was someone real famous, so Kyle decided to sit on the side so he didn’t look like a retard like me, then I realized, I didn’t know what he looked like, only Kyle did, then I remembered he was real tall and around 18, the only problem was, a bunch of tall 18ish guys came off this plane so I didn’t want to make a commotion about the wrong guy. So I walk up to one of the tall guys that came out and said, "Uh, are you Hayes Hunter?" He said yeah, so I was safe from looking like an idiot. So we go to my grandpa’s van and Hayes thinks it’s cool because the windows have curtains. We get in and we drive to my house. We get there and start playtesting and building decks. My mom bought a bunch of blankets and pillows for Kyle and Hayes to use, but I forgot about them (Ooops, sorry). Well, we all get tired and start going to sleep. Kyle was the first to drop and he makes this funny noise if he sleeps on his back, so Hayes throught a tape dispenser at him. He started making more noise and Hayes put the Maul bean bag on his face to see if it would block the sound, Kyle got up and through the bean bag and went back to sleep on his side and didn’t make the sound, so we’re like ok. I go to my room and  Jayson getting ready to sleep on his cot, as he sits on it, it collapses and he rolls backwards. It was funny as hell, and don’t worry, this is not the end of the collapsing cot story, it will strike back, but later. Well, since I am lame, stupid, and suck, I’m playing asteroid sanctuary for light, and Watto is da man the hostess’ ding dong for dark. We get up, have some breakfast and head out to the hotel for the DPC. We get there and as Hayes signed in, my bro asked him to sign his Jedi Luke, as he signed it, the pen sort of exploded and ink spilled all over the Jedi Luke, to save it, my bro wipes it all over his arm, so he looks like he’s a fairy with shiny gold ink all over his arm. Well, we get there and get ready to play. There’s only like 27 people so we’re a little ticked. But, there is brian hunter, hayes hunter, kyle craft, josh bader, van melancolon, dan chisty, and tom cathman. All 1900+players. So it will be an interesting day. 
<br/>
<br/>
First game, I was, geeee, I don’t remember, basically I went 3-0 with the Watto deck, and 0-3 with the asteroid dfeck. It was awespome, every dark deck I played had wattos box. It was awesome. The Watto deck kicked, it beat and EBO, a podracing, and a mains and toys I believe. Everybody I played was higher than me, everyone I lossed to was at least 150 points ahead of me so I won’t get hurt that much from that, so I’ll be going up from this tourney. The final 4 were Hayes, Brian, Josh Bader, and Dan Christy. Hayes beat Dan with dark and Brian beat Josh. Hayes then beat Brian twice in the final. He also beat him during the tourney. But Hayes Hunter is the Denver DPC Champion.
<br/>
<br/>
Then I play in the Epidode 1 booster draft, I’m light and have 10 playable characters including an Obi wan. But that’s all. We find out at least 4 mauls were pulled, all tatooine. My bro got 2 of em’. One guy got a Maul, maul’s stick, watto objective, the two starting locations, boonta eve podrace, start your engines, podrace arena, teemto’s racer, and watto’s box. Is this a little unfair. Light got total crap. Well, I go 2-2 and had to play the guy that pulled everything. Chris Fanchi, u da man, finished 1st overall and went 4-0, second wqas the guy that got everything, one loss to Chris. So they respectively get the Qui Gon epp and The Maul epp.
<br/>
<br/>
We get home and there’s crap all in our living room, literally boxes everuywhere, so we try to get around it. I decide I want to make a new Light deck, but it’s like 1 am and decide to make it right before we have to leave for the tourney today. I go to sleep. I get up at 9:30 and we’re leaving at 11. So I buil a really quickly made Min what you have learned mains deck. It uses Mindful of the future to set up the cantina shuffle, I realize later, I have no space in the deck. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, we get there and register. It ends up the invitational would only have 7 players so they combine it into 2 tourneys. The top 3 would get glass, which were for the invitational, the top player over 1800 would get a set of reflections 1, and the top player under 1800 would get a box of either cor. or tat. or a $100 certifiacte for singles at collectormania. So Scott Gaeta, collectormania owner and director of CCGs at Tacticon and really cool might I add, challenges any under 1800 player to get a glass trophy, we’ll see. My rating going in is around 1650.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
Mind what u have learned mains vs. Van Melancolon (1917) 
<br/>
<br/>
Not good, He’s playing Retardosaurus rex ISB so I start Don’t do that again with insurrection/aim high and the camp. I set up the cantina shuffle early with Padme and Qui gon, as he’s getting set up in space. He blocks drains with undercover spies, I sorry about the mess one, and corran takes care of the other. I’m draining for 8 a turn on the ground and he gets black sun fleet out so he’s draining for around 8 as well. I on the edge for 4 once but do they have code clearance grabs it.It comes real close and his black sun fleet allows him an extra drain of 1 which allows him to win by 1.
<br/>
<br/>
0(-1)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Being so close to beating a 1900+player, doing that well with no space at all.
<br/>
Lows:Not much, just that it wasn’t real interactive, just draining.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
Hostess’ Ding Dong vs (sorry forgot your name) WYS
<br/>
I new I should win this game. Well, I get the first turn flip with Palpy to Mos Espa, Watto to junkyard, make him lose 2 force. Tell him go. He plays a location says go. I drain, make him lose 2 force to the objective tell him go. It’s like this for awhile. Later he brings down Han with gun and Lando with gun together. I have Vader, DLOTS and I have you now. I play him with his stick, battle, play i have you now, choke han, cut lando, draw a 6 and a 4. I have 16 to 3, he loses Lando and 13. The rest of the game was me draining him and wattoing him every turn for a win by 32.
<br/>
<br/>
2(+31)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Watto deck is 4-0 in tourneys.
<br/>
Lows: Nothing really.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
The Hostess’ ding dong vs Van Melancolon HB Flip.
<br/>
<br/>
I knew I could take this game, I just had to do as much damage as I could early and make him lose systems so he can’t flip. I get Palpy to Mos Espa first turn, Watto to junkyard, make him lose 2, tell him go after moving palpy to watto. His turn, he drops luke w/stick on watto and palpy, I pull I have you now with crush. He still battles and targets watto with the stick, draws a 0 and a 2, yes, he missed. He gets no destiny, I draw 4, 4, 6. He loses Luke and a bunch including 2 systems. He can’t flip. The rest of the game is my direct damge and drains. He never damaged me. I win by 44.
<br/>
<br/>
4(+75)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Yeah, I beat a 1917 player! Watto deck 5-0 in tourneys.
<br/>
Lows: Nothing except I felt sorry for him because nothing went his way.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
Mind mains vs. Josh Rangel BHBM (1709)
<br/>
<br/>
I beat him with my Watto deck yesterday, but I suck with light. I give him luke, can’t fend off all his mains, drain here and there. The only real damage that brought him down reall low was his own objective. I never drew any retrieval interrupts. Well, that’s how the game went, he won by 5.
<br/>
<br/>
4(+70)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:Bringing the differential down low.
<br/>
Lows:Not drawing any retrieval interrupts.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
Hostess’Ding dong vs. Josh Rangel Hyperdrive 
<br/>
<br/>
All I’m thinking is revenge. He converts my junkyard with his objective. I get Watto and Palpy in opening hand, Oh yeah, he’s racing. Well, I flip and cause 2 damage first turn. He draws and said go. The podrace isn’t exciting, I’ll just say because of my insane destiny and him not drawing interrupts, I win the race. Well, I drain, cause 2 damage, play Maul to the junkyard. He drops quigon to junkyard, I win the battle and chop him. I lose mara though. My next turn, I play Maul to the junkyard after draining, cause 2 damage tell him go. He brings down Qui w/ his stick and Obi wan. He battles, I play Maul strikes to add 2 destinies. He cuts watto but he loses the battle because of my 3 destinies. I lose Watto and he loses obi. The rest of the game is draining for 1 and small battles. Basically I won by 20. Palpy never left the table. I also never saw a Watto since the first one died. 
<br/>
<br/>
6(+90)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning, Watto deck going 3-0 this weekend.
<br/>
Lows: Not seeing another Watto.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
My light crap vs Robert Schiermeyer Black Sun (17somethin)
<br/>
<br/>
This game had like three battles. I got Jedi Luke out early and soon after got all my mains to tatooine. I was drainign for quite a bit having quis stick and lukes stick out. He never flipped back. I was also retrieving with the market place. I won the game right when time ran out because he tried to block my drain with Xizor at the docking bay, The turn before that, I drew Ben and his stick consecutively. That was game over and I won by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
8(+97)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: I won 1 with light!
<br/>
Lows:Nada.
<br/>
<br/>
Well they’re handing out prizes and I find out I’m the highest player under 1800 so I grab a box of Coruscant, I also got third so I snuck in and got some glass. Josh Bader won and got the ref 1 set and Ton Kathman got second and an uncut sheet of R2 dark foils.
<br/>
<br/>
We go home without Kyle cuz he went back to Univ of CO. on the bus. We get back and I start acting all retarded. I always get like that after tourneys, it’s wierd. Well, while Jayson went to take a shower, Hayes comes in to talk and sits on the infamous cot and it collapses and he falls and we all laugh our butts off. So he gets up and puts it back up sop it will fall when somebody sits on it. So he goes and sits on something else and Jayson comes in and we’re all real quiet. He’s looking at us like what’s wrong, he sits down and the cot strikes again. He falls and we all laugh our butts off again. After we all calm down, we all tell stories from hawaii, that’s where I moved from. It’s the most messed up place, the schools there are retarded. The only cool thing is the fact that there is a fight every other day. Well, we all go to sleep for 3 and a half ours then we get up to take Hayes to the airport. Well, we get to the airport and we ride the train to the gate. The door talks if you’re blocking the door from closing, this guy on the other side is blocking the door so it says to move or they can’t depart, so we all laugh at him, then the door on our side is closing and I guess Hayes’ butt was sticking out the door so it told him to move then we all laughed at him. Well, we try jumping as the train slows down and you fly forward, if you jump as it starts, you don’t move anywhere. It was funny. Well, we get to his gate and talk about hawaii for 45 min till his plane has to go and we say bye and I was so sad, I started crying, well, not really, but I was sad. So we hope to see Hayes at Worlds this year as I plan to go. That’s basically all. Now, wasn’t that a short report.
