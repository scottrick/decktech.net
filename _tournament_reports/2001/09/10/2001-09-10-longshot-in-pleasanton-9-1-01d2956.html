<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">TR straight outta Warmasters in Pleasanton in the good old Bay
<br/>
Area of California.  I had just got into San Francisco (after
<br/>
having spent the summer in Southern Cal) and I decided to head
<br/>
to the tourney to see some old faces.  It was good seeing
<br/>
everyone again.  Two players I must give props to right away are
<br/>
Kyle Ishimaru and Paul McKelvey.  These 2 players were in the
<br/>
low 1800s when I left and now both are rated in the 2000s!  Kyle
<br/>
is #3 in Alderaan now, so props go to him.  Props to Alfred for
<br/>
still being THAT DAMN GOOD and props to Nick and Steve for 
<br/>
runnign tournies all this time and still doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
Dark side is a seante deck, light side is TIGIH.  Both decks 
<br/>
have antiracing, since that was pretty big in SoCal, I assumed
<br/>
the same for here in NoCal.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS v Adrian’s Court (POTH, MP/YCHF, TINT/OE)
<br/>
<br/>
He uses POTH to pull Boelo and puts him and Televan (the alien
<br/>
who deploys for zero and cancels Beggar) to the AC.  I deploy
<br/>
Orrimaarko to the SArlacc Pit and move Luke to the Endor DB.
<br/>
He drains and gets Mara out from reserve using the AC text.
<br/>
He sets up a big drain in the AC with Gailid, POTF, and Mara w/
<br/>
saber.  I setup drains at the Pit, Endor DB (w/Luke’s saber), 
<br/>
&amp; Tatooine DB.  So were’re both draining for 4.  He’s losing
<br/>
his ships to drains so I deploy Kessel and put the Radiant VII
<br/>
there with her 2 pilots aboard.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I’m ahead in drains.  I also draw a Control, so I cancel his
<br/>
only drain then I deploy Ounee Ta to get the Control back and 
<br/>
play it again next turn.  He spreads to the Dungeon to drain but
<br/>
Lando w/ Ax and Chewie make an appearance, but I draw like crap
<br/>
and dont get to stack a card.  But I do clear the site.  So the
<br/>
game ends in a drain with only 1 battle all game, and no cards 
<br/>
stacked.  Win by 29.  2 (+29).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Getting that Kessel drain.
<br/>
Worst: Kinda boring without battles.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS v Kyle Ishimaru’s WYS racing
<br/>
<br/>
I flash Anakin’s pod with Sebulba and flip 1st turn with Lott 
<br/>
Dod and the senator who allows only 1 destiny at BG sites.  I
<br/>
deploy Maul to his site for free and move him to the Arena.  He
<br/>
just draws, and on my turn he draws bad for race destiny (5,2,1 
<br/>
I believe).  So we’re going along and I’ve finally got Maul at
<br/>
the Tat DB to drain for 3 thanks to Motion Supported.  I don’t
<br/>
draw a whole lot of characters, except Senators, and I am using
<br/>
Lott Dod to fetch my Pod Collisions.  Han &amp; Luke come out and get
<br/>
in a few beatdowns, but I have all 4 political effects on table
<br/>
so I can swing any battle by 6 (add 3 to my draw, subtract 3 from 
<br/>
their draw).
<br/>
<br/>
The race is almost over, we both draw our destiny and I have 30 to
<br/>
his 29, so I win the race, and that pretty much seals the game.
<br/>
However, I have Tarkin and a Coruscant Guard at a site and Kyle
<br/>
deploys EPP Luke and a smuggler to hit Tarkin and make him lost
<br/>
using SATM/BP from lost pile and I take 11 battle damage.  Ouch.
<br/>
Then i drain him out for the win by 24.  4 (+53).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Winning the race.
<br/>
Worst: Luke beating down a poor Coruscant guard
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v Alfred Dong’s PodProfit
<br/>
<br/>
I dont start any aliens in the AC to guard Han.  I just deploy
<br/>
Maul and pull Lott using Phantom menace.  Then I deploy Tikkes
<br/>
and flip.  I stalled Anakin’s Pod, of course.  He drops Qui-Gon
<br/>
in the AC but doesnt free Han yet.  After I’ve drained a bit, he
<br/>
frees Han to retrieve.  I play a Pod Collision, he plays Too Close
<br/>
For Comfort, so I sense, and end up losing a SAC war so my 
<br/>
collision is lost and all my Sense &amp; Alters are in my used pile
<br/>
now, while he’s probably got more in his hand.
<br/>
<br/>
He plays Step backwards a couple times, but luckily for me we are
<br/>
tied 4 times throughout the race (at 0, 15, 19, and 20) so I get
<br/>
to stall Anakin each time.  But I cant get a collision through.
<br/>
Meanwhile he’s only hitting me for 1 force per turn due to Profit
<br/>
damage (I cancel his drain).  He spreads later to increase the 
<br/>
Profit damage to 2.  He’s got a few twix sites out so he’s 
<br/>
activating a good amount.  Then the race ends when he has 26 to
<br/>
my 25, so I play my last Pod collision, expecting a sense or Too
<br/>
Close for Comfort but he has nothing so I remove a 5 and win the
<br/>
race 25 to 21.  That ends the game.  Win by 18.  6 (+71).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Winning the race.
<br/>
Worst: No battles
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v Alex Stefanko’s Senate deck 
<br/>
<br/>
He flips 2nd turn while I drain and move Luke to the Endor DB.  
<br/>
He sets up weakly in the Senate, so I challenge him in there with
<br/>
Mas, Sei, and Yarua (Bacta Tank on table).  So I kill some Senators
<br/>
before he reinforces the Senate and kicks me out of there for good.
<br/>
But it did keep him from using his senator’s text (especially Lott)
<br/>
and Yarua is so cool since he -2 from a wealth senator’s politics
<br/>
to keep him from having a majority.  Like I said though, my 3 guys
<br/>
only held out so long before they died and I redeployed them else-
<br/>
where (using the Tank).
<br/>
<br/>
Ben and Qui-gon showed up at my Tat DB, but Dr E and 2 battle droids
<br/>
showed up, 1 with a blaster.  He shot and operated on Ben (damn 
<br/>
senators are +2 or +3 destiny), and beatdown Qui-gon with a 9 destiny
<br/>
draw (droid rifle is destiny 6 then he added 3 to it).  I finally get
<br/>
rid of Dr E but the droids hold out against me with his high destiny.
<br/>
This game goes to time, my 20 to his 16.  I don’t get to stack any 
<br/>
cards.  Later he showed how he normally draws destiny of 11 each draw
<br/>
using a droid blaster (destiny 6) then having An Entire Legion of my
<br/>
Best Troops (+2 to blaster rifle destiny), then adds 3 using his 
<br/>
effect.  Pretty nasty.  Then he also used Inconsequential Losses so
<br/>
he just forfeited a rifle to his used pile to satisfy attrition on me.
<br/>
Just sick.  Timed win by 20.  7 (+91).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Putting up a fight in the Senate.
<br/>
Worst: No cards stacked.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS v Paul McKelvey’s No Money, No Parts deck
<br/>
<br/>
He owned me this game.  1st turn he drops Vader to endor DB,
<br/>
Televan to Mos Espa, and Watto to Junkyard, I lose 2 force.  I have
<br/>
nothinh to counter with, so i just move Luke over and draw.  he 
<br/>
drains, I lose 2 more to his objective, he drops Zuckuss in MH to the
<br/>
Tat system (he deployed) and drops Tat Occupation.  I could’ve cried.
<br/>
Now I’m losing a bunch of force and its only the 3rd turn.  I get Ben
<br/>
and Qui-Gon to Mos Espa, and he moves Xizor and Maul over from the
<br/>
junkyard.  He drops Emp to backup Vader and I move Qui and Ben to the
<br/>
junkyard.  I’m drawing all my red like my racing interrupts and the
<br/>
characters I do draw are sucky ones like the Radiant VII pilots and 
<br/>
senators.  My deck just sucks vs Watto because Watto deck goes too
<br/>
fast for me.  I battle at the junkyard to end the game and he plays
<br/>
Maul Strikes and I have you now plus Watto’s cube and draws a bunch
<br/>
of destiny.  Lose by 25.  7 (+66).
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS v Paul’s WYS racing (starts Insight/Staging)
<br/>
<br/>
I draw no characters opening hand, AND no pod collisions.  I do draw
<br/>
Zuckuss in MH though.  I draw, he flips in space with Mirax and Theron
<br/>
in their ships to Kessel and Tat.  I kill Mirax w/ Zuckuss and draw,
<br/>
looking for Maul.  He’s way ahead in the race by the time I draw a
<br/>
Maul, still havent drawn a collision (4 in the deck).  He’s already
<br/>
played 2 step backwards on me, and he’s at like 18 while I’m at 7.
<br/>
So I go for the drains, I finally flip and am draining for good 
<br/>
amounts thanks to Motion Supported.  But he gets Menace fades going
<br/>
and now I’m hurting.  He wins the race, and now he’s retrieving due
<br/>
to I Did It!  That’s the reason I play antiracing, not because of the
<br/>
12 force swing, but because I Did It is a killer.
<br/>
<br/>
But I’m still canceling his drains so he’s not doing much damage to 
<br/>
me.  But then he kills me off in space and has Battle Plan on table,
<br/>
so I’m done.  His retrieval plus my having to pay for drains means
<br/>
he can come back big time, so i draw up to prevent him from getting a
<br/>
lot of force back.  Lose by 2.  7 (+64).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: None really, except canceling a LOT of his drains.
<br/>
Worst: Losing the race, losing in space.
<br/>
<br/>
Paul goes undefeated, Alfred takes 2nd.  I end up in 7th I think.
<br/>
I’m running a tourney on Sept 15th in Pleasanton, so I hope you all
<br/>
who can show up will show up.  thanks for reading.
