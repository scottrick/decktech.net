<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well the day before I thought that I had my decks good to go. A few people had finally made some type II decks, and brought them in to play. Like I thought my dark deck just plays like a beast, and is yet to lose a type II game and has taken out its fair share of constructed decks. So you can see my confidence in my dark deck, my light deck on the other hand is another story. When I play tested this deck, it was mostly against constructed decks. Since it won a few, and never really lost by that many I thought it was good enough. It probably was good enough too, but for some reason I changed the deck completely. It went from a ground assult/drain deck, to a here is some senators a qui-gon and naboo system with a bunch of naboo starfighters. What was I thinking? Well, even though I should have kept the deck the way it was, it did rather well. 
<br/>
So the tourney comes, and for some reason nobody has any confidence in the light side. Out of the eight people we got to play, I would have to say that atleast six thought light was not gonna get one win. People are making predictions that the winner is gonna have two wins, both from their dark decks. Well we were wrong, and here is why:
<br/>
Round one I play Mikes Dark Senator deck with my Light Senate/Space/Qui-Gon pile of cards
<br/>
The game starts off just the way I thought it would, he sets up at the senate. Meanwhile, I set up the Naboo space drain as fast as I can, and try to find senators to maybe stand a chance in the senate. I throw down Yoda in his new house for some activation, maybe? Well he comes down with the spy, breaks and drops Maul with saber and just breaks my Yoda. Afterwards he has a steady drain of three there, which didnt really hurt till the end of the game. As i seemingly shut the drain down by canceling it almost every turn, with controls and senators in the effect. I had altered his effect off the table, so my drain up in the sky hurt him pretty badly. The only other thing I could do, was try and beat him out of the senate. The senate was the only exciting place the entire game. Battles left and right, majority shifting from turn to turn. Though I put up a good fight in the senate he took control in the end. Which caused me to reflip my objective, and ended my ability to cancel Mauls drain of four with senators. All I had left were controls, and they eventually ran out. From there it became a drain race to the end, which he eventually won. A turn too late I deployed the 2/2 endor site, and landed two starfighters. Had I done this a turn or two earlier I may have won, but Mike pulled this game out by five cards. 
<br/>
FL 0(-5)
<br/>
<br/>
Well as expected, first round every dark side player won. However, unexpectedly my lose was only but 5 and worried some other players. They expected my light deck to possibly win its next game, considering it lost by so little when every other light deck lost by atleast 25 cards.
<br/>
<br/>
Now second round my dark Senate/Maul takes on Brads Hyperdrive Generators Gone
<br/>
This game was in my view, and I am sure Brad will agree, a brutal @#$% kicking. I had this game from the beginning, with a early set up in the senate. And Maul out too quickly, just beating the hell out of his characters. His podrace did nothing, when I lost the cards I just retrieved them a few turns later with Squabling. There was really nothing he could have done, when I hit the point that I thought he had nothing to do. I set up what my deck was truly built for, sit and drain at one site and retrieve 1 to 2 force a turn. Its simple, have Maul and company sit at the site where you spend 3 force to retrieve one, drain for two, and use Yeb Yeb and the Hutt b!tch to retrieve another. Once Brad caught on to this evil cycle he drew up. So the game goes rather quick, and at this point the theory has held true. Second round along with my dark deck winning by 29, every other game that was over finished with a dark victory. The one game remaining was Dans, and he was light. I looked over and remember thinking what just about everyone else thought, why couldnt I play the newbie? Well Dan went on to be the first light side winner.
<br/>
FW 2(+24)
<br/>
<br/>
Third Round my dark takes on Dan and his Quote Unquote light deck (he was using Bills light deck cause he didnt have one, and won with it in the second round. but because he and Bill were both light this game, he used Matts light deck)
<br/>
Another fast game, where nothing could have been done. I had set the deck up first turn, and was waiting for him to do something. Then I noticed he was starting to save force, and predicted a Jar-Jar deployment coming soon. I brought down some back up to Maul, and next turn the rumble began. Maul took out Qui-Gon, and my P59/60 took out some little guys and caused a 3 force loss (Jar-Jar didnt blow-up, cause he drew a 0). Rune destroyed his dreams of killing anyone, I guessed correctly how nice right. And the table for his side was cleared, mine on the other hand remained as it was to begin with. A turn or two later I set up the what I like to call Force Cycle, he cant drain me I retrieve and drain. He shortly there after is drained out, and I win by 35.
<br/>
FW 4(+59)
<br/>
Now there are a few light side victories, and the theory of everyone going 2 and 2 is far from over. With one game left everyone has one loss, however some at this moment are 2 and 1. So basicly if I want to even think about takin this home, I need to win with my light. 
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth Round my Light pile of cards takes on Mot and his Dark Senate/Maul deck.
<br/>
I knew I was gonna have to work fast this game. After he set up in the senate and had Mual (with no saber and no drain) on tatooine on his first turn, I set up a drain at Naboo system. Or so I thought, after maybe three drains with no effect to cancel my drains (altered early) he came to the sky and just powered me out of the air. The following turn, with no fear of Maul Qui-Gon with saber came down with the 2/2 site for Naboo and drained for three the remainder of the game. The senate had a few battles here and there, but I used my ability to cancel drains with the effect to stop the system drain and set up my senators. Once they hit the effect, I deployed them the next turn to Yoda and his council chamber. When I got enough of them out, I walked into the senate and booted the dark side out. Now he had nothing to drain with, and I had a drain of four going. In a last effort to try and win, he came to Naboo with one of his sites and had a drain of two on it. Within three turns I over ran the site with power, and took over that site. Within 6 turns the game was over from drains, and in complete rage Mot took his lost pile and threw it. Fortunately for me, any win means I win the tourney. I took down Mot by 19 cards, given me the highest diff.
<br/>
6(+78)
<br/>
<br/>
So I walk away with the Maul foil (not really, the moment Dan gets it it is headed for EBAY), and Dan wins the random drawing foil Qui-Gon (which Im sure will hit EBAY as well).
<br/>
Top four are as followed:
<br/>
1 I take first
<br/>
2 Moxless
<br/>
3 Brad
<br/>
4 Mot
