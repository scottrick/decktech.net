Brave New Worlds
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
STOP THERE IF YOU DON"T LIKE DIRECTOR’S REPORTS!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Ah...  It feels good to run my regular tournaments again...and to play too!!  I feel like for 3 years I was cheated!!!
<br/>
<br/>
If you realize, "Hey, that’s not Ted’s usual hangout," you are correct.  We arrived between 11:45 and 12:15 at RPG Outpost in Glenside, but the owner never showed!!  I put up a sign and took a chance by caravaning everyone around the way to Brave New Worlds, which is about 5 minutes away.  They often have other games going on, but they had room for the motley assortment that was my tournament!!  
<br/>
<br/>
A few new faces played today.  A few old faces came back.  State Runner-up Dan Bordier (NOT RAY!!) stopped by for a cameo appearance and autographs, but had to leave once we got under way.  The decks were varied, including WYS, Profit, ISB, SYCFA, QMC, Dark Real, Ties, HB Mains, Strike Team, Black Sun, and Rallops.  All the decks had a good share of Tatooine characters, Podracing (Sebulba ALWAYS wins, right Greg?), and even a Both Ops deck came back for surprise value.
<br/>
<br/>
Kim Caton tells me that she has to work at 4pm, so we quickly get things started at about 12:30.  I also start so we have an even number at 12.  After 2 games, the top 4 were:
<br/>
<br/>
Andy Talaga    4(49)
<br/>
Bob Caton      4(20)
<br/>
Ryan Lynch     4(15)
<br/>
TD Masta P     2(22)
<br/>
<br/>
So we pair off again at about 2:15, having made up some time.  I get a double shellaquing from Ryan and Jared Napolitano, so I drop quite a bit.   After 4 games (approx. 3:55), Kim leaves for work after going 3-1, I drop to even things out, and the employee asks us how long we’re gonna be.  I told him that we usually play 6 games and would be done by 6pm.  He informs me that the store closes at 5pm and he had to leave then for a committment.  I poll the players and ask if they want two "turbo games" of if they wanted to call it a day at 4 games.  In the spirit of the game, the elect to play the 2 games in 60 minutes (I’ll hear it about that I’m sure!!).  After 4 games:
<br/>
<br/>
Andy Talaga     8(68)
<br/>
Ryan Lynch      6(33)
<br/>
Kim Caton       6(26)   now dropped
<br/>
Bob Caton       6(15)
<br/>
Greg Shaw       4(14)
<br/>
<br/>
So we start turbo round.  Despite my reminders every 5 minutes, these games go quickly and a few people take chances, get a little reckless, and even draw up to avoid the timed decision.  In the final games there were only 3 timed wins.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Standings:
<br/>
<br/>
1.    Andy Talaga     10(76)
<br/>
2.    Greg Shaw        8(77)  won bonus "77" prize
<br/>
3.    Jared Napolitano 8(26)
<br/>

<br/>
5.    Kim Caton        6(26)
<br/>
6.    Bob Caton        6(-29)
<br/>
7.    Bill Kafer       6(-40)
<br/>

<br/>
10.   Mike Kiesling    3(-43)
<br/>
11.   TD Masta P       2(-22)
<br/>
12.   Joe Streleckis   2(-51)
<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side wins:   19
<br/>
Light Side wins:  15
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think a few people were planning on more detailed reports.  My gameplay was very half-hearted despite the look on SOMEONE’s face when my Sebulba won HIS podrace.  Sebulba ALWAYS wins!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all the new folks (4!!!) that came today!!  See some of you at Origins and the rest at my 7/29 tournament, hopefully back at RPG Outpost!!
