<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, here’s another tourney I got permission to go to. Great. I was disappointed about the performances of my decks at the last tourney, so I trashed them both, and built 2 new ones. I had no one to play test with, so I went into the tourney blind, 2 brand new, off-the-presses decks. I like Endor the best, so I based both decks around that system. That later proved to be my folly and also a good idea.
<br/>
<br/>
DS: Endor Operations. My dream deck. It starts Biker Scout Gear, IAO, and Combat Response. I finally got the cards needed, and built this one with only one purpose in mind: mad destinies, and mad drains. No wait, 2 purposes in mind: mad destinies, mad drains, and heavy reacting. No, 3 main&amp;#8230; Oh, what’s the use? Some of my main purposes are mad destinies, mad drains, and heavy reacting. This will be posted on my page, please review it "Endor Operations/This Outpost Has Been Secured"; I think you will like it a lot. I did. The only problem with my DS deck is that I have to have a large number of cards on the table for it to work. So my wins are by small differentials, but they are still wins.
<br/>
<br/>
LS: I went with a standard TIGIH deck that stays on Endor and has a lot of weapons and Rebel Scouts, starting Strike Planning, Insurrection, and Superficial Damage. This deck totally sucked [as I came to know later] and will not be posted. It’s a waste of time. It has already been trashed.
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: Whenever I say I deployed a Saber pilot with his matching ship, that is because I used Combat Response to do so. I do not say it, as I think it is understood. I had uncanny luck, always finding the ship or the pilot I needed [maybe the force was with me, I don’t know].
<br/>
<br/>
I got to Galactic Quest at 9:30, as that was the time my dad had to work. So I grabbed a book, and read. 
<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the tourney starts around 12, and I’m ready to go.
<br/>
There were 24 people there, and I hoped to place in the to half. My rating, I think, is 1492.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My LS POS v/s Hitson Taylor’s [1426] COTVG with Rancor. 
<br/>
He starts Power Of The Hutt, All Wrapped Up and Inconsequential Losses. I start my usual. He draws up for 2 turns straight. No arguments from me. I hit him with drains of 4 from turn 3 that are never answered. G. Solo, Paige, G. Calrissian, Beezer, and Cracken go to Mos Eisley for a drink. Crix, Midge and Panno are partying on Endor, with Luke sitting alone at CCH, playing with his Lightsaber the whole time. Anyway, he deploys Jodo Kast, Boba Fett [CC], Jabba’s barge with passenger deck, some dude driving it who adds 3 to it’s power, Iggy with gun and some other guy, he initiates. I shoot the other guy; he shoots Beezer and Cracken, who are captured coz of AWU. He moves the 2 captives to the dungeon, retrieving 4 force. This makes the scouts on Tatooine mad, joined by Greeve and Kensaric. These fellows move to the Sarlacc Pit, leaving Greeve at Eisley with a A280 gun, and Orrimarrko for protection. He has now flipped. The Mandalorian Armored duo moves the captives to the Audience Chamber, and Rancor is deployed to his pit. Cracken falls into the Trap Door, and is eaten. This further pisses the Tatooine located scouts, who move into the Audience Chamber to meet Iggy, Fett, Kast and Arica, who broke her cover the previous turn. Beezer has the very same fate as Cracken, and now the Rebels are raving mad. Solo, with Mercenary Armor, shoots Arica, and Iggy forgets he has a gun. I draw a 6; he draws a 1. Arica takes it, while Kensaric leaves the party. Next turn, Bruckman joins Solo and crew, along with Janse. Fett gets shot [I’m officially shocked at my high destinies], and Iggy still forgets his game text. I draw a 5, he has no draw [no reserve]. He loses the battle 33 to 16, clearing the site. I spread and drain him out. He has no characters left to fight; they all died or got stacked. I had 4 cards under I Feel The Conflict. 
<br/>
FW by 24.
<br/>
Highs: Actually winning my first game for once.
<br/>
Lows: No Vader. That sucked big time. Also, I forgot that I could move Luke.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 2, +24.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS v/s Andy Paulk’s [1479] Hidden Base X-wing swarm.
<br/>
He starts Wise Advice, Your Insight Serves You Well, and Do Or Do Not. I always start my usual. He gives me no force, but I’m not worried. DS-181-4 and Saber 4 orbit the Endor system, and Ominous Rumors comes down. I also deploy the Forest Clearing, which was in my hand. He deploys Kashyyyk, Sullust and Kessel. Next turn Fel in Saber 1 goes to Kessel, Barich on bike, Tempest Scout 6 and Avarik come down, as well as ESB. Second turn flip. Cool! He deploys Tatooine. 3 X-wings go for free to Rendezvous Point [RP], as well as Lando in Falcon. X-wings go to Tatooine, while LIF stays at RP. Next turn, I drain him for 4 at Endor system, 2 at Clearing and 1 at the Platform, 3 at Kessel. 10 force total. Bossk in HT, and Dominator say hello to the 3 X-wings. I initiate battle, drawing a 6 and 5, while he gets no destiny. He loses by 12, losing all the X-wings. I move the two ships to Kashyyyk for bigger drains. The next turn he draws up. I drain for 17 [4 at Kashyyyk, 5 at Endor, 5 at Clearing, Back Door and Platform, 3 at Kessel] and deploy some more. He draws up some more. I drain for 21 [same as last turn + 4 at Sullust], winning the game. This game lasted 18 minutes. As I said earlier, this deck rips through everything [tested for the first time].
<br/>
FW +21 [I had a lot of cards on the table and in my hand]
<br/>
Highs: Successfully testing my DS deck. It’s so beautiful, I think I’m gonna cry&amp;#8230;
<br/>
Lows: Beating up so mercilessly on a kid. I did give him some pointers, though, and suggested what he should use or throw out.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 4, +45.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My LS POS v/s Will Gilchrist’s [1577] BHBM
<br/>
He started Secret Plans, IAO and First Strike. 
<br/>
This game went all wrong from the start. I use the wrong Luke [Rebel Scout instead of Jedi Knight]. That is what caused me the game right there. My hand had 6 weapons, 1 interrupt and Corporal Janse. I pulled Crix and Solo, but that wasn’t great shakes. My turn, Crix and Solo came down, while Crix pulled Cracken. He saves up force. I deploy Cracken and Janse to the Throne Room, giving Janse an A280. He deployed Maul and his stick there, stopping my drains. He also deployed Vader to platform, and moved in to the Hut, flipping both our objectives, and relocating us to the Throne room, where Maul is draining for 1. The Empy comes down at the DS2 DB, as I have characters at the Throne Room. Me, being stupid, moved the 2 scouts to the DB, hoping to kick the Empy’s ass. He moves away to the Throne room, with Maul following the unwanted scouts. A few turns later, Jade, Guri, and Blizzard 2 come to meet Crix, Solo, Midge and Panno. Needless to say, he won the battle. I only drew 1’s and 2’s for battle and weapon destiny the whole time, while he drew 3’s and higher. Those 3 cards won for him 7 battles. But before he could convert Luke, he drained me out, or beat me out. Details on how are a little fuzzy here, as I resigned myself once he won 3 battles. He just kept winning a lot of duels, with my sorry destinies, and could not convert Luke. I lost 3 force a turn consistently, which really hurts, combined with a drain of 3 the whole game.
<br/>
FL -25.
<br/>
Highs: None, as such. It could have been worse. There’s always the next game [my DS, hehehe]
<br/>
Lows: Drawing characters and those 2 destiny weapons for all the battles and duels.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 4, +20
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My DS v/s Rebekah Gruver’s [1331] WYS copied from Decktech.
<br/>
She started Squadron Assignments, Insurrection, and Draw Their Fire. 
<br/>
A WYS. These gave me enough force to drop OR, Saber 3 with DS-181-3, and draw some up. There I got Elsek and Drelosyn. With Tempest Scout 4 already in hand, all I needed was an Endor location. While searching my deck for OR, I saw all three sites there. She deployed Theron Nett in Red 10 to Tatooine, as well as Kessel and another system. I look at my hand. Saber 4 and Fel were there. Next turn, I deploy the TS 4, Elsek and Drelosyn on bikes. Searching my deck for ESB, I saw all 3 of my sites there. Wow. She deploys Han with gun and Tallon Karrde for the flip. Luke with stick also shows up on the Tat: DB. My turn, searching for ESB, I see that the Back Door is not there in my reserve. I drain, and draw until I get the Back Door, which was the third card in my force pile from the top. She drains and deploys R2 and 3PO next to Han, fearing a beatdown. She was gonna get one all right, but not the kind she expected. I deploy the Back Door, Fel in ship, and Saber 4 with pilot to the Tatooine system, where Nett was asleep. I initiate battle, drawing 2 destinies. He draws a 5 to power only. I draw a 5 and 4. She cleared the site, and lost 1 more. There went another Luke with stick. I moved Elsek on bike over, getting ready to flip next turn. She drew up all that she activated. I drained 9. I also deployed ESB, and flipped. This was the longest it took me to flip. Anyway, Dengar in P1 and Turr in Saber 2 go to Kessel for a chat, and the Dominator backs up Saber 3 at Endor. She draws up all her activated amount, playing 2 Tunnel Visions as she did so. Why, I don’t know. Any way, next turn; I drained 5 at the Endor system, 1 at the platform, 2 at the Back Door, 3 at Kessel, 4 at Tatooine for a total of 15. I deployed some and drew some, getting the Dark Forest. She moved R2 and 3PO to Luke for support, and drew. She knew I was going to hit her for quite a bit. She was correct. She got drained for 15 again, leaving her with one force. She drew up after draining. I finally won. This game, though seeming long and tedious, lasted 23 minutes.
<br/>
FW +14.
<br/>
Highs: Winning again. Also proving that my DS deck was not just a one-time wonder like my LS deck which is a POS.
<br/>
Lows: Deploying and drawing even though I had practically won. The differential would have been different had I been in my right mind.
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 6, +34.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: My LS POS v/s Joshua Gruver’s [1593] Ralltiir Ops.
<br/>
By the way, this is Rebekah’s elder brother, and a very nice and jovial fellow. His only shortcoming is that he calls AT-AT’s  "atats" instead of "A T A Tees" [It was very painful hearing him say that]. He started Battle Order, Imperial Arrest Order, and Mobilization Points.
<br/>
He deployed 2 Tempest Scouts to the DS docking [which he also deployed] with 2 AT-ST pilots. I followed with Cracken, G. Calrissian and Beezer. He deploys Blizzard 2 and initiates battle. He draws a 6, which becomes a 7 for attrition. Now I have to lose 2 scouts or Calrissian. I, being stupid, lose the 2 scrub scouts. I activate to little to move Calrissian away, as Vader and Tarkin are at the Platform with Crix and Bruckman. I deploy Greeve from reserve, and Kensaric, and Luke moves over to be captured. I flip. He initiates battle against lone Lando, who loses the battle by 14. Ouch. That’s Calrissian and 7 more. My hand is empty, so I have to lose 6 off the top. I lose both my Insertion Planning’s, 3 scouts, my other Luke and Aim High. He then transfers over to the Spaceport DB at Ralltiir. He flips the next turn. I never get space-worthy, the drain -1 coz of his objective is restricting my drains, as I won’t pay 3 force to drain for 0. He drains heavily, and I never win any of the battles in the game. He even Sniper’s Luke with Vader’s stick, flipping me back. All I could do was watch as my force kept decreasing, and his stayed the same. He drained me out in the end.
<br/>
FL -14.
<br/>
Highs: He drew too many cards, and my differential was not hurt considerably.
<br/>
Lows: This deck lost twice. I have yet to master the art of a good LS deck. Anyway, the brother reclaimed what the sister lost. I found it really funny. 
<br/>
<br/>
Score: 6, +20.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My DS v/s Jed Humphreys’ [1572] Profit deck.
<br/>
Jed is a nice guy, and I really wanted to play him. Well, here’s my opportunity to go 3 for 3 with my DS deck.
<br/>
He starts The Camp, Draw Their Fire and Your Insight Serves You Well.
<br/>
I have no aliens, so I resign to getting my drains up ASAP. My hand is beautiful. Dark Forest, Avarik, Barich, Misik, Tempest Scout 6, ESB, Saber 1 and Battle Deployment. I pull OR, deploy my third site, find Fel and deploy him to Endor in his ship, and Battle Deployment and OR. He looks at OR closely. Next turn, he frees Han with Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight [LSJK] with stick. He retrieves his lost pile of 1 force. He also deploys the Tatooine site that is where the Vaporator adds 1 to drains. Padawan Obi with stick goes there. He ends his turn, flipping. Finally, a deck that flipped faster than my DS deck. This should be fun. I drained for 2, and deployed Barich on a bike, Misik on a bike, and TS 6 to 3 respective sites. ESB hit the table, and I flipped. I drew up. He drains for 5, and hits me for 1. He deploys Chewie to the Palace, and moves Han there. Boussh gets deployed Undercover to TS 6. I drain him for 8, and he loses 3 systems. Damn. There go my space drains. This damage goes back and forth a couple of more turns. Him for 8, me for 8 now, I have 24 force left, and he has 26. His turn, he hits me for 8, leaving me with 16. He breaks Boussh’s cover at TS 6’s site and initiates battle. I react Barich on bike, and Misik on bike there. He draws a 2, which I subtract using Barich’s gametext. I draw a 2. He loses by 14, losing Boussh and 9 more. My turn, I hit him for 9, and move the 2 biker scouts. He hits me for 8. I now have 8; he has 15. The last card I lost to Profit damage was Avarik, a biker scout. I hit him for 11, and look at my possible moves. I forgot that my objective says I can retrieve one biker scout during my draw phase. I say those fateful words "May the force be with you". He hits me for 8, winning by 4 force.
<br/>
FL -4.
<br/>
Highs: A very close game that could have gone either way. It is always fun playing Jed, and it was so again.
<br/>
Lows: Belatedly, I realized that I could have retrieved Avarik, leaving me with one force at the end of his turn, winning me the game by 1. How could I have been so STUPID!!I would have kicked myself, but I would have missed, I was so mad! A veritable win turned into a loss, by my own ignorance! The irony is harsh.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Score: 6, +16. [It should have been 8, +21. But I’m a moron.]
<br/>
<br/>
I placed 10 out of 24, which I think is a big improvement over my last one. But I could have done better if I remembered&amp;#8230; Oh, get on with it&amp;#8230; All right.
<br/>
Anyway, I got a cool "The Empire Strikes Back" poster, and a pose-able Dash Rendar for prize support, so that washed away my disappointment.
<br/>
<br/>
