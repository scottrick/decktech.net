<br/>
<br/>
-*-*-*-*-Pre-Tournament Junk-*-*-*-*-
<br/>
<br/>
	With the recent release of the Tatooine expansion this was one of the hardest tournaments to prepare for. I spent many hours looking at different decks on decktech and talking tech over AIM with many different people. I had examined the cards I had available to me (which isnt the best selection) and the objectives and their advantages and disadvantages with Tatooine. 
<br/>
	After many hours of looking at decks I decided for light side I was going to bring an RST. I had tested it a few times and it is a machine. I call it RST: The Cheap Way! It had won with differentials of 10, 16, and 36. Youll see how it works in my sixth game of the tournament. It 
<br/>
combined many different RST’s I had viewed on Decktech.
<br/>
	Deciding what to bring for Dark side was even harder. I had made many different decks before the tourney. I did not know what to expect other than QMC and RST. Those were what I thought were popular in my area. My first deck I made was Ral Ops Hidden Podracing. After you flipped you pull the podracing cards, and does not give the opponent a chance to deploy Anakins Podracer (thats with the starting interrupt). This deck was terrible though. It was way to slow and lost mad to Profit and other Mains Decks. Then a day before the tourney I switched to Court, but decided I didnt have enough strong ground characters and was not very confident about it. Then about 16 hours before the tourney while watching a repeat of SNL I decided to make my old Endor Ops deck that is has a terrible record. I remade it and updated it for Tatooine. But had no time to test it. 
<br/>
	I Fell asleep at 1:00 AM with a 75 card Dark deck. In the morning I did not know what to take out. I ended up taking out some Space and Interrupts. After I finished my Dark deck my dog decided to eat a whole bag of Hershey’s kisses, Foil wrapped with the works. He then came into my room and vomited on alot of my cards. Needless to say I was pissed it took 45 minutes to get the nasty crap looking Vomit off my floor. My dad drove me their at 9:30. On the way we stopped at Mcdonalds and I had a Hash Brown and a Cold Breakfast sandwich. I arrived at 10:15 for a 12:00 
<br/>
tourney
<br/>
	I was their very early because I had to beg people for some automatic charges, Deactivate the Shield Generator, RST, and Strike Planning. When I got their I bought 6 packs of cards The 2 best Rares were Sebulba AI and Anakins pod which I needed. I then went to get my decks to switch the cards and WTF, It wasnt their. I had to call my dad and he brought it back to Beyond Reality, he was helpful, but needless to say he was pissed. People started showing up at 11:00. We started about 5 minutes late because are tourney director Mike M. was trading for some cards he needed to finish his set.

<br/>
Game 1      My Light Side RST vs Zach Cute’s Court Deck
<br/>
<br/>
I Start my usual that is: The Shield Is Down, Strike Planning, and Ultimatum. He starts some Court effects also. We kind of just did our own thing for most of the time. I Stacked all my scouts and mains at the Bunker while he drained me and flipped. I couldnt get the da*n Bunker blown up after losing one of my Automatic Charges after a force drain from the top. about 3 turns til the end i was down By like 30. I had about 15 in force while he had 40 something. He doesnt expect it, but I play Nabrun Leids to move all my characters at the Bunker to the Landing Platform where he has one character, I think it was Lord Vader. He ends up losing 25 or something force and Lord Vader. My next turn I used good old Nabrun again to move all my guys at the Landing Platform to a site where he had two characters. I win the battle and he has to lose the characters and about 20 force thats game. Afterwards he noticed he had to Senses in his hand and he could have canceled both Nabruns! He normally would have won. FW 5

Game 2-My Endor Ops vs Profit
<br/>
<br/>
Not much happened this game. I didnt start an alien because I didnt feel like it. (Dont ask me why) I drained while he Drained not too many battles. Needless to say he freed Han. We both kept on draining each other. I never got Ominous Rumors set up, but my space outdid his gorund and I pull out the win by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FW 4 (+12) 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3-      My Endor Ops vs Zachs Profit
<br/>
<br/>
Another Profit. Lots of mains in his deck I saw a bit of it before the game started. Again I didnt start an alien, Ive never actually played a Profit before today so. Well he Freed Han and he had all of his mains at different sites. My hand was terible all game. I was taking about 8 direct damage a turn while giving him a drain of 1 or 2. I lost because of bad hand all game, probably would have lost anyway. FL 30ish
<br/>
<br/>
4 (-??)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4-      My RST vs Stephen Behr’s Tie Interceptor Deck 
<br/>
<br/>
Ive played him at every tournament Ive been to except one sometimes more than twice. I Always lose to him except one time I beat him. Hes playing a Space deck and my deck cant win if they dont deploy anyone on the ground. He started Battle Order and some other stuff. He had Rendzvous Point and just kept on draining me at different space systems while I sat their and wacthed. I deployed all my guys to the Bunker. Mid-Game I attempted to Blow the Bunker with two automatic Charges on the Bunker, but kept on drawing Ones and Twos. He was draining me for about 6 a turn. Mid-game he deployed Arica down to Rebel Landing Site. We argued about an Undercover spy occupying a site. When you review tell me if an Undercover spy is considered occupying a site. the TD said she was so he didnt have to pay to drain. I was looking frantically for Corran Horn, but also lost him off the top and tried to do On the Edge without tracking to get him back, but failed. He drained me to Death. 4(-?)

Game 5     My Dark Endor Ops vs his Light Space QMC
<br/>
<br/>
I knew he was playing space QMC before we started because we talked before. He let me borrow his automatic charge. When he told me he was playing space QMC Im like WTF!?!?! He wasnt even using the new objective enhancer (he didnt know their was one) and he didnt know how to podrace. He never flipped. Not much went on. He deployed Haven to Sullust when he had no one their. Then I deployed Dengar in Punishing One to cancel it adn started laughing at how stupid he was. I then move him to Kiffex and deployed some other Ships their. With my ground and space drains I was draining about 6 a turn. Most of his ships could not move to Kiffex. He drained for about 2 a turn. Their were some minor battles in space, but nothing huge happened. FW ??

Game 6      My RST Vs a Girls MKOS  
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, dont remember your name. Her Rep was Pete Snitkin. This game was FUN FUN FUN!!! (for me). I deployed all my scouts and mains to the Bunker while she deployed 1 or 2 guys to different sites and flipped to start the drains. I had about 15 characters At the Bunker and I finally was able to blow up the freakin Bunker!!! That was about mid-game. She lost 8 force I retrieved 8 and her hand went to the used pile. The same turn I used the famous Nabrun Leids to transit my 15 characters to her 2 at a Jabbas Palace Site. I captured on guy with Lando with Vibro Axe and 
<br/>
missed when I swang at the other. She drew a destiny 1 and I drew a destiny 6. She lost the character and about 30 more, and that was game. FW 33

<br/>
	Well overall I finish 6th out of 18 people. This was the best ive ever finished a tournament and I was actually happy to win 4 games, That was also my goal. Prize Support was Tatooine and 2 Box toppers. We drafted. When it came to me I had a choice between Jar-Jar, Box Topper Obi, 
<br/>
and Box Topper Boba. I Chose a foily Obi. The second time it came around to me I took Sebulbas Podracer. First place took a Darth Maul and Second got a Qui or Obi, dont remember
<br/>
	So both of my decks go 2-1. Im going to remake my RST to deal with space a bit better and take apart my Endor Ops all together and maybe make a Tie Swarm. I expected my dark side to do terrible, but it all worked out. Hope you enjoyed reading the Tournament Report.
