<br/>
Once again time for another local here in Texas. Tournaments have been scarce for a long time, now it seems there is one every week. Not that I m complaining. This
<br/>
report is probably going to be on the long side, so feel free to skip to the games below. And no one take offense. This was written with a grain of salt, so do not take everything seriously. With a new set playtesting is important. Tatooine did not really provide new
<br/>
deck types but seemed to help quite a few. Podracing for the lightside blows worse than Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge. Must be because Sebulba swallow. After playtesting
<br/>
with /Begin gratutuious @#$% kissing/ Texas State Champ and Hunt Down Master &amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren/ End @#$% kissing/ , he introduced me to a HDADTJ with racing that was brutal and a QMC full of paths and tons of other interrupts that was just too good not to play. After finishing second to Hoostino at a tourney last week doing my best Van
<br/>
impersonation by losing to Justin twice even though I knew what he was playing, I was ready to try again without him there. Hoostino tried to help me out even though he was not
<br/>
going to be there by dragging me to Dennys the night before. Remebering the labor pains I suffered last time and the black bile that oozed out of my pores last time I refuse and settle for Reeses PB pie. Much more gooder. Other than the standard horrible service and
<br/>
drunken rednecks that inhabit Dennys at night, nothing too exciting happened.  I followed my standard tipping rule of leaving 50 cents per tooth, so the waitress actually
<br/>
owed us money at the end of the night. Off I went to Austin to find an amazing turn-out of 30 people. That is huge for a local here. States only drew 40+. I saw lots of old faces
<br/>
and a few new. Always a good sign. Anyway on to the games:
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 
<br/>
DS Huntdown/Pod Race vs. Reid Delfeld (1594) EBO (Strike planning, Insurrection, ?)
<br/>
<br/>
Great , just what I wanted to see. A heavy Space deck when I am light on space. Oh well, Huntdown is still a machine.  Visage eats away at him as I podrace uncontested
<br/>
to his low destinies. Tech Mor and Empy come down and sit in the Holotheatre watching VOTE on the big screen. Gotta be better than the XFL. He flips with Beezer, Madine and
<br/>
Figgy. I wait till I have 11 cards lost to win the podrace. He deploys Gen Lando in Gold Squadron 1 to Kiffex. I cant have that , so using a tracked 7 with BIHT, I make Lando
<br/>
bend over for one of what would be many times for me today. I lose Bossk, who I retrieve with my 11, numbers hits for 6 during the podrace damage, Vader and stick sit at the
<br/>
podrace arena and the smell of victory is in the air. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just the Colt 45 that Lando spilled on his way out. After losing 18 cards in one turn combine with another 8 or so to Visage, Reid had little resources left to challenge me with. From There it was just a matter of mop-up work. 
<br/>
FW 2 +32
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: This Huntdown is a beast. Few decks play themselves, but even Pauly Shore could win with this HDADTJ. Isnt he dead anyway?
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: With racial tension running high, I hated to beat down Uncle Tom, errr Lando but it had to happen. The Watts riots were really about the power shortages in LA anyway.
<br/>
Sucks to live in So. Cal.
<br/>
<br/>
Reid is a good player for the limited cards base he has and always makes a game tough, especially with his ties. It was good to see him again.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 LS QMC vs. Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8220;Weiner&amp;#8221; (1950)  Old School Skrillings ETE start
<br/>
<br/>
WTF? Who plays this jizz any more. But this is from the guy who created Bantha for Bubo. I have a bad feeling about skrillings, so Insight never leaves. First turn he deploys
<br/>
all his sites and draws a few. I throw Epp Obi down, Battle Plan and deploy a site. His turn , Baby Jabba, Pote Gailid , Scum  hit the table along with Den Of Thieves. Hmm this does not look good. I really wish I had a Grimtaash about now. I get Capt Up at the system with Dash after I flipped and Tunnel for Menace. He drain for about 6 before I get Menace fades down and deploys 6 skrillings against Obi who pathed far away. He drops a few  lone skrillings  to various Jabbas sites over the next few turns. Feeling brave, I send Melas, and Epp Luke down to rape one. Uhh barrier Melas, NSP Luke and I can feel my daily dose of prison lovin coming as he Abyssians for another skrilling , uses one off the den and drops 2 more. Melas and 10 is never good. Of that 10 , I lost 2 edges and CC celebration all in a row from my reserve. Thing went down hill as we pinged each other for one or 2 and eventually he used the Ornament for 12 or so and won by 18.
<br/>
FL (-18) 2 +14
<br/>
Highs: I flipped QMC again. Melas was immune to attrition of 5?
<br/>
Lows: Where was Qui-Gon? I just made one mistake and Jake capitalized on it. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 
<br/>
HDADTJ vs. Nick Fehring 1486 Slave quarters, podracing start.
<br/>
<br/>
This was going to get nasty real fast. Sebulba owns Anakin and gets off to a good start with a 5 (8). The holotable with a Monnok also makes an appearance as we both lose to
<br/>
Visage. This goes on back and forth till turn 4 when my race destiny sits at 30 to his 24. I deploy DVDLOTS against Jedi Luke and EJP Lando at the Outskirts. Duel Luke with
<br/>
focused attack. 6,5,7 and it did not matter what he drew. He chooses to turn Luke and lose 6. Lando the pisses himself as he realizes he never should have quit his job at the psychic friends network. He takes a shot of colt 45 and tries to call his mom, but being the crack ho she is, the phone sex line is busy. Father and Son show Lando what a good time really is. Saber swing. Hack. Destiny 6 to his 3 for total of 18 to 6. Lando and 12. Oh and can not
<br/>
forget to lose to Wattos Box and Visage for a grand total of 30 cards lost in one turn. Not pretty at all. Being a glutton for punishment, he put Epp Han and Chewie , protector out to oppose the Dark Jedi. Choke Chewie, Hack Han and handshake. 
<br/>
FW 2 (+45) 4(+59)
<br/>
<br/>
High: I have never won by so much with the dark. Everything went perfect. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: It took a whole 10 minutes to play this game and I never like beating somebody by so much.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 LS QMC vs. Conner Bragge ROPS (Mob Points, IAO, First Strike)
<br/>
<br/>
Instead of my usual start of Insight, I started  Dont do that again to put the crunch on himearly. I started to set up on CC with EPP Obi, Dash/outrider at the DB and Captain at the system. He set up and flipped with AT-ST and generic pilots. After a few small drains here and there, he put Vader and Tarkin at a CC site against Ben who Pathed away. This was going to get ugly. I had Clash, Melas, Gift Of The Mentor,  RLR, Path and the Doubler/Tripler card. I tunneled for Luke and deployed Melas. Tripler, RLR, Clash Vader, Pathed Obi over as Tarkin soiled his depends. It ended up
<br/>
being 20 to 4, double that and it&amp;#8217;s Tarkin and 32 cards. Game and Handshake. FW 2(+28)
<br/>
6 (+86)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Being able to Tunnel for what I needed to send Tarkin back to the Blue Oyster for Tango night.
<br/>
Lows: Beating a young player by so much.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5 LS vs. Ted Woodward 1765  Hunter ISB  (Mob Point, IAO, SSPFT) 
<br/>
<br/>
Ted is a local who I always have had luck against. He either gets all his ships or no planets against me and I win. I was counting on my immunity to Ted to pull through
<br/>
again. I started the Mob Points killer, which was worthless. When Hunter said that it does not hurt ISB, he was right. You do not argue with the word of the Lord when he has spoken. Ted dropped Piett, Mejerrik and 2 or 3 systems first turn. Yep, I was glad I started the Mob Killer. That two force I deprived him was crucial. Whatever. I drop Obi and give it Ted. Holding Dash and Outrider, Path and ECC Lando, So I  flip next
<br/>
turn, but I do not want to leave Dash in space. He drops Fondor and the Big E, I drop Dash, the DB, Lando, flip, tunnel for Battle Plan and land Dash. The DB was a last
<br/>
minute addition for just this reason. He drops a walker and ORS against Dash who paths away. He also deployed the Devestator with and shuttled Mejerrik and moved them to
<br/>
Endor. My turn I have a power pivot, Intruder missile, tunnel for Leia, Squassion for the Falcon and drop on the Devestator. I play the tripler, reduce his power to 0 and win by 10. It is ruled that in space Han only doubles because the cards requires him to be present.
<br/>
Fair enough. The bad part was after forfeit he lost 5 card. Not as impressive as I would have liked.  During this time, Ted asks Brian if I can Path from a Docking bay. He says
<br/>
yes, but then Ted points out that CC is only exterior. Path targets interior. What docking bay is not both. Sorry Ted. I thought it was legal at the time or I would have walked Dash inside with Luke  after I landed the Outrider anyway. We ping each other, he damages the Falcon and I send Dash back to space to join him with a little back up. He had shuttled the walker up to the Executor in case I had a few more tricks. He still had not flipped, so he shuttled the Walker back the DB. I deployed Ben and Melas, tripler, RLR and this seems to be very familiar today as this battle hit him for enough cards that he drew his last 8 or before I could retrieve. FW 2(+25) 8(+111)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning against a bad matchup for me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Lows: I felt bad about the misplay, but we all make mistakes. Its okay, Im not bitterabout you forgetting about Battle Plan or becoming super anal for the rest of the game. Losing sucks. Itll give you something to talk about with Chris on Monday. At least I learned that if you dont declare Dash during the weapon phase, your opponent doesnt
<br/>
have to let you subtract power. 
<br/>
<br/>
Jacob was still undefeated at this point, but we played the same side, so I had to rely on
<br/>
someone else to try to beat him, while I drew a TD from the Waco area.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
Michael Richards 1523
<br/>
DS HDADTJ vs. Dagobah Mains (Insight, Insurrection and ?)
<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed in Richards. Usually he has some crazy teched out tech that rocks. Boring Dagobah mains this time. He did have Anakins Podracer to challenge me with. I
<br/>
set up with monnok at the Holotable and did some Visage damage. Sebulba got off to his usual head start and never looked back. He did cancel visage once, but I redeployed in
<br/>
instantly. He played Throw me another charge. No Charge, imagine that. Podracer collision let me put OOC/TT #2 out of play. Visage would stay through out the remainder
<br/>
of the game. I had Empy, a number and Tech, but he never ditched insight. I did win the podrace, used Podracer collision to place an Off the Edge out of play and bury his other retrieval means. He placed Qui-Gon at the Cantina who I let drain, while he deployed EJP Lando and Ben Kenobi/Stick against my Emp and Vader/Stick.  He just didnt know that Lando was my @#$% all day long. The focused attack and Circle in my hand were more excited than the Bush Twins at an open bar. Circle Ben, Rape Lando for another 10 or so cards and that was game after a minor skirmish with a lone Corran that let me put my Elis
<br/>
in hand back in my used pile. FW 2(+25)  10(+136)
<br/>
<br/>
Well Jake held on to win going undefeated with a difference of 156 or some crap like that. I picked up a nice Sense foil for my effort all the same. With the new set, I noticed
<br/>
that podracing can really disrupt any bodys strategy, but is more powerful for the dark. Also, the Mob point killers didnt frighten anybody as I saw 6 ISB decks(A few Space
<br/>
Cowboys from Hell among others) and even a Hidden Mains or 2. Darth Maul made an appearance in every persons deck that owned him, but he wasnt always successful in
<br/>
dueling. You need to track people. Or load your deck with destinies. Destiny will always win you games. Or if your name is Matt Lush and you use Marquand you will auto win as
<br/>
well, but I havent seen that lately. Cant have a report from Killeen without a little name dropping.
<br/>
<br/>
Props:
<br/>
<br/>
Jacob &amp;#8220;Oscar&amp;#8221; Mayer &amp;#8221;Weiner&amp;#8221;  for Damn good hot-dogs. Oh yeah and winning too.
<br/>
Justin &amp;#8220;Hoostino&amp;#8221; Warren who without his lack of a life these awesome decks never would have evolved to be today. 
<br/>
Brain Guthrie  for running another great tourney. Hate to see you go. 
<br/>
My wife for granting parole for a day.
<br/>
Your Mom. She knows why.
<br/>
Brian Hunter for being right about the Mob points killer and letting Van lose to him all the time. 
<br/>
All 30 people who came out. Hopefully we have more turnouts like this
<br/>
Halle Berry for earning an extra 500,000 for going topless in Swordfish.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
<br/>
Ted for being Ted
<br/>
Me for making 2 mistakes by deploying Melas (your welcome, Jake) and pathing from the DB
<br/>
The Reeses pie for only being good enough for second. But at least I can still eat solid food. After the brownie that can be a struggle.
<br/>
Our Denny&amp;#8217;s server for being abducted by a UFO or what ever happens to trailer trash in the middle of our meal when she disappeared and never came back.
<br/>
Justin&amp;#8217;s Ego which continues to swell. 
<br/>
The Army for inventing places like Korea, NTC and Hell.

<br/>
Earth**ughmmpfh.
