Deciding that Acme Games was too easy and boring, team Milfo-Nati traveled some distance to wreck havoc on Schumer’s card store.  We arrived about 11:50 and I got out to scout the players.  The tournament started at about noon and I liked my chances.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  My Light vs. Matt Farney’s BHBM Dark
<br/>
I started all my racing stuff with Podracer Prep and my 3 sites W/ my objective.  This game was pretty easy.  I denied him every chance of activation w/ A Tremor In The Force.  And everytime he deployed, I played It Can Wait and then played Recoil In Fear to get rid of what he deployed. I flipped quickly and set up force draining at Kessel and Tatooine.  On ground the usual happened.  He sat Vader at the DS2 DB and had Maul and Mara running around.  After about 5 turns I killed Maul w/ Chewie and blaster and Yotts Orren together and let Mara sit and drain for 1. I won the Race w/o much difficulty.  All in all it was a good game on both parts.  Klein: Full Win by 14
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My Dark vs. Alex George’s QMC.
<br/>
I started my usual, Objective, Casino, IAO, Secret Plans, YCHF, and I’m Sorry.  First turn I pulled my two sites and set up Dark Deal on my first turn.  I was surprised with this against a QMC but then I realized who my opponent was.(chuckle)  But I Underestimated him.  After about 2 turns of draining, he came down w/ Obi and stick.  I wasn’t worried until he played I’ve Got a Bad Feeling About This and also played Run Luke Run and Gift of the Mentor to totally crush my ass.  I ended up losing about 20 force and I was ready to bend over and take it like a man.  But I pulled it out and drained the hell out of him and won by 4.  Klein:  Full win by 4
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: my Light vs. Josh Rohrig’s Court jank.
<br/>
This guy’s deck was wierd.  It was all over the place and designed for WYS.  He started Teemto’s pod and Wattos Box and I started my usual.  This game was close and it all came down to who would win the podrace.  The race was neck and neck for the whole game until the end when I played Podrace Prep to use LSJK from hand for a race destiny and also drew another 5 and six.  I chose the two 6’s and won the race.  I retrieved my 11 and he lost his 11, and that ended the game.  As for the ground and Space, well it was ugly.  Space was wierd.  He had the Executor parked at Tatooine and I had my Uutrider w/ Dash and Mirax and her ship and Han in Falcon w/ a RFC piolting too.  He had other ships too.  Zuckuss in his ship w/ IG-88 piolting and a Victory Class Star Destroyer w/ Guri and Admiral Piett pioliting to kill my destinies and add some w/ Imp. Command.  On the gorund his jank Bounty Hunters and Maul and Vader ran around.  Klein: full win by 13
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Dark vs. Josh Rohrig’s QMC racing.
<br/>
This game was about the same.  He started all the podracing stuff and his objective jank.  I set up in 2 turns and used my Disturbences in The Force to deny force.  When he managed to get a character out I used IJASKAW to stop that @#$% and then used Uncertain Is The Future to get rid of it for good.  He won the podrace cause I didn’t have Sebulba’s pod.  His 6 retrieval couldn’t stand up to my heavy drains and he couldn’t get cards out to stop them.  Klein: full win by 16
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  My Light vs. Matt Scott’s SYCFA flip.
<br/>
Matt Scott is a god among men.  He was so good that I didn’t have a chance.  I did everything right it was just that I couldnt’t contest to his space and drains w/ the new card AMVCO, and my force denial wasn’t working too well.  I did manage to get rid of some cards w/ It Can Wait, but matt Scott is just too good.  Klein:  Full loss by 26
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6:  Not this @#$% again.  My Dark vs.  Matt Scott’s Rebel Strike Team Flip, mains, and Podracing.  This game was jsut like the previous.  I got my @#$% working and drained for some, but i couldnt hold out against the characters and again my force denial wasnt working too well.  i managed to win a few battles but over all i got killed.  he blew the bunker which, surprisingly, took till the last turn.  He also won the race and i couldn’t get a glimpse of winning.  I really don’t like playing Matt cause he builds my decks and knows how to kick their @#$% and what’s in them.  I should’ve played the deck I built, but hey, it sucked.  Matt Scott is my God.
