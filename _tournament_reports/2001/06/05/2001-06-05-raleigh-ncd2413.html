<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Greetings everyone, this is my second tournament report, so if I do something really wrong with it please send me a letter on decktech, or e-mail me at MrCheezNcho@aol.com, before giving it a bad rating. For the pre tournament crap:
<br/>
<br/>
On the morning of the tournament I had my decks all set. 
<br/>
<br/>
Light Side: My Tosche Station deck (look on my page) updated with Tatooine characters, and the outskirts for an alternate of Obi’s Hut.
<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side: My really awesome SYCFA no flip, with Star Destroyers, pilots, and bounty hunters in their ships.
<br/>
<br/>
The tournament started at 10:30 so I wanted to be there a little early to get some new sleeves for my dark deck and sleeve it with no one seeing it. I arrive at about 9:50 the store opens at 10. I wait in the car with my dad till we see someone walking in. I buy my sleeves and go back into the game room to sleeve my deck. Some guys walk in that I havent seen before. About half way the way through sleeving my deck I realize that the entry fee is 5 dollars, after buying those sleeves I only had 4.50. I stay calm and keep on sleeving my deck. Some more people walk in, I bum money off of them, and eventually get the 50 cents I needed. 20 people show up, and the tournament gets started.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 My DS vs. Eddie Browns WYS
<br/>
<br/>
I had a MAJOR advantage this whole game, I had been talking to Eddie online, and I knew he hadn’t got any Tatooine, so I wouldn’t be expecting a podrace or anything. I started with all the SYCFA stuff prepped defenses Battle Order, Mob Points, and Something Special Planned. He starts the wys crap heading for the medical frigate, Insurrection, Staging Areas, and squad ass. I start off the game by grabbing a Flagship Executer with Mob Points. I deployed Palpy to the DS DB and drew up. On his turn he deployed a Kessel with Mirax in her ship there. I activated some and deployed boba in his ship, and battled. Mirax hyper escaped away from it to Tatooine. Next turn he activates some force pays three to drain me 1, and deploys Luke with stick on the Tatooine docking bay. He re-circulates and tells me its my go. I activate 12 force and with some extra saved up I deploy Piett, pull the Admiral&amp;#8217;s Order with him, and deploy Chierenu (or however you spell it). I use a Twi&amp;#8217;lek Advisor to pull a lateral damage, and I play it on the pulsar skate. I ballet, he looses 10 force and the ship. That was about game right there. He spreads out on the ground, I spread out in space, he gets a drain or two at the death star until I block it. FW +25  2(+25)
<br/>
<br/>
Good- Winning my first game
<br/>
Bad-Winning my first game with a sort of cheap advantage. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 My LS vs. Howard something with a T I thinks SYCFA I see the ojb, and start up Outskirts and Tosche Station. He starts SYCFA crap Prepped defenses, Oppressive Enforcement, and Battle Order. I couldn&amp;#8217;t be sure if he was playing flip or no flip so on my first few turns I hold back and activate at Tosche like crazy. He starts pulling death star sites, and then he pulls a gunner. Now I know he&amp;#8217;s blowing away. I deploy Jar Jar to the gunners site, and naburn some people (including Orri) over. We battle, and he looses the gunner, and two from Orri. He deploys Sullust, Vader, and Tarkin to the site, and he battles. He doesnt let me draw destiny, and I loose a guy or two. We have an ongoing battle at the death star the rest of the game so I wont tell you about EVERY single battle there. He starts deploying some people in space and draining me. I come down with Home 1, that gets barriered. He comes down with some more SDs, and battles me. I loose Home 1. He flips and starts draining in space. We time out. 
<br/>
TW +28  3(+53) 
<br/>
<br/>
Good-Winning
<br/>
Bad- Howard really should have won this, but we just went too slow.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 My Dark vs. Ryan Obman&amp;#8217;s Podracing QMC
<br/>
I start SYCFA stuff Secret plans, Mob Points, and Something Special Planned. He starts QMC, guest place, bespin, podrace prep, QMC effect, and podrace arena. We both get our pods out. This game was very boring and uneventful, almost no battles took place so I dont have much to say about it. I get Palpy and battle order in my hand, I put them down, he wins the podrace he doesnt have enough to retrive so I loose 6. He sets up QMC, he drains on the ground, I drain in space, I drain more in space. I win. FW +10  5(+63)
<br/>
<br/>
Good- Nothing really this was a boring game.
<br/>
Bad- It was a boring game. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Sean Bass&amp;#8217;s YMSYL vs. My Light
<br/>
I start Obi&amp;#8217;s Hut and Tosche Station. He starts 5th Marker, prepped defenses, IAO(crap!), decree(crap!) and YMSYL. For the first few turns both of us draw up, I get Obi at the Station, and start draining him some. He deploys some walkers and puts out No Escape. I play Honor, and a stick and profisency ( I cant spell). I try to drain him of three he tells me decrees in effect. He plays some Garrisons on me, and I grab it. We have a lot of battles, but in the end he out drains me with his walker&amp;#8217;s FL &amp;#8211;18  5(+45) ( I think)
<br/>
<br/>
Good- Sean gets 2nd overall, and I think I played a good game. 
<br/>
Bad- If I had won I would have had 7 victory points, so I might have got 2nd or something.
<br/>
<br/>
I end up 6th out of 20, so I get 2 premere packs, one CC, and one D*2, I get Dark Jedi Presence, Throne Room, Artoo Come Back Here at Once, and I forget what my D*2 rare was. I annoy the crap out of everyone trying to get a QMC, until I finally trade some sleeves for it. Then I realize I was supposed to go to my friends house so I call my mom.
