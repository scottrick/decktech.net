Well, Thursday was my last final of the year, so I was psyched that my hellish freshman year of college was over.  With my academic standing floating in the air, I was relieved to hear about Alfred Dong’s tournament in Pleasanton slated for Saturday.  I immediately turned to working out new decks.  For Light Side, I had my mean RST Jedi Presence deck ready to go, and for Dark, I had Black Rabbit, which started Court and ran Dark Jedi and a few support characters.  After moving all my crap, and a few boxes of my friend’s, into my vehicle from my 3rd floor dorm room, then driving it home, and unpacking most of it, my arms were bruised and battered, but I somehow was still able to playtest with Steve Daniel Friday evening.  After working out some kinks, and reworking the start for Black Rabbit, I was ready to go.
<br/>
<br/>
The Tournament:
<br/>
<br/>
My decks:
<br/>
LS - Scouting For The Jedi - RST with Jedi support and mad activation courtesy of The Shield Is Down!
<br/>
DS - Black Rabbit - MKOS fake start with Podracing and Dark Jedi
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v. Timothy Green’s QMC
<br/>
I hear the pairings, and I see Tim shaking his head and staring down.  He’s intimidated by me, and knows from past experiences that I’m going to throttle him.
<br/>
He starts Anakin’s Pod to contest Sebulba; I start Crush The Rebellion.  First turn, we start racing with Sebulba flashing Anakin with his vents, and Mara with Saber went to the AC.  Tim drew, after missing Squassin going for Dash w/ Outrider.  My turn, I draw.  He drops Qui-Gon and Melas to the AC; I You Are Beaten Qui-Gon; he draws.  I indicated his mistake, drop ECC 4-LOM and Myo, and beat Melas for him +13 or so.  I also had dropped Maul to JP.  Sebulba wins the podrace.  Tim sets up on CC, and flips QMC.  My turn, I Elis Maul in front of Qui-Gon, duel, and Maul wins.  He’s got no hand, so I spread out a little.  Qui-Gon comes back and preys on a lone Janus.  I clear CC with the help of Elis, and he soon thereafter draws up.
<br/>
Result: FW +23
<br/>
Standing: 2(+23)
<br/>
Positive: Dark Jedi ruling Tatooine and Cloud City.
<br/>
Negative: Forgetting about Keeping The Empire Out Forever, which Tim used to bring Qui-Gon back.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v. Kody Doherty’s Podracing starting Desert Landing Site
<br/>
I set up the Crix engine on Endor, while he drops Mara and Blizzard Scout 1 to the Lars’ Farm, then moved them to the Podrace Arena.  I dropped Jedi Luke and Daughter Of Skywalker to the Lars’ Farm, armed with Luke’s and Anakin’s Sabers respectively.  Sebulba wins the podrace, and Mara and the AT-ST move back to the Lars’ Farm.  I drop Qui-Gon, a few power 3 scouts, battle, play Jedi Presence, he takes 38 battle damage.  Drain out after that.
<br/>
Result: FW +19
<br/>
Standing: 4(+42)
<br/>
Positive: Jedi Presence.
<br/>
Negative: Not flipping fast enough to help my racing destinies.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS v. Paul Green’s QMC
<br/>
Paul’s leading the pack, and is wondering why, because he’s usually on the bottom.
<br/>
He starts Anakin’s; I start Crush The Rebellion.  I invade CC early with DVDLOTS w/ Saber.  He drops EPP Obi and EPP Luke in front of him and battles; I YAB Obi, play I Have You Now, and hit Luke to take out him +5 more.  I move DVDLOTS over.  He drops Chewie Protector to join Obi.  My turn, I Elis Vader in front of them, replace with Lord Vader, battle, play I Have You Now, Circle Obi, hit Chewie, and he loses 6 more.  With me holding 2 of his 3 CC sites, he draws up, never being able to flip.
<br/>
Result: FW +36
<br/>
Standing: 6(+78)
<br/>
Positive: Another flawless performance by the Rabbit.
<br/>
Negative: None.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS v. Alexander Sheynis’ JP Podracing
<br/>
This was the greatest game I got to play all day.  I piled high on the Rebel Landing Site, waiting for him to make the first move.  He came after me, and we chased each other around Endor for awhile.  Qui-Gon went to the CC DB and was Off The Edge-ing.  Mara came down to kill him, but failed.  In the last major battle, which he initiated, at the Back Door, I whittled his forces down to just Tarkin.  On my turn, I battled Tarkin for the win.
<br/>
Result: FW +15
<br/>
Standing: 8(+92)
<br/>
Positive: Surviving the mains that invaded Endor; Qui-Gon living forever.
<br/>
Negative: None.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS v. Steve Daniel’s Tosche mains
<br/>
This game was complete old school - SAC, mains, Nabrun/Elis.  I held Tosche Station, and repelled his every attack.  A key battle was when DVDLOTS faced off against Qui-Gon, both armed, in a stalemate.  He moved Padawan Obi to join Qui-Gon.  I Circled Obi, dropped Aurra, battled, stole Qui-Gon’s stick, and Aurra hit Qui-Gon.  After that, Steve tossed Lando With Vibro-Ax to the Desert Landing Site.  I responded with Lord Vader w/ Saber, he Nabrun-ed away, I followed with Elis, dropped more guys, and battled Lando to end the game.
<br/>
Result: FW +31
<br/>
Standing: 10(+113)
<br/>
Positive: The Dark Jedi ruled the day.  I was pleased with the deck’s perfect performance.
<br/>
Negative: Beating Steve.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS v. Steve Daniel’s JP mains
<br/>
I set up the Crix engine, he dropped Vader and crew to stomp it out.  Every red card I played got SAC-ed.  I tried to recoil, but could not take out the armed Maul and Vader roaming the forests of Endor.  It was a massacre.
<br/>
Result: FL -28
<br/>
Standing: 10(+85)
<br/>
Positive: None.
<br/>
Negative: Getting raped by SAC, and being unable to do squat once Crix got iced.
<br/>
<br/>
Results:
<br/>
No one went undefeated.  I had thought I had a good shot at winning, but there was an upset: Philip Green took the tournament playing MWYHL Podracing and Hunt Down NUMBERS.  I got 2 packs of Tatooine, in which I pulled We Shall Double Our Efforts (great) and Padmé (w00t).
