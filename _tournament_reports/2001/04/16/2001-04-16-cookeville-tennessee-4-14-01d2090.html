<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Hello everyone!
<br/>
It’s been a while since I’ve been on Decktech.
<br/>
Last Saturday I played in a local tournament, and we had a turnout of 11 people. Not too many, not too few. A lot of the good players weren’t there, so I felt pretty confident.
<br/>
Dark Side: Bring Him Before Me w/ Sienar Fleet Systems
<br/>
Light Side: There is Good in Him w/ buncha scouts =)
<br/>
I had worked on my Dark Side deck for a couple of weeks, but I had to throw my Light Side deck together the night before the tournament. =(
<br/>
Round 1:
<br/>
Light Side
<br/>
C.D. w/ a pile of cards
<br/>
Literally, this kid’s deck was a pile of cards! He had never played in a tournament before, and he didn’t know the rules very well. He draws up for his first couple of turns. I move Luke to the Landing Platform and start deploying guys there. About 3 turns into the game, I’ve got Luke, Daugher, General Solo, and Obi w/ Saber at the Platform. C.D. decides to drop a couple of aliens and battle. I hit both his guys and play Courage to make Luke Power 14. He ends up losing most of his deck in that battle. I Signal for Traffic Control, drop my hand, and drain him out.
<br/>
Win by 42!!!
<br/>
Round 2:
<br/>
1-0(+42)
<br/>
Dark Side
<br/>
Dustin w/ Watch Your Step
<br/>
I drop the Emperor to the D.S. 2 Docking Bay(I started with Mobilization Points) and start generating a lot of force. He deploys Jedi Luke to the Cantina and sits there. I get my Dreaded Imperal Starfleet and Sienar Fleet Systems out, so I’m setting up pretty good. He grabs Outrider with Leebo and then drops Dash on there at Kessel. My turn, I drop 4 TIE Scouts, initiate a battle, and play All Power to Weapons. I win the battle by 2, and that’s one down for the conversion. Next turn, he shows Han to get the Falcon, drops it at Kessel, and battle. I play All Power to Weapons, and he forget to use Dash’s game text! I think he draws a 0 for destiny, because somehow I end up winning the battle. 2 for the conversion! I drop Lord Vader to the Cantina to kidnap Luke and make a run for it. I cancel his drain at Kessel. He deploys Chewie, Protector and a Raltiir Freighter Captain to Cantina(his objective flips!), drops the Admiral’s Order that makes my Scouts Power 0(it’s like, if you don’t have a pilot character on a ship, then its power -2). Next he chases me at Tatooine and draws. Here we go! I drop Mara Jade(her Saber wasn’t in the reserve deck at the time) and Fett w/ Blaster to the Cantina. I miss my shot at Chewie, but I still take the battle. 3 on the conversion! Vader takes Luke to the D.S. 2 Docking Bay, move my Scouts from Tatooine, and then I draw. His turn, he tries to drain my(cancelled) and doesn’t have anything to deploy. He chases my Scouts, runs with Chewie, and draws. I run with Scouts, move Vader, and DUEL! I win the duel, DOH! Next turn, he still has nothing. Before I activate, I duel, lose, and shuffle up. Destiny says... FIVE! Yay! Twi’lek Advisor for the conversion! Game over.
<br/>
Win by 26.
<br/>
Round 3:
<br/>
2-0(+68)
<br/>
Dark Side
<br/>
Eddie Walker w/ Hidden Base
<br/>
This one goes uneventfully: he battles me ONCE during the whole game. The rest of the game is me draining him and Your Destiny dealing direct damage. In the last turns of the game, he drops Luke Skywalker(yes, Premiere one) to Vader’s site, and I take him to the Emperor. I duel the crap out of him. =) Sorry I couldn’t get much more detail, there wasn’t really any...
<br/>
Win by 30
<br/>
Round 4:
<br/>
3-0(+98)
<br/>
Light Side
<br/>
Blake Edmondson w/ Hunt Down
<br/>
This game goes like the last one: nothing happens. He doesn’t deploy ANYONE until the last turn of the game. I get Reflection on Daughter to lessen the Visage hurt, but never find a way to kill it. I set up a drain of 2 at the Landing Platform and 3 at Kessel which go the distance.
<br/>
Win by 18
<br/>
Final record: 1st place, 4-0(+116)
<br/>
I go home with a foil Alter for my troubles.
<br/>
Overall, not a bad tournament. I never had to play against Billy though, and I’m sure that was a major factor in my winning the tournament.
<br/>
See you all next time!
