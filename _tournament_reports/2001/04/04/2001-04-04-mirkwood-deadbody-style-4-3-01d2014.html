<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay sorry about any misspellings, but I’m just typing this straight on DeckTech to avoid Tags.  This is the usual Mirkwood Tuesday Report, for Light I went with Schoolgirl Mains (will post someday) and my Hunting for a Foily Vader (HDADTJ dueling with 5 foily vaders).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 my Dark Vs. Mike Raveling and his MWYHL
<br/>
<br/>
Okay this was a very non-interactive game (as training decks are apt to be) so it went kinda like this.  I deployed Vader w/saber to the CC DB and Bad feeling on the first turn.  Flip and he loses to Visage.  For the next few turns he deploys Yoda and Uncontrollable Fury and sits looking for Leia.  By the time he has her found and passes test 1 I have An Uncontrollably furion Vader with stick at the CC db Chimera Dengar in P1 and Bossk in HT at Carida, and a mess of guys at the DS DB (palpy Xixor and Dr. E and Ponda).  He eventually deploys Obi w/stick to the DS DB but doesn’t battle.  I deploy $-lom and battle, he fallen portals $-lom and Dr E. and Ponda, hits Xixor, and loses Obi to attrition, Paply just sits and smiles.  During my move phase I take Vader back into hand to get rid of UF, and we both lose to Visage.  His turn he passes another test, deploys Luke w/saber to take on the geezer, misses on the swing and I lose about 5 to keep Palpy on table, and he loses Luke.  My turn I deploy Vader w/saber again, and flip say go.  He eventually lost due to the steady drains of a few, and Visage.  Fw by 12

<br/>
Wow, It’s been a while since I beat Mike in a game.  He is one of the best in the state, and I’m really happy.  That is until I find out that I must face Graham’s Skrilling death horde.
<br/>
Highs: Beating Mike, playing well
<br/>
Lows: Well Vader was really mad for a while and that cost me about 10 force.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 my LS vs. Graham Neal
<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game was really quick.  He got off a few drains of 6 and wheen I attacked him in the chamber he took out all my guys plus a few force, then in a last ditch spread out and drain him to death he deployed 6 skrillings to take on Obi w/saber, and I lost the battle by about 30.  THat was game.  FL by 18

<br/>
Highs: Moral Victory I made him lose Jabba then placed him Out of Play with Out of Commision
<br/>
Lows: see above.  Obi getting b!tchslapped by 6 skrillings on steroids.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 my DS vs. Dion and his Matching Pilots WTF?? start
<br/>
<br/>
Okay Dion started Kashyyk only, and then Squass and 2 other Effects, so people aren’t sure what he was doing.  After the first game Mike and I had watched (with permission of course) Dion play this side against Josh Grace, so I had an Idea what to expect.  I didn’t get a Vader until the 3rd turn, then he came down at 1 DB and Jabba Xixor and Ephant Mon took over Tatooine DB.  He deployed Ben Kenobi and said go.  I deployed 4-LOm barrier, okay well then, I look in my reserve deck for a DB, and see mostly high Destinys.  So i Transit Darth over and Circle with Focused Attack. I win he loses 9.  He then deploys Leia and Chewie and  Luke sends Leia and Chewie to the CC DB and Luke to the DS DB.  I activate and look at my destinys 2 1’s and 4 5’s or higher.  Well then I deploy Ig-w/gun to THe CC db to take on Leia and shoot, capture Leia, draw destiny its a 1 perfect, that means I only have 1 left in 4 cards, I lose 1 force, he loses Chewie, I then DB transit Vader back over to the DS, and play Vaders Ob. plus Focused attack, 5,5,6.  I win he turns luke, and loses 6.  He then trys to spread out his ships to Kasshyyk and Kessel (Dash and Tycho were his only ships on table) and Thrawn on the Chimera and a blind 6,7  draw sent tycho down in flames and ended then game.

<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning 2 duels, an dagain playing well, not making any mistakes
<br/>
Lows: Dion had a bad game, afterwards we looked at his deck, and I suggestted some changes.
<br/>
<br/>
Final Game. At this point I am afraid of facing Mike again, since I know he is playing Ties, and those suck to play against, but no I face Alex and his Build the DS Endor Ops.
<br/>
<br/>
Okay this game was really over on his first turn, I started my usual throne room, and got Blount with Crix, put Walex at the Endor DB (I had a houjix in hand, and was hoping to stop him from deploying his effects).  His turn he deploys Moff Jerjeerod to the Bunker and draws.  WTF, he just saw me pull a spy????  Okay well if he wants to be dumb, I’ll let him.  I deploy the Back door so I have another place to drain, and deploy Cracken, Obi w/stick and KFC to JerJerods site. Battle hit smoke screen obi’s 6 and he loses 12.  Move Crix to back up Walex and say go.  His turn he draws up.. I move my guys to the Back door from the bunker, and deploy Launching the assault, to take Home 1.  He deploys 2 dreadnaughts and Ties to endor. I revo the system so it is only a drain of 1 and save.  He doesn’t drain (didn’t all game in fact) and saves some.  I deploy Home 1 with Blount and Wedge to Kessel.  He laterally damages the Home 1 and then deploys nothing.  I drain for a ton then revo the Throne Room and drop luke with saber there.  He moves his fleet to kessel. I move Home 1 away and drain him out.

<br/>
<br/>
Highs: um..see above
<br/>
Lows: This kid didn’t really know what he was doing I think.. When after the game I told him he should have drained he said that it was only for 1 and it didn’t matter, I explained that it would have cost me at lest 10 force and could have cost me some of the cards that I deployed against him.  In retrospect I feel bad for beating him so bad.
<br/>
<br/>
So overall I went 3-1 an dfinished 3rd, plus traded for a foily GMT.  SO it was a good Tourney, and I feel that as States grows closer I am hoping to improve on my 7th place at the MN Grand Slam, and I have a good shot at it.
