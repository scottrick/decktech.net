Findlay, OH
<br/>
well time for the monthly tourney and i&amp;#8217;m testing some decks for states next week.  we have a lot of stuff made but
<br/>
for ls i make a mains deck that looks ok but has a weakness to mkos in my opinion.  for dark we make &amp;#8220;THE deck&amp;#8221;
<br/>
as we called it, it was some good cards + tech + crap which looked really good but it ended up not being all that
<br/>
great.   whatever i play anyway.
<br/>
1. dark vs adam  ebox
<br/>
well he starts out setting up ebo.  i drop ships fast to systems and start to drain him.  we do a few battles in space
<br/>
and i win them all, but i win a huge one and he had to lose a bunch of xwings from the one battle which was big. 
<br/>
with alot of his ships gone he couldn&amp;#8217;t retrieve a lot from all wings report in.  he did the spread and drain thing
<br/>
while i drained him.  i forgot about resistance the entire game, which i have in the deck to slow ebo.  oh well.  in
<br/>
the end he is draining me for alot and i am draining for some but since i got off to the faster start i won.
<br/>
fw 2 (+8)
<br/>
2. light vs shea random.pile
<br/>
he startsds2  throneroom but no objective.  he just does stupid stuff all game.  he daws 40 cards till he gets his
<br/>
reactor terminal out.  too bad i didnt find my grimtassh.  i deploy dagobah and the hut, next turn he drops the dag
<br/>
cave?? wtf?? and then i drain and he loses dark dag sysytem. strange.  well he gets out a bunch of royal guards and
<br/>
vader to my tat db where i have the whole crew.  he has myn kyngenuth and lets royal guards react to battles for
<br/>
free, and a 20 card hand, so i dont want to fight.  i find my grimtassh and do it lost and take away some doubles,
<br/>
then i fiight. i win and hit alot of his guys.  he puts palpy on the ds2 so a spy and beatdown crew go there too.  after
<br/>
that i am draining him out and do an omdh for 11 but only hae 8 cards lost.
<br/>
fw 4 (+35)
<br/>
3. dark vs craig wys
<br/>
well his deck is the average wys raiders with harvest and all that junk-tech.  i grab out of comission early, but i
<br/>
should have grabbed harvest.  that hurt cause he did it like 5-6 times before i found my other grabber.  oh well. i
<br/>
am draining for a lot in space and he cant find ships, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have mattered cause i would have beat him
<br/>
down.   his drains on ground aren&amp;#8217;t that great, but luke and a stick in the catina is annoying.  that made it pretty
<br/>
close. late game he attacks me in space and gets jacked.  dain him out
<br/>
fw 6 (+48)
<br/>
4. light vs craig mkos
<br/>
gee same guy. winner takes tourney, loser is 2nd or 3rd depending on the diff.  he sets up inside the ac and lower
<br/>
passages while i setup at jabbas palace, which takes a while cause of no bargain and none shall pass.  however
<br/>
isetup a drain of 4 there, but his resistance cuts it down to 2.  he doesnt have secret plans so i do omdh for 12 like 3
<br/>
times (i won the bingo prize for this).  he gets out mosep and PotF at his 2 sites and with gaylid is draining for 6
<br/>
off the top a tun at 2 dites.  late game we have some battles and he gets beat up.  i try to invade the chaber but its
<br/>
too late.  i have 1 card left and think he will drain me out......but no, he battles, gets back 2 with scum, and that
<br/>
gave him the few cards of differential he needed to win the tourney.
