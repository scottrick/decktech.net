<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Like so many other Americans this week, I had to do my taxes.  And,
<br/>
like so many other Americans, Friday rolled around and I still 
<br/>
hadn’t finished them.  So I’m thinking I can’t go to the tourney
<br/>
on Saturday, but I really want to.  So I decide to stay up all night
<br/>
Friday and finished the dang taxes.  Well, I get pissed off after
<br/>
doing my federal taxes cuz it turns out I OWE money rather than get
<br/>
a refund!  So I’m mad.  *Really* mad.  But I finish my state taxes
<br/>
and its all good there.  Anyways, that’s probably just boring most
<br/>
of you, but that explains why I will be so freakin’ tired for the
<br/>
tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
So in staying up all night I clean up my little apartment and look
<br/>
over my decks.  The Hunt Down deck looks good, waaay better than my
<br/>
Scum deck so I’ll use that one.  It uses unique Saber and Onix TIEs
<br/>
starting IAO, Mob Pts, and Combat Response.  Mara, Emp, and, of
<br/>
course, Vader are the main ground weapons.  SFS is the only 
<br/>
retrieval.  And yes, it duels.
<br/>
<br/>
For Light I made a new HB mains but I liked my EBO deck (already on
<br/>
Decktech with a few changes), so I decide to stick with EBO.  When 
<br/>
a deck is on a streak, you just don’t switch decks.  Its just Rogue
<br/>
speeders and xwings.  It does either ANSB start, or 3 effect start.
<br/>
<br/>
So I head out to the train station and sleep like a log on the way
<br/>
to Pleasanton (I live in San Francisco), and just for kicks I bring
<br/>
my YJ sample deck (where all the cards have 0 or 1 damage, heheh).
<br/>
I get there 45 minutes before the tourney starts, do some trades &amp;
<br/>
play like 20 games of YJ with the sample deck against various 
<br/>
people (the games are *that* fast with the sample deck).  I don’t 
<br/>
play YJ normally, but sometimes the sample deck can be fun.
<br/>
<br/>
Nick Stefanko is the TD, &amp; 17 people showed to play.  On to the 
<br/>
games.  This will be 6 games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS v Steven Howard’s Profit (only starts Squassin)
<br/>
<br/>
I start Mara in the Chamber, back her up with Vader 1st turn.  He
<br/>
draws.  I drop Emp to the Chamber, move Mara w/saber to JP for the
<br/>
drain of 3.  He would lose to Visage all game, so it made this
<br/>
game quick.  I got Kashyyk out, put the Exec there with the Emp’s
<br/>
Sword.  Now he’s eating some big drains, so he drops Protector
<br/>
Chewie and Capt. Yutani to JP, then draws.  Mara battles, but 
<br/>
misses Chewie (I forgot he has armor, otherwise I would’ve swung
<br/>
at Yutani), and I draw a 1, so I lose 2 force, he loses Yutani.  
<br/>
Then he deploys a Medium Repeating Cannon, and draws.  I inform 
<br/>
him he needs a power source to shoot that, something he didn’t
<br/>
know.  So Mara battles, and I draw high killing Chewie plus a few
<br/>
force and the Cannon (forfeits for 1).
<br/>
<br/>
He came at my Exec when he dropped a YT freighter w/Kin Kian 
<br/>
aboard.  Then he put Quad Laser Cannons aboard.  He looked for 
<br/>
Red 3 w/Squassin, but it wasn’t there.  He had lost several pilots
<br/>
and ships to drains and Visage.  So he battles w/the lone ship,
<br/>
Power Pivots Exec, and shoots the Emp’s Sword.  He says he misses,
<br/>
but I inform him Kian adds 2 to desiny, so he hits the Emp’s Sword.
<br/>
But he doesn’t get destiny, so I’m power 8 to his 3, so he loses
<br/>
both Kian and the ship, I lose the Sword.  I drop Endor and Saber 2
<br/>
w/pilot to retrive my lost force, and a few drains later end the
<br/>
game uneventfully.  Win by 38.  2 (+38).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Not letting him flip and me staying flipped all game.
<br/>
Worst: Mara missing the swing on Chewie and drawing a 1.
<br/>
<br/>
After that game I realize I’m not tired at all.  Good, cuz being
<br/>
tired is something I don’t need.  I just play some YJ sample deck
<br/>
games in between all my games (most of them finish quickly).
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS v Kyle Ishimaru’s BHBM (IAO, Mob Pts, Opp Enforcement)
<br/>
<br/>
Kyle and I have a friendly little rivalry going.  Apparantly he
<br/>
really wants a Masterful Move foil.  And last tourney he lost to
<br/>
me and it cost him the 1st place, he wound up in 2nd place.
<br/>
I do the ANSB start.  He gets Janus and Emp at Endor DB 1st turn, 
<br/>
but I get Battle Plan out 1st turn to slow him down.  Lord Vader
<br/>
goes to Endor DB, Emp and Janus move to his other DB (Tat DB I 
<br/>
think).  He also Twi’leked for Search &amp; Destroy.  I get EBO going
<br/>
on my 2nd turn using BHBM to deploy Hoth Luke for 2 force, but he
<br/>
barriered him so he was stuck under the Hoth Shield.  I drop Rebel
<br/>
Fleet, drop 2 xwings to Rendili, then lose 3 to Your Destiny.  He 
<br/>
deploys Zuckuss to Rendili, I barrier, so he deploys Bossk and 
<br/>
battles.  I have Incom on table, &amp; I play Org Attack.  Bossk dies,
<br/>
and Zuckuss is alone.  I play Org Attack to get 3 xwings, then beat
<br/>
on Zuckuss for him plus 6 more.  Oh yeah, i deployed Honor as well.
<br/>
But I don’t have enough to move Luke to Endor DB, so I lose 1 to 
<br/>
Your Destiny.  He draws some.
<br/>
<br/>
I just spread my xwings out at various systems to maximize drains.
<br/>
Since I draw up Rogue 1, I decide to move Wedge and Luke over to
<br/>
the North Ridge rather than pay 10 to transit to Endor DB.   But 
<br/>
Luke has to outside the speeder or I still lose to Your Destiny,
<br/>
and he has No Escape out now.  So I move them, and he brings it
<br/>
with IG88 against Luke and Wedge, and deploys Dengar in ship and a
<br/>
Dreadnaught against 2 of my xwings (one of which is Lat Damaged).
<br/>
So I stack a card from each battle and he captures Luke with IG, I
<br/>
lose Wedge, and I lose both xwings.  He loses the Dreadnaught &amp; 
<br/>
lands Dengar w/IG88 at the North Ridge.  So he has no one at 
<br/>
systems, I have no one at sites.  So we both must pay for drains.
<br/>
Although i drain for more than he does, I don’t have the force to 
<br/>
pay for them all and I lose to Search and Destroy more than any
<br/>
other card.  Lose by 8.  2 (+30).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Beatdown on Zuckuss.
<br/>
Worst: Beatdown on Wedge, not being able to have Luke pilot Rogue 1.
<br/>
And Search and Destroy was a real pain.  Normally that card doesn’t
<br/>
hurt me.
<br/>
<br/>
So Kyle got his wish, and I realize I need to get high differential
<br/>
wins and make sure no one goes undefeated.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS v Tim Green’s ROps (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)
<br/>
<br/>
I do the ANSB start.  He deploys Arnet to DSII DB, I Signal for my
<br/>
Rebel Fleet &amp; deploy Sullust.  He deploys Vader to his Forest, I 
<br/>
deploy an xwing to Sullust and move it to Ralltiir, saving a force.
<br/>
He drops Fett in Slave 1, I barrier, but he also deploys an ATST 
<br/>
pilot to his Swamp and moves Arnet to his generic DB to flip.  I
<br/>
get EBO out on my next turn, and proceed to beatdown Fett with 3 
<br/>
xwings and an Org Attack.  He draws high (his objective helps too)
<br/>
but he still loses Fett and 2-3 more force.  I also deployed Battle
<br/>
Plan.  So he pays 3 to drain, I cancel w/Rebel Fleet, so he pays 3
<br/>
to drain me for 1.  I like that, paying 6 for a 1 drain.  He 
<br/>
deploys Ice Plains w/a Tempest Scout and Chirneau there.  I have yet
<br/>
to draw a Rogue speeder, so I’m afraid of him getting Decree going.
<br/>
But he just draws.
<br/>
<br/>
So I deploy Boushh to the swamp, break cover and kill the lone ATST
<br/>
pilot plus 2-3 more force (I battle for free, something he forgot).
<br/>
And he flips back.  Now I spread my xwings to his Wakeelmui, and my
<br/>
Hoth, Sullust, and Kiffex.  He doesn’t pay to drain and kills an 
<br/>
xwing w/IG in ship at Kiffex.  I drain for 13, he draws.  I move
<br/>
Hobbie and Luke to his generic DB, and move Wedge to my North Ridge
<br/>
to drain for 1 (I *still* have no speeders!).  He drops Igar in 
<br/>
Tempest 1 to Boushh, I lose her and she barely covers the damage.  
<br/>
He also deployed Zuckuss to Ralltiir (which I barriered), so he was
<br/>
about to flip when I informed him that Luke and Hobbie were at his DB
<br/>
so he only controlled 2 sites.  He moves the Tempest Scout to my
<br/>
Hoth DB and Chirneau to my MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain him for
<br/>
all but 1 force, then he draws his last force up.  Win by 29.
<br/>
4 (+59).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Keeping him on the zero side for most of the game.
<br/>
Worst: IG in ship for killing my xwing, but at least it didn’t
<br/>
satisfy Battle Plan.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS v Chris Green’s HB mains (Insurr, Squassin, Strike Plan)
<br/>
<br/>
Chris and Kyle are both from Lodi, and Chris wants to beat me too.
<br/>
So the ’whole Lodi crew’ is after me.  Oh well, who cares anyway.  :)
<br/>
I have Endor DB in my hand, but I know he plays it as well and I 
<br/>
want to convert his DB.  But he doesn’t deploy it, so that’s fine 
<br/>
with me cuz I only play it as a BG site for Vader.  He deploys 
<br/>
Endor (which is in my hand, but I don’t convert it just yet).  I
<br/>
end up losing Endor to Visage.  I don’t get my Vader out until 
<br/>
my 3rd turn, and he’s just been drawing.  So I’ve got Piett and 
<br/>
Merrejk at my Exec DB and Lord Vader at his CC DB.  Its the only 
<br/>
BG site on table.
<br/>
<br/>
He drops Lando w/Ax to Merrejk and Piett, and I smell a beatdown.
<br/>
To my surprise, he deploys EPP Obi!  HD is flipped of course, so
<br/>
Obi can’t battle, so I wait until he initiates battle and then
<br/>
inform him he can’t battle me.  *whew*, I was saved.  I drop Emp
<br/>
and Mara to CC DB and move Merrejk and Piett there (Obi can’t 
<br/>
drain).  He now searches for a DB (Home One &amp; Endor DB are still
<br/>
in there) but he activated both!  So he deploys Jedi Luke to CC DB
<br/>
and moves Obi and Lando to the Med Chamber.  Well, I battle of
<br/>
course &amp; miss both swings on Luke, then draw low destiny.  I lose
<br/>
Merrejk and he loses 13 force rather than lose Luke.  Wtf?  I
<br/>
guess he just wanted to give up, whatever.  He activates all but
<br/>
one force and before he gets to his control phase to drain me I
<br/>
duel Luke w/Vader.  I know I’ve got 2 3’s on top, so if he draws
<br/>
a 5, we tie.  A 6 wins the duel for him.  He draws a 4 and rather
<br/>
than cross Luke he loses 18 force and that’s game.  Win by 22.
<br/>
6 (+81).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Everything, just a good game for me.
<br/>
Worst: Seemed like he gave up after he made the mistake of 
<br/>
deploying Obi to battle Piett.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I’m ahead in differential, but I need more victory points. 
<br/>
There is only 1 undefeated player now, John Monroe.  So, like
<br/>
last tourney, I play John in Game 5.  I only pray I’m dark side.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: DS v John Monroe’s WYS (Insurr, Staging, Squassin)
<br/>
<br/>
We always pair up towards the end of tourneys.  I get DLOTS to
<br/>
Tat DB 1st turn, he plays TT cancelling Visage.  He puts Tallon
<br/>
Karrade to Home One DB, saves 1.  I drop Mara w/saber to Tallon,
<br/>
he barriers.  I deploy Emp to Cantina.  Looks good for me so far.
<br/>
He pulls Falcon using Capt Solo, deploys them to Tat DB, moves
<br/>
Tallon aboard and takes off to the system.  I drain for 5, play
<br/>
Piett and Dominator to Kashyyk.  He drains me for 1, moves 
<br/>
Falcon to Dominator, draws.  I drop Saber 4 w/pilot and a SFS
<br/>
cannon, but I didn’t feel confident I could hit a maneuver 6 ship,
<br/>
so I saved 3 and let him go.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention I 
<br/>
deployed Secret Plans and SSPFT 1st turn.  Yup, it was a good 
<br/>
starting hand.  SFS and Wakeelmui were also on table, along with
<br/>
the Endor DB.  So I was activating 18, he was activating 9.
<br/>
<br/>
He dropped Jedi Luke w/saber to DLOTS (he doesn’t get to flip
<br/>
though), battles, I Weapon Lev the saber, miss the choke on Luke,
<br/>
and draw low.  Luke Smoke Screens for a 6.  Vader dies, and he
<br/>
moves the Falcon to Tatooine, with me forgetting to make him pay 
<br/>
+2 force to do so.  Had I remembered that, I could’ve beat the 
<br/>
Falcon down next turn.  So I deploy Lord Vader w/Saber to Luke, 
<br/>
hit him and draw low battle destiny again so I lose 2 force.
<br/>
WYS is *still* on the zero side and like 20 cards are already
<br/>
in his lost pile.  Dominator follows the Falcon to Tatooine.
<br/>
He runs away, and after draining for 8, I drop the Executor, Emp’s
<br/>
Sword, Emp’s Shield (retrieving 6), and move the Dominator over to
<br/>
back them up (I’ll Take The Leader was on table so I didn’t battle).
<br/>
<br/>
He thinks for a loooong time (as only John can, j/k John *lol*),
<br/>
and deploys Chewie w/gun and Theron Nett to Lord Vader to finally 
<br/>
flip WYS.  He battles, Vader hits Chewie, Chewie misses, and we 
<br/>
are both cleared, so WYS flips back to zero side.  He also had
<br/>
deployed Wedge in Red Squadron 1 to back up the Falcon.  On my 
<br/>
turn, I deploy DLOTS to Tat DB, then battle at Kashyyk, missing the
<br/>
shot on the Falcon but clearing all but Capt Han and the Falcon.
<br/>
I had deployed Onix 1 w/ Jendon aboard, so I lost Jendon &amp; sent
<br/>
Onix 1 to used pile.  He backs up the Falcon by deploying Melas
<br/>
aboard the Skate (Mirax wasn’t in his reserve).  I drain (those 
<br/>
drains at the Cantina and Home One DB have been hurtin’ him), 
<br/>
then clear him in space by shooting down the Skate.  I lose Saber 4
<br/>
and the pilot, then move the Executor and Emp’s Sword to Tatooine.
<br/>
He draws and my drains end the game.  Win by 30.  8 (+111).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Only letting WYS flip for a single phase of a turn.
<br/>
Worst: Drawing low in my battles vs. Jedi Luke.  Visage getting
<br/>
cancelled sucked too.  I didn’t draw much, so i never got another
<br/>
one.
<br/>
<br/>
Now no one is undefeated and I am waaaay ahead in differential.
<br/>
Kyle is around 8 (+60) and he’s in 2nd, so if I win the next game,
<br/>
no matter the differential, I win.  Kyle should be my next opponent,
<br/>
but we already did my LS v his DS.  So I play John again.  John is at
<br/>
8 (+29).
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: LS v John Monroe’s ISB Big Blue (IAO, Mob Pts, Decree)
<br/>
<br/>
We played this matchup last weekend with me getting a timed win by 17
<br/>
only because of 2 less cards than John in my lost pile.  So I was
<br/>
worried, to say the least.  I ask him why he doesn’t start SSPFT 
<br/>
(since it was a huge card for him last weekend), but he just says
<br/>
he needs those other 3 effects out for sure.  Personally, I’d start
<br/>
SSPFT over Decree if I knew I would be playing against an xwing 
<br/>
swarm deck.  Especially since he didn’t even use Decree last weekend
<br/>
(against me anyways).
<br/>
<br/>
So I start ANSB, he gets Piett w/imp Command to the Exec DB, gets
<br/>
Executor w/Mob Pts (the REAL Executor he calls it, not the ’one that
<br/>
got blown up in the movie’ as he calls it).  I Signal for Yarna, he 
<br/>
pulls Merrejk, drops him with Piett and pulls Fondor.  I deploy EBO
<br/>
my 2nd turn, deploy Rogue 2, move Zev in, and move Luke to War Room.
<br/>
He drops Executor w/Chirneau to Fondor, deploys Yavin IV.  I drop an
<br/>
xwing to Executor.  I deploy Sullust and Kiffex.  I move my xwing from
<br/>
Hoth DB to Hoth, move Luke into Rogue 2 and move Rogue 2 to North 
<br/>
Ridge.  He drops Thrawn &amp; Chimaera to Hoth, battles, and I Hyper 
<br/>
Escape to Coruscant.  Executor battles my lone xwing, I play Houjix.
<br/>
I drain for 4, deploy a bunch of xwings at all systems except Hoth &amp;
<br/>
Fondor, deploy Menace Fades, and draw into Rogue 1 &amp; 3.  He deploys
<br/>
Devastator &amp; 2 ORS, I Hyper Escape away.  This game made me realize
<br/>
I need to play Order To Engage in this deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Now I deploy Rebel Fleet, and he’s eating some big drains.  So he
<br/>
drops a Blizzard Walker to North Ridge w/Ozzel aboard.  Then he moves 
<br/>
Devastator to Hoth and shuttles both ORS into the ATAT.  The ATAT 
<br/>
moves to the MPG to satisfy Decree.  I drain, drop Rogue 3 w/Wedge
<br/>
against the ATAT, drop Rogue 1 w/Hobbie to the Ridge.  He’s lost SSPFT
<br/>
off the top to drains, so I’m *very* happy about that.  I check my
<br/>
reserve and see 2 5’s in there, so I drop 2 xwings vs. the Avenger &amp;
<br/>
Chirneau and play Org Attack (Incom Corp on table).  Chirneau dies.
<br/>
Then Wedge battles, he draws a 3, I draw 5, but I add 1 to it w/
<br/>
Heading for Medical Frigate and we tie on power.  He loses Ozzel.
<br/>
Luke gets in Rogue 1 and I move it to Echo DB to prevent Decree next
<br/>
turn.  He has We’re in Attack Position Now on table as well.
<br/>
<br/>
He deploys Blizzard 2 to the Ridge w/Motti and ORS aboard.  Then he
<br/>
moves the non-unique ATAT to Echo DB, &amp; the 2 ORS walk into the War
<br/>
Room, so Decree is satisfied again (he controlled Hoth system w/
<br/>
Thrawn in Chimaera &amp; Devastator).  I drain (he is getting rather low)
<br/>
and deploy Boushh to kill an ORS at the War Room.  I also battle
<br/>
the lone Avenger, and smash it for 17 damage.  He loses Avenger plus
<br/>
8 more.  Now he’s down to 8-9 life force.  He moves the ORS over to
<br/>
the Echo Corridor, cancelling Incom Corp but doesn’t satisfy
<br/>
Decree cuz I moved several xwings to Hoth.  So he battles, but its moot
<br/>
cuz my drains next turn finish him.  This game almost times out.
<br/>
Win by 15.  10 (+126).
<br/>
<br/>
Best: Not having to deal w/SSPFT, that card is what made it sooo close
<br/>
last weekend.
<br/>
Worst: None really, I always drew good destiny and didn’t make any
<br/>
mistakes.
<br/>
<br/>
Why is it my last game always goes to time or is about to go to time?
<br/>
Kyle wins his game by 30, so he’s around 80 or 90 differential, &amp;
<br/>
once again he gets 2nd place, despite beating me.  Nick’s got some
<br/>
real good prize support (lots of R2 packs plus a few ECC packs he got
<br/>
and opened up to distribute the CC packs and fixed cards).  I get a 
<br/>
Masterful Move foil, no packs.  Thanks for reading and Happy
<br/>
Easter everyone.
<br/>
<br/>
Props to:
<br/>
Nick Stefanko for lots of good prizes and no ruling screw-ups.
<br/>
Andrew Meewis for the ride back to the train station.
<br/>
Kyle for beating me in a good game.
<br/>
John for always giving me some good games.
<br/>
John for being the only one to beat Kyle.   :)
<br/>
