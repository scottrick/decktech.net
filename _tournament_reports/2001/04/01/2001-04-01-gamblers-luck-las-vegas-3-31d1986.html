<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"> ( use - as an apostrphe, ok?)Just a 4 gamer, so I-ll try to pack in as much detail as I can remember. There were 14 people today, trying to fight for the Foil Signal (or Masterful Move. Still haven-t got the Decree). I was the tournament director, but when we started there was an odd # of players, so I decided I should play. We ended up getting 2 more players but they were too late for game 1. I was playing the same decks as 2 weeks ago, WYS and MKOS Abyssins.

ok... on to the games:
<br/>
game 1 WYS vs. Chris Hines~s SYCFA with Destroyers and Tractor Beams (I start BP, Squadass, and Staging)
<br/>
His 1st turn he deployed Janus to the DS DB,Rendili with Mob. Pts., DS War Room, DS Corridor (prizon) and draws a couple. My turn I deploy a raider to the Tat: DB and Squadass Dash to Tatooine. I had 1 force saved and Barrier in hand. He then deploys Lord Vader to Tat: DB to kill the raider, but I barrier. He draws a couple and says go. In my opening hand I had both ECC Chewie, and EPP Han, imagine the carnage... So I deploy them and battle. Shoot with Han, and drew my foil JK Luke. Hit forfeit 0. Chris was frustrated by that (of course) and ended up losing about 12 force. I lost the raider. (remember the JK Luke, I only have 1 foil) So his turn, Chimaera and Palleon pay Dash a visit. He draws a 2 for destiny. I draw a 5 and obviously reduced his power down. He gets more upset at this. He loses Palleon and leaves the destroyer. I kill it on my turn and say go. He comes down with Thunderflare and a pilot with ability = enough, and a tractor beam. He battles and I draw destiny of 6. The foil Luke. He says -Did you track that?- I say- No it was dumb luck.- (which it was). So his pilot dies but he tractors Dash in. My turn, I Tunnel/Control to get the Skate from my force pile, and Squadass for Mirax and deploy her to Tatooine. I shuffle and he cuts. HE CUTS!!  I battle and draw the foil Luke. He got pissed and says that I am tracking it and it is different from all my cards,which it isn’t. I was speechless, but oh well, Dash was freed. From the it was downhill for him as my drains caught up to him.
<br/>
Full Win by 36
<br/>
2(+36)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Sweet WYS
<br/>
Slops: being told I was cheating when it was plain old dumb luck.
<br/>
<br/>
So I hand him my deck and say go ahead and find it, but we never resolve it. Matt switches me one regular JK for my foil one. He tried to find it in my deck saying that foils were bent, but could not on 5 different cuts. IT WAS DUMB LUCK MAN!!!  so anyways...
<br/>
<br/>
While this happened Tim lost to Brandon Chong (upset) and Brandon Gravo lost to John Spadora (another upset) refer to the ratings up there to see what I mean. onward...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Abyssins vs. Brandon Chong- WYS
<br/>
Not too eventful, but I-ll try to recall some stuff. On my 1st turn, there were no JP sitez in my deck. Lame. So I draw and say go. He Squadasses for Cpt Han and Falcon and go. I had drawn one of my sitez, so I get the AC from reserve and drop the passages from hand. and draw a couple. He puts down Karrde and an RFC at the cantina and looks for Kessel. Not There! So he says go. I deploy Jabba the Mighty to the AC with Bib, and Xizor to the Cantina. Got the flip coz he couldntfind Kessel. (also, SAV was down after Jabba) I drop 1st strike and battle. I drew Abyssin Orn/W Wookie for destiny. (Having a good day as far as that goes, destiny and all) he was pissed and lost both dudes and flipped back. In retrospect, he only had to lose the RFC, but oh well. He gets oout Kessel and moves there to get some drains. I put Gailid at the AC and some dudes to JP. He drains me and I had no cancellers, weak. I take the drain. He brings out Rebel Scout Luke and fights Xizor. I endup losing 1 or 2. So I drop 2Abyssins and Boelo to the cantina in retribution. I battle and he loses a few. I also get out Den O Thieves and S&amp;D. I moved Boelo and an Abyssin to the DB where Jabba-s Sail was waiting to wisk them away to JP, and I move the dudes at JP to the passages. I draw Zuckuss in Hunter. He drains in space but I block it. He puts Mirax at the cantina to flip, and Lando w/gun to the Falcon. He says go. I deploy Z in MH to Kessel and an abyssin with him. I battle on the groud and retrieve, and he plays It-s A Trap. I battle in space, more retrieval. no one dies. Eventually he just dies. Full win by 36 again
<br/>
4 (+72)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: No flaws in this game for me
<br/>
Slops: Brandon was cool and it was terrible to watch his guys die so much.
<br/>
<br/>
At this point John beat Kris which is another Upset.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: Abyssins vs. John-s HB with Matching Pilots
<br/>
I had a god like draw. S&amp;D, Chall, Twi-lek Advisor, 2 sitez, Abyssin, and NSP, and Hutt Influence. I deploy my sitez, and Hutt Influence. I say go. He Squadasses with Red 6 for Jek. He gets him to the Rendezvous Pt. Deploys Endor from reserve, and Kashyyyk and Bespin from hand. On my turn I do the flip with SAV, Chall, some abyssins and I get Jabba once per game and Bib with POTH. He deploys Kiffex and Kessel and Squadasses for Lil Luke and Artoo in Red 5. Then he moves them to Kessel and flips. My drains remain, fortunatly. So I drain, then remember to deploy S&amp;D. I put an abyssin alone at the passages to try to draw him in. He bites and drops Cracken and Blount. I NSP Blount. He deploys Green Leader and battles. I lose the abyssin and a card or 2. Then I come with the beats. Xizor, Dengar w/gun, and a couple of abyssins and a Bubo. Bubo eats Cracker, and Green Leader meets his maker. loss of 14 or so. From then it is a race and I eventually drain him out. Full Win by 34
<br/>
<br/>
6(+106)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Solid game vs. HB just like it is supposed to be
<br/>
Slops: Forgetting to deploy S&amp;D sooner.
<br/>
Ugly: Green Leader-s grisly death
<br/>
<br/>
At this point Brandon Gravo hasn’t won a game yet. LOL. and he is mad that Berta is worth 15 points on the DPC list.
<br/>
<br/>
Game (final) 4: WYS vs. Kris-s HDADTJ
<br/>
This was a J.R. Style slobberknocker. One of us would be way ahead then the other. His 1st turn, I kill Visage. He deploys Premiere Vader and another Visage. (Now I know. It is unique. he shouldn-t have. I am a scrub dammit) So I Squadass for the pilot of Red Squadron 1. Heh heh. Wegde is there and takes the sky. He deploys Kashyyyk and saves some money (force). I deploy EPP Han and ECC Chewie to the cantina and fight. I play Sorry/Proficiency with Han and shoot at Vader. Draw a 1. Miss. He YAB-s Chewie. He hacks Han and draws a 6 (7 coz prmiere Vader) and laughs. I play Houjix/OONowhere from lost pile. I laugh back. His turn he Laterally damage-s RS1 and deploys Fett in his ship to Tatooine, but I Barrier. He saves the rest of his force. I Squadass Dash to Kashyyyk (reason unknown) and move Wedge over and cancel Damage and move Dash over to Tatooine. I had also put a raider at the DB coz I had Fallen Portal. He comes with Mara at the raider and prescence on the Cantina. He kills the Raider after the portal misses and I lose a few. He moves Fett away from Dash to Wedge at Kashyyyk. I follow with Dash on My turn and have to flip back coz I don’t have 2 BG-s. and I draw some. He brings a Dreadnaught to fight with Fett. We throw down and he draws high enough to kill Wedge and I kill the Dread. On my Turn, Melas Takes Wegde-s Place and Lando and a raider go to face Mara. I fight and utterly destroy fett. He took 14 damage from it. Dash is a machine, and A Few Maneuvers is a good destiny to draw with anything. I Kill Mara too and he clears my site with the saber and such. So I round up Karrde, ECC Chewie JK Luke and a Mirax to fight Vader and Tarkin in the cantina. I play Cantina Brawl but to no avail. I battle and shoot Tarkin. He swings at Chewie, and sucessfully duels Luke. I draw phat destiny and Kill Luke with Tark. Karrde is the only survivor of the carnage. I move to the DB and draw a Bith Shuffle combo and play it in his reserve. Then I draw  A Few Maneuvers and play it on Dash. Then I draw Portal. I am totally safe!!! He comes with IG-88 and fights. Portal, draw a 6. He moves Vader over. I activate to the portal, drain with Dash and draw. The portal is in Hand. He fights and I portal Vader and the game ends. Full Win by 6
<br/>
