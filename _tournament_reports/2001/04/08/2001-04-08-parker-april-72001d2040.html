<br/>
Well first is first, its late friday night and i am on the phone with my friends, and its like ok Didn’t do so hot last week at states we modified all our decks and i totally changed my Dark from Agents Of Black sun to Hunt Down.  Its like hey you got us rides for tomarrow i can get us picked up. Jake is like no my parents can’t bring us, we Call Chris he’s like no they said no.  I go and call everyone i know, finally i call my Grandma she’s all like sure i can do that.  Cool i call Chris "Hello" "hey is Chris there?" "no he wen’t to David O’Briens" "Ok Thanks Bye" ::click::, David O’Briens?? Not there, its Called Star WARS Tournament , not O’briens so we can play computer games all night. ok I call Jake its like dude tomarrow i got us rides he’s like right on.
<br/>
   Saturday morning, Ok i was at my Aunts to sleep over and i have no cards there and i wanna fix my decks up a bit. Hmm what to do, i find i small pile of cards and i am all set.  I go through and add some omni boxes thinking hell trackable 6’s are nice and i think the annoying factor is nice sometimes.  7:30 i set my cousins alarm clock and it goes off playing some Rap crap and i’m thinking its gonna be a bad day.  I go into the shower after a good few hours of sleep. I get ready then 8:30 i call my grandma shes like on my way.  She gets me we are on our way with jake thinking fate has lost trying to keep us from this tournament.  Then we run into Road closures, everywhere, we get through it all and we finally arrive 1/2 an hour early. I buy a pack of DSII and what do i pull, Nuthin but the crapy flagship executor.

GAMES
<br/>
----------
<br/>
Game 1:Hunt Down &amp; Get Jiggy Wit it vs. Profit
<br/>
   Right away i choose not to throw my 2 aliens out, Shoulda kept Xizor in the deck, figured Mara Wasn’t worth it alone.  I quickly drop my force of Mara and Dark Lord Of The Sith. I kill off his first wave of people.  I move out of the audience chamber and he realeases han retrieving his few cards. He comes out and i throw some things down and get some docking bays out throwing Emperor and His advisor and transit to endor to drain for 2 there.  His turn he tries to initiate but My objective and leia holds him back, My turn i drop my people. I initiate and choke Han, then i swing at chewie hit him and Darkstrike to make him lost.  Mara takes her glowstick and hits leia, She misses with her boom stick.  Tarkin Cancels i draw a six.  He loses stuff to drains and Visage i spread out and drain. FW of about 11

Game 2:WYS My Way Or The Highway vs. Jaymson’s ISB

<br/>
2:-4
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:Hunt Down &amp; Get Jiggy Wit it vs. MWYHL
<br/>
   Ok feeling good about this and Jake just played this guy and our decks are pretty much the exact same but his has a few different twists.  This guy is playing to train and i know exactly what to do, i flip fast and throw Mara with vader and drained then the dang R2-D2 comes under cover, eliminating my high drain, i send a few people elsewhere to drain and shuttle Mara and Sith to the devestator thats orbitting Endor.  Endor hyperspeeds to dagobah.  He tries to train and fails the first time.  He only draws one forgetting his objective lets him draw 2 and choose.  I space it out at the time and next turn he completes.  He trains Daughter to test 2 b4 vader shuttles down to dagobagh.  He can’t fight cause of the objective and i on my turn pay my 2 force to you are beaten Yoda. I initiate against the daughter and Swing at her drawing 2 6’s, We draw destiny i draw another tracked 6 and he draws a 3, he loses daughter and some cards i am immune. Mara shuttles to site next to vader i don’5t draw.  He draws out.  FW 15

<br/>
Game 4:WYS My Way or the Highway vs. Chris Fanchi Rep Deck
<br/>
   Man not what i wanted today.  The Rep Deck from hell!!  Ok He does alot of everything and i try to but i do alot of nothing. None of my cards that i need come and he eats me.  FL.
<br/>
<br/>
4:-4&lt;or so i don’t remember differentials to well&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Hunt Down &amp; get Jiggy Wit it vs Joe Helfrich Profit
<br/>
  Man I knew i would get paired with him...Exactly what i didn’t want to happen i got a win over him last week and i doubted my ability to repeat.  I don’t go to the audience chamber and stop him there....Mistake one.  Late game i duel luke...mistake 2= i didn’t track this.  His dumb -3 to attempts o cross him over made me mad. luke wins the duel by 1 pretty much game.  Joe does all he needs to do to win by 17. FL
<br/>
<br/>
4:-21
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: WYS My Way or the Highway vs. Carbon Chamber Testing
<br/>
  Pregame pep-talk---
<br/>
"Hey You know what i did to your counter part after last week right?"
<br/>
The light side stack of cards just stare at me.
<br/>
"Do you want the same fate as my Agents of Blacksun Deck?"
<br/>
you can sense the cards say no and get warmed up.
<br/>
On with the game---
<br/>
   Ok Night b4 i throw in frozen assets WHY DID I? hmm i still had no clue.  He uses Jabba’s Prize Yeah I keep my Rebel! ok he drops IG with Capture-stick and snags the prize and heads to the audience chamber.  I have Luke Rebel Scout in hand with his glowstick starring me in the face.  I drop Dash in his Shp at the kessel i just put out.  He puts out that Bossk guy and moves IG with him at the docking bay.  I play frozen assets and it looks my right in the eye and i get a grin. Ok Rebel scout for 5 with glow stick.  then Mirax in Skate at tatooine. i’m thinking RIGHT ON! i initiate for free and use the glowstick to cut ig down to size. He attempts to captuer Rebel Scout. He Draws a 6 and is happy i inform him my glowstick adds to my defense value. destiny draws i get a 5 he gets a 2, I win and realease the prize then put Han with boomstick to convert.  Next turn he gets his 1 drain at the audience chamber.  I drop Chewie and move him with han for a better drain while lando and melas go to the cantina.  Obi Makes an odd apearance with his glow stick at the docking bay 94.  I drain him out and lose his 1 a turn drain from hand and win.  FW 35
