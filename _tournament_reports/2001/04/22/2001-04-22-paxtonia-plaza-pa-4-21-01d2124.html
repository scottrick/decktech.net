<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I woke up at 7:00 in the morning ready to play in the tourney at the local store. I had decided that i was goin to play my huntdown deck and my train crix to test 1/supa falcon deck. After i had tune my decks, i had go mow my lawn and some other jank. 
<br/>
when i got to the store at 12 tourney directer james leiser was already their so i decided to play him in some games before the tourney started. I had found out my supa falcon deck wrecks most ground decks, but has trouble against big blue. when it got to be around 2 we had about 6 players, so we had to scrounge up 2 players that have not played in years.
<br/>
heres the report-
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1
<br/>
ME-light vs Chad bowser’s, hunt down
<br/>
<br/>
       Chad is pretty good but this was his first game in a while, i got kinda nervous since i have trouble with hunt down sometimes. He pulled some DB’s and drew up. I then sacked YISYW to go get honor. I then pulled the hut and put down yoda, i also got kessel and home1 and hass’n in my hand so i would be set in 2 turns. On his next turn he puts vader with sabre at the endor DB then he flips and ends his turn. I put crix down with test 1 pull more dagobah sites and put a projection at the DB. on his next turn he put mara and sabre at the yavin IV DB. then on my turn i put anothe projection thier i also failed my test with 2 1’s, so i pulled the last site in the deck and ploped kessel down with home 1 and hassh’n. on his turn he puts zuckuss with iggy aboard down and flies it to dagobah hoping to sniper crix 2 turns from now. on my turn i failed test one again with a 1 and a zero, so i then tunnel vision for couracant and put the supa falcon thier, and then a few meneuvers it so i would’nt fail test 1 again. I also put uncontrollable fury on vader but he canceled it right away with you are beaten. on his turn he lands zuckuss to an adjacent site and moves iggy to the hut. on my turn i got test 1 with a tracked 6 and moved crix and yoda to the training ground. he does no more damage to me because all his drains are blocked and i drain for 6 in space he eventually runs out. ME FW  +20   2(+20)
<br/>
the game would have been diffrent if chad would have had time to work on his decks and known them better.
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 2
<br/>
<br/>
ME dark VS WESLY PAYNE’s RTP deck
<br/>
<br/>
This was a pretty quick game since i knew how to play against it and huntdown should beat RTP most of the time anyway. I put vader in the Yavin IV DB flip put down rendilli and the endor DB and then move vader in to the warroom. he puts down 8D8 a swoop and a lift tube at the DS DB and moves 8D8 to the prison. i drain and draw up a bit.(My hand sucked @$$, i had no characters or walkers)
<br/>
he ends up flipping his objective second turn and i get scared because its obvious vader will die next turn. I look at my hand i got lord vader and a sabre so i persona replace him I was gonna battle but decided not to because vader would die to a warriors courage so i leave him there hoping that wes would do what i thought he’d do. and he did it, he put look with leia at the warroom he tries to battle but i point out to him that skywalkers can’t battle at non-battlegrounds. I now have blizzar 2, ozzle and 2 tramples in my hand. i put it at the DB, trample 8d8 and move vader to its site. By this time he had lost to many cards to the visage and the force drain, he moved luke to vader and the walkers site and the he lost 15 in battle damage
<br/>
I ended up winning by 28
<br/>
ME FW +28     4(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 3
<br/>
ME light side VS JOSH WHITMORE’s MKOS deck with chevins
<br/>
<br/>
This was probably the closest game of the day. on his first turn he puts gailid down with ephant mon at the audiance chamber. on my turn i put yoda at the hutt and draw. then he drained and put mara with sabre at the jabbas palce. on my turn i pull some sites and i put corn horn and EPP luke against mara i battled beat him by 4 but i missed with thes  sabre and drew a 2. i lose luke and then he just battles corn horn, i draw a 5 and we both die. on my turn i finally start the training with crix and put another EPP luke at the desert heart. He just drains on his turn then draws. I tunnel vision for coruscant and put wedge and ship thier. then he comes down with some scrubs and kills luke but luke killed them too. I drain for 3 the whole game  in coruscant while he drains for 1 the whole game at the chamber. I eventually take over the palace and desert heart with mains, and i drain him out with only few cards left.
<br/>
ME FW +8  6(+56)
<br/>
this player was from chambersburg, hes pretty good player.
<br/>
<br/>
FINAL round
<br/>
ME dark  VS  CHAD BOWSER’s WYS deck
<br/>
<br/>
I start out by just pulling DB’s and rendilli and draw for lord vader. on his turn he draws for more smugglers. I Put down vader in the cantina on my turn and he puts down dash and ship at kasshhhyk and puts down EPP han and chewie protector, vader catches beatings but the battle damage was small. He ends up losing han and has to leave and un protected chewie in the DB. i drop epp vader and a blizzard 2 with evax and crush him. he loses around 10 cards i move vader back into the cantina. he puts more guys in space and i drain. Battle plan was hurting me a bit so i put zuckuss at tatooine. he moves his guys over and then i drop  denjgar in ship and lateral damage the outfider and dar a total of 8 for battle destiny. he loses most of his space and then i drain him out.
<br/>
ME FW +18    8(+74)
