<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Okay, this is my first TR so here goes:
<br/>
<br/>
I got to the store about 9:30, 1 and 1/2 hours before starting time.  I got my decklists checked out and got bored while I waited to start.  Finally it’s 11:30, (it was supposed to start at 11:00) and we start the first game.  
<br/>
<br/>
Game #1:  My MKOS versus Michael Peralta’s MWYHL
<br/>
<br/>
What happened: I start off badly but I get back in it with Gailid.  He’s using Battle Plan so I pay 2 to drain every time. (3, but I get one back with Jabba) He pulls tests and Yoda and completes all 5 by turn eight.  He’s retrieveing with a Power Droid using Off The Edge at the Incinerator.  He completes the 5th test, and starts pulling mains.  He takes over the palace over 2-3 turns and we time-out.  I lose by 28
<br/>
<br/>
FL:-28
<br/>
<br/>
High point: I get Gailid down 3rd turn.
<br/>
Low Point: I lost.  ’nuff said.
<br/>
<br/>
Notes: I finally get ahold of an EPP Leia and Ketwol after the game.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We start the 2nd game on time and I have a bad feeling when I sit down against the TD’s son, Andrew Taylor.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #2: My X-wing versus his Huntdown.
<br/>
<br/>
I start with a TT in hand and cancel Visage before I lose anything to it.  I then get out Honor and flip and drain.  He drops a Bossk in Bus at Hoth and I mutilate it for 18 battle damage.  He never gets off another probe and I coast to a 30 force win.
<br/>
<br/>
FW:+30
<br/>
Total:2 +2
<br/>
<br/>
High point: I get rid of Zuckuss with my first drain.
<br/>
Low Point: I lose 4 to S&amp;D before I get out Honor.
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:I trade for a Mara and a Chall.  I wish I had those before the tourney started.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We take a 40 minute lucnh break.  I go down to Jack-in-the-Box with My Friend, James Fisher.  Just to prove how my luck is today, I order an Ultimate Cheeseburger and they give me a BACON Ultimate Cheeseburger.  I want to trade so I let James finish my fries.  While we are gone, they raffle of a Jap. Foil Darth Vader.  Derek Snook wins.  However, he sayes, "I already have one of these".  He goes over to little 8 year old Chris Turcotte, and gives it to him.  Chris is so happy he runs over and hugs Snook’s Leg.  Yay Snook!  They announce it’s time for the third game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #3: My X-wings versus Brenton Roberts BHBM.
<br/>
<br/>
I get 3 X-wings and 2 Organized in my first hand and drop 9 X-wings first turn.  I get Menace Fades and PoaSs down and he is draining for three while I drain for 8.  He keeps it close, but I win by 10
<br/>
<br/>
FW: +10
<br/>
Total: 4 +12
<br/>
<br/>
Notes: I get Xixor and Mirax.  I’m feeling great.
<br/>
<br/>
We start the next game pretty quickly afterwards and I’m up against some pretty stiff competition in Eddie Turcotte’s WYS.  He would later finish 8th overall.
<br/>
<br/>
Game#4: My MKOS versus his WYS.
<br/>
<br/>
We both play our own games and his is better.  I can’t stop his Celebrating and he retrieves 3 every turn.  I do manage to pull off a couple of monster battles and only lose by 19.  I did not play well.  (never found Gailid)
<br/>
<br/>
FL: -19
<br/>
Total: 4 -7
<br/>
<br/>
It’s the end of the second round and I go trade.  I pick up another Mara, the Skate, and a Virago for cheap.  We raffle of an oversized Huntdown+an EPP Leia Foil.  I don’t win.
<br/>
We prepare for game 5.
<br/>
<br/>
Game #5: my MKOS versus Kyle Kruegers AITC Ewoks.
<br/>
<br/>
He gets Tessek, Rebel Landing Site, the Hut and Chirpa+he Pulls Madine and Solo in his opening hand.  I can’t find Gailid and he starts draining.  I put my Myos to good use but can’t stop the bleeding.  He drains me out and wins by 19, pulling of a ’Chimes’ before the last drain.  Dang!  My dark deck goes 0-3. I hope I can pull off a miracle and finish in the + range.
<br/>
<br/>
FL: -19
<br/>
Total: 4 -26
<br/>
<br/>
Notes:  I decide I hate Ewoks.  I am avidly seeking a Mara’s Stick and can’t find one.  Finally one kid trades me his after the last game.
<br/>
<br/>
Everyones can’t wait for the last game and no one times out so we start quickly.  I am playing for honor more than anything else and I am willing my X-wings to win.  I play against Tom Ryan’s AOBS.
<br/>
<br/>
game #6: My X-wings versus his AOBS.  
<br/>
<br/>
I drain away his third battle-ground and start draining.  He can’t stop the Honor because he dare not come to space.  He finally comes too late and I out-drain him, pulling off All Wings Report In at the end and win by 29.  YEEEEAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
FW: +29
<br/>
Total:6 +3  ( I made the positives baby!)
<br/>
<br/>
The prizes are awarded, last to 3. (Nick Jones and Douglas Harvilla have a final confrontation to see who wins and gets a garuanteed seat at Worlds, day 2.  Jones wins.)  I finish 22nd and Feel very pleased.  By the way, remember that Mara’s Stick I needed?  I pull a Foil one in my prize Ref 2 booster.  Not fair :(  But hey, I trade it away in 3 days for some nice stuff.  I can’t wait for my next tourney.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoyed this,
<br/>
