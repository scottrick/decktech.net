<br/>
be warned !!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Pretourny junk : After finally deciding to attend the SW
<br/>
National Championship, which i was not sure about, because
<br/>
i haven´t had a sanctioned SW tournament since the ´99
<br/>
Ralltiir Regional, i now have three weeks to find two decks,
<br/>
good enough to get me some wins.
<br/>
<br/>
After talking to some Decktech members, who tell me not to
<br/>
worry about my rating, and play stuff i know, i turn to my
<br/>
friend Brian Hunter in advice for decks.
<br/>
Some days later, i have narrowed down my list to two decks
<br/>
each side : WYS or Hidden Mains for light, MKOS or Dark Deal
<br/>
for Dark. I come to the conclusion, not to play WYS, since
<br/>
i expect everyone to use it, and go with the HB Mains.
<br/>
For Dark i end up with Dark Deal, seeing that my MKOS, while
<br/>
very balanced, doesn´t as good as i hoped.
<br/>
<br/>
So, after some playtesting, the day before the Nationals
<br/>
arrives.
<br/>
<br/>
Friday, 04/06/01 (evening) : I hurry arround and scramble
<br/>
to get all my stuff together; get a hunch to include
<br/>
Battle Plan instead of Kal Fal, but ultimatively decide
<br/>
against it, because i am worried, that i won´t be able to
<br/>
hold it with four ships (editors note : had i decided for
<br/>
the Battle Plan, it would have helped in two games).
<br/>
<br/>
But i decide on dumping Brangus for Xizor, which would
<br/>
wound up to have no effect at all on my deck (didn´t deploy
<br/>
Xizor all day).
<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, 04/07/01 : I wake at four, get up at four thirty,
<br/>
and manage to goof arround till five. Then i get to the bus,
<br/>
which arrives shortly after.
<br/>
<br/>
When i hit the next stop, where i am supposed to change bus
<br/>
to get to the train-station, i realize, i am short on time,
<br/>
because i will never make it in fifty minutes with a 
<br/>
conventional bus plus riding the tub to get my train at
<br/>
6:21. So i get a cab - turns out to be a good decision;
<br/>
now i can atleast have some coffee to get awake.
<br/>
<br/>
The trip itself - it takes approximately four hours to 
<br/>
get to Bochum from Berlin (where i live) - is quite boring,
<br/>
so i will spare you the details.
<br/>
<br/>
However, i am able to find the place, where the Natioals
<br/>
are going to be held, rather smoothly.
<br/>
I reintroduce myself to the TD, who for some odd reason 
<br/>
seems to renember me from the ´99 Ralltiir Regional.
<br/>
<br/>
I look arround, and see some new and some old faces; mainly
<br/>
Bastian Winkelhaus (2134) - one of the two top-guns, and
<br/>
as it turns out, Martin Falke (2099), eager to contest him
<br/>
for the title, is there as well - before the tourney starts.
<br/>
<br/>
We have a good turnout - there are 53 people participating,
<br/>
including me ( i am the sole player from Berlin)
<br/>
<br/>
-----End Pretourny Garbage---------------------------------
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : Hidden Mains vs. Endor Ops
<br/>
<br/>
I start Menace Fades, next to Insurrection,Staging Areas.
<br/>
<br/>
The first few turns we just activate, i get out my docking
<br/>
bays, as well as Dagobah, the Hut and Corulag (as i would do
<br/>
every light game), then he deploys Rumors on Endor, drops
<br/>
the Visage with Baron and a scrub piloting.
<br/>
<br/>
I get some guys at my docking bays to drain, and wait for
<br/>
Captain Han Solo, to go with one of my two Falcons in hand.
<br/>
<br/>
I curse myself for not teching against the Bunker, cosz
<br/>
E-Man prevents me from deploying there and beating the @#$%
<br/>
out of him.
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, i get a full Superfalcon up and running, with 
<br/>
Bacta Tank and OTE out. I cannot find my Punch It (as in
<br/>
every other light game i am about to play today), but since
<br/>
Kashyykk is the only system he has presence on, except
<br/>
Endor, i am not worried about the Rumors-drain, i can 
<br/>
always retreat to Corulag to put Menace Fades into effect,
<br/>
should his stuff prove to be more than i can handle.
<br/>
<br/>
He battles me at the aforementioned system, with the
<br/>
Accuser, some scrubs on board and the AO, but despite his
<br/>
immunity, i draw high enough to make him forfeit everything.
<br/>
<br/>
But next turn he laterals my Falcon, brings another SD with
<br/>
crew (but still without Thrawn), Bossk in Bus and Dengar 
<br/>
against my power-zero Falcon. 
<br/>
I manage to kill Dengar and Bossk with my destinies, but in
<br/>
return have to forfeit Leia, who wanders in the Tank.
<br/>
<br/>
Not wanting to get another beating and staying at his mery,
<br/>
i elect to retreat to the rendevous point, to cancel the
<br/>
lateral damage - but alas, he plays Gravity Shadow, and now
<br/>
my ship is stuck.
<br/>
<br/>
He again battles me, after adding the Chimera to his mix,
<br/>
but draws relatively low, so i can just lose Chewie.
<br/>
His ships plus crew, however remain unscathed.
<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, i manage to get to the Lateral Damage, and try
<br/>
to cancel it - 1. Then next two turns prove to be equally
<br/>
satisfying in that matter, as i draw a 2 and another 1.
<br/>
But now, the drains are hurting more and more, and i have
<br/>
to think of retrieval now, despite his SSPFT out.
<br/>
<br/>
I edge Ben for five (to draw my tracked six), but mistrack,
<br/>
draw a 2 (kal fal) and murder Mr.Ben (actually quite 
<br/>
humorous, as i would proceed to edge and kill Ben on another three times).
<br/>
<br/>
We drain some more, but now, i have lost all my retrieval.
<br/>
I finally get Melas to the Endor Docking bay, only to have
<br/>
his drain blocked by Arica, who on the following turn 
<br/>
breaks cover to battle her adversary. After the dust has
<br/>
settled, both the dancer and the alien are dead meat.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, with nothing else to show for (Home One and
<br/>
Spiral went to my lost pile soon)- i succumb to his drains.
<br/>
<br/>
Full Loss (15).
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Dark Deal vs. EBO
<br/>
<br/>
Though he complains about having to lose to me in a drain
<br/>
race, i am equally worried, because EBO is one of the 
<br/>
strongest Light Decks, and sets up much faster - still, 
<br/>
i start Resistance as my third effect.
<br/>
<br/>
He sets up usually, while i try to make something out of
<br/>
my crappy hand - i cannot find Search and Destroy, and he
<br/>
finally commits some Baragwins to his Hoth Locations, which
<br/>
lets me smile inwardly - Baragwin EBO is a deck i can beat.
<br/>
(I very much feared EBOX, because its cannons would keep
<br/>
me of my sector and prevent the deal).
<br/>
<br/>
Well, he finally deploys two X-wings to his systems, so i
<br/>
now know what i am up against.
<br/>
<br/>
Our drains are equal for some time, because Resistance is
<br/>
cutting in his potential to inflict harm on me.
<br/>
But then he gets TK to block Mara´s saber-enhanced drain
<br/>
at the Carbonite Chamber, while Boushh comes undercover to
<br/>
the Executor Dockingbay to pay Thrawn a visit.
<br/>
Seeing that i have no answer for the latter (Barrier), he
<br/>
breaks Leia´s cover and kills Thrawn.
<br/>
<br/>
Cannot find Vader, nor can i find the Sniper to kill TK
<br/>
and reestablish my drain - his drains are now 4-1 in his
<br/>
favor. To make matters worse, Jedi Luke, armed with his
<br/>
fathers Lightsaber, comes down on Ardan and Janus at the
<br/>
West Gallery,but is not allowed to pass due to a Barrier,
<br/>
which gives my men a chance to run away.
<br/>
<br/>
I finally manage to find my Sniper, and Mara kills Han with
<br/>
my tracked six plus a four (about the only time, my tracking skills worked as the should) -  he now has three
<br/>
x-wings at three different systems. I think of beating him
<br/>
down, but i only have Zuckuss and Executor in Hand, and 
<br/>
HIS hand is always average eight cards, so without a ghhhk,
<br/>
i have nothing to answer a swarm of x-wings and the game
<br/>
could be over, if he deploys a cannon, power-pivots my
<br/>
Capital and shoots Zuckass. So i play defensively, even
<br/>
forego the deployment of my sector, because i only have
<br/>
one Tie in hand to go with the Zuckuss in ship - clearly
<br/>
not enough.
<br/>
<br/>
The meager damage i do is covered by the Baragwin retrieval, so i look pretty stupid. Even moreso, when
<br/>
he edges Jedi Luke for six, giving me the loss by 34.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : Dark Deal vs. HB Strikeplan Mains 
<br/>
<br/>
This game nearly everything works out for me, as it should.
<br/>
I get a godlike setup - the Executor with three Admirals
<br/>
at the system, so i can drop the Occupation on turn five,
<br/>
i have Janus, the Emperor, Ardan and Bane Malar at my
<br/>
sites, plus Vader in hand. The two Obsidian Ties get to 
<br/>
the sector, so i am ready to deploy the deal.
<br/>
<br/>
He tries to contest me at the system - but without the
<br/>
Superfalcon, his ships are no match for three battle -
<br/>
destinies and average twenty power. So i slowly wipe him
<br/>
of the system, and drain him out. Win by 22.
<br/>
<br/>
The curse is broken - finally, i have won with a dark deck!
<br/>
<br/>
Game four : Hidden Mains vs. Oldskool Ties (PotF-Start)
<br/>
<br/>
I know that this will be hard; normally, the advise is to
<br/>
stay away from them, so the cannot retrieve even more.
<br/>
<br/>
But i have no I hope she is allright, no BattlePlan or
<br/>
Aim High, i know that my db-drains won´t cut it here; on 
<br/>
top of that, i am unsure, whether i am able to initiate
<br/>
and maintain a retrieval loop with my edge-cards, something
<br/>
that would have saved me from the start.
<br/>
<br/>
The first time i try to retrieve, i kill Ben again.
<br/>
<br/>
I get the Falcon up, battle his lone Bossk in Bus and kill
<br/>
him for five overflow - get out Bacta Tank and Chewie on
<br/>
the Falcon for extra forfeit.
<br/>
<br/>
After that, we have some skirmishes, the Falcon stands its
<br/>
ground, i manage to kil some ties. Eventually i wipe him
<br/>
of Kashyykk and have an uncontested drain for some turns,
<br/>
but then he comes at me with four Interceptors, a 
<br/>
dreadnought, Dengar in Boat, plays All Power, which i 
<br/>
couldn´t grab the first time arround, because i had no
<br/>
grabber then - his power is about 34 to my nine, and i draw
<br/>
low, so i have to lose Leia and Chewie while he is immune.
<br/>
<br/>
He soon battles me another time, after i had run to Corulag, and the ensuing damage is so bad, that i have to
<br/>
lose Han, the Falcon, plus 11 more.
<br/>
<br/>
From that on, i never seem to fully recover; i get off
<br/>
a suprise assault for eight, but he deploys some more ties,
<br/>
and retrieves with short-range fighters for twelve.
<br/>
<br/>
(Btw, he played eighteen Tie Interceptors !)
<br/>
<br/>
I drain some more, but he nails me in the end and i lose
<br/>
by 35, which is the largest i have lost a game to, ever.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am now 1-3, and i hope for another win to go 2-4; i know
<br/>
it is higly unlikely, i will make 3-3;which turns out to
<br/>
be right.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: Hidden Mains vs. Random-space ground with Troopers.
<br/>
<br/>
This game is rather easy. I pretty soon set up at the
<br/>
Tattoine and Cloud City DB, he deploys Mara (which i barrier), followed by some troopers, i deploy Chewie and
<br/>
Leia to Ben, play Order to Engage. He battles, Mara
<br/>
succumbs to Fallen Portal, and i clean everything but one
<br/>
trooper, who scurries away.
<br/>
<br/>
I chase his other troopers plus a ATST again, get some 
<br/>
more damage in, then he finally deploys to space -  
<br/>
for some reason, i don´t want to finsish him so quickly,
<br/>
so i wait before i deploy the Falcon, since i don´t have
<br/>
Leia or some other scrub to go with.
<br/>
<br/>
Again i try to on the Edge Obi, AGAIN, i kill Obi, who -
<br/>
this turn gets tanked. I get him out, try again, only to
<br/>
kill him twice in one game - to add insult to injury, i
<br/>
mistrack for two off the edges.
<br/>
<br/>
Bastian and some others, standing arround, make comments
<br/>
about my inability to track (and i feel rather foolish).
<br/>
<br/>
In the end i drain him out, after a brief skirmish with
<br/>
Jedi Luke and some guys at the backdoor, which nets me
<br/>
another drain for three for several turns, and i drain him
<br/>
out. Full Win by 17.
<br/>
<br/>
Game six : Dark Deal vs. RST - bunker blowup:
<br/>
<br/>
I know whats coming my way, but i get a crappy opening hand, and i know, i can only win, if i play my own game.
<br/>
<br/>
We take some times to setup, and after he moves into the
<br/>
bunker and plants a charge, which he misses the first 
<br/>
draw on, i seriously consider, taking Vader and Sarkli to
<br/>
interfere with his plans, but i seem to detect a smile on
<br/>
my opponents face, telling me he can read my mind - great !
<br/>
<br/>
I play my own game, set up with some characters, most
<br/>
notably the Emperor (Palpy got to see lots of action for
<br/>
his old wrinkled days), get the System out, with the
<br/>
Chimera and lots of scrubs aboard and the occupation going.
<br/>
(I did not deploy the executor, because it got grimtaashed
<br/>
 used an then lost to a drain). 
<br/>
<br/>
I further deploy the sector with a lone Tie, Barrier and
<br/>
Mastermove, Zuckuss in Ship, in Hand. I draw up Bossk in
<br/>
Hounds Tooth, after i deploy the Deal on the Sector.
<br/>
<br/>
He comes down with the Superfalcon. I barrier. He 
<br/>
follows up with Dash in Outrider and decides not to battle.
<br/>
I deploy Boskk in Bus, Guri as passenger and Zuckuss,
<br/>
battle, he has to lose the Outrider, Dash, and the Falcon,
<br/>
plus Han, but i lose Guri.
<br/>
<br/>
He deploys Red Leader in Red 1 (no barrier this time),
<br/>
initiates, shoots Zuckuss and draws high, while i draw low,
<br/>
and lose Bossk. The X-Wing stays, to give me a nice drain
<br/>
of two for the rest of the game.
<br/>
<br/>
I get some more scrubs on Bespin, maintain the drains plus
<br/>
an occupation for three, he tries to challenge me again
<br/>
at the system, but i beat him off - still, his drains are
<br/>
too much. Loss by 19.
<br/>
<br/>
Woah, going 2-4, as predicted.
<br/>
<br/>
Still, i didn´t make any gamebreaking mistakes, which is
<br/>
good. I didn´t even forget to force-drain, but once.
<br/>
(Did i tell you, i didn´t play in a sanctioned tournament
<br/>
 for about one and a half years ?)
<br/>
<br/>
As expected, Bastian and Martin get to play each other in
<br/>
the Final Confrontation - with Martin winning with his 
<br/>
Light by 19, but losing with his dark by 26.
<br/>
<br/>
So, in the end, Bastian gets to be the champ.
<br/>
<br/>
Hope you liked the report. 
<br/>

Props :
<br/>
<br/>
- To Martin Falke, for going undefeated in swiss-games, and
<br/>
  being a nice guy.
<br/>
<br/>
- To Dominic Probst; Dominic always builds the most funky
<br/>
  light decks you can possibly imagine - ´99 Regional he
<br/>
  played Ewoks, this time (believe it or not) he went for
<br/>
  a deck with TIMER MINES AND MINING DROIDS.
<br/>
<br/>
- To Dominic Probst for my quote of the day (while playing
<br/>
  Thomas Koch´s Bunker-blowing RST with his Endor Ops):
<br/>
  " Get your hands of my bunker, thats Imperial Property!"
<br/>
<br/>
- To Harald Lange, Patrick Rueger, Jonas Skali, Torsten
<br/>
  Maas, Lars Grasendyk, and every other of the nice players
<br/>
  i met there.
<br/>
<br/>
- Finally, to Brian Hunter, for helping me with my decks,
<br/>
  and for being the best american friend a non-us SW-Player
<br/>
  can hope for.
<br/>
<br/>
Black Leader, Over &amp; Out !!!
