<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Whoa, folks, this tourney was some really good times. The Scrubs from Nantucket came to visit Pat Napier, Dante Montoya, and the rest of the Springs crew. It was myself, David Jones, Chris Compton, Jakob Brown, and Bobby Sorrentino all jammed into one hella fast Ford Bronco. The Decks stood as follows
<br/>
ME: Scum2k1 revised version 2.1
<br/>
        WYS with Badass RFC&amp;#8217;s
<br/>
<br/>
Jake: Huntdown Pods
<br/>
         WYS with Badass RFC&amp;#8217;s
<br/>
<br/>
Dave: Huntdown Pods
<br/>
           WYS with Badass Palace Raiders
<br/>
<br/>
Chris: Dark Deal that rarely hits the table
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
             Agents in the court with the rep from Naboo, Jar Jar (AAAAAAAAAH! RUN!)
<br/>
<br/>
We left Thornton at 9am, with an 11 o clock start in Springs. This is where it gets nasty. We fly down the Highway, and then, we are suddenly in Castle Rock within 30 minutes. Then, we arrive at the McDonald&amp;#8217;s near Hobbytown at around 10:20. I thought I was Gonna Die. This drive is supposed to be nearly 2 hrs. long, and we made it in less that 1 and Â½. 
<br/>
We waltz into hobbytown looking all baddass and pimpin, and then we fill out command cards. When Pat read off the pairings, I got the Dreaded FIRST ROUND BYE!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! Oh, well, at least I get a win. I&amp;#8217;ll give you  the lowdown on the game I watched while I sat there. 
<br/>
David Jones&amp;#8217; Huntdown Pods vs. Mark Chambers&amp;#8217; PodProfit.
<br/>
<br/>
At first, I thought David would throw down an easy win by 25 or so, but then the game got started. He tried to drop Mara with her Stick at the Audience Chamber to kill Qui-Gon and Padme. He got Rocked, and Hard. He Swung and missed Qui-gon, then drew a 0 for destiny. He lost Mara plus 6 more cards. Then, he won the podrace, and didn&amp;#8217;t have any force to pay to retrieve with, so that didn&amp;#8217;t help much. He finally cleared out the audience chamber by dropping the Tatooine Maul with his Uber stick and Phantom Menace. He wasted Qui-Gon, then drew 7 for destiny. Then more stuff happened that I can&amp;#8217;t remember, so he won the game. Props to Dave.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 2: My WYS vs. Chris Compton&amp;#8217;s Dark Deal
<br/>
<br/>
This Game started off pretty bad for Chris, because first turn, I drop Dash and ship to Kessel for a drain of three, and because of His icons at Cloud City, I am able to drop Melas at the Cantina, and an RFC with Dash to flip my Objective. Second turn for him and he still didn&amp;#8217;t have the executor out, and then it got bad, as on my second turn, I drained for 5. Then, I gave Melas some Help, and then I was almost untouchable when I dropped Lando in Falcon at Kessel with Dash. He then proceeded to try to clear out my Cantina with Mara, but she got barriered. The next turn, I drop an RFC, and then gave Mara a ride on the Attrition Bus, but she made Melas hit and F=0. 
<br/>
In the end, It was My win.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 3: My WYS vs. David Jones&amp;#8217; Huntdown Pods.
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the problem with Huntdown pods. Damn Destiny is too High. No matter how you cut it, HDADTJ played the way that David Jones Plays it is just too even of a Matchup for me to have the normal advantage of WYS. In the end, I think it came down to playing ability. No very notable Events in this game, aside from me losing about 20 to visage. Oh, wait, funny thing, those 3 Step Backward in my LS kept the Podrace from ever ending. Props to A Step Backward. 
<br/>
In the end, though, it was my loss.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 4: My Scum 2k1 revised&amp;#8230; vs. Ian something&amp;#8217;s TIGIH
<br/>
<br/>
The battle deck is definitely not my friend when I&amp;#8217;m trying to play Scum. Luke got some sort of bad attitude, and then, he cam to Tatooine. I couldn&amp;#8217;t repel the masses of mains, so I kinda lost my composure, and ended up drawing out. Not a whole lot I could do about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Round 5: My WYS vs. Mark Chambers&amp;#8217; Endor Ops
<br/>
<br/>
This game really took some doing to win. He gave me a hard time, as his deck included a lot of battling. My Off the Edges on Cloud city, however, kept this game in my hand, until he dropped the choke Vader at the back door, and another character right next to him, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t stop those drains. No characters coming to my hand. I was able to outlast him. Thank god I didn&amp;#8217;t lose, because that&amp;#8217;s like 10 points! And I&amp;#8217;m rated 1416!
<br/>
<br/>
Round 6: My Scum didn&amp;#8217;t show vs. Some Guy&amp;#8217;s WYS
<br/>
<br/>
This game started off pretty sweet for me, and Gailid made him mad. So, he decided to use frozen assets and Tunnel vision A lot. He then dropped Luke, Han and Chewie to the audience chamber, made two of my guys hit and f=0, then played don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y. That&amp;#8217;s 1 for ability. 1for Han&amp;#8217;s text. 1for 2 smugglers. 2 for don&amp;#8217;t get @#$%y. 5 destinies. That was the end of the game.

Post tourney:
<br/>
<br/>
	Here is where the cool stuff started to happen. We set out after some good prize support (Props to Pat Napier and Hobbytown) and trades with Brian Hunter, and we pile back into the Bronco. Final Records:
<br/>
	Dave 5-1
<br/>
	Me 3-3
<br/>
	Jake 3-3
<br/>
	Chris 3-3
<br/>
	Bobby 1-5
<br/>
We set out for home, and Chris starts whining about losing to me, and I tell him to stuff it, so we go to crappy Wendy&amp;#8217;s for dinner. He decides to challenge me while INSIDE WENDY&amp;#8217;S EATING DINNER. So I play him just to pacify him. Naturally, I get a crappy draw and lose. So we continue on, and head back to home. Somewhere around Denver City Limits, as Chris&amp;#8217; Bronco slips into what we call the &amp;#8216;Oh @#$% Gear&amp;#8217; A pair of red and blue lights pop up behind us, and he only gets a warning for going 75 in a 55 zone. Whoa. So then we got home. All in all it was a good fun time.
