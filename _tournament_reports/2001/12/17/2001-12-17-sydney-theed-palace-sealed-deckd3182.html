<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This tournament didn&amp;#8217;t look good from the start. Only 8 people turned up for what was the first naboo sealed deck held in our local area the small turn out was probably due to the chase the can Lord Of The Tournament the day before. This is how the day unfolded. We got our 5 packs of naboo and 1 pack of r3. I played light and out of the 6 packs the best character I got was chewie enraged who I couldn&amp;#8217;t even keep on the table due to the upkeep cost. Since the naboo set did not contain many sites so the td Rob Blanford decided that the start would be: naboo system, dark theed palace courtyard and light throne room. I only got 15 characters so I used all of them (they mainly consisted of security guards). The rest of my deck included high destinys, fambaas and gungan shields. I was also able to get three ships, which were bravo 5, bravo 3 and a y-wing. We were also allowed to use the battle plains and the naboo swamp.

Game1 vs. Brett Chaiywatt 
<br/>
This game was doomed from the start when Brett deployed one lone droid fighter on the naboo system and I had all pilots and no ships so I ate a drain of two the whole game as he just reinforced the system. Then sideous paid a visit to the throne room and I could not dislodge him. Finally after taking a drain of 4 for a couple of turns I got down a security guard and chewie vs sideous and even though Brett drew a six I still overpowered him by six so Brett just lost it off the top and left sideous on the table and I got the guard out of the throne room as fast as I could. The next turns consisted of a drain race-me at the courtyard for 2 and Brett at the throne room and at the system for 4. At the end of the game I spread out to drain for more but by then the game was lost.

Game2 vs. Rob Blanford
<br/>
This game was not really a serious game as Rob tried to build the objectives for fun and of course he could not pull them off and the 0 drain at the system allowed me more time to set up. Chewie and 2 guards beat up on a infantry droid and Battle droid officer. This caused rob to lose 9 cards in difference, which in a sealed deck is death so I had a big lead to deal with. As in most of these sealed deck games with the naboo cards when someone has lost a lot of cards and characters they don&amp;#8217;t have enough to beat back with so players go to ground and try to drain for as much as possible. This game did not faulter in that sense and I was happy to take the drains and a comfortable win.

 Game3 vs. Dave Georaghty
<br/>
Light was not going too well and only myself and fellow light payer Stephen McCallum had won a game. Dave and I basically tried to control the battle plains and so both of us just battled there while I plinked him at the throne room with two naboo guards. The battle at the plains consisted of AAT tanks piloted by druids vs. near all my guards and chewie once again. As usual I used Weesa Gotta Grand Army to pull out Boss Nass chamber to activate more force, which helps a lot with the upkeep cost of Chewbacca. Luckily Daves destiny&amp;#8217;s were really low so every time he got two due to the tank I only had to forfeit a trooper to satisfy attrition. Finally I broke through the force on the battlefield and was able to drain but then uncie maul with saber came down and of course Dave battled my lowly Chewie and gungan guard. He missed chewie once but not twice and drew a three a which killed my characters and so Dave had to lose three in battle difference. The rest of the game I ran away from maul with my Kashyyk operative and my two security guards. I just plinked away at him and eventually got another trooper down and battled maul and killed him off so I was able to drain dave out with a operative and a guard on the plains and gungan guard on the throne room. Daves last hoorah was two droids and he sent them up against my gungan and killed him off which caused me to lose a couple of extra cards out of my hand. Dave moved them over to the plains forgetting that I had the guard that lets you target a droid in your control phase and if you draw &gt;3 the droid is lost. With minimal cards in my life force I was able to track a five and kill his most powerful droid and my guard and operative beat down on the droid and Dave just drew his last two cards.

FW+7 (4+5)

Game4 vs. Jared Brown
<br/>
 Since this was the last game nobody could catch Jared so all I could do was try to finish 2nd. Some of the cards Jared got were phenomenal these cards included: Maul w/stick, OWO18 w/backup, Droid Blockade Flagship and a old skool control just to name a few. Jared dominated this game from the start and I never really had a chance. Maul killed my troopers and Chewie while the blockade flagship drained the @#$% out of me in space. I had no characters, no ships I just had good destiny&amp;#8217;s for my covert operative to sneak into the throne room undetected for a undisputed drain of 1. Unfortunately the operative was cut down and died a horrible death. On the whole this was my worst game of the day.

FL-17 (4-12)
<br/>
<br/>
This was a terrible day for me but surprisingly I ended up coming third and head of the light side. It was good to try out the new cards some of them will without a doubt be prominent cards in regular Swiss play. (Sideous is a @#$%!)
