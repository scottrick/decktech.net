<br/>
	Ventura almost always has good competition, a few Rogue Squadron members and some good locals. Im sure nobody cares about what I did before the tourney so Ill get right to it. I needed the Qui Gon with/saber so I traded a Luke Jedi Knight and a few R3 premiums for one.  Im playing high destiny saber combat on both sides. Then it was off to the games. Sorry if Im off on the specifics, I was a little sick.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
My Dark Side Saber Combat VS Dunya &amp;#8220;Hardpack&amp;#8221;s  Light Senate
<br/>
Dunya was playing with a handicap that day because he was missing part of his index finger. Some kind of box knife accident, (I didn&amp;#8217;t know he worked for American Airlines J/K) He starts the senate and jedi council chamber. Anyway, I do my stuff, I pull Rendilli first turn and a db for some activation. I play the Come Here You Big Coward Defensive shield so he couldnt drain me at the senate.  I had a major advantage at Naboo because every time he would drop a jedi, I would either play maul strikes, or play 2 sevens to saber combat and make him lose his jedi. There were also a limited number of battles throughout the game. His biggest problem was satisfying the shield come here you big coward. He attempted to play Jar Jar and Admiral Ackbar to the Executor Db. The next turn I dropped Maul and his saber, struck them both down, and played I have you now. He lost them and about five. Luckily I was playing with a few bounty hunter ships because he threw down Coruscant , the pulsar skate, corran horn and Lt. Blount.  I play zuckuss in MH and boba fett in Slave 1. He doesnt get destiny so I take him out by attrition. So I take control of rendilli and coruscant. Since I control a system and a site, both battle grounds, I play the shield where he has to spend 3 force to drain. It gets hard for him to drain and run away so I end up draining him out in the end. 
<br/>
FW 2(+19)
<br/>
The good: getting rid of his jedi and not letting him drain that often.
<br/>
The bad: Wtf, when he played jar jar and ackbar, jar jar chucked his spear at maul, I thought that the spear taps the character. Apparently it doesnt and I lost Maul for no reason.
<br/>
The ugly: Hey dude what was up with the finger?
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
My light side saber combat vs. Sean Campbells Dark saber combat
<br/>
Seans pretty funny, he hooked me up with the qui w/saber so that was cool. Anyway, I knew this was gonna be a hard match up because Sean was possibly the best player playing. His first turn he pulls the blockade flagship bridge and the imperial holotable. So off the bat he is getting more force than me. But thats not it, he decides to play sense and uncertain is the future, right after I pull crix madine using strike planning. Im like wtf. Oh well, I actually got a better hand anyway.  My turn I pull crix again, I pull the home one db, and I play crix to the db to pull beezer and a portable scanner. I dont want him to drain me for 3 at the Naboo core so I drop luke with the honkey bat and I battle maul and hit him. the site is clear on both sides. Next thing I know I got obi and han at the central core up against dr E and Vader with stick. Im thinking wtf, hes gonna play the circle is now complete and rape han upside down. But he disarms obi instead and I end up moving han all by himself. I decide to take initiative and deploy qui gon to the central core where he now has the Pimperor and Janus. Vader and dr E are to the left jerking off han and chewie. His next turn he deploys maul with the emperor and janus, so far I am winning most of the saber combats and hes lost most of his maul strikes. Next, I play the new lando to han and chewies site. I battle, he tries to hit chewie but he misses, no one gets operated on. I play life debt, Im looking at 5 battle destiny, he just plays a ghkk. Im all wtf. This is where I had the upper hand. I now had a drain of 2 and the choice of which of his dark jedi to combat. I on the other hand I had only one. So whichever jedi he put the combat card under, I dueled the other one, since I always had 2 sevens under qui gon we would either tie, or I would win and he would lose 4 since it was the new R3 qui gon. I pack one on the edge and I retrieved 6 force with it, not bad. Pretty soon he was down to only a few cards, he played uncertain is the future i guess to find a maul strikes, but there were none left. At the end he had 2 cards left, both sevens, so if he dueled with maul he would have beaten qui, since maul had his saber and Id lose 4 force. So I just moved qui gon over one site so he couldnt move maul and lightsaber combat. That was the end of the game. 
<br/>
FW 4 (+18)
<br/>
The good: playing against a solid player and a solid deck
<br/>
The bad: whats up with disarming my characters?
<br/>
The ugly: Dr. E, what an ugly mother fcker
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
My Light side saber combat vs Wilsons Wattos junkyard
<br/>
I wasnt there but I had heard Wilson beat everyone last tourny with this deck so I tried to play it safe. First turn he flips and makes me lose 2. I hate wattos junkyard because it messes with your head. Anyway, my turn I deploy obi to naboo. Its only the second turn and he deploys vader to naboo and plays the circle is now complete. Great, obi is out of play. Luckily I was able to get rid of vader later on and I took over naboo for a while. He flipped again and this time had 2 force, too bad its a win win situation for the darkside and he gets to deploy the executor for free to rendili. Lucky for me I play dash and the outrider to rendili my turn, battle, reduce the executors power and draw a five, he decides to lose from his hand. his next turn he has tatooine pretty well secured, the same for me on naboo, but he plays the blizzard 4 and gets out Vader, then he deploys the sith infiltrator, I guess he forgot that it was rendilli on the table and not tat. So he cant move maul up to the system. My turn I drain at naboo and deploys han and chewie in the falcon and battle. He ends up losing the executor and 1. A few turns later, I place the falcon out of play. From there on he has trouble draining where his jedi are because my objective is on the zero side. So he decides to bring a squad to naboo. Since he doesn&amp;#8217;t contol a battleground system I play the battle play shield so now he has to pay big for his drains, almost 12 force. Anyway I saber combat his jedi on naboo and he is constantly losing from it. It was close to the end and he could only pay for maybe 2 of his drains. I play padme to the central core where his maul was chillin, i pull qui gon w/saber and deploy luke. His turn he decides to battle. Since I get an extra battle destiny I just dray my 2 sevens thats the end of the game. It was close.
<br/>
FW 6(+9) 
<br/>
The good: Being able to stand up to wattos junkyard. Wilson played a solid game
<br/>
The bad: losing obi 2nd turn. He was playing anti combat interrupts.
<br/>
The ugly: hey dude what was up with your Halloween costume?
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 
<br/>
My dark side saber combat VS Wilsons light side saber combat Racing
<br/>
Let me tell you where this game took a turn for the worst. Apparently he thought people don&amp;#8217;t play podracers anymore, I still do however, and I win his own race by fourth or fifth turn. Another problem was that he really didn&amp;#8217;t have any way to pull high destiny cards, so every time I had 2 sevens and won the saber combat. A few times I played maul strikes and that cleared a few jedi, that wasnt too bad. Then he builds up a squad on tat and moves them over to naboo. The only problem was that he couldnt battle me with his militia because he had qui and ben with them. I just stacked my sevens under my jedi and that was pretty much it for him. He lost a lot of cards from the top of his reserve from that. After the podrace it was hard for him to come back.
<br/>
He did however take control of kessel and my rendilli, so he was draining me for 3 up there all day. Oh well I eventually won. Again, it was close. Hes a good player.
<br/>
FW 8(+10)
<br/>
<br/>
Total differential 8 (+50 something)
<br/>
The good: playing good competition.
<br/>
The bad: My bounty hunter ships couldn&amp;#8217;t hold their own.
<br/>
The ugly: Whats up with me winning the race?
<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a good tourny, I came in first undefeated. Theres another one up there on the 15th. Check it out. Anyway I gave my prize support away to the other players. And got some food.
