<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I know I’m gunna lose starts for the cheesey Eminem parody, but oh well.  Last night at 2 AM when I tried this before I lost the TR to the Deckteck system, so here it is again.
<br/>
<br/>
This was my first torunament.  I’ve been playing since Premiere, but I came from a small town so I’ve never been to a tournament.  Now I’m in college and can afford to go when I can find someone to drive for an hour.  The Tournament was in Berkley, CA on November 18th
<br/>
<br/>
Enough of that mushy crap, on to the tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
The tourney was held in the basement of this game store that had apparently been a bank at one time so it had a pretty cool basement.  It was hot as heck and the owner didn’t allow food or drinks down there.  Also, when we made a joke about destroying a Jar Jar poster they had hanging up she came down hard on the TD, sorry Mike.  No sense of humor what so ever.  Tournament starts close to what I would call on time.  I didn’t take any notes and this is from 2 weeks ago now so I’m not even going to try to remember names, I’m not good at it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
For my decks I was using both light and dark Lightsaber Combat. (It was the best objective I had at the time)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
Light VS Space Deck?
<br/>
My opponent had no objective and one fight early hit him pretty hard so I have no idea what his deck really was but it looked like a space deck.  I had an awesome hand, Obi Wan, Qui Gon Jinn, and Obi-s Stick.  His first turn he draws his whole pile, mine I put down Obi Wan, Jedi Knight at the core with his stick.  He tries to fight Obi, Vaderless, and draws under his immunity for Battle Destiny.  I lose a couple and he forfiets 2 guys to my destiny and stick.  Next turn, finger of death one of his guys, put down Quiggy, and layeth the smacketh down.  (If you can’t tell this is the battle he got screwd by) I think he had ozzel and some other 2 - 2 dark side pilot guy so he got a battle destiny but it doesn’t matter because he drew a site (like half his deck was sites that I could see going to the lost pile)  He clears his side of the board, but still has battle dammage, and loses a ton of sites and a few starships.  Its pretty easy from there.  He puts Vader down to Naboo once, with backup. I give Quiggy a combat card on his turn and my turn and beat Vader senseless and proceede to kill off his backup for more dammage.  At some point I thought it would be a good Idea to put Jar Jar alone, at a site, to drain.  When he deployed Blizard 1 T thought I was in trouble, but when Veers came out I looked at my hand and saw the Nobel Sacrifice and sac’d Jar Jar with Veers for a retrieval of 3.  No beat down.  TK-422 goes over there to block the drain, until he gets trampled.  Doesn’t mattter, I drain for 5 he drains for 1 pretty much the rest of the game. I win.
<br/>
FW thirtys?  The differentials are going to be off too.
<br/>
2(+30 something)
<br/>
Highs: First game of first torunament and I won.  Sacrificing Jar Jar, finally something hes good at ;)
<br/>
Lows: ..... I’ll get back to you.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
Dark VS QMC
<br/>
Had I known "Put guys on CC before he flips and makes it hard to do so" this game may have gone better.  He Goo Nee Tay’d me so to put anything on CC cost me a huge pile of force.  At one point I managed to clear a site with droids (Guri, P-59, 4-LOM, and IG) but he played Jedi Resiliance to get luke with stick back into hand.  My droids died shortly after and he started retrieving with CC Celebration.  He got all the way down to his starting interupt while playing Out Of Commision on most my lost pile.  I lost.  Big time. FL by a lot
<br/>
My diff is now in the negitives, never to return to positive numbers.
<br/>
2(-#)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The deck design on Naboo was working, Establish Control on the DB and drain for 3 on either side.
<br/>
Lows: He retrieved his entire lost pile every turn.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
Light VS ISB Scum deck.
<br/>
I made a few really dumb mistakes this game.  He Barriered Raging Chewie and I forgot to pay his upkeep.  I put R3 leia on naboo instead of the AC in a deck with absolutly no non aliens. (He argued that Mara would have counted anyway, but she doesn’t (she’s not a non-alien))  On the bright side I managed to get him to flip his other Maul w/ Stickby killing his first Maul w/ Stick in LS Comabt.  I chased his guys around Naboo, but lost to the drains at Jabba’s Palace.
<br/>
Full Loss by 24 (I remember this one because we both forgot to write it so I had to remember what it was for the scorecard)
<br/>
2(-big #)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Killing 2 Mauls with one stone
<br/>
Lows: Not paying for chewie, not putting Leia in the AC, not doing a lot of things I should of.  Playing this guy who tries to abuse every rule (he aslo said when Crumb makes a card lost my destiny = 0)
<br/>
<br/>
Between Game 3 and Game 4 I had to run up and eat my lunch that the store almost threw out for me (how nice of them).  I scarfed a HUGE piece of pizza from "Fat Slice" and couldn’t finish the other one between games so I gave it to someone who asked where I got the pizza.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
Dark VS Space Deck
<br/>
This is the same guy I played game 1 against, again with no objective.  When I saw kessel come down turn 2 I should have known better than to go to space.  I lost cards to battle dammage 2 turns in a row to keep the exec alive against overpowering forces.  I tried to get R3 Fett and Vader up there but it wasn’t happening.  When I finally lost the Exec he made a Legendary Falcon.  Drains and Dammage wore me out.  I think he had 2 cards in his lost pile. Quickest Game of SW I’ve ever played, 8 minutes.  We started another game to pass time.  FL by a lot again
<br/>
2(- close to 100 but not quite)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: ----
<br/>
Lows: Game was over in 8 minutes.  Not getting Fett and Vader aboard the Executor.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5
<br/>
Light VS Court of the vile Skrillings
<br/>
He showed me Pote (which I already knew) for his rep.  Here comes the wave of Skrills.  Jedi Knight Obi ran all over Taooine untill he moved into the desert to drain late game and to see if he would chase me.  He did.  Obi finally died.  Porjection went on the AC, and after he canceled that Leia went there to cancel Scum and drain for some.  I never remembered to retrieve to stop his drains though.  I grabbed his only Abyssian Ornament when he used it to get a skrill from reserve, so no retrieval for him.  He forgot to retrieve a skrill every turn too.  4-LOM came down to whoop the crap outta my lone Leia.  All of a sudden Jabba and his Twerps exist again and Leia gets stomped all over.  Yoda was chillin at the Naboo core for a constant drain of 2, he never came to Naboo.  Of course I forgot about a third of the time to drain (yes I’m a scrub)
<br/>
My Opponent said it was the closest game he’s had all day, so I felt better.  I lose after he drains me out.
<br/>
FL(-teens?)
<br/>
2(-close to 100)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Canceling Scum with Leia. Finding out Yoda make a good Combat Jedi.
<br/>
Lows: Leia getting beat up by Jabba and 4-LOM.
<br/>
<br/>
I am almost triple digit negative diff, and I don’t want that to happen.  I’m 1-4 and I don’t want 1-5 to happen either.  I have to win the next game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6
<br/>
Dark VS QMC
<br/>
Oh its on now.  Now I know better than to not put guys on CC untill after he flips.  Lord Maul goes to the core to start draining unless he wants to come and fight him.  All the rest of the charecters go to CC.  Vader among them.  I don’t think he deployed a ship to Bespin the whole game, or the executor would have come calling.  The drains are too much for him and I finally win another game.
<br/>
FW(probably twenties)
<br/>
2(-a lot, but less than 100)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: 2-4, not losing twice to the same objective.
<br/>
Lows: I wonder if 2-4 is bad enoguh to take last.
<br/>
<br/>
I end up in like 4th or 5th place, it was really fun overall.  I pulled a Blocade Flagship: Bridge and a Depa Billba from my prizes.
<br/>
<br/>
So I didn’t do TOO badly.  There is another tourney coming up on the 15th, hopefully that report will be better with things like names and such.
<br/>
<br/>
Props:
<br/>
My friend Eugene for driving all the way to Berkley (an hour drive that he made in 45 munutes)
<br/>
Mike Mendoza for running the first tournament I ever went too, and being cool.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
Me for being a scrub and making so many mistakes
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize to everyone for the report last night, I was just WAY to tired to retype that thing again at 2 AM. </font></td>
