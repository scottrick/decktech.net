<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">		Hey! Time for the chronicle of the events at New World Manga, Livingston, NJ on December 22, 2001. 
<br/>
<br/>
		****Pre-Tourney Jank ****
<br/>
<br/>
	Alright so my buds Tim and Jon come by to pick me up around 10:30 AM to head off to Manga for my first tournament since July. Im kind of concerned since I have NO idea whose going to go there and what there going to play. Anyway, I spent the last night throwing together a HD Pods deck with which I had played with in the past, and had little confidence in. I had built a LSC deck for he light, and although I had never seen it in tournament play I knew it would be weak against TIES and any deck with mad force drain bonuses, since theres no way for me to slow it down. But, I figured I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to play these dex anyway , so I was less concerned. 
<br/>
	So we got there around 11:15 AM and we signed in, got some trading done, and I took notice of who was there. I saw some guys from around the area, some younger guys, and Tom and Kelly. Damn. I knew that since me and Tom had been out of it for a while, Kelly was gonna wipe the floor with us. LOL. Anyway, Tom built his decks before our very eyes before the tournament, Dark Deal with destroyers (EV-9D9 is mad tech!), and We Have a Plan (Tom obviously didn&amp;#8217;t when he built it) so I hoped I didn&amp;#8217;t have to play Tom first round with my LS.
<br/>
Rating going in :1513 over 100 games played. Anyway, heres the report:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
****GAME 1**** Mike&amp;#8217;s LSC vs. Tom H-K&amp;#8217;s Dark Deal Destroyers
<br/>
<br/>
	AHHHHHHH!!!! I knew this would happen. Alright, the best I can do is slow the bleeding once its begun. I start Claw Fish, Insight, and Pathetic Lifeform. He starts Im&amp;#8217; Sorry , and I think Mob Points and something else. He gets out They Must Never Again Leave This City , gets Executor to Bespin for free. Doh. Anyway, Im setting up drains of two and two which he cant cancel at the Gen and Gen Core. He set up EV-9D9 , P60 and a destoyer to the incinerator and sets up Dark Deal. Hes draining me for 6 at the incinerator because its plus 2 from DD and EV9D9 adds one at the incinerator for every droid present. Mad Tech. Props Tom. I can&amp;#8217;t slow his drains except for revo-ing the incinerator for a &amp;#8211;1 drain but that&amp;#8217;s it. The drains I stage aren&amp;#8217;t enough, even though I stacked a 6 on fish, battled with EPP Luke and drew the 6 to wipe out both destroyers, I screwed.

****GAME 2**** Mike&amp;#8217;s HD Pod&amp;#8217;s vs. Michael Chan&amp;#8217;s Tatooine Pod Mains 
<br/>
<br/>
	Ok so he starts the podrace and doesn&amp;#8217;t expect me to be podracing, so it slows him down. I put down Mara with Sabre and Fett BH to the Outskirts for a drain of three. He gets down Qui Gon and sabre put not enough to battle. I get down TC-14 and place him out so Qui is power = 0 and has no immunity. He moves, I get down Lord Vader and sabre. Im draining, hes running, had a few skirmishes, but visages and the podrace finished him off. Not much to say about this game.

****GAME 3**** Mike&amp;#8217;s LSC vs, Timbo&amp;#8217;s TIE F-OPS
<br/>
<br/>
	Damnit! Damnit Damnit Damnit. I knew this would happen, I get to play the only decks my deck is weak against. I knew I lost this one before it started, with Lando in Falcon as my only air (no one would trade me a H C and F  L) I knew that even the drains of 2 and 2 wouldn&amp;#8217;t slow him. I used all 3 of my shields, the grabber or Imp Command, Aim High for SFS and Battle Plan for the double-edged screw over. He was draining at +1 at Naboo , Endor and Fondor before I knew it. He was retrieving by deploying squadrons to the Big One, than next turn theyd get blown up and go to used, get redeployed for four retrieval. The drains killed me I knew Id lose this game , but just my luck, I play the decks Im weak against. But what are you gonna do?

		At this point im feeling a little low, going 1-2 in my first two games, I get lunch at a pretty r33t Chinese place down the road, so I eat my regular shrimp and broccoli. I feel energized for the next three games. At this point Dalton shows up to mock us and tell us how much of a disgrace we are yada yada. Hes a cool guy. So he hangs around and watches me and Tom the rest of the day, and buysa pack of LotR and shows us its coolness. Not Bad. Anyway, hes watching Tom and jokes about how he could absolutely smack him with all the stuff hes forgetting, but slowly remebering. TOm and me have been out for 6 months. LOL we goof about Dalton coming out of retirement for one day to beat Tom just one more time. LOL (sry Tom) anyway:

****GAME 4**** Mike&amp;#8217;s HD Pods vs. Tim &amp;#8220;Terkovich&amp;#8221; &amp;#8217;s QMC Mains 
<br/>
<br/>
	Shazbot. I didn&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d have to play Terkovich today, but I guess I did in spirit through his deck. Having played Terko In the past, I had a good idea what was in this deck. Mains, Off the Edges and the like. So, I D Shield Code Clearance, for OTE , and win the podrace in three turns. Good and bad I guess, early force loss, but too early for retrieval. I get Lord Maul and EPP Vader to the Downtown Plaza to flip and Mara and Sabre and P59 to the Leia&amp;#8217;s Hut. I Drain for a few turns, and put a Presence of the force on down town plaza, just to be vergenced. So I keep moving and draining, he sets up celebration but i cancel it with Masterful combo. So he comes down Luke Han and Obi EPP, Clashes Mara, and screws over P59. Damn. It comes down to a drain race, and I put Thrawn at he Podrace Arena for a secure drain. We get down to 7 force each when time expires, I notice if I don&amp;#8217;t battle, hell win anyway. My only hope is battle damage. We both have one card in our hand, and I battle with Mara and sabre and vader EPP against Han and Luke EPPs. I play I Have You Now for the two extra destiny, he plays The force is strong with this one two add two. Damn. He gets 4 , I get 3, we both clean each others site, he drains me on the last turn for one. Modified win by 7, 7 to 5.

****GAME 5**** Mike&amp;#8217;s HD Pods vs. Torres&amp;#8217;s MWYHL 
<br/>
<br/>
	So I win the podrace in minimal turns, get my 11 retrieved and his lost 11. I drained for 1s since Test 1 is out. He gets Kal Fal and Qui with sabre down to the Tat Dbay. I get down TC-14 and OOP to force him to move. So I drain and move around the various sites we have out, with Lord Vader and Sabre, Mara with sabre and Maul with 2x Sabre (damn you Jedi Test 1!!!) We have a few battles, and I continue to move , drain and block with U3P0. Eventually pull it out in the end.

****GAME 6**** Mikes&amp;#8217;s LSC vs. Michael Chan&amp;#8217;s Galactic Senate DS Mains 
<br/>
<br/>
	I get my drains et up quick, he eats them since he cant cancel them with the political effect cuz of the obj. he gets down YA Maul, barrier, next turn combat him of the site. He gets down Ponda Baba combo and Bossk with gun with the two unique destroyers. I It&amp;#8217;s a Trap twice to stall for time, move Obi EPP over to help EPP Luke. He battles , captures Qui. I lose Luke and a lot. But Qui goes back over. I come back with Padme and Luke EPP, and deploy EPP Obi from reserve. I battle hit everyone except Bossk, I lose Obi, pull him next turn with Padme, he loses everyone. Game went in my favor from then on.

	So Im waiting for the two deciding games to finish. If Tim beatsTom and Kim beats Pat, I finish in 4th, If both lose, Im in second . I fone loses and one wins, Im in third. Kim wins, Tom squeaks one out, and I think thisa is how it finished.
<br/>
<br/>
1st- Tom Hermley- Keen
<br/>
2nd- Kelly Krieble
<br/>
3rd- Michael Robinson (me)
<br/>
4th- Pat Giordano (sp?)
<br/>
5th- Timothy Yung
<br/>
6th- Edward Yoon
<br/>
7th- Michael Chan
<br/>
8th- Jon Torres
<br/>
<br/>
	I think that&amp;#8217;s how it went, so I got third, got a pack of theed in which I got one those crappy AO&amp;#8217;s traded it for Kelly&amp;#8217;s Senate Hovercam because they are cool.I got this cool litle Maul thing too. Whatever. I accomplished part of my goal of maintaining a equal if not better rating in my first tourney back, leaving with a 1514 rating, one better.
