<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Being fairly confident in myself (not a wise thing), I went up against my competitor from last tournament - Earl.  His Dagocheese destroyed me in the last tournament, but this one I thought I was ready for it.  Unfortunately, I forgot to add in ships with hyperdrive (shut up) and I could not get to Dagobah.  I could not get Occupation or the Fighters Coming In drains going quickly.  His clouds were even being set up slowly, but I struggled to get my damage going.  Unfortunately, I eventually lost this match by 3 cards.  :’-(
<br/>
<br/>
With my ego being shoved back in my face, I was ready to play again without my own @#$%iness getting in my way.  My next match was against Paul, who unfortunately thought the tournament was an Episode I tournament, and brought 2 Senate decks.  I was to fight off against his dark side senate deck.  Surprisingly, this deck was very strong and put up a good fight, but unfortunately he did not have any space support so I could spread out and increase the damage to surprising amounts, so not even his blocking of drains would stop it.  I won this match by a fair margain.
<br/>
<br/>
My next match was, strangely, against Paul once again.  We switched decks and I played against his light side senate deck.  This match was more difficult for me, because he had some of those Naboo fighters in the deck.  Fortunately, I had 3 copies of SFS Laser Cannons so I blew the hell out of him and tore him apart in a single turn.  This deck made me lose around 10 force, so I felt pretty confident in myself (another mistake).
<br/>
<br/>
Now for the playoffs to get rid of the weaker top contenders.  Me and Jason were paired off again, and once again, I played my Hidden Base deck.  The same result this time, but it was a little more difficult due to his ability to set up the deal much faster.  Fortunately, Hidden Base objective drain-blocking saved the day and I came up victorious yet again.
<br/>
<br/>
Now it was time for the championship match.  Like it usually goes, I was paired up against Ian for the final victory.  This match was my Hidden Base again against his Walkers.  We both started our shakily, but we both went into a groove and stayed there for awhile.  He never got off a Walker Garrison drain, but his direct damage started piling up.  Unfortunately for me, he got Prepare For A Surface Attack right before the tournament, so he put that in his deck.  This is what killed me.  I could not stop his drains.  Eventually, his direct damage and small drains started to eat through into my reserve deck and he took away the victory by a few force.  The game lasted at least an hour and half, and was an excellent game.  Possibly the best one we ever had.  Congrats, Ian.
<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, the championship match was for 1st or 4th place.  I know how that’s how it was supposed to be, but it seemed odd.  Oh well, it was all fair and good.  We split the jackpot anyways, cause I wasn’t gonna let him go away with a few special edition packs (if I won) for going undefeated :-P.  The final results were:
<br/>
<br/>
1st - Ian
<br/>
2nd - Earl
<br/>
3rd - David
<br/>
4th - Dennis (me)
<br/>
5th - Jason
<br/>
6th - Paul
<br/>
7th and down to 13th - everyone else - thank you for coming!
<br/>
<br/>
Mad props to:
<br/>
<br/>
Gary for being gracious enough for letting me and Ian play past your closing time.
<br/>
Jason for being kick @$$ and bringing awesome prizes and being neato for letting me borrow some cards (I still have them).
<br/>
Ian for taking away the victory and splitting prizes with me cause I’m all poor and sad (and letting me stay at his house).
<br/>
Ryan for not being able to make it because of poor road conditions.  We missed you! (and because you make it sanctioned) :-P
<br/>
Earl for eating me alive because of his Dagocheese again.
<br/>
Paul for being a good sport with the Episode 1 decks and not doing bad at all with them (keep them for limited deck format).
<br/>
Everyone else for coming - it was a blast!
<br/>
