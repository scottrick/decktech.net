<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">This here is my first tournament report posted on decktech, so please try to be tolerant to me, and also for my english which is far from good, still I hope you will enjoy reading this, or at least you won’t be bored.
<br/>
<br/>
So it all started on 26th of october, when a small convencion begun. I wasn’t interested in first two days of the convention, but sunday was another thing, that’s becouse of SW tournament which was going to be held.
<br/>
<br/>
I woke up arond 9 (tournament should start at 11), when I looked out the window all of my enthusiasm was gone. There was terrible fog ant termometer shown 0 degrees celcius :-/
<br/>
But what could I do, I just had to go to this tournament, so after about 1,5 hour (I just love our public transportation) I arrived at the convention. Most of my friends was already there. At the end there was 18 people in the tournament (all of the Krakow top players as well as three guys from Rzeszow).
<br/>
<br/>
I was playing quite standard podracing WYS (just a little upgraded to battled senators) and ralttir ops.
<br/>
<br/>
The firs game was against Marcin Solonczak (currently top player in Sullust region)(note: we was in Paris at Europeans together), I was playind dark side.
<br/>
I knew he will play WYS (very similar to my own), he’s my usual playtester and I knew his deck very well (playing agains it almost every day). But he wasn’t quite ready for my ral ops becouse I played senators just a day befor (as the last tests for our decks).
<br/>
The first tun was a classic, I pull out rendili, death star2: docking bay, and generic sire, he starts the race, ozzel to death star and draw. He deployed some smugler in mathing ship and moved to fraltiir to avoid second turn flip. Eventualy the race ended, I flipped my objective, you might say it was the time when the game actualy started, my main goal was to stadn up to him in space since he wasn’t even trying to battle me at raltiir. wih the help of high destiny draws i was able to hold a space locaton (battle plan was very iritating). I deployed Establish control which helped me outdrain him, late game retrive from First Strike and Empire New Order also helped a lot. At the end I was (+16) (or something aroud that;))
<br/>
The light side: I’ve won agains my nemesis :)
<br/>
The dark side: When I’m winning against Marcin there are no dark side ;)
<br/>
<br/>
Second game was against Grzegorz Mirek, he’s also from Krakow, maybe he doesn’t have high rating, but he’s a fair player. I was playing my WYS vs his SYCFA (interceptors). I don’t like playing against Interceptors, but this time it went quite smooth, maybe becouse Lady Luck as on my side. I the race was finished in the third turn and Grzegorz had a location screw (deployed just walkemui and endor). Then I Did It started to working at he was activating 8 for the rest of the game. T draind at Cantina and docking bay (Chewie wookie strangeled undercover spies), I was also able to deploy Legendary Starfighter and it was in fact the end of this game. I’ve ended at (+28)
<br/>
The light side: Easy victory against Ties, matchup I was very arfaid of. 
<br/>
The dark side: No dark side at all.
<br/>
<br/>
Third game, against Marcin Korczynski, he’s also fair playedt but not one of top rating (note: we was in Paris at Europeans together). Marcin was also playing Ties (just my luck). after the first turn i was quite worried becouse marcin deployed 4 locations and even I Did It would not help me much. But I had to do something, so i deployd to cantina and docking bay (strangling spies like last time).
<br/>
The race ended on fourth turm, at this time Marcin already had a singel Interceptor at every location, on a subsequent turn I was drained for 7 and Marcic lost two force to leave his force in place, i thouhgt he was holding some imperial barriers in hand, but i had to deploy in space. To one location I deployed Luke Skywalker in Artoo in Red 5 and to another Han, Falcon and raltiir freighter captain, i also deployed I’ll take the leader. There was no barrfiers, I was good thing. luke battled first, there was no reaction, I played darklighter spin to make my destiny 8. He had to play Ghhhk. Then falcon iniciated the battle, after this I learned why Marcin was seving his force, he had Emperor’s shield and emperor’s sword in hand (both deploying as a react), but there was just one problem, I had two Rebel barriers in han, and none of the squadrons could participated in battled, and Marcin didn’t have another ghhhk, he had to lose 12 force exept interceptor, I deployd Legendary starfighter and become quite convinient. After the next winning battle and Marcin without ghhk it was the end. I’ve won by +25
<br/>
The light side: Beating ties despite their quite good starting hand.
<br/>
The dark side: Once again there is no dark side.
<br/>
<br/>
4th game, against Mateusz Halczak, he’s one of newer SW palyers, but already have quite good results. He was playing old-style, power tatooine Profit. I started as always (rendili, docking bay, etc.). Since I didn’t have any aliens in my deck Mateusz didn’t have any problems relesing Han of his first turn, he deployed Master Luke to Audience Chamber and ben Kenobi to Jabba’s Palace, then he moved Han to Ben.
<br/>
Next turn, I fliped Objective and drew some cards. Mateusz just drew. Nex turn, I deployed EPP Vader and Tarkin to Luke I also deployed First Strike and battled, he played Narrow Escape. Mateusze deployed Qui-Gon, and and some Lightsabers and moved Luke and Ben to Audience Chamber. He just forgot about one thing, To move Han and Threepio (which he deployed in his first turn) with Narrow Escape, he would need 3 force (including first strike) and he left only two force. So on my next turn I deployed Janus Grejatus to Han and battled, Han was lost, adding to that one more Han lost from reserve deck, Mateusz was out of Hans (I learned that later). So I didn’t lost any more force, I was able to hold up Downtown Plaza which Mateusz deployed later. I’ve won by (+34)
<br/>
<br/>
5th game as against Pawel Szymanski, Pawel is from Rzeszow, he is currently one of the top Sullust Players, I was afraid of this game becouse I lost last three tournament games against Pawel. Knowing that he is playing my the most hated match-up (BHBM) didn’t helped me. But as tje time showed fear was greater than the foe, at least this time. On my first turn I deployed Melas in Artoo in Red 5 to Kessel, Pawel just drew. Next turn I deployed Han in Falcon to Tatooine to flip my objective. Pawel deployed Emperor to Throne Room. Some time later he deployed vader to cantina and Zuckuss with 4-LOM to Kessel, I was lucky enough to have rebel Barrier on my hand and Zuckuss wasn’t able to battle. As a response I deployed LSJK  to Vader and X-wing laser cannon on Red 5 which efected in flipin BHBM and getting rid of Zuckuss. It was the last time Pawel deployed in space, it was more then enough for me to win, and some retrivese gave me a victory by (+32)
<br/>
<br/>
The last game was once again against Pawel, now he was playing racing WYS, and now it wasn’t so good. First of all my starting hand was very far from perfect so pawel could pull up quite a few drains before I fliped, then he won the race, retrived, I lost. It was looking like I’m. Going to lose, but then I deployed Much Anger in Him and Responsibility of command combo on Han, and he was lossing 4 force per turn till the end of the game. Imperial Decree become also very heplful preventing drfaind on Malastate nd reducing on kessel. Although I must say it wasn’t easy making Imperial Decree working. I the end I’ve won by (+4)
<br/>
<br/>
So I finished tournamen first with 12 (+139), so it was quite a good tournament ("Another fine day for science" as some would say).
<br/>
<br/>
