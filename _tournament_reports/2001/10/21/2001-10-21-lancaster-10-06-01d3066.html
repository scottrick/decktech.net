<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, let me first say that I’m sorry this report is old, but I just got re-signed onto DeckTech so I am going to post it now.
<br/>
<br/>
Me, Drew, and Rory made the trip from Hummelstown down to Lancaster for the Two StarWars tournaments, and a WWF Tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
First up was the WWF Tournament in which I took Second Place {Decent, thought I was gonna win}. I took my Road Dogg, and lost to Jame Leiser’s Christian deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Then Rory went home with Shamus, and it was time for us to begin the StarWars tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
To begin, I will admit that A) I am a scrub in StarWars, and B) I am not a scrub in WWF.
<br/>
<br/>
For LS I was using a WYS-Racing-Catipult style deck, though I rarely ever get to use the Catipult tech. The only time I really get to play anymore is at tournaments, so I play around 4-8 times a month. 
<br/>
<br/>
For DS I am using my Bring Him manipulation style with Crush to get my Monnoks, and My’ioom. {Though I’ve noticed that she’s not NEARLY as effective with all of the Republican characters and Jedi out now.}
<br/>
<br/>
Tournament Director: Micheal Car
<br/>
<br/>
First Game: Ms {DS} vs. James Leiser LS
<br/>
Well, this was bad for me to begin with. James had a LS Senate deck, meaning, VERY FEW non-republic or Jedi characters, so My’ioom is basically worthless. Defensive Fire came in handy every now and then {when I got his key cards}. But, he has a better version of Fire, its called the Senate objective. I made a few errors, like attempting to take out Dash in Outrider with Zuckuss, and forgetting to add a second destiny with Emperor’s Power.

<br/>
Second Game: Ms {LS} vs. Micheal Car {DS}
<br/>
Yet, another bad match up {yea... I’ve noticed theres alot of bad match-ups for me}. He’s playing the Watto objective and I’m playing WYS. It seems like I should take him, except he draws a Gragra, Tatooine Maul, and a Watto in his opening hand. He drops the Gragra and Watto {to their respective locations} to flip. Then he leaves 3 force. I attempt to bring it to the Gragra with My RFC’s {Raltiir Freighter Captains}, and Karrde. He doesn’t barrier the first RFC. So, I’m thinking all good and mighty... drop Karrde. BARRIER. Second RFC... BARRIER. Sh!t. And I run out of force. His turn. He destroys them by dropping several roody poo characters. Now at this point, for Podracing, we’re tied so we hafta go into the "extra laps". Where, he ends up with a 28, and I end up with a 27. I lose my 6, and he gets his 6 back. Not good times for the LS... As my Jedi Knight Luke and Melas are lost. Both are my only 4 Ability or higher characters in the deck. He drops Tatty Maul so there is no way for me to flip. Nothing I can do for remainder of game.

Intermission. I go get a Pizza, which by the way tasted horrible and then we resume play.
<br/>
<br/>
Third Game: Me {LS} vs. Nathan {DS}
<br/>
<br/>
Nathan is playing the new Walker decks with the new effect. His first turn, he drops a 2/1 Hoth site, and drops a Presence on the 2/0 Hoth site. And then he goes to get a Docking Bay with IAO, hoping to find the Hoth one, but he only finds the Endor one. So, on my turn, this gives me exactly enough force to deploy LS, JK and then his saber. For remainder of this game it is my roody poo smugglers destroying Walkers left and right. 
<br/>
<br/>
(2) FW +34 (-13)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fourth Game: Ms {DS} vs. a Newier Older Man {LS}
<br/>
<br/>
This was only the mans second tournament, as he first learned how to play at the last tournament. He also thought you could only have one of every card in your deck, so he didn’t have many good cards in his deck. I get My’ioom set up first turn, and on the second turn he lost 6 characters from his hand. 
<br/>
(4) FW +43 (+30)
<br/>
<br/>
I normally go 2-2, losing to the good players and beating the Lower players, so I stay around my usual mark of 1550/1570. Ahh... the good days of being a scrub.
<br/>
<br/>
Props: 
<br/>
Mike for running the tournaments.
<br/>
James for being cool.
<br/>
Drew for being cool.
<br/>
Shamus for fun entertainment value since he was late to the WWF tournament and he got lost for 3 hours and almost ended up in Maryland.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
That sh!tty pizza.
