<br/>
    All was well that one, cold day. As we drove to Atlanta from Savannah, so we could participate in the Pre-Release Reflections 3 Booster Draft. Which is about a good 4-5 hour drive! It seemed as if it was going to be a good day, and I was very hyped up at the release of the new Set, which was expected to be the most powerful and "easy-reach" set ever. We finally reached the place, "Galactic Quest", and we traded and played with some of the other peeps awaiting the Booster Draft Tournament. I played a guy with my Watto Deck, and won. And still we waited. It was a while before we got started, and when they finally did, we started Drafting. We each got 4 packs, and we could ONLY pull one card and pass it. Which had to be our side of the force. I was elected to be a light side player, and the pack opening began. Well, the two people next to me each got a powerful (And RARE!) card. One got Darth Maul, Young Apprentice/holo-AI, and the other got Qui-Gon Jin, Jedi Master/holo-AI. After that, they each got other powerful cards, like 2 Yodas, Stormtrooper Garrison, and Blizzard 4. After such a shock of rarity’s I got excited of what my packs could contain! (Hence, I said COULD contain.) Well, the first had Jar Jar’s Electropole (Which, without Jar Jar really isn’t all that special is it people?) And the second was Theed Palace:Generator Core. The other other 2 packs contained cards to sad to name. As far as the pack’s holographs went, I hit well! I got the Radiant 4 and the Outrider! Only problem was, after we finished drafting and the tourney began. I had only 6 charcters in my deck! 2 being USELESS power 1 droids. And the rest being neither warrior nor pilot. I got NOTHING above ability 2 or power 2!!! NOTHING!!! But, one guy drafted the new objective, all the cards to use it, and even Lord Maul. As if he came in with a constructed deck! How insane! Well, even so, I didn’t give up! I fought brave! I delivered blow after blow to my opponemt’s decks! (Which was like hitting concrete as hard as you can with your bare fist.) And I left with -71 points, and 0 Victory Points. I came in last place. Which I knew was going to happen when I saw what cards I had pulled. But, in the midst of it all, it goes to show that even the best players can get abused when they draft crap, crap, and well, crap! Well, I hope you liked my report, and didn’t cry to much for me! And, also, don’t let it scare you into not going to Booster Drafts. You might be the one to draft that lucky deck! </font></td>
