     Hey! Today I got to meet a famous person! Matt Lush!!! He writes those editorial thingies! I even got to play him. And I got my @#$% kicked. So I got to have my @#$% kicked by a famous person! :^) Cool!
<br/>
Another thing, I just spent 3 hours typing this exact TR and my comp fukced up and I lost it all so I am really pissed so if I’m not my normal cheery self I don’t care. So since its really late, I’m tired, pissed off I’m not gonna do the details of the games because like i said, i already typed out a quality tr, it just got screwed, so if u wanna be a prick gimme one star, if not just enjoy a semi cool tr.
<br/>
Oh, and if the caps and grammar suck well, you try typing perfect after you just spent 3 hours for nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Game one, me vs alan sagans podprofit. 
<br/>
my podrace sucked bad, i drew 4 1’s and a 0. and i have like 30 cards that are highr then 4 in my deck. so i lost race and got a FL by something.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:, me vs Green hat guy, sorry cant remember name.
<br/>
He played some ties w/ pilots thing, i beat on a lone tie interceptor for like 20, i won by 30 something.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, me ls vs Matt Lushs DS Senate machine.
<br/>
We set up semi slow, the game almost timed out due to heavy retrievel on my part and heavy damage on his. i retrieved over 40 force that game. cool huh? he won by 8. I killed maul 5 times or something with invinco Luke with resilience.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, me DS vs Green Hat again. I win game fast from Visage damage and race. In the whole game i lost 2 cards.
<br/>
I win bye 41.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, me vs Alan again. He playing ISB Scum. I playing my ls techy goo. He gets  cool setup with tat from nemo advisor and twileks for nightfall and deploys a pile of spies for free! tech!  gets drained by me at kessel for about 15 total. i lose by 21 tho.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, vs some guy i know but i dont know his name. all that happened really was i crassed luke and beatdown obi and that pretty much won the game along with my podrace.
<br/>
