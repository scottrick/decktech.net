<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Flat out, this is going to be the @#$%tiest TR I will ever do (even if it is a double).  I can’t even remember the witty, attention catching phrase that came up on the ride home for a title.  I’m tired and have a headache but I need to document my games so I’m posting brief details of them, and even briefer (is that a word?) details about the time surrounding them.  To attempt to make up for that I will post the decks I used (as best I can remember).  I am also going to copy and pasting this to Note Pad, then copy and pasting it to Decktech (instead of editing out all the punctuation then manually adding it all back in) so sorry if the tabs show up.
<br/>
<br/>
9/6:  Thursday.  School.  Drive up to Phoenix with Enrique Huerta.  Spend the night at Girard’s place in the middle of nowhere.  He has funny dogs.
<br/>
<br/>
9/7:  Friday.  DPC day and only 25 show up for it.  Gay.   Rating is 2261.  Decks are WYS SOLID and HDADTJ SOLID.

Unknown Type:
<br/>
Hunt Down And Destroy The Jedi/Their Fire Has Gone Out Of The Universe
<br/>
<br/>
Game One
<br/>
WYS Vs Chris Schaut’s (1865) Senate
<br/>
WYS doesn’t lose to senate, as far as I’m aware.
<br/>
FW +29
<br/>
2(+29)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Seeing Chris again.  He’s from New York.
<br/>
Lows:  Me no know.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two
<br/>
HDADTJ Vs John Hawkins’ (2070) WYS
<br/>
I got excellent draw.  I got lots of force, and applied much pressure forcing him to delay flipping.  Vader + Cantina + Stick = drain.  2x ZIMH + 2x Lat Damage = beats.
<br/>
FW +17
<br/>
4(+46)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing John.  He is an excellent player.
<br/>
Lows:  None.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three
<br/>
WYS Vs Tim Guzman’s (1935) HDADTJ
<br/>
The game was actually pretty even because he got a pretty good start, in comparison to mine.  Eventually Vader went Lost in the Wilderness, and that basically sealed it.  Edges help differential.
<br/>
FW +23
<br/>
6(+69!)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Tim is the man.  He smells like a doctor.
<br/>
Lows:  This @#$%ing headache.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four
<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Chris Denoma’s (2030) WYS
<br/>
Much like John’s except no racing.  Fitting that I beat him by 6 more cards.  Vader just likes to drain.
<br/>
FW +23
<br/>
8(+22)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Chris is a really cool guy.  Check out his and John’s site www.CCGHookup.com
<br/>
Lows:  Philosophy papers I should be writing.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Five
<br/>
WYS Vs Clint Hays’ (2226) Senate
<br/>
He never got the combo, and Vader found his @#$% beaten by swarming smugglers.  Lost in the Wilderness mighta been played, and Dodge was a pain in his ass.
<br/>
FW +22
<br/>
10(+114)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Playing (and beating) Clint for the first time.
<br/>
Lows:  None, it was a good game all around.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Six
<br/>
HDADTJ Vs Clint Hays’ (Julien Riviere’s) (2226) MYWHL
<br/>
You’ve seen the deck lists.  This deck was designed to rape mains and toys and that’s exactly what it did to me.  That, coupled with the fact that I didn’t flip for 6 turns because I couldn’t draw a Vader, or I couldn’t get a battleground for him to go to means an easy win for him.  I drew up when Clint had 10 cards on his racer, 12 in his hand, and 6+ cards in his lost pile.
<br/>
FL -23
<br/>
10(+91)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  It only took about 7 minutes to play.
<br/>
Lows:  AFA should only work if they occupy a battleground.
<br/>
<br/>
I finish in first.  Josh Bader from Colorado got second.  Then Chu was one differential ahead of Clint for third.  Chu beats Josh by one card, cause he’s that damned good, and I play Clint.
<br/>
<br/>
Semi Finals
<br/>
WYS Vs Clint’s Senate
<br/>
Same as before.  Vader got his @#$% smacked, and I just controlled the board (Menace Fades, Battle Plan, Goo Nee Tay, etc).  I didn’t care about differential, so I just played to win. 
<br/>
FW +17
<br/>
<br/>
The prize money was weak and Chu and I discovered that even if he won first he and Clint weren’t going to break even (plane tickets, hotel etc).  We both knew that our light decks would win, but his light would have won by more (probably) so rather than forcing him to risk losing any more money I agreed to give him the first place cash.
<br/>
<br/>
That night we all just kinda hung out.  I got Juz into L5R.  Helped Jay Webb Build decks for the open.
<br/>
<br/>
9/8:  Saturday.  I had to get my lazy @#$% out of bed at 8:00 to run the open.  After 6 it was John Hawkins in first and Chu in second.  Chu won both games of the final.  I played in a Raw Deal tourney and sucked cause the deck I borrowed was ass.  Went to Hooters with Juz, Clint, and Jay Webb.

<br/>
<br/>
Went to bed at 4am.
<br/>
<br/>
9/9:  Sunday.  Up at 12 to run tourney at 1.  No one comes.  Screw around for a bit.  Go to lunch with Juz and Enrique.  Play L5R.  Go home.
<br/>
<br/>
Epilogue (sort of)
<br/>
<br/>
9/11:  Terrorist attacks.
<br/>
<br/>
10/3:  DecipherCon is cancelled.
<br/>
<br/>
10/5:  I quit SW.
<br/>
<br/>
10/7:  I return.
<br/>
<br/>
10/10:  Wednesday.  A monthly tournament at the Gamer’s Edge in Phoenix.  Haven’t played since DPC Phoenix.  Been busy juggling Katie and Allie, so I build my dark in the car on the drive up with Enrique, Justin Beal, Bobby Dayton, and Pat Gimber.  I get to ride in the trunk of the Blazer.  Suck.  Bobby has to piss like a racehorse since he drank like 1.5 liters of Dr. Pepper before we left.  Much laughter ensues as we declare that pit stops are determined not by the one with weakest bladder, but by the one with the strongest, as dictated by the code of man.  Rating is 2278.  Decks are WYS SOLID and Martin Falke’s second version of his Senate, both with slight modifications.
<br/>
<br/>
Game One
<br/>
Falke Senate Vs Jon Dunn’s (1785) HB Operatives
<br/>
Lots of senators, lots of squabbles and yet I don’t flip for 230597823048 turns.  Literally.  Third turn I get Maul in his ship to Kirdo III, which is good.  I beat up EPP Luke with Palp (who he failed to kill), Dr. E &amp; Ponda, IG with Gun and an I Have You Now for eight, I think.  Then Thrawn + Chimaera + Lat damage on lone Wedge in ship seals it.
<br/>
FW + 19
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  I like John.  He silly.  Deck fun.
<br/>
Lows:  Kinda non-interactive.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two
<br/>
WYS Vs Robert Dayton’s (1644) Maul Hut/ JP Start
<br/>
Bobby is seriously one of the best players I have encountered out here.  If he was more competitive I’m sure he could easily be rated at least 2000.  We’ve played this match up a couple times in testing, so we knew each other’s decks to a t (what does is that supposed to mean, anyway?) and we both knew I was going to win.  To be a great sport, he drew up to give me the full win.  Mad Props for that, bud.
<br/>
FW + 22
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Its cool playing Bobby.
<br/>
Lows:  Playing one another hurt our "team" from Tucson.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three
<br/>
Falke Senate Vs Robert Dayton’s (1644) TIGIH
<br/>
Again, I know his deck inside and out and I know how to beat it, but I play like a complete @#$% wipe.  DTF/ First Strike did more damage to me than anything all game.  Eventually Vader took Luke and hid on the Executor DB, and ZiMH drained at Kashyyyk for the win.
<br/>
FW+ 7
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Bleh.
<br/>
Lows:  I suck at this game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four
<br/>
WYS Vs Justin Beal’s (1751) Droid AOBS
<br/>
I can satisfy Battle Plan and he can’t.  I am activating more than he is.  We skirmish, but I always come out on top.  We waste a lot of time trying to figure out how much he can lose by and still come in second as I play with my Edges, and time is called and I find myself with the timed win.  My 21 cards to his 2.
<br/>
TW + 21
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  None.
<br/>
Lows:  I’m stupid.  I lose points now.
<br/>
<br/>
I win, Beal grabs second, Enrique ran the thing, but would have gotten third, and Bobby and Pat scrub out hardcore.  We attempt to eat at Jack in the Box, but they are out of shakes so I opt for nothing.  After 5 minutes of watching them eat I want food and settle for spicy Doritos and a coffee coollatta thing from 7-11.  Many odd things are said on the way home, the end result of which being that Bobby is a flaming homo.
<br/>
<br/>
Mad Props to:
<br/>
<br/>
Bobby for being a great sport and an excellent playtest buddy.
<br/>
<br/>
Props to:
<br/>
<br/>
Kiki cause he’s always driving and running tournaments, unselfishly.
<br/>
<br/>
See you all at "A World Champioship" in Virginia Beach this November.  I forget if there is anything else I have to say.  Good night.
