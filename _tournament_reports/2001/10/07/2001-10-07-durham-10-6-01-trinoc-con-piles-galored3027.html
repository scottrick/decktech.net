<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here is my tourney report for Trinoc*coN where I was being better than I normally am. 
<br/>
<br/>
 Pre-Tourney Stuff: Well, the week before, I go to the tourney in Durham and do HORRIBLY with a capital every letter. So I decide I need new decks. I know Edwin was leaving Friday, so I think &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll have him over some day and I&amp;#8217;ll be fine.&amp;#8221; Well I am busy almost every day and I don&amp;#8217;t get around to having him over, and I&amp;#8217;m in trouble with cards cuz I can&amp;#8217;t borrow anything from him. So I talk to Brad Reinhold online and he&amp;#8217;s like &amp;#8220;Just have fun.&amp;#8221; So he tells me to play Jawas which would be wicked cool, but I can&amp;#8217;t find the cards. I decide to play the EXACT same deck as my BHBM except with Hunt Down, and I only changed two cards. ONLY TWO. So my sucky deck now is goodified cuz of Hunt Down. For light I was gonna play jawas, but I can&amp;#8217;t find those cards either, so I choose to play Brian Hunter&amp;#8217;s EBO done RIGHT aka The Real Deal, HEAVILY modified. I am frantic searching for cards Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, as I go to a b-day party from 5 to 10 on Friday. I get most of my EBO ready, except I have no Rebel Fleets or Incom Corps (?). I just couldn&amp;#8217;t find them. So I&amp;#8217;m like &amp;#8220;Step over Hayes Hunter, I have the MOST pilish deck EVER.&amp;#8221; I have only 52 cards in my deck as the pairings are announced, and I add eight random mains to my deck, which is now EBO x-wing swarm with mains&amp;#8230;hmmm. Anyway, before that, I get to the millennium hotel at about 11:15-11:30 and register for the con in the hotel lobby, and we&amp;#8217;re REALLY confused about where it is. Finally we get to the third floor and see Patrick and some other guys playing JK and LoTR so I&amp;#8217;m like yay! So me, my dad, and my bro go to CiCi&amp;#8217;s Pizza for lunch, and we get back at about 12:15. The tourney starts at 1, so I frantically search for cards to add to my light. Brad tells everyone to go downstairs to start the tourney, so we all follow him into this gaming room to play. Brad is directing the tourney and playing cuz there aren&amp;#8217;t sixteen people. I am finishing both of my decks as the pairings are announced, and I finally get a Visage from Caleb Foth so I can play Hunt Down. Anyway, I add some random mains to my deck in the last minute so I have 60 cards. I sit down for the first game with
<br/>
Game 1: My LS EBO x-wing swarm/random mains VS. Ed Yarrington Court (1509)
<br/>
<br/>
I start the Signal and ANSB, and he starts PoTH, First Strike, and All Wrapped Up with Prepped Defenses. First turn he gets Boelo and an Abyssin to the audience chamber and a docking bay to tatooine and draws some. I have an arcona, an x-wing, naboo system, and barrier in hand, so I get two sites before I activate, then activate 6. I deploy the sites and Naboo system and an x-wing to the system and an arcona to the db to satisfy the court damage.  I keep two force in case somehow he attacks the arcona AND the x-wing. On his turn, he drains and deploys another db to tatooine, and attacks the arcona, who reacts away, and he does not follow. On my turn, before I activate, I get a db and echo effect, EBG. I activate several and drain for 3, from the system and at the site. I deploy the site and effect, and get Hobbie from reserve. I deploy him to the war room, and deploy Lando w/Ax and Tawss Khaa to a db on tatooine and let him go. On his turn, he deploys Iggy w/Gun and P-60 to Lando&amp;#8217;s site and battles. Shoots, captures Lando, hits Tawss with P-60, I lose 1. Battle destiny I get a 5 I think, and he forfeits P-60, I forfeit Tawss. So he has Iggy there with Lando as a captive. I have an x-wing at the naboo system and an arcona on tatooine. I drain for my three, and get EBO and a guy with EBG. I deploy the guy to the Echo Base, and Leia w/Gun to the DB. I deploy EBO and Qui-Gon to tatooine, then transit Leia to tatooine. I draw some, and somewhere along these lines I OOC and get Gailid. On his turn he fortifies his AC with Jabba and Ephant Mon and someone else. He deploys Boba Fett with a thermal detonator to Arcona&amp;#8217;s site and battles. I react away and he moves Boba to the AC. He is steadily moving Iggy over to the dungeon. Meanwhile, I am draining at systems with EBO and I have Qui-Gon&amp;#8217;s stick on him. He is losing lots to drains, and I am only losing 1 a turn. Somewhere along the lines he has Boba against my Leia with two tracked fives. I battle, fire, and hit Boba, but he detonates the detonator and gets a 1 for one of his destinies. Crap! The tracked five would have been cool. O well. He also looks for a DB and doesn&amp;#8217;t find it, so he has to deploy a ship, which is ZiMH, who I barrier. I come down next turn with a couple x-wings and beat him up. He loses a couple, but keeps Zuckass there. He battles next turn, and I react with the Spiral, and I get destiny, which is like a 5, so he has to lose Zuckass and some more. He moves his guys to Qui-gon&amp;#8217;s site. I keep draining, and move Qui-Gon to the AC. He moves all of his guys over. I move Qui to the dungeon. He follows with Ephant Mon, Boelo, and Iggy. He puts Lando in the dungeon and retrieves two. I get him down to a few cards, and he has his whole force against my Qui-Gon. I keep him there on my turn, and he battles. I hit a guy, and forfeit Qui and he satisfies. I drain him out for the win next turn. FW +21
<br/>
2 (21)
<br/>
Highs: Draining a whole lot and totally dominating (pretty much).
<br/>
Lows: The thermal detonator. Darn.
<br/>
<br/>
Well, between the games I talk to Brad, and we figure out we&amp;#8217;re playing each other. Also, Mike beat Matt Guinn in a battle by 60 in his game, and Brad, me, and Henry I think are asking him how he did it. Well, Matt had choke Vader alone. Mike drops RFC there. At this point Frederick Foure leans over from playing his game and asks how. Matt then replies &amp;#8220;Play your game, you&amp;#8217;re @#$%ing up enough.&amp;#8221; This was so hilarious. We all busted out laughing. I think you kind of had to be there, but this was so hilarious. Anyway, he then drops EPP Luke to the Cantina with Beggar to use Matt&amp;#8217;s force. Then EPP Han to the DB. Matt knew he had a 6, 7, 6, 3, and a 1 in his deck, so he thinks he&amp;#8217;s OK. Battle, Triple, Run Luke Run, Don&amp;#8217;t Get C0cky! Matt tries to choke the RFC, and draws the 1. Mike cuts Vader and draws high, Matt draws the 3. Well that&amp;#8217;s Vader and 60.    
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My DS Hunt Down pile VS. Brad Reinhold WYS (1955)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I start Hunt Down without Epic Duel. I start Prepped Defenses with IAO/Secret Plans, YCHF, and Mob Points. He starts Squad Ass., Insurrection/Aim High, and DDTA. Crap! O well. We shuffle, and draw our 8 card hands. I get the GOD draw against WYS. I can&amp;#8217;t believe how good it was. I get EPP Vader, Tat Maul, Guri, and Search and Destroy! Dooood!!! Ok, first turn I deploy Vader to the Cantina, and he loses to Visage, and it&amp;#8217;s his go. During my turn and his turn after that he&amp;#8217;s talking smack, like Dood, you have ballz to put Vader in the Cantina first turn vs. WYS. I&amp;#8217;m not faded, so I keep him. On his turn he just gets out Home one DB with Insurrection, deploys Goo Nee Tay, and draws. I activate 8, and deploy Tatooine Maul to the Tat DB, and deploy S+D. I also persona replace EPP Vader with Lord Vader and his stick. Now he&amp;#8217;s like @#$! So he&amp;#8217;s losing 5 on my turn and 2 on his. So for now, he&amp;#8217;s basically screwed. He loses to Search and Destroy and Visage. On his turn he deploys Dash and Outrider to Kessel system and Theron Nett to the Cantina. He loses to Visage and Search and Destroy. I deploy Guri to the Cantina and battle. He Dodges away to the DB, where he has no presence. I also get Maul&amp;#8217;s stick this turn and deploy it on him. I pick some up, and it&amp;#8217;s his turn. He drains at Kessel for 3. On his turn, he drops Phylo Gandish, Wedge, and Han w/Gun to the DB. He battles, I cut Phylo. He shoots, gets Maul with Blaster Proficiency to help out Han&amp;#8217;s gun. He gets two destiny, which are two 3&amp;#8217;s. I draw a 4, and he forfeits Theron. I lose Maul and about 5, Search and Destroy is cancelled, and TPM that I deployed goes to used pile. I drain, he loses to Visage. He also deployed Battle Plan last turn. So he is draining for lots, me not. He gets Melas in Red 10 to Tatooine and I&amp;#8217;ll Take the Leader out. He also has another two DB&amp;#8217;s at Tatooine which he occupies. I deploy Palpy and Janus to the CC DB. I am draining for 3 at the Cantina and two at the CC DB. He is draining for a WHOLE lot, so I am screwed. He Edges for 3 once, and basically drains me out. FL by 10. 2 (11).
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Almost beating Brad! Brad was like Dood you&amp;#8217;re awesome the whole game. It was a great game and I think I played pretty well. 
<br/>
Lows: Well, losing, but getting drained for 600000000000000000000000000000000 each turn at like 4 sites. 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, we have a lot of time between games, so I stay around and watch some games.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My DS VS. Mike Merletto&amp;#8217;s WYS (1708)
<br/>
<br/>
Great. The same deck that I lost to last time. So he starts Battle Plan/DTF, Insurrection/Aim High, and Squad Ass. I start my usual. Again, I get the god draw. EPP Vader, and Maul. Dood, it&amp;#8217;s all good. First turn I deploy EPP Vader to the Cantina. He loses to Visage, and it&amp;#8217;s his turn. On his turn, he gets Kessel system and Mirax on the Pulsar Skate to Tatooine. He loses to Visage, and it&amp;#8217;s my turn. I drain of two, and deploy Coruscant Maul to the DB with his stick. On his turn, he drains and deploys Beggar. I drain, and get out S+D. He&amp;#8217;s losing lots of force again, just like against Brad. On his turn he deploys Artoo &amp; Threepio to the Home One DB. On my turn I persona replace EPP Vader with Lord, and stick, and Tarkin to the Cantina. I have five force saved. He uses the five force, and I can&amp;#8217;t play my barrier. He deploys EPP Luke to the Cantina, EPP Han, and RFC to the DB, battle, Triple, Run, Luke Run, Don&amp;#8217;t Get @#$%y, and 5 destiny. I cut Han and draw a 4. That&amp;#8217;s Maul and 22. @#$%! That&amp;#8217;s game. Anyway, he drains me more in space and I have to pay to drain on the ground. I drain him for a little, and we are both losing to Visage. He finally drains me out for a win by 12. FL by 12. 2 (-1).
<br/>
Highs: Getting a good start, only losing by 12.
<br/>
Lows: Losing a battle by 30, with 22 overflow.  
<br/>
<br/>
Since there were only about 12 people there, we could only go four games. So going in to the last game, I play John Irving, and I see he&amp;#8217;s playing the same BHBM cheese he played last tourney that killed me. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My LS VS. John Irving BHBM Cheese (1605)
<br/>
<br/>
Well, he beat me last tourney, so I&amp;#8217;m scared. He starts racing with the Box of Death. I get a quick start with an x-wing at Corulag first turn. I get some people to the Echo base and an arcona to the DB. He gets Palpy and Tech Mor to the Throne Room early. He deploys Vader to the 4th Marker, and luckily I drew my Ice Storm the turn before. Vader is sent missing, and he inserts numbers on me. It comes to the top a few turns later, but Honor limits the loss to 7. I attack his Throne Room with Corran and Tawss, and cause him some damage, and he loses Palpy, I loseTawss. Next turn he redeploys Palpy and battles. He uses Palpy&amp;#8217;s Power and draws 5 and 4. I draw a 6, and lose Corran. . He wins the podrace, and again I only have to lose 9. I drain him for massive amounts. He deploys Boba Fett in Boat to Naboo and battles. He draws high, I don&amp;#8217;t draw. I lose one of my 2 x-wings. Next turn I come back with 4 x-wings and Lando in Falcon and battle. I beat him down for eleven overflow. Next turn I All Wings Report in for 8, and get the arcona out to the north ridge. I keep draining, and he tracks some 5 for counter assault at naboo. From then on I just drain him out. FW by 9. 4 (8)
<br/>
Highs: Beating John, and playing him. John is a great guy. 
<br/>
Lows: Counter assault. I was so stupid. I shouldn&amp;#8217;t have drained at Naboo when I knew he had one.
<br/>
<br/>
So I placed 6th out of about twelve, which is pretty good for me. After the tourney I sit around with Greyson, Ryan, and Caleb and talk about decks. Caleb shows me his RTP sh!t and my mom comes. When I get home, I calculate my rating and I got up to 1494 from 1459 in one tourney. So that was pretty cool. Also I really like my decks even tho they are SUPER piles. Now for the famous Props and Slops:
