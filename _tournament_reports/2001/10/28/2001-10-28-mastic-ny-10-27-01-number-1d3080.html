<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The number 1 in the title comes from the song by nelly that I was listening to with Brad in the car that got stuck in my head for much of the tournament.  Anyway, Brad Vogel and I had planned to go down to Mastic on Saturday to tear it up in Mastic.  You see, on the Long Island Group page on decktech there had been some heat building up between the Tri-County Players (myself, Brad and others) and the Mastic players.  It all started when I said Matt Ehrhart and I were going to invade Mastic and Joe Guiffre of Mastic got a little angry.  So, this tournament was surely going to be big, very big.  I decided to bring senate with revos and mains for light and Maul mains with combat response for JP for dark.  The drive up to Mastic took us about 40 minutes and that includes using some directions which weren’t dead on (first left eh John?).  We get there around 1:40, sign up for the tournament, play some Marvel vs. Capcom and wait around a little bit.  The pairings are announced and first rounds it’s my light against Joe Guiffre’s Dark.  I immediately shout out "OOOOOOOOOH!!!"
<br/>
<br/>
Round 1
<br/>
My LS senate vs. Joe Guifre’s Court Scum
<br/>
<br/>
He was starting the court stuff with prepared defenses for first strike, power of the hutt, and something else that I can’t remember.  I started the senate stuff with HFTMF for YISYW/Staging Areas, Insurrection/Aim High, and Don’t Do that Again.  First turn he pulled a docking bay, lost a force to his objective, and drew.  My first turn I dropped Senaor Palpatine and the hammerhead senator to flip.  I then deployed Obi’s Hut and H1: DB from my deck.  I played it could be worse on the court damage and drew.  His turn, he deployed Jabba’s Palace: Lower Passages and a bunch of guys to the Audience chamber, including Chokk, Mighty Jabba, Ephant Mon and some other guys.  On my turn I drained him for 1 at the senate, deployed Goo Nee Tay, and dropped Obi EPP, Luke EPP, and Leia EPP on them.  I battled and not all went down as I wanted it to so to make a long story short, I was left with just Obi EPP and he kept all of his guys because I think boelo was there to cancel my destiny.  I moved Obi over to the Passages, drew some and let him go.  He deployed some other thugs to the Audience chamber like IG w/ Riot Gun and Dengar w/ Blaster Carbine but didn’t move anyone over after Obi.  On my turn I drained at two sites and sent down guys to help out Obi Wan.  For the next bunch of turns he kept chasing me down and I kept running.  We were both draining for 1 because I had the senate held.  The guys he was chasing me wih consisted of Dengar, IG, Dr. E w/ Ponda Baba, Chokk, Ephant Mon, Mighty Jabba, and Boelo, Prince Xizor and Jodo Kast I think.  I had Han EPP, Qui gon who was holding his saber, a disarmed Obi EPP, and Luke EPP. I kept drawing looking for my Sorry About the mess combo so that I could take out dengar and not get slaughterd in a battle.  I eventually got it after running.  On his next turn he split up his guys into two groups.  I just remember all the guys  mentioned before being at my site except for Xizor who was at the adjacent site with somebody else.  So he moved over and on my turn I played SATM and took out dengar.  I battled and hit every guy I swung or shot at.  IG missed his shot and we drew destiny.  He cancelled one of my draws and he drew 3 because of jodo kast with Ig and ephant mon with Jabba.  I was pissed because when i asked him how many bounty hunters he had there he just told me Dengar and IG but whatever.  I ended up forfeiting obi and han I believe.  He lost every guy I hit but didn’t have any overflow because Chokk prevents their forfeits from getting reduced.  Anyway, at this point, the tables pretty much turned in my favor.  I started chasing him down with some guys and eventually we battled and I cleared him.  My drains finished him off and I was able to retrieve 3 wih might of the republic towards the end of the game.  I get the full win by 21.
<br/>
<br/>
2(+21)
<br/>
Highs: Beating Joe Guiffre, who had said some $hit that he shouldn’t have said, but thats all in the past now... 
<br/>
Lows: Having to run for a bunch of turns, not seeing Jodo Kast in that battle, thank jesus he didn’t have a hidden weapons to play.
<br/>
<br/>
Brad and I had both won our first games but we played the same sides so we knew we couldn’t play each other so that was cool.  The pairings were announced ad its my dark vs. Mike Bianco’s light.
<br/>
<br/>
Round 2
<br/>
My Maul Mains vs. Bianco’s RST Boomrace
<br/>
<br/>
I was a little worried about this match because I had never played against RST with this deck.  I figured all I had to do was get out CHYBC and beat him down on endor with mains.  First turn I play we must accelerate to get CHYBC and play it.  I also deploy the audience chamber from my deck.  He goes and deploys Obi Wan EPP and General Solo to the back door and lets me go.  Now, I smell blood.  I deploy the lower passages from my deck and I drop Vader EPP and Dr. E with Ponda baba.  I you are beaten obi wan and han is beat down for 13 overflow.  He’s been drawing really low for the podrace also so the game is looking good.  On his next turn he drops Leia EPP on board r2 in red 5 to endor.  I go, drain, and deploy mara with her saber and Guri to the audience chamber and deploy my last jabba’s palace site, the dungeon.  On his turn, he deploys luke to obis site and moves them over to the bunker.  Once again, I smell blood.  I am holding Cor. Maul, his saber, Maul Strikes and sniper/ds.  I go and drain for 4.  Then, I drop Maul to the bunker and battle.  I swing at luke but I miss.  This isn’t good.  He swings at maul and its him.  I now realize that I am holding alter/friendly fire so I play it to try and make one of his guys lost and I draw a 1 so he lose obi wan.  I can’t play maul strikes now because Obi is dead but I won’t be beaten down now so it’s all good.  We both lose our guys and it’s now his turn.  On his turn he drops obi wan epp to the landing site.  I drain, he wins the race finally, and I draw until I get a ship.  On his turn he runs to the back door and tells me to go.  I drop fett in slave 1 at the endor system and battle.  He draws a 1 and i draw a 5 so he has to lose leia and fett stays.  I move to obi’s site and draw up.  On his turn he moves obi over to the bunker.  I go and drain for 5 and then move over my guys and circle obi, so he goes out of play.  So now the table consists of my fett in slave 1 holding endor, mara and guri holding the audience chamber and the only characters at any endor sites are my Dre combo and Vader EPP.  On his turn he drops luke on the r2 in red5 that is still at endor and battles fett.  I draw another 5 and he gets a 3 so I’m immune and luke dies.  I go, drain, and move my guys over to the back door.  A few turns later my guys are at the rebel landing site for some reason that I can’t explain and he drops Corran horn at the bunker in a last ditch effort to try and make me lose 8.  He attempts to blow it up but draws like a 5 and a 1 so he’s unseccessful.  On my tun I move over my guys and a draw a bunch looking for some guys to stop corran.  I get none in my hand.  On his turn he tries to blow it up but fails again.  On my turn, I move my guys to the bunker and let him go.  He fails yet again to blow the thing up and on my next turn I drain him out.  I get the full win by 20.
<br/>
<br/>
4(+41)
<br/>
Highs: Making him lose 13 force in the first battle of the game.  Placing Obi out of play.  Holding the endor system for most of the game with just Fett in Slave 1.  Pretty much having control of the entire table for the whole game.
<br/>
Lows: Not having a guy in my hand to beat down Corran Horn at the bunker towards the end of the game.  
<br/>
<br/>
Brad had lost his 2nd game to Mike Patton’s EBO, so I was doing the better of the two of us at this time.  3rd round it seems I will be playing Mike Patton and Brad gives me some encouragement, assuring me that I can beat him.  My current record against Patton going into this game is 1-1 but in that loss I was playing TIE bombers so I’m not too worried that is until I see...
<br/>
<br/>
Round 4
<br/>
My ls senate vs. Mike’s DS SENATE!!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Going into this game i am 0-3 against DS senate with my best performance being a loss by 5, so I’m fairly concerned.  He seems worried about this match also but I know how badly the DS senate can rape the LS because of their surplus of senators.  So I start the usual and he starts maul’s landing site and prepared defenses for I will Find them quickly master and the coruscant effect that bulls db’s. First turn he just deploys the 2/2 naboo site and tatooine: mos espa db and then draws.  I go, deploy yoda from my deck as well H1: DB from my deck.  I draw and let him go.  He just activates, deploys Naboo:DB, and draws.  On my turn, I drop vallorum, palptine, yarua, and the hoe senator to the senate.  Needless to say, I flip.  I also play revolution on Maul’s site, not realizing that with If the Trace was correct on the table, if he has maul there, he drains me for 4.  So he goes and drops a bunch of senators down to the senate and we brawl.  I lose vallorum and some other crappy guy.  We continue to brawl at the senate for most of the game and eventually he does take it over as I knew he would but this doesn’t happen until close to the end of the game so I’ll discuss it later.  Meanwhile, he had deployed Maul to the Tat: Db and moved him over to get a drain of 4.  I deployed obi epp and leia epp to take him out.  I missed the swing, sensed his maul strikes and drew a 5 for destiny.  We both lose the site.  He comes down there with another maul.  Again, i hit him with some epps and the site is completely cleared.  This keeps happening for a while and he eventually takes the senate over.  At this point however, I have used out of commsions to place both Maul and Vader out of play.  I now drop Luke EPP, Han EPP, and Leia EPP to the 2/2 naboo site.  He deploys xizor and someone else to the senate and moves them over to the jedi counel chamber.  So right now he is draining for 4 and i’m draining for 2...however, I am holding it could be worse.  I go and move leia epp to the naboo: db.  He goes and drains me for 4.  I it could be worse 3 of it away.  He drops rune haako and nute gunray at the tat: db and moves them to the desert landing site.  I go, activate it could be worse to the 3rd card of my force pile.  I move leia to the tat: db and draw the it could be worse.  He goes and uses his objective to try and get the it could be worse out of my hand but doesn’t.  He drains and I play it again.  I go and once again track it back into drawing position.  I drain and move leia to the landing site.  He goes and I think activate it all for some reason that i can’t remember.  He tries to get it could be worse out of my hand again but again fails to get it.  He battles, retrieves a force for doing so.  He predicts my weapon destiny and his prediction is wrong but i still miss the shot.  He predicts my battle destiny and is correct so i think i lose 1 force.  I go and drain him for 2 again.  I battle, shoot rune because he predicted wrong.  He predicts my battle destiny though so i lose leia and he loses rune.  Next turn he tries to get it could be worse out of my hand again but once again misses it.  So I go and drain him and he only has one card left so he can’t try to get it could be worse out of my hand next turn and I win on my next turn with only 4 cards left in my deck.  
<br/>
<br/>
6(+45)
<br/>
Highs: Placing Vader and Maul out of play.  Tracking it could be worse correctly over and over and getting extremely lucky because he missed it every time.  
<br/>
Lows: Losing the senate.  Playing revo on desert landing site and almost having it lose me the game.
<br/>
<br/>
So I’m currently kicking a$$ and taking names and when the pairings are announced I’m playing the almighty Dan Curran, the 2nd highest rated player on Long Island.  I say almighty because he made the claim that nobody could beat him on the Long Island group page.  However, Brad beat him by 25 in this tournament.  
<br/>
<br/>
Round 4
<br/>
My Dark vs. Dan Curran’s Hidden Base Flip
<br/>
First turn I pull the chamber and drop maul YA to the landing site with his saber.  Guri gets pulled with the AC and i move them both to JP.  He goes, pulls endor, and drops general calrissian aboard his ship there.  I go and drain for 2 and move over to the AC.  He goes and drains and pulls another system and puts somebody there.  He also deploys tk-422 to the AC.  On my turn I sniper tk, drain and drop mara with her saber to the AC.  For the next few turns he continues to pull systems and set up ships.  Meanwhile, I am spreading out 2 big drains at the Audience chamber and lower passages.  At one point he drains me for 3 and i lose 2 of the 3 ships in my deck off the top of my reserve deck so I am thinking that i am seriosly screwed.  Shortly after I spread out my guys, he flips.  On my turn he cancels my drains and I spread out a bunch of guys to my 4 jp sites and draw.  He goes and drains me for 8.  I go and get 2 of 2 off while he cancels 2 others.  This is where it all get f*cked up.  I drop Bossk in hounds tooth to Naboo where he has Lando in Gold Squad 1.  I had Security Precautions in my hand.  I forget to deploy it. I probe it and he says, yea thats it.  As soon as he says this i say "no, wait," and he refuses to allow me to put down security precautoins.  I verbally abuse him for this and I wasn’t aware that I’m allowed to take it back because I hadn’t moved on to another action.  Anyway, we move along and I run with bossk to kessel.  He drains me 6 and drops luke epp, obi epp, and leia epp to the dungeon after mara with her saber.  He battles and kills bossk and I you are beaten obi wan at the dungeon.  He battles mara with luke and leia and misses mara twice.  I miss luke with the swing.  His destiny is lower than maras immunity so he loses leia and i lose 2 force of overflow.  On my turn I get a drain of 7 off and battle luke with mara.  He misses mara but i hit luke and his draw is low again.  On his turn he drains me for 9 or so and battles mara with obi, finally killing her.  I go and drain 7 again.  He goes and drains me out.  He gets the win by 10, the same amount of force that he would have lost from security precautions.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Knowing that I can beat a 1900+ player if the rules are applied correctly.    
<br/>
Lows: Gee, I wonder...    
<br/>
<br/>
So I finish off at 6(+35) and in 3rd place.  John Curran gets 1st and Brad Vogel gets 2nd.  Dan Curran gets 4th even though he is unbeatable.  After the tournament I make a few cool trades and get Executor, Qui Gon Jinn, and some AI’s.  All in all, this was a successful  tournament with tri county players taking 2 of the top 3 spots in the tournament.  I guess I’ll do some props and slops..
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Me for being cool
<br/>
Brad for being cooler, getting 2nd, and hooking me up with a ride.
<br/>
All the people at mastic except for Dan Curran for being cool.
<br/>
Wendys for being the shizzle.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops: Dan Curran for screwing me in my game and as I found out later, hiding a secret plans under his objective in another game screwing a kid out of retrieving.   </font></td>
