<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Ok, here we go. So I’ve been play testing my decks since my tournament on New Years day.  I have always been a fan of Hunt Down and so I decide to modify Hunt Down 2K1: The Missing Chromosome.  I add in a few more characters and a few "tech" cards to combat the new objective.  I’m feeling very confident with it and now it comes time to select a light deck.  Do I really have to??  I have 3 put together, but none of them seem to win consistently enough for me to take them to a tournament, even a local.  I end up deciding on a version of Yannick’s "The Machine" deck that starts out MWYHL with mains and docking bays.  Uses high destiny recycling interrupts for force retrieval.  Destiny adders and the whole bit.  I was playing fairly well in the play testing against my roommates Nathan "Jawatosser" Magro and Zach "Yodamuppet" Marshall.  Beating them both on a consistent basis. 
<br/>
<br/>
We arrive at the tournament at 4:30PM or so to get in some early trades and play test a little more with the other local players before the tournament at 6:00.  So we trade and play and I prepare for the tournament by passing out command cards.  Yes, this is going to be my first tournament that I will run and also play in.  I kind of hope that I don’t win, because that would make me feel bad to run the tournament and also take 1st.  But it was a good thing that I decided to play because only 7 people showed up.  With me that’s 8 and it can be sanctioned.  So here we go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: DS vs. Zach’s WYS Ralitir Captain Madness
<br/>
<br/>
So we draw our opening hand.  Lucky me, I got 2 Vaders.  One Choke and one Lord.  So first turn I drop Choke to his d-bay pull Executor D-bay, flip and say go.  He drops stick Luke (damn no dueling card in hand) and battles Vader.  I try to choke, he cuts draws a 3, I draw a 1 I lose Vader and 1, a Vader off the top.  Darn, that just re-flipped my objective and I lost 2 Vaders.  No matter, I got another one in hand.  So we both lose one to visage and now it’s my turn again.  Drop Lord Vader at Exe. D-bay move to tatooine flip and say go.  He brings down Mirax and a RFC (Ralitir Freighter Captain) to the d-bay and one to the cantina, flips his objective and battles.  I draw a 5 (way to stand tall Vader) and he draws a 6 and a 3.  Holy hell!  There goes another Vader. 3 in two turns.  So I lose Vader he loses a RFC, and moves Mirax to the cantina.  By now I need some cards in my hand so I activate and draw losing two more to visage.  And wouldn’t you know it, but another one off the top was a Vader.  So now I’ve only got one Vader left.  And he’s floating around in my deck somewhere.  I have Mara and Dr. E draining for 2 at the d* d-bay and the Emperor, Tarkin and Dengar draining at his d-bay.  I finally get the balls to move into his cantina with IG88, Dengar, Mara and Dr. E.  4 shots and 4 characters gone.  Not many can stand up to that.  So he runs and I finally draw up my last Vader and his lightsaber.  His turn he basically draws up, gets an Out of Commission, and plays it.  I cancel it with This is Some Rescue, my little destiny 6 recyclable tech. But he can play from his lost pile so he does and whom does he get, Vader.  That lucky little humph!  So I lose my Vader and his stick to drains next turn and then I drop the Executor, I can tell he wasn’t expecting this, to tatooine and battle, I have power 12 to his 4. So he loses everything there and I shuttle up Dengar to get a destiny if he comes back.  He never did.  I dropped Thrawn to the Executor and shuttled back down Dengar.  I end up beating him off the planet and winning.

Standing 2(+8)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning with a Vader-less Hunt Down and getting to use my tech This is Some Rescue.  Also playing a really great game.
<br/>
Lows: Losing 4 Vaders by turn 3.  Having to play against my friend when I knew every part of his deck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: LS vs. Courtney Haggerty’s Endor Opps: Let’s build us a DS2.
<br/>
<br/>
This was a pretty non-interactive game.  First turn I put EPP Luke at his d-bay and drew a few.  He dropped a walker and move over Merejik to pilot.  I drop EPP Obi, battle, Gift, and draw 14 in destiny.  Good night.  He went to space where he was followed by the Super Falcon who beat him down at Kessel and moved over to where he had Baron Fel in his TIE with a cannon.  He drops another guy in a tie and battles.  I play Don’t get @#$%y to kill Fel and proceed to draw my 4 destiny.  He dies horribly in space.  I also took out the Executor, cha-ching!

Highs:  Having my deck work like a charm.  Killing Fel with my Don’t Get @#$%y tech.
<br/>
Lows:  Not getting Yoda until the 3rd turn.  That little muppet sure does know how to hide.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: DS vs. Nathan’s WYS with undercover spies.
<br/>
<br/>
First turn I drop Vader and he loses one to visage of the top.  Outrider goes to the lost pile.  No more Dash for the rest of the game.  His turn he drops Coruscant and a YT freighter and draws some.  Next one off the top, Pulsar Skate.  No more of that in space.  The game basically went the same for him for the rest of the game.  I dropped the Executor to Coruscant and battled his guy and he ran away.  S&amp;D doing some major damage as well as Visage + drains, it almost seemed like it was over from the beginning for him.

So I’m in second place behind a guy that if the old rule of hands down were still in effect would’ve had two modified wins.  I know what deck he’s playing and my deck should be able to hold out at least a little while to widdle him down.  Unfortunately my deck sucks!!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: LS vs. Tom Ercenbrack’s Endor Opps. Massive Space deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so I get one bad Meta game, so I’ll just play mine and hope to get the Falcon or H1 to one of his lowly scrubs and hope my retrieval will keep up with his drains long enough to win.  I drop to a d-bay and start draining.  He drops U-3PO to block.  I move to my other d-bay and he drops Arica to block.  So I’m draining him for 1 at his d-bay and I’m eating drains of 4+ in space.  Every time I went to look for one of my ships it was in my reserve deck.  I figure I can at least count on my retrieval to bring be back a little bit, but no luck.  I didn’t retrieve once!  Not one of my 4 retrieval cards worked, I lost 4 characters including 2 EPP Obi’s to On the Edges.  Kept drawing 1’s.  So I finally get H1 to go to space late in the game and he Lat Damage beat down with the Devastator, Dengar in ship, and a TIE Squad.  I killed the Squad with Don’t Get @#$%y, but he had too much for me to withstand.  And I lose

Ok, so I don’t win. That’s fine with me.  I had a good time and got to test out my decks for the next tournament this Sat.  I won’t be shut out again.
