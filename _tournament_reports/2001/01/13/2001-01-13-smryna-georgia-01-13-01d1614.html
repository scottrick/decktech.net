<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Here is my latest tourney report-  I haven’t written a TR for a while because I keep forgetting the scores and the games.
<br/>
<br/>
Pre Tourney - 
<br/>
<br/>
Well a few weeks before the tourney I am talking to Austin "Yoda" Sheppard via AIM and I got him to try to make it.  Everyone one was psyched about Reflections II prize support.  Friday Night I recieved my box of R2 in the mail so I added the combo’s and lit cards to my deck.  I didn’t pull anything great but I got a Outer Rim Scout foil so I was happy.  On the day of the tourny I go down to the store and as the store opened Jody came.  I watched him pull a LS,JK foil and put it into his deck.  We played a few gamEs and more people came.  We had about 12 people today which is more than we ussally have! Now let the games BEGIN!
<br/>
<br/>
Game One -  My R2 teched out Court vs. Jody’s Throne Room Mains. 
<br/>
I start Mob.Points, Combat Response, and Power of the Hutt.  He starts Insurrection, Staging Areas, and Insight
<br/>
<br/>
Well I just played this deck about an hour ago so I know what it is cappable of - fast beatdowns. I get a pretty good hand with Chall and Jabba and scum.  I decided to lose one from my obj.  instead of deploying.  First turn for Jody - He deploys LSJK to Home one DB which he got VIA insurrection for activation. He grabs Honor and loses insight. Also he deploys Home One War Room. My turn I deploy Jabba and Chall and Ephant mon after I deploy Scum to AC and also add in Presence of the force. His turn he deploys Tat. DB and he deploys Obi to AC but I None Shall Pass it back to his hand. He draws after he move JK luke to Tat DB.  MY turn a drain for 2 and deploy a few sites and Mosep from reserve and Mara with Saber to Lower passages. I draw a few. Jody deploy’s Obi, han  and EPPLeia to MAra’s position and clears the site i lose a few force.  My turn I use mob points to get Kuat and i send zuckuus there. Save a few force.  Jody deploy’s kessel and Homeone with hasshn on it. and I knew it would be a drain race from there.  Through the rest of this game he out of comissioned a few of my dudes and it got annoying. and he dropped Orrikio and Lando with axe to the tat DB his drain for five killed me and I lost by 13 which isn’t bad since I ussally get crushed by him.

Game 2 My EBO tracking fun Vs Andrew’s SYCFA Stardestroyers
<br/>
<br/>
I star 1st and 4th marker with Signal for ANSB.  He starts the anit sac combo, Something Special planned for them and Imp Decree. Well this was going to be a close game.
<br/>
First turn he got half of his planets out first turn giving him a fast star with all his STD’s.  I get EBO set up second turn! with 3 ish tibs and start tracking sevens.  I get Red leader in red one to kiffex and spiral to Hoth.  I kept 2 hyperspace escapes. His turn he deploys Executor to Red leader in red one.  I draw a 5 for battle destiny  - he loses 1 force from hand. My turn i drain and get 2 more sites down with Home One with Thanpesi to sullust. His turn he drops Emperor to Death star DB after draining. Then he dropes iggy in ship and I hyper escape away. Next turn I drain for alot and he controls one of them.  I drop EPP obi down to 4th marker.  his turn - He drops Tempenst 1 with igar and battles i dar a five fore battle destiny so he loses Igar I lost obi,.  My turn i drain and drop EPP Leia and  Capt. Han on the Tempest 1. I draw a 7 and a 5. he loses tempese 1 and about 10 more.  His turn he drops Stalker and Thunderflare with Chiraneu on my Spiral.  Yet again i hype away using hyperspace Escape.  About this time We are both running low on force.  I move my forces to block his drains and he keeps running away. I drain him away but i only win by 2.

Round 2 Game One 
<br/>
<br/>
My Court Vs.  Will’s MWYHL
<br/>
I start my reg court stuff and he starts Draw there fire thw way of things and something else (I forget)
<br/>
<br/>
I wasn’t too excited with this match up - I have a problem with beating MWYHL.  Well first turn I set up fast with Mospe galid and chall with scum down first turn. his turnhe gets out yoda and his hope and back pack but no daughter.  I drain from reserve and he loses trafic control which really screws his tracking in this game.  I deploy Presence and draw a few. his turn he drops obi and i bounce him back with Nopn shall pass  and he still can find Daughter and he is really mad. so i drain again for 3 from reserve.  I deploy fett wiht gun and Bane malar to put of carkoon. His turn he drops obi, Eppe leia and Han and attacks  - I lose 1 force he retreives one. he shots bane an hits fet over the head with a saber I lose those and a bunch of force. He starts doing his tests  - limiting my drains and such.  When he gets to test five  - he mistracks it and gets a three for destiny.  But it proved enought ot defeat me me when i moved mara and DR. E wand poda boba. He thrashes me and drains me out after retrieving a bunch.

I use ANSB and deploy 2 Ish tibs and draw 1 losing 1 to court. his turn he drops mara jodokast, and 4lom with gun at 4th marker and loses 1 to court.
