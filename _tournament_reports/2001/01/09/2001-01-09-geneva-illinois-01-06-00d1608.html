<br/>
<br/>
Today I was tired I barely got any sleep. I got up at 8:00, took my shower, and my friend picked me up at 10:00. We got to Beyond Reality, and we play tested our decks. Soon some people some Sycamore people come, so that means that we will play, joy. So we got up and started the pairings. There were about 23 or so people there so we actually had to listen to who we are paired with.
<br/>
<br/>
Decks:
<br/>
Light-EBO
<br/>
Dark-Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Alex &amp;#8217;the great gatsby&amp;#8217; Helmke vs. Jon Grubb
<br/>
<br/>
The second I heard my pairing I got a headache. One of the top people in Corellia is playing me, crap. Well I’m playing dark, so I activated my 5 force. I deployed my DB, counting my vaders in my deck, 4. So I have one in my Force Pile, cool. So I draw up, and say go. He’s playing a Ishi Tib EBO, he searches for his Echo sites, pulling Echo Corridor and DB. he activates, and deploys his sites and war room. He deploys an ishi tib at the corridor, and does the Ishi tib thing and says go (were still both losing to Visage, ahh i love that annoying card). So i activate, deploy my D* DB and put vader and tarkin there so i flip, excellant (but whats not excellant is that im going to lose this game, but oh well). So I draw and he goes. Takes stuff, deploys some people at Hoth echo sites and gets EBO done. Deploys some one to hoth and to rendili, which i deployed earlier. He says go. I activate, Deplot Bossk and Boba at rendili, lateral Damage his Red squad xwing, but he has GLinG1 there, we draw he has to lose GL and I have to lose Bossk, so thats bad I win the battle though, and he later out drains me, which EBO does best.
<br/>
FL 19 / 0(-19)
<br/>
Props-me for not losing as much to a good player
<br/>
Jon- for being an excellant player
<br/>
Hunt Down-for being one of the best decks
<br/>
Slops-doing well, bad
<br/>
It was either after the first game or after the second when me nick seistrup and matt crews go get some free bread at the bread store. the second we get out of Beyond Reality, me nick and matt start playing the P_E_N_I_S game. Matt starts then me then nick. so we got around the corner being louder and louder, and these old women are looking at us, ha. I scream it as loud as I can, and i win, hahahaha. we got some bread then returned back to the tourney and waited for the other games to end, and ther next set of pairings. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: Alex &amp;#8216; the Great Gatsby&amp;#8217; Helmke vs. Jeff &amp;#8216; spicy burrito &amp;#8217; Butt
<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I hear this pairing I am well pleased. We go downstairs to play. I am light, so i start EBO stuff. He’s playing this CC deck with he starts Twi lek and gets Oppressive Enforcement, and he starts CC DT Plaza as his starting. He activates, then draws. I get my EBO stuff-corridor and EBG, since I have War Room in my hand. I activate, deploy the sites, deploy ’I need a Hobby’ Klivian, then I say go. Activates, he puts Lando at the lower corridor, and Sim Aloo at the DT plaza and says go. Pull stuff for EBO, activate, deploy zev and xwing for EBO, and say go. He activates drains a then draws. I pull Kiffex with that tech card, activate, and deploy incom corp. 3 xwings to kiffex, then say go. He activates, deploys Accuser and Iggy in ship to Kiffex and battles. We get to Battle destiny part, and he thinks I cant draw it but i can with Incom Corp on table so i draw destiny, use organized attack, i win the battle by 23, he forfeits both and some from his deck. The rest of the game there was no battling at all, and i eventually drained him out.
<br/>
<br/>
FW20 2(+1)
<br/>
Props to me for winning
<br/>
EBO-for being good
<br/>
Slops-winning so easy
<br/>
<br/>
Its either after this or the next game, well Matt was hungry, so we went out to eat, but we had to be quick. The second we got outside, we started playing the P_E_N_I_S game, again. We were waiting by the curb to wait for the light to change, and there were a mom and her baby, me and Nick wanted to scream PENIS in its ear, but we decided not to. We went into the cafe, watched Matt eat and Nick talked about scary move, then we left and played penis before we got back to BR (that is the best game ever!). I think i won again, even though nick is pretty loud.  We played another one, Matt won, and Nick’s voice kept squeeking. It’s a little thing called "’adolesence’"
<br/>
<br/>
  We got back, next set of pairings.
<br/>
Alex &amp;#8217;the great gatsby&amp;#8217; Helmke vs. Scott Sicha (sp?)
<br/>
He looked like a very good player, and i soon found out, was. I stated HD , he stated Agents, and rep was harc seff, the ishi. Well i activated deployed the DS DB and said go. He deployed some speeders, go. I activated, Deployed vader to the ds db and Ozzie to Ex DB and said go and draw some. He activates deploys hoth db with incom there, and deploys lando to the EX db CRAP!, he also deployed 3 speeders. Battle, beatdown, enough said i have to lose 7 more pluse ozzie, so i lose that. he moves cancels visage, crap. Go, so i activate, drain, and deploy emp sim and anus to the CC DB, and say go. he activates, deploys speeders to his tat sites, and says go. i activate drain,go. He uses attack pattern delta to add plus 1 drains for 8 or so, and he does that mainly for the rest of the game.

<br/>
Well, well, well. Zach Cute and his cute ROps, crap, for day 1 of the idea of ROps, it was made to kill EBO, but i was ready to fight the good fight, so here goes. he activated, deployed 3 rall sites, and said go. I pulled EBG and the DB. Activated, deployed War room, EBG, and DB, draw up, go. He activates, Deploys a non unique imp Atst pio, in Crap scout 3 i think, i forget. And he deploys DVDLOTS, to the DB, he has Kuat and Wakemmuli on the table to, deploys ships there. Says go, i get last site and ebo, and zev, activate, deploy corridor and zev and a wing at the DB. Dep ebo,and incom, go. Activate, drain, He deploys another guy and atst friend to jungle flips, crap, crap, crap. says go. I take hoth, activte, deploy to kiffex, but i noticed he had decree up, so i have to kill him at rallitir. i deploy arcona to jungle but the turn before he alterd the ORDER to engage (i love that card its acrcona tech, right jon?) So i just stick him there, i move to ralitiir. and go. He activates drains, deploys Suckuss, and capt Salarki to ralltir with bossk waitng there. He battled, i organized attacked, he lost by like 12 i think, so he lost every one there i had legedary SF so i deployed it on the xwing. Then we had this agrguement about if you could alter LSF, im like no, why would say immune to control? so we had people come over, and of course it cant its a imm. effect, well anyway back to the game. I have my drain for 1 at kiffex yay! but we eventually run out of time, and he wins, alas, another lose to this deck :-(.
