Game 4: my court against hidden base
<br/>
Well, I know this kids friend and he&amp;#8217;s played about 5 times. So I try to help him when playing. I set up gaild and hutt influence with the 2 guys necisary to drain. Then I help him after he flips by telling him to to spread out early game and to drain then later game bunch up and drain, he was gona bunch up then so I couldn&amp;#8217;t kill him but it was like turn 3. so he does the drains and I get out scum and firct strike, then I play down buba and I attack, I retrive 4 and he loses 2(he had draw there fire) so I;m happy, we both tie and I move. Then I;m draining for 6 each turn and 1 to the objective while I&amp;#8217;m retriving, when I get down to hime with 1 force left I attack and retrive lost pile and he loses the game.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: my court against his profit and harvest
<br/>
Well, this was another bad game, I basicly am getting screwd over and AGAIN hearded into the couner and deing. I&amp;#8217;m feeling good cause this guys really nice and cool so I ask what his differencial is, he says 32, so I make a deal to lose by 33 giving him +1 for fun. This is a really great guy(sean estes) so it&amp;#8217;s no biggy. So I let hime harvest for 6 or so turns and I draw up.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, somehow everytime I&amp;#8217;ve played I get tessek so I set up tesske and draw for a take me to jabba now or a kabe. Then I set up bo shuda and camp the kabe and tessek. Then I canel visage with my bothnain spy and 2 rats for forfit protection(I was thinking about the time I caneled with no protection, smart huh?) so then I set up the drains. He battles and I beat him I do it over and over and make him lose to first strike. Hes got 5 card left and I drain for all but 1 then I retive 6 and I drain. Fun game and It worked.
