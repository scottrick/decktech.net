<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">hi,
<br/>
eric hunter here. wou will have to bear with me cause i’m not gonna right it on word cause the text gets all messed up if i mispell something and it’s even harder for me to right it. well here it goes.
<br/>
<br/>
All week i had been playtesting with with mylight deck cause my dark was just so good. it only loses to my brother and with the few adjustments i had made, it has a better chance of winnning. well the main decks i made are as follows: hb with close air support(use endor and bespin) and mains, omdh with afa and some revo, and finaly degabah with afa and on the edge and superfalcon. 
<br/>
For about 3 weeks i had been playing a deadbolt, however it started to lose so i took it apart. however the night before the tourney i started to talk with mike gemme and i made of mine(with superfalcon and mains) with yannicks. sp basicly i had a stronger mains hit squad, and stronger space. i won’t bother posting it cause r2 is coming out. Well i didn’t have time to playtest it but i knew it was strong so i played that so my decks were:
<br/>
<br/>
Bhbm with some sac and deadbolt with epp hit squads.
<br/>
<br/>
so in the morning i got up and watched cartoons though it was all reruns witch sucks. i make a few changes to my decks by adding a hyper escape and putting in a forgoten hftmf. my dark i put in chybc cause i expected ebo drain and stuff. the ride over was uneventful so we got there on time. on to the games(note iwas rated 1960 before going into this)
<br/>
<br/>
game 1 against justin (forget your last name) ebo.
<br/>
<br/>
i start buy taking out emperor and put him at the ds2 db, i also put out caridia. he then signals for ansb but i sense it, so he just picks up. i then get out vader and then weapon levatate his stick and move emperor over with vader on cc. he gets luke to heputs down honor and draws. i do a damage via the effect on bhbm, drain put out janus and let him go. he gets out luke to 4th marker and draws. i drain and get out endor db and put iggy to where luke is. if i captured luke my objective would flip and i wouldn’t be able to duel with vader i jst drew destiny and he lost luke but he drew a zero so iggy stayed. finnaly he got ansb out but i had s&amp;D and was draining for 5 so i won by 29.
<br/>
highs-i practieced tracking forcelighting so i could use janus as a reacter terminal.
<br/>
lows- beating him so badly.
<br/>
<br/>
game 2 vs. hayes hunter’s bhbm.
<br/>
<br/>
some people were stupid and played the wrong sides but hayes and i had the highest diffs so we just sat down for 15 minutes untill we could start. basicly my starting hand was great, endor, hoth wart room, echo:BD, and staging areas. that’s like 3 twixes. i activate and search for a general and take out lando and crix. noticing that i had a singal in my force pile i just drew some cards leaving, 3 force and let him go. he gets out vader and stick to cc and let’s me go. at the end of his turn i played the signal but he sensed and lost 2 more cards cause of do or do not which i had started. i activated, put out kewtol(which i had drawn first turn)to the db, put out luke to vader and picked up. he darined and drew. so i activaed like 14 force and put down crix pulled blount and drew looking for ansb. by now he has a bunch of efects including sectret plans out and i was hurting, but because of the do or do not and his objective he was also huring. he jsut drained and let me go. from there i got some space out out and he just was draining. he got some space out and i made some stupid errors, i only pulled 1 on the edge off, but i had gotten some damage through and only lost by 14.
<br/>
highs-the great start
<br/>
lows- the mistakes at the end, never getting ebo out.
<br/>
<br/>
after we where finished this hot lady was renting some dvd’s and justin asked if that was our mom, and then he asked if it was the schiemers mom. i then asked if it was brians cyzenski’s mom cause she was the same age of this 2osomething year old player and we had a good laugh. i don’t know, it’s one of those "shoulda been there" things.
<br/>
<br/>
game 3 vs.brian cyzenski’s court scum.
<br/>
first off brina takes the entire football season off so this was his first tourney in a while and otherwise he’s really good. i get out ansb and take my generals out. he put some guys out to jabba’s sail bardge and moves them to the judland wastes. i get ebo out and lose one to court. i take the the drain and he draws. i put obi to his ac and get a ship out to a system to start draining. he somes and smacks obi but i don’t lose anyforce. he did have dannick jericho out and i hit with my saber. realizeing if i drew destiny he could lose somebody else first i refused to draw destiny thuse he had to lose jericho fisrt, and obi would not be placed out of play. next turn i just drain and back up my space. he drains and draws. i put dut down leai with obi to the judland after i frozen aseted his force pile to prevent barrier. i ploped down dtf and batlled against jabba’s sailbarge that had ree-yes and boelo. i hit both, then i clashed 1 so he couldn’t draw destiny. i draw a 5 forcing him to lose only the charecter and 7 or the everything. he chose the later thus also losing the twix from the sailbarge. that meant he only activated 7 force a turn now. i started my retrival with on the edge so i had myself a small lost pile. i also pread out and started to play frozen assets every turn as to prevent a smack on my ships. well he alters the frozen wich took me off guard, and then smaked my tala 2.i drained and put down the home 1 and moved lando over to join them. from there i just drained on the ground with leia and obi and battled him in space.  however i did smakc him in 1 batlle and he lost all the batle damage, preventing me from retriving another 10 or so.
<br/>
highs- playing brian, my deck worked great
<br/>
lows- beating brian to give him his third loss.
<br/>
<br/>
game 4 against ben rodriguz’s tigih eloms
<br/>
there were 3 undefeated people at this point all of which had played dark so i got to play ben(who was undefeated) since i was the third highest light. 
<br/>
i started by getting my emp out to the ds2 db. i would of put him at the endor one but i didn’t have vader... well he gets out a db and a charecter to it and moves luke over. i get out another db and put janus down to pick up luke and move the emperor over. I draw and finaly get vader. he puts down chewie, who i barrier, he then put down a 2 more eloms and batles, he draws a 4 and i drawa 3 or something so i lose janus and he loses a elom, he then moves over the charecters he had at the db to help the guys out he had against my lone emperor. i activate put down vader and stick, janus, and sim aloo, i yab chewie and batlle. i hit a elom a draw 2 destiny. we tie in power and i lose sime while he loses some. he retreats and let’s me go. i move emp and janus to cc and let him go. he puts down ben to his tat:db and moves a elom and chewie over to his chirpa’s hut. i drain and draw since i was getting no charecters. he sends some guys after the emperor put i barrier ecc lando so he dosen’t battle, he moves obi over. i drain then force lighting obi used, i put down mara with saber and iggy. i yab lando and batle. i atempt to capture obi but fail! i swing and hit obi though and i lose nobody and he stacks a card. from there we  had som intense batles but i usualy barrierd his stuff and would have the upper hand, i eventualy got vader and the emperor to the ds2tr and crossed luke. id on’t remember that much cause there was so much battling. it was a great game with me winning it by 11.
<br/>
highs-the game was great
<br/>
lows-none
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
game 5 vs. steve beroni’s deadbolt.
<br/>
this game went fast so i don’t remember to much. basicly i got set up fast but he got set up a little later. i had first strike and he had dtf so when we batlled(which i did most of) there was a 4 force swing. basicly i got a drain of 4 going and i went after him at the 4th marker so my s$d would go into efect. he kept his ships together so i would beat him up in space. the turning point was this. i tracked some destinies and put down mara with saber vs. leia and obi. i clash obi and battle leia. i draw a 3 and a 5. i then drew a 5 and he a six. he lost leia and 2 and stacked a card, i lost mara. there he spread out a little in space. i then deployed bosk and decngar vs tala 2 and red sqquadron 1. he reacted with spiral but i drew 2 tracked 5’s making him satisfy atrit of 13. because of that i was able to outdrain him and win by 13.
<br/>
highs- great game, closer then i thought
<br/>
lows-beating steve.
<br/>
<br/>
game 6 vs ben rodriguz’s endor ops.
<br/>
this game also was very fast and i don’t remember to much. Basicly i got things going fast. but so did he. he then got out the executer and some star destroyers. i put down gold 1 with lando and numb along with the home 1. i make him lose  bunch an i lose none. from there i put my epp hit squads of luke, leai, and han on the home 1 to get a bunce of destinies. i also had tala 1 at hotth the entire game so i had a steady drain while he never got 1 drain in. so since i lost very few force, the ones that i did i retrived via on the edge. so in a quick game i won by 31.
<br/>
highs- my small space kicking but
<br/>
lows-beating ben by so much.
