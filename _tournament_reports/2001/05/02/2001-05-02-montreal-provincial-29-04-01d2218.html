<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I guess it all started this week when we started to get down and start making our decks for the provincial. i playtested a lot of decks 2 or 3 kind of watch your step, set your course, bring him to me, dagobah, hidden base. After talking some tech with yannick i decided to go with him on the light side Mind what you have learned, and dark i decided to use a deck that i like a lot my bring him battle(no duel).

Round1 
<br/>
game1
<br/>
My light vs Guillaume Soucy Dark Cloud City
<br/>
Darn first game and i hit one the 8 i didn’t want to play against. Well we get started not much happens in the 5-6 turn i activate do my test to 5 he does a couple of cc sabacc as soon as test5 is done test6 comes and since there’s no vader on table he starts losing to test6 jedi knight, obi-wan epp, han epp, orrimarko and corran horn are already on cloud city giving a hell of time. Finish him but not before i retrive 10 with 2 on the edge.

<br/>
my light vs sorry could not remember is name. Bhtm tie bomber
<br/>
One of the weirdest game i played he started with the effect that gives +5 to bomber destiny and notice he play the bomber with 2 destiny witch gave them in battle a 7. i was expecting a fast game on his part but he only manage to deploy walkelmui, sullust and ds2 docking bay in the 4 first turn, on my side i had test6 going and vader was out of controlled when he came chasing down on dahgobah to make him lose a total of 4 per turn and he still hasn&amp;#8217;t deployed a battleground. He finally comes down to duel leia for test6 vader and leia duel draw 2 5’s he draws low test6 complete draw one more destiny everywhere. game win by +11

<br/>
my light vs jessie dimaurizio hdadtj duel
<br/>
ok no prob honor hits the table fast he doesn’t play no escape, he only as 2 battle location test1-6, uncontrolle fury, anger fear aggression, all of them combine with about 15 force retrival gave me another win by +27 not much else can be said i knew he play a lot of visage so didn&amp;#8217;t bother to cancel it and went to the holotable. 
<br/>
8(+65)

<br/>
darn i know his watch your step i know that my chance to win are very low. i look around i notice that the guys sitting next to me is playin massasi base operation, if only i could’ve played him... Anyway i play martin the best i could but in a battle in witch i out power him by one i have vader with lightsaber and mara jade lightsaber he as artoo and threepio, protector and patrol craft with palace raider he plays i have a very bad felling double battle damage plays artoo ihave a bad feeling no destiny he draws a 6,5,5 humm 30 battle damage forfeit vader and mara and still lose 15 force.
