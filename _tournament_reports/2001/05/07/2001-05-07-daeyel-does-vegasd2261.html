<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">So I’m late. I wrote this last Sunday night in about 3 hours, and just as I was about to submit (and I mean JUST! like 3 seconds!) my computer goes fubar. So I’m pissed and say hell with it. So I’ll do it again, only longer. So sue me. &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
As for pre tourny stuff, I didn’t know what I’d play for the DS. LS was very set. Girard told me my Profit beats would major surprise in Vegas, even though it loses to the locals. It’s your ordinary draw for 4 turns pray they don’t monnok and get Luke to power 30 something. It wrecks. I’ve been playing it since November’s Phoenix Slam. It’s my fastest deck ever. Made it in 2 hours before the Slam. That’s instantaneous. I don’t know why it works. It just does. Unless you are from Utah. DS is a different story. So I’m talkin, and some guy mentions Emergency Deployment and 40 SD. I’m like, seeing the light. So, I throw one together in the 2 weeks before the DPC. Now, 2 weeks is very fast for me. I’ll think about an idea for 3 weeks before I even start to make a deck. So this is a fast deck. &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
I don’t know how I’m getting down, cause nobody decides to make plans until the last minute, so we end up renting a car (NO AVIS, Clayton!) and driving down. We is Nathan Magro, the Utah State champ, Casey Barson, the funnest (is that a word?)guy in the world to play against (Read all the TRs!) and their friend Melissa, who is a YJ player. Turns out all 4 of us bring CD cases, I mean like the ones that hold 200 CD’s. But we only listen to one band. Aqua rocks. I need that CD. I’ll buy it tonight at work. I also pop a little Doors in, cause I’m needing the sound. I’m sorry, but put me by myself anywhere, and I’ll survive, if I have the Doors. It’s a fast trip, and I never drove. I don’t know why, I guess they heard about the last trip in Home One. At least I brought the tech plastic map of Vegas. &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
So we arrive, and we get to our hotel, and I’m not wanting to reveal tech for the DPC in the pre, so I’ve already got a mad fun deck for the DS. Basically kinda like the deck Chris Hines ran, I just drop Lando at the Casino, sabacc and then use Voyeur and Trinto Duaba to make them lose force from the used pile. Dark Path rules with this deck. LS, I threw together the same thing in an hour, but it sucked, cause LS ain’t got no Trinto. I knew it was a loser, but I had no time and didnt care. Its only for fun anwho, right? &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
So we get there, after I take the shotgun and the map for directions and suck cause I take forever to know right from left. At least we didn’t go the wrong way. I got demoted for the rest of the trip though. No more shotgun for me. 
<br/>
We get out and there is 2 shy of a riot in there. Mikey tells us we are too late and there is no room. We Utah guys are pansies and say ok. Then NorCal crew shows up, and Clayton pitches one on Girard: We drove 8 hours and we want to PLAY! So Girard says OKAY! and we all get in. I’m cool. So I get paired off vs a NorCal guy. Ohmy Fasudhani. (I can spell :)) &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 1 my LS Sabacc crap vs Ohmy Fasudhani’s Court Scum&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Ohmy won the S.F Slam last year, so I was giving him crap about being good. He tried to say he sucks now cause he don’t play anymore, but I’m not buying. He drops Jabba’s Sail Barge to the Palace turn one. I don’t get one of my 3 Lando’s in hand, so I drop GLIG1 for a quick drain. He drops Gailid to the Sail Barge turn 2, and pulls Power of the Hutt and I draw for Lando. Still no dice. I forget to drain w/ GLIG1. So much for fast drains. So he gets 15 force turn 3, to my 10. He drop more Power of the Hutt to the AC, and Scum comes down. I eat the drain, and draw for Lando. At last! So I eat the drain again, and on my turn, drop Lando, Orrimaarko and Corran Horn and CC Sabacc him. I win, he loses, and I retrieve 3. He drops Dengar and 2 Skrilling and shoots Lando. He cancels my destiny cause hes like flipped.  He gets 2 back for Scum, and I lose everyone.  I draw for Lando 2 and get him. I debate my options, and eat the drain of 6. He challenges GLIG1 w/ Zuckuss in MH, and kills it. I get no destiny, he gets 2 back from Scum, and my go. I drop Lando 2 and EPP Luke to the Casino and Sabacc. I win, he loses, I retrieve 3. I then decide to draw rather than move Luke and Lando. he still has Dengar and the 2 Skrillings there, but I think I’m ok. He drops another Skrilling and 4-Lom. No Luke for you! I lose both. I eat 8 in drains until I find Lando 3 and Obi for the little use they are. &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by 24&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 2: My DS CCT Sabacc vs Dan Collins EBO&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Dan came all the way they hell from Cleveland, Ohio, so kudo’s to him for busting out the raft over the Mississippi. His EBO set up real slow, though, and my SCrews were, well, screwing him over.  I get Lando and Lobot in opening hand, they come down turn 1, and I SCrewed him w/ my last force, and put a rebel back to the used pile. I finally get the Casino, and drop Vader and Xizor to Hoth. He kept losing to Sabaac and and then I pop Trinto on him. SCrews kept his rebels in short supply as well. Dark Path really work wonders when you get the 2 back anyway. He finally got EBO up and drained my for 3 and 7, but then I did him in.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
FW by 29&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 3: Ryan Shueller’s Court Scum vs my LS Crap Sabacc.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
This is the same deck as Ohmy played, so I’m not too confident. It’s only for fun anyway, so I don’t care. I get Lando and Boshek in opening hand, as well as the Casino, EPP Luke and a cc Sabacc. I’m doing ok. He deploys the Sail Barge like Ohmy did, I drop Casino, Lando, Boshek, Sabaac. He Grabbed it! 1st turn! Game over. He drops Mara and sword and kills them both. I’m ok, I have Lando 2 in hand, and drop him and EPP Luke and kill Mara. He dies too, though.  He says enough, drops IG, and captures Lando. I’m done.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by 25&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 4: My DS CCT Sabacc vs Tom Ercanbrack’s TIGIH&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
So I have to go to Vegas to play Tom? That’s ok, cause we never play in Utah. Since he has the TIGIH tech, he gets the fast drain on me. I get Lando out, back him up with Xizor and start driving him nuts with my manipulation. I make him activate one, Sabacc I win, he loses, I retrieve. Activate another one, sabaac, I win, he loses. He asks if I’m done so he can have his turn back :) Sorry Tom, but it’s too fun. He has me on drains and a DTF snowspeeder swarm end the Lando/Xizor threat and some more.  I draw for 3 turns (!) and eat the drains. I get Lando, Mara and Lobot down, but 2 more speeders join the rest, and I’m through.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
Full loss by 20
<br/>
So I went 1-3, but I don’t care, I had a ton of fun, got to play a Utah player I never play, and got my 2 merrejk’s I needed for the morrow.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
So we head back to the fancy Digs Casey got for us, and I have to room with Eric and Tom. We give Dan Collins a ride to his digs. He’s cool, he can hang with me anytime. I head over to Casey’s room to finish my Emergency Deployment deck, cause it’s not quite there yet. We order a pizza, and Nate looks at my deck and wrecks it. Dude, Emergency Deployment isn’t cumulative. I’m like, Oh Sht. Turns out it is, but only as long as my opponent has double my power. So much for dropping like 5 of them on him. So I’m like crap, maybe I can pull a Phoenix and make a kickass DS deck in a couple hours. So I’m like dead tired, cause I had to work Thursday night, drove down on Friday, and now it’s Saturday morning. So I go to sleep until the pizza arrives, and think about DS decks. Yes, I think about SW in my sleep. What else am I going to think about? So the pizza arrives, and I’ve decided on an Imperial deck. I go through and grab every Imperial power 3 or better. There is a lot of them. So I addd all my wimpy Palpatines (destiny 1) cause I left the good ones at home, and add all my Vaders so I can do some mad Dark Jedi Presence. I’m going to ask Girard about the ED in the AM though to CMA. Casey starts on how its late, so I wander to my room and Eric and Tom aren’t there yet. I finally crash on the floor at 2 am cause I hate beds. Casey is supposed to call me when he gets up so I don’t over sleep. I slept like a baby until 7 am when I woke up. I love my mental clock. :) I have to finish my decks and write my decklists so I shower and head out, and see Casey walking to breakfast, so I join him. Casey’s house has like good breakfast, not the donut and OJ the other crap motels have. Residence Inn is a spiffy place. So I get a sausage muffin and toast and a yogurt and a lot of apple juice. it was good stuff. I finally get over and finish my decks, but I don’t know which one I’ll play, so I write a decklist for each. Turns out Tom and Eric don’t want to play in the DPC, so I’m not sure why they came. Their loss. We head over to the T&amp;M, and find it no trouble. We wait around, and I ask Girard about the ED. He confirms Nate’s suspicions, and I’ve got a decision to make. I eventually decide that the ED deck was made for the DPC and I’ll sink or swim with it. Bad choice, as I would see. (Course, I still don’t know how the other deck would have done, but it at least wasn’t missing a key card.) Girard gets it off 20 minutes late. Closest to on time I’ve ever seen a big T go.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
 Game 1 profit vs Chris Kroutil’s Court&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Chris started Jabba and Mara in the AC, so I figured ok, Double Agent wipes. He drops Ephant Mon w/ Power of the Hutt, and then changes his mind. I’m ok, now I know I’ll need my Choke as well. I had Ben, Courage, JK Luke and Presence. I decide to draw for the rest, and set up the beats. He drops a system, Carida and Boelo to the AC. I have a Tunnel Vision in hand, and decide to get Double Agent rather than Gift of the Mentor. I drop Master Luke, and he has no action. I drop his saber, and still no action. I drop Mercenary Armor. No action. Play Double Agent, draw a 5, Mara is gone. That leaves Boelo and Xizor in the AC. I drop Ben, battle. I drop Courage, on Luke, Presence and Smoke Screen for Ben’s 6. Power is 45 to 13. It’s all over but the drains. he has me beat in the drain race, but I nail him by 23. He wasn’t too happy to lose like that, kept mentioning but for a barrier he’d have won. I asked how many barriers he had in the deck, and he said 1. 1 doesn’t cut it.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
FW by 23&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 2: my ED vs Jason Kilby’s Profit.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
I’m not sure how his Profit works, so I’m going to be careful. Brian Hunter is next to Jason, so I ask him if I should deploy 2 aliens. He looks over, and wheezes With Endor ops! NOOOO!  So I don’t. Not that I really could anyway. I deploy Merrejk to the Bunker with Ephant Mon and Perimeter Patrol.  He draws up and stays with 5 force left. next turn, he performs a 1 card beatdown. He chokes Ephant Mon! Down come Lando with Ax, Master Luke and saber, and a baragwin. He slaps Ephant wit the saber, and I lose 16 more as well as both of them. He drops 2 more baragwins, I drop a TIE at each system I have, Carida, Rendili, Corulag and Kessel. I should have dropped one at Endor instead, but it was seperate so I didn’t think of it. It would have been an extra drain of one, but I’m a scrub. Each time I drain, he loses a weapon, and baragwins it back, so I’m really only hitting him for 2 instead of 5. I’m scrambling for my Traffic control so I can put all my big ships back for ED. Guess what? I don’t have one, and my DS deck is doomed for the day. I figure that is tournament for me, but maybe I can go 4-0 w/ my Profit deck to salvage .500. We’ll see.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full Loss by 37. Yes, it was that ugly. Consolation came later when Casey lost to him by the same amount. Small consolation&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 3: My DS POS vs Jason Makohan’s BHBM&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
I got Perim Patrol out, and set up Ephant Mon at the bunker. Nobody can get 2 god draw chokes on me can they? I get Rendili and Corulag out as well. I have to draw careful though. I need my ED and my TIES, but if I draw too much, I get all my ships too.  He moves Luke over, and I drop Snoova. I also drop a TIE at Endora and Merrejk at the Landing Platform, snagging Luke. I then move into the Hut. he puts madine on CC, and sets up a force there, and then transits over to Endor from there. Since I couldnt find my Ominous, I was draining low. He dropped Lando w/ Ax, and sensed my Barrier. The second Barrier got through on Brooks Carlson, but he added Page and beat Merrejk up and 5 more.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by 24&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 4: Profit vs James Eby’s Scum&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
James is from Canada, Kudo’s for him to show up here. Scum is always a battling game, but I have the upper hand. They have to move to drain, and I get power 40 something with 2 cards. That’s always tough to beat.  he stars Mara and Xizor (WTF?) and I draw for 4 turns! He drops Ephant and Boelo to the AC, and moves mara to the Palace to get the drain of 3. I eat the drains while drawing, and he adds Snoova to Mara. I’m not worried about Mara, cause she can miss, but Snoova wrecks easy with capture. So I’ve got to get rid of him. I drop Ben, Luke and Leia and battle. I play Friendly Fire/Alter to make him lose someone, and luckily draw Boushh. So he loses Snoova! Sweet! We then get a ruling on whether I lose 2 for DODN/TINT, and I win. I lose the FF (it’s a lost interrupt) but since I didn’t alter anything, I don’t lose 2. So I’m dropping all my stuff, and just before I drop Smoke Screen, he drops ghhhk! So I keep that, but waste my Courage, Gift and Presence. At least he dropped it to soon. All that trouble, I revela my method, and he ghhks, and the AC is still full. I’m not too happy about it, but I move over to the AC and draw, getting Gift, Courage and Presence again. I’m all set again :) I play Someone who loves you to get Han free, then I FORGET TO RETRIEVE 10! Secret plans wans’t out either. He drops 3 abyssins, and battles. Luke and Ben show rolls again, I have power 60, he has power 17. He loses just about all he has. I lose Han, and scramble for Gen Solo to get my retrieval, but he draws up.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full win by 14&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 5: Profit vs. Simon Lee’s Lego Death Star. 
<br/>
he’s building himself a DS, and puts Arica undercover in the AC. He starts w/ the interrupt that gives him Jerjerrod, the DSI and an effect, so he only draws 6.I draw for ages, and realize he doesn’t have a lot of ground, so  I need Double Agent to get Arica out of the way fast. I get Double Agent, and debate whether to track to get it. I decide to go blind, and D’OH! I missed! Now my only hope to flip is Someone Who Loves You! I messed up, and somehow got thinking that Arica is a droid, so I released Han anyway and retrieved. He never challenged, and I started to draw. 3rd card down was Someone Who Loves You, and I realized I had illegally freed han. I figured it didn’t matter, cause as soon as I got the SWLY a minute later, I’d have done it anyway (Secret Plans wasn’t on table) So all is cool. He’s pinging me for 6 a turn, and I have drains and damage of 7. As we come down to the end of the game, I have Boushh at the AC, Han and Chewie, Protector at the Palace, and Arica moved over as well. Lando is at aonther Tat site (I forget which) and Luke and Ben have nabruned over to the Endor Landing Platform to drain for 3 until he got Thrawn to the Bunker and Imperial Decree out to cancel the sabers. He has Mianda and Baron in ships at Endor ant Sullust, and I lose 2 for DSII being at Sullust. He has 6 cards, 2 in hand, and I have 5 cards, none in hand, and it’s his turn. No matter what he does. He drops Battle Order so I can’t drain, and drops Xizor to the AC w/ Mara with all 4 of his force left. he battles for free, and I lose 2, as neither of us draw destiny. So now he has 4, and I have 3, but I can’t drain. But I do have profit damage of exactly 4. Whew! This was the single best game anyone has ever played against this deck, and I was able to squeeze it out. Easily my lowest differential with this deck.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full win by 3&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 6 My ED Crap vs Dan Rider’s EBO fakeout.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Dan wrote a TR, so I’ll paste his comments in here, and then give you mine so you can see how we each viewed the game.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
GAME 6 VS. A No Namer&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
Actually he has a name but I didn&amp;#8217;t catch it r write it down. He was the Deaf Guy and while this sounds insulting, it&amp;#8217;s simply the ooonly way I can explain it.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
<br/>
Well Endor Ops Vs. my 4 starships mains deck. Damn, LS doon&amp;#8217;t get no breaks. Wait, turn 2 Home OOne! sweet!. He drops 2 systems and a tie fighter at each system. I&amp;#8217;m coonfused. He&amp;#8217;s not doing SFS but he has ties? Hmm. I figure he&amp;#8217;s got some ghhk thing going so I decide to get rid of it. Instead when the Home 1 battles it sees some emergency deployment! Whawha-what! Dang. Straight up thuderflare, ISD and another TIE join the fray. I lose Melas and 6 to keep the home one alive. WTF was that! I move to Endor and decide I&amp;#8217;ll fight another TIE there.He forgets his Rumors drain bonus the whoole game so i only lose 3 force a turn from 2 drains. Not bad... He runs away from Endor so I go to the ground and beat on Vader with Luke and Han. He Emergency deploys again...twice! (no, it&amp;#8217;s not unique!) Luckily no characters. I win that battle and make him lose 14. I keep it safe and win this game tightly. 
<br/>
FW 16 Curreent 6(+5) 
<br/>
<br/>
GOOD: Whoa! My LS squeaked out a win! WTF! 
<br/>
BAD: Emergency Deployment! WTF? That is some cool shiznat. Props ges to the Deaf Guy. &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Well, I guess I’m a no namer LOL. I pulled the usual, Perim, Epahnt and Rendili. I reckon I’m in for a fight, but perhaps my surprise element will hold me in. I draw and then drop a TIE to Kashyyk ASAP. As you can see, he’s quite confused and drops the Home One with Melas piloting. Sure enough, I ED, and I’m surprised he remembered what I drew. I’m surprised I do! All of a sudden the power goes from 1 to 11 to my favor 12 to 22 when I draw a 3 for destiny and he draws a 1. He loses Melas and I lose the TIE. I revealed my DS Legendary too soon, and he pointed out he hadn’t lost a ship, so he lost Melas.  Dan, were you going to lose the Home One like I think you were? I snag ominous, and as Dan mentioned, I promtply forgot about it. That could have made all the difference. I’m such a scrub.  I need more drains, so I deploy Vader to the Endor DB. W/o Traffic, I’m drawing lots to get my ED and TIE’s, and losing the ships to drains. Such a scrub, I should have deployed them and made him come after me. So I reckon I’ll move to the Rendili DB to block the drain by the 2 guys there (Madine and a 2-2 scout). So he drops Luke, Saber, EPP Han and Tawss. I lose a hit Vader and 9 more. In the end, I think Ominous cost me the game. That would have been 10 or 12 damage, eliminating the Vader beatdown that came.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by 14. Dan says 16, perhaps he’s right.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 7: Profit vs Matt Jensen’s Agents of the Black Sun&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
I’m not too happy about this, cause Matt iss from Utah, and remember, Profit loses to Utah players. So much for 4-4. He starts w/ Snoova and Fett in the AC, and I hate Snoova, remember? Weapons miss, but that damn Snoova always captures. I draw for ages, cause I need to get a Snoova eliminator, and I can’t find any of my 2 (Choke, Friendly Fire or Blaster Proficiency) I also only got 1 of my combo cards in the opening hand, ( I think Gift) So I’m looking for all kinds of my combo cards. By far my worst opening hand ever. So he tosses all kinds of power onto the table, and when I drop Boushh to cancel his Palace drain, she turns traitor and starts kissing Hutts. I finally get my wrecking crew down, but Luke gets captured. Kinda hard to get him to power 30 something when he’s captured. I still get 2 destiny, and free Boushh (Hit her captor) Matt wins by 9 cause the Ben and Luke show got cancelled, and I have to lose Ben. Boushh is still around, but Han’s butt is still frozen. I don’t have anyone left, and I’m running. Matt takes this one going away. He admitted to being terrified of the deck, cause he’s seen it work, but he just knew what to avoid. I’m glad he enjoyed the game so much, it was a good one. So much stuff happened I really wish I could have done a turn by turn of it, but you’ve got the gist of it. I didn’t record the differential, do you remember, Matt?&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by ?&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Game 8: ED crap vs Tim McKnight’s HB&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
I could not for the life of me find a TIE, so all the ED I had were useless. By the time I get one, and deploy it, I have so many cards in hand he Grims me lost. I lose 5 of my ED (of 8) and draw. I bluff and smile as I draw, to make him think I got one, but he has none of it and comes down with Spiral, Tycho and Boshek piloting, and Wedge on Red 1. He kicks me around for 17.  I lose all 17 from hand, and still have 2 cards left! :) I run him around a little, but we both know it’s ceremonial, and I lose by a ton.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Full loss by 26&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
Well we all know who won what, so I won’t go into that, but I will say it was an awesome time, and I had an absolute blast, despite the migraine I was developing. I played Kyle’s DS deck that got smashed by Shaner w/ my Profit deck, and as Casey predicted, I got kicked. I hope that made him feel better. he’s like the 1st Non Utahn that’s ever beat it :) I got to talk to Dan Collins during the tournament, and he wasn’t doing well. I felt bad, cause it sucks to go all that way and not do well, but he said he was seeing counter and designs he’d never seen before. Hopefully he can whip up in Ohio w/ all that new tech. I also got to talk to Chu. He’s all that and more. Very mellow and no ego. I like that. We watched all the end stuff, then headed for the hotel. Congrats to Hunter for winning it all despite having the Ebola Virus and not being able to talk. I don’t remember much after that except I went to sleep and never mind what else. Ask Nathan.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Now it’s time for Slops and Props, everyone’s favorite part.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
PROPS:&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Casey Barson, for the best joke of the day. Hunter and I were talking with him, and Hunter can’t hardly say anything. Casey pipes up: You two better not play each other, cause you (me) can’t hear and you (Hunter) can’t talk.  That was the funniest quote of the weekend.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
Jason Kilby for owning Utah by 37 each &lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Nathan Magro for all the tech help on Saturday morning and the assistance in the DPC&lt;BR&gt;

Clayton Atkin for pitching one and getting us into the Pre event.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Hunter, for proving #1 is really #1&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Me for owning Canada. 2-0 lifetime. In fact, I’ve never lost to a non American. Does that mean I own the world?&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Girard for running such damn smooth events and getting his own card. Let us know when the next one is, Mike!&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Collins, Chu, Irvine and Anderson for crossing the Mississippi. Hopefully West coast gets more to RamapoCon.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>

Nathan for not playing&lt;BR&gt;

<br/>
Hunter for not shaking hands. Share the wealth! :P&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Dan Rider for forgetting my name. Or am I a no-name?&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
Jason Kilby for showing us Utah scrubs just how far we have to go.&lt;BR&gt; 
<br/>
Tom and Eric for not playing after driving that far.&lt;BR&gt;
<br/>
<br/>
I think that’s it but I’ll hit send and remember something important. Oh well. I had fun, even if I scrubbed out.&lt;BR&gt; Don’t I always?&lt;BR&gt;
