Pre-Tourney stuff:
<br/>
<br/>
   I was disappointed with both of my decks.  I could not make a Light Deck to save my life so I copied the Hidden Mains deck.  My DS Big Blue at Endor deck is rock solid.  It drains for a ton, but it has a tremendous weakness.  All you have to do is shove a big Luke on a ship, blow up the Death Star abd I lose 20 force.
<br/>
<br/>
I remade my old, pre Endor Fortman Hunt Down deck and threw in some of the newer cards.  This Hunt Down uses Vader to duel Luke and Obi-Wan and then use Counter Assault on all the nugs.  The Fortman Hunt Down was copied far and wide in Corellia and it was used extensively at Wixard World a couple years ago.  Markley changed the Star Destroyers to Dreads and called it his own when he won.  I was happy with this because it consistantly beat the Hidden Mains and every type of scout deck out there.
<br/>
<br/>
I arrived in Orland Park and the tourney was going to start late.  I played a warm up game with my Big Blue at Endor deck.  I controlled space and ground.  I was draining for between 9-11 each turn.  Then Daughter of Skywalker on Red 5 finished her journey through the DSII sectors and blew up the Death Star.  I lost 20 force and won by 2.  I sure was glad I made the Hunt Down deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
Hunt Down Fortman Style
<br/>
    vs.
<br/>
Frank Amador WYS
<br/>
<br/>
  Frank started Aim High, Superficial Damage and another crazy effect I would not associate with WYS.  I started my standard No Escape, Mob pts and IAO.  I got choke Vader and duel stick down to the Cantina turn 1.  
<br/>
<br/>
Frank POAS the Cantina and deployed Rendevous Pt. with a couple freighters one moved to Kessel.  I jumped the freighter with Zuckuss and he Hit and Run away to Tatooine.
<br/>
<br/>
I kept the slow drain at the Cantina and Visage damage going until Frank Revo’d the Theatre and dumped Melas there.  I Counter Assaulted the drain at Tatooine and Frank lost 3.  I dumped Mara at the Theatre, but couldn’t hit Melas.  My attrition cleared the site and she drained for 3 at the Theatre.
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile in space the entire LS fleet arrived and they had guns.  Quad Laser Cannons were all over the place and the Freighters tore into Zuckuss, then Bossk and Boba Fett at the same time.  
<br/>
<br/>
TK-422 hid with Mara until the Emperor zapped him and the LS Freighters spread out to Kessel, Tatooine (Revod), Corellia and the newly deployed Coruscant.
<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate insult occured when Leebo Kessel Ran between Rendevous Pt. and I started losing to Leebo.  In the end I got 2 Counter Assaults when I was supposed to be drained out of the game at Coruscant and Tatooine and I won by 7.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Fortman Hunt Down makes a successful comeback.
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Humiliated by Freighters with no pilots in space.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2
<br/>
Hunters stolen Hidden Mains
<br/>
   vs.
<br/>
Mike Stock Hunt Down
<br/>
<br/>
 Mike got Vader, Tarkin and an At-At down to the DS docking bay fast.  I got Ben Kenobi, stick and Corrin Horn down to the Tatooine DB just as fast.  We both lost to Visage each turn and Mike deployed Myoointh to search my hand each turn.
<br/>
<br/>
While he did this, I was draining for 2 at Tatooine.  Mike had to use alot of force to check my hand each turn and sometimes he didn’t drain (Battle Plan) and sometimes he didn’t pick up much.
<br/>
<br/>
All he had was Secret Plans so I was able to retreive every now and then.  I got Order to Engage out and moved Ben and Co. along with EPP leia to the DS db forcing Mike to fight.
<br/>
<br/>
Vader had a portal drop on him and my destiny was high enough to get threw the At-At.  I got Home One to Curolag so Battle Plan wasn’t affecting me.  Mike still used Myoointh to scan my hand and couldn’t drain.
<br/>
<br/>
I saw alot of Bounty hunter ships he lost early to Visage and I also saw a couple Myooinths go to.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Order to Engage along with my retreival helped me win the game by 21.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Winning even though Myoointh scanned me 4 times
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Secret Plans does nothing against Edge retreival.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
<br/>
Stolen hidden mains
<br/>
   vs
<br/>
Andy Chidester tractor beam deck
<br/>
<br/>
Andy started Fondor, Mob, IAO, and SSPFT.  First turn Andy drops Executor DB, Ozzel and Secret Plans.  Andy knows how to stop retrieval.
<br/>
<br/>
I got Ben + stick and Luke + stick out fast and drained for 4 a turn.  Andy started to deploy enmass and spread out between Kessel, Fondor and Sullest.
<br/>
<br/>
I found 3 tracked 6’s and deployed the Super Falcon to clear 2 DS Star Destroyers and pilots off of Sullest.  Andy played a few interrupts to use his tractor beam right away and all I could do was wave as the Falcon, Capt. Han and EPP Leia were captured.  I had 2 Senses in my hand but the top 3 cards were 6’s so there was no point.
<br/>
<br/>
In my greed, I forgot to leave a low number on top in case I needed to sense.  I got I Hope She’s Alright out and between the drains for 4 and Andy losing 2 to the effect I managed to pull out a close win by 10.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  Thanks to Blackviper, I managed to track 3 sixes!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  and not be able to use Sense because thanks to      Blackviper I managed to track 3 sixes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
<br/>
Fortman Hunt Down
<br/>
   vs.
<br/>
Andy Chidesters Rescue the Princess
<br/>
<br/>
Our time was tight for this game and after turn 1 we had to stop because someone else needed the hall we were in.  The TD, Eric Olson, had us running around the Civic Center like a bad Monty Python scetch.
<br/>
<br/>
First we were going to play outside, but it was raining, then we were going to play in the back of Franks Van!  I had visions of Spicoli’s Van in Fast Times at Ridgement High and said no to the Van idea.  We were then kicked out of several corners until we finally found a secure spot and some tables.
<br/>
<br/>
I had a fantastic hand before the game had to be started again and I didn’t have the same hand this time.
<br/>
<br/>
I had no Vader so I found the Reactor Terminal and drew a Vader.  Andy Signaled for Echo Base Garrison, pulled 8D8, played Lift Tube Escape to get a tube and get both tube and droid to the DS db.  
<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get Vader + duel stick down to DS db and Andy began the long slow death of losing to the Visage.  I saw a couple of locations go to the lost pile for Andy and the look on his face told me he needed those.
<br/>
<br/>
I didn’t give him any force and deployed Mara to the Yavin War Room for more drains.  I ignored Leia whenever she moved in front of me.  Andy flipped and I still ignored Leia.
<br/>
<br/>
Until he deployed a Jedi or Luke, Leia could not drain or fight so she was a liabilty.  I slowly drained when I could and the Visage choked the life out of Andy.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end, Vader and Tarkin were sitting in front of a lift tube and 8D8.  I drained with vader and Counter Assaulted my own drain!!  I drew two sixes and he had to lose 11 force and the game by 20.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs:  I managed to pull off the elusive Counter Assault of my own force drain
<br/>
<br/>
Lows:  Poor Andy was force choked the whole game and probably should have given me a harder time than I got.
<br/>
<br/>
So that was it.  I got a Sense foil and headed home after the last tournament before Tatooine comes out .  Everyone at the tournament seemed to think they would just add a por racer to their current decks and that would be fine.  
<br/>
<br/>
I don’t know, we’ll have to see Wednesday. </font></td>
