Pre Tourny stuff
<br/>
Friday I had an easy as hell day 3 spares a bio lab and a presentation of my friends which got me outta chem class so really i only had english. I ask a few friends if they wanna catch pearl harbour after school, they are all fine with it. So I go take my friends bus home (yeah i suck i have to take a bus home cause i don’t have a car stupid public transit) and my friends Colin, James, and my girl Elena are all there, so it was a talkative bus ride, except from James cause well he only says about 20 things a day. We’re going to meet everyone at the theatre at 4:30 so we have some time to kill, since Elena lives right by Colin we go over to her house and find out her boss called and she has to work, so that shrinks my posse down to 5 I beat Colin at a game of basketball well we only played Horse . So we go I beat everyone at Air Hockey and we watch Pearl Harbour pretty good movie three hours though. I win at air hockey again and we all leave, Everyone lives on the opposite side of town as me so i only have a ride to the nearest bus station.. stupid city. I get home realise I’m playing QMC all wrong so i toss together a WYS beatdown which should work fine, talk to some people on AIM and ICQ until 1 in the morning and go to bed. The next afternoon i wake up and it’s raining, and i was supposed to play tennis stupid planet.. everyone’s working and me with only a job in the summer is stuck at home so I work with my WYS some more make it better and all, go on the net Talk to this girl Audra i know for a while... a long while she talks way too much, it’s even worse on the phone and realise it’s late and i go to bed. Wake up, shower ect grab the loser cruiser (bus) and go to the tournament, I get there about 20 minutes early, buy some voyager just because pull a janeway I’m not happy just like pleased onward to the games
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: Dark Surgeon vs some dude named Jonathan’s HB flip deck (that didn’t flip).
<br/>
<br/>
Ok so for my opening hand I got Coruscant DB Emperor, Vigo then some jank so that was a great start, by the end of the second turn Vigo, xizor and palpy were at the D* docking bay chillin and draining. The guy had no clue what he was doing i think, he had maybe 12 fighters and their matching pilots and well deployed them all the rendevous point and he couldn’t move them because up until maybe the 5th last turn the only systems he had out was Yavin and Bothwathi. I presence the Coruscant DB as well and drain him at each. He deploys Kessel and Tantive with Tiree. I go sweet drop a force lighting to look at my force pile 4 lom and lat damage are near the bottom so i draw up to get them (which in hindsight was a mistake cause Zuckuss and Bossk in the ships would of done fine) beatdown Tantive and it’s game.
<br/>
So really this was the one easy game I got against a scrub and I only won by 29 so a disappointment cause i drew up too many cards.
<br/>
<br/>
2 (+29)
<br/>
<br/>
Props Having that beatdown in space
<br/>
Slops having to draw 6 cards to get that beatdown
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My WYS destiny adding jank vs Martin LeBlanc’s MKOS Chevin Deck
<br/>
<br/>
Martin was the only person there who could possibly beat me everyone else sucks so it made for an interesting game. I got a half decent starting hand 2 Wedges (cause he well kicks ass), Dash, RFC, EPP Han plus some other stuff. My turn I grab the non unique DB from my res deploy it, i show wedge to grab the skate and deploy it at the DB then martin points out to me that the skate isn’t a freighter, it’s a yaught so it’s only deploy -1...gay. So I deploy a RFC to the skate as well move it up draw all but two (and got luke and a RFC) . He deployed Zuckuss in ship and 4 lom, i say @#$% fearing the worst he battles and draws only 6 total for destiny so yeah Wedge is gone. I see a great chance here i have all i need for a sweet @#$% beatdown I deploy the other Wedge to the skate show dash to pull the outrider with squass, deploy the RFC to the DB (i have dodge so no worries) flips WYS I battle he ends up losing like 9 force and i got control of space. Next turn i deploy Luke and Han and i tv from the lost pile and get chewie deploy him too so Luke is at Tat DB and Han n Chewie are at the non unique I’m all fine with a Run Luke Run and 3 destiny adders so. I’m getting drained like crazy, but i manage to track a six and on the edge for 5 plus I’m retrieving from Tat celeb now so It’s slowin things down. I notice the text on Desert Heart and say well that sucks.. so I deploy falcon from hand move luke over move them up in falcon and next turn drop em all at JP with a Merc Pilot w/ the Barge there (as well i deployed Mirax and Melas here this turn. So i moved Han and Chewie in to the ACall that was there was Boelo, Chevin, Bib and Emphant Mon. He does some shuffling around but doesn’t do anything, so I"m confused and all. And i hear the judge yell 15 minutes left.. I figure this will be enough time. i battle at the AC RLR and play Don’t get @#$%y, Rug Hug and Life Debt, then think dude this is MKOS he has Wounded Wookie...so he plays it I slice Emphant and use Mess to make him lost I clear the site but lose chewie cause he drew a Wounded Wookie and the destiny on that was crazy with MKOS so I also managed to trounce the merc pilot w/ mirax and melas . So we’re going at it with both of us draining each other and time is called, I couldn’t do much no on the edge cause it was oop so here’s how it went I had 8 he had 16 so that sucked. I found out during lunch that people watching saw him retieving 3 w/ scum instead of two, but i didn’t notice it and well he probably thought i had DTF on table so i guess it’s my own fault. Plus I lost Aim High twice from my hand for stupid reasons.
<br/>
2(+13)
<br/>
<br/>
Props: Not losing to Martin by 30 something like everyone else does
<br/>
Slops: not noticing the scum thing and taking so long to play i guess.
<br/>
<br/>
So we go for lunch I go to New York Fries grab a poutine, and Martin Mike and I sit and talk, bout everyone else sucking, Klepy  waiting for 20 minutes in line at KFC plus other stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: WYS beatdown vs Mike Smyth’s BHBM TIE deck
<br/>
<br/>
So I ended up playing Mike he sucks so i’m fine. I got Wedge, Dash, RFC and Han again starting hand so I guess I’m lucky. I pull the whole Non Unique DB thingy and Wedge, RFC and the Skate, only one problem i forget to move it up (which later is a good thing) and  leave a few force. He deploys DS612 and black2 to tatooine and Im like are you sure you want to do that cause he’s gonna die, and he’s like yeah so I go ohhhhk and he lets me go. I’m getting crazy force cause he has Endor and Endor DB out so that’s more he’s giving me, so I deploy dash and the outrider (from res cause of squass) as well as EPP Han and EPP Luke to the outrider for fun sakes flip WYS, I battle play Don’t Get @#$%y he only ends up losing 12 force (stupid forefit), but it was all in good fun I lose luke  cause he had palpy + power to get a destiny as well i can deploy him from lost so. I move Wedge, RFC and the Skate up. He deploys another TIE w/ a pilot at endor and lets me go (i have no clue what he’s doing) I deploy Luke to the DB hoping that the two vaders i got rid of were it, but i was wrong next turn vader comes down and moves to the D*2 to soon meet palpy. Now here is what kills me (points wise) I declare I’m putting down Honour and Battle plan and I do then i say no wait I’ll take back battle plan he complains saying that i deployed BP first and well the Judge looked up all the last action jank in the CRD glossary n stuff this took 10 minutes before he decided to just let me take back BP. He really can’t touch me after this but once again Time is called, very gay so i on the edge Han and i was 100% sure i had a 6 tracked but noooooooooooooooo it was a 4 so that sucked.
<br/>
Tie + 20
<br/>
3 (+33)
<br/>
Props: Mike for sucking
<br/>
Slops Mike for @#$%ing about the battle plan and taking away 10 minutes in which i coulda won
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 Dark Surgeon Vs Mike Smyth’s RST
<br/>
<br/>
So this is gay i had to play him again, but well I was playing Dark Surgeon i couldn’t lose so i was fine. I got palpy in starting hand again (I have 5 so i usually get him) He piles up people at the Landing site so I end up putting Palpy, Xizor, Snoova, and a Vigo there and Iggy to the landing site so i can start using sniper to capture someone and put the rest in his used. He makes the mistake of putting General Solo and General Lando up in GS1 @ Endor with me having Guri Stinger, Bossk in bus and Zuckuss and 4 lom in hand a Vigo too for forefit. I drop The Bus Stinger w/ Guri and the vigo for the first round Han dies.. but he doesn’t move, I take a peek at my force pile notice a lateral damage 2nd card down i draw up for it and get a big @#$% grin on my face. He’s scared of landing so Lando and GS1 stay up there cause hes stupid or something. Next turn i drop Zuckuss, 4 lom and Lat Damage the falcon he gets killed for like 19, but the bastard is still going. His next turn he deploys 2 charges and some dude who adds to the blowing up the bunker thing, EPP obi plus the epic event moves the two into the bunker, I for somereason think nothing of it. The next turn he blows my bunker but this didn’t help him much cause in the end i still won by 23.
