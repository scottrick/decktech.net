<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pretourny:
<br/>
After preparing my decks for ovber a week (note: we have a monthly tourny).I was pretty confident that my light deck shouldn´t be stopped to easy because manipulators aren´t that popular here.For light I was playing Hidden Mains beatdown with destinny adders and tripple damage card, but played more characters than in other versions to stop early drains ( I added EPP Obis and EJP Landos ).The deck was pretty much set and now I needed only a good dark deck.
<br/>
I had to decide between MKOS and AOTBS.
<br/>
After posting the MKOS deck a few days before the tourny i hoped to get some advice from the decktech members, but as usual there were only reviews like "Skrillings are better than Abyssins" or "good deck" so i ahd no clue what to add or take out.
<br/>
The deck was solid but i was not sure how it would work if the drains get shut down with Menace Fades and stuff so I decided to play AOTBS with SAC and Hidden Weapons + 2 Jodos.
<br/>
So after arriving in Munich I borrowed a third Emperor from a friend and I was set.
<br/>
Before the tourny I did some trading and suddenly a guy from the last tourny arrived and said that he got a foil jedi Luke from the last tournies prize support where he got last place (note: He buyed Refl.1 afterwards and got a foil Ben, a foil DVDLOTS and a normal Óbi Wan, lucky guy).
<br/>
I still needed a Luke so I traded with him and gave him a lot of ECCs and EJPs and some cash since he is still a newbie and needs the stuff.
<br/>
So finally our TD arrives and the tourny starts.
<br/>
<br/>
My Decks:
<br/>
<br/>
dark - AOTBS with SAC/Hidden weapons and 4 ships.
<br/>
<br/>
light - HB-beatdown
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1
<br/>
<br/>
My light vs. Adam Polkinghorne´s (form Australia; 1588) ISB
<br/>
After seeing his start I hoped to play ISB-Big Blue since it is a slow deck and I had luck.
<br/>
He was setting up Piett at Executor DB and getting Merrejk and said go.On my first turns I was pretty much organizing my hand with Yoda Stew and was searching for Chewie since I had the rest of the crew on my hand.
<br/>
I grabbed his Command and played Grimtash afterwards in hope to get a few Outer Rims but did´t get any.I got the Grimtash back with Onee Ta but still didn´t get any one turn later.
<br/>
At that point he had set up Executor wioth Ozzel, Avenger with Chiraneau and Dengar in Punishing One at Sullust.After
<br/>
deploying more guys to the Executor he moved Avenger and Dengar over to Kessel and now it was show time.
<br/>
On my turn I grabbed Falcon with Life Debt Deployed Frozen Assets and the fully loaded Falcon to Kessel initiated a battle with triple card and added 8 destinies.Game Over.
<br/>
 FW + 28
<br/>
 2 (+28)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning so fast and playing someone from Australia#!!!
<br/>
Lows: He had no Main Course.
<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we did some trading and I got my first Rug Hug, that was cool cause I wass searching the whole time for that card.This guy had cool collection including several good Japanes cards like Trample and much more.He said that he played Main Course in his other deck and I dunno what had happened if he had played this deck.
<br/>
So I watched the game between the last tourny winner Holger Schulz and LJulian Konrad, where Holger won with his Testing deck against Julians Skrilling.
<br/>
Ston Pile getting cards like S&amp;D was too much.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 
<br/>
<br/>
My dark vs. Alex´s (14??) Hidden Base with weapons
<br/>
Hm I had seen this deck last week and knew that Luke in space will mean that I could win so let´s see.
<br/>
I was setting up qick with getting out Broken Concentration, S&amp;D and controliong both Battle Groun DBs with my guys (Presence on Couruscant DB).
<br/>
Meanwhile he had flipped and prepared a Kessel Run, cause I was hurting him bad with my drains.
<br/>
I Set For Stunned his Ralltiir freighter Captain and his Run was gone.
<br/>
After that I deployed my ships and found his HB which was Endor pretty fast.From now on the game was pretty much over.
<br/>
He got a direct damage of 7 a turn + a few drains in space and after the final battle where his Luke got Set for Stunned he was done cause he has a weapon was on Luke´s ship.This was another quick game so I´m sorry when you think there´s a lack of detail but I was the first to be ready after every game in the whole tourny so it´s not my fault.Between we played last week and he was using Profit with Portals so I was pretty glad that he was using this deck.
<br/>
 Fw + 27
<br/>
 4 (+55)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: It was a good game and winning is always a High.
<br/>
Lows: None.
<br/>
<br/>
SO like last game I watched some other games (note: all people here do that so let´s say all are scouting) to see how Adam´s WYS lost o Willi´s TDIGWATT.So to my surprise Willi wa sin third and I had to play Bjoern now.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3
<br/>
<br/>
My dark vs. Bjoern´s (1589) Training-deck
<br/>
We were both not very confident with this matchup but we had to play it.Somehow I was only setting up on a DB and searching my ships to get around Battle Plan buit didn´t spread out to the other one caus eI feared EPP-Beatdown.Why did I fear that???Just cause I am stupid.So finally after he had finished the first test I got Broken with T´wilek and deployed it.He altered and drew a 1.Great!I had Sensed his ICBW and my Controls were ready to be drawn up in my Force Pile.
<br/>
So my only hope at this point was to get S&amp;D and then spread out but somehow I always drew it for Sense destiny.
<br/>
Now it was time for the turnpoint of the game, the 5th Jedi Test.Bjoern had used Reactor Terminal to get his 0/7 destiny down but as he tried the test he got 2 1s and from now on he was in a very bad mood.
<br/>
He brought down spy Lando and Luke to my Couruscant DB to drain a bit.I moved over with IG and 4-Lom ready for the next turn beatdown.
<br/>
On his turn he still got more mad.After deploying Orrimaarko he still wanted me to lose force from 6th Jedi Test but I said no.my turn down comes Djas Puhr and Dengar.
<br/>
Battle, cancel Landos text.Luke takes a swing at 4-Lom but I play Swith Off.Luke gets captured by IG and btoh others get shot by tracked 5s.He still draw a 4 so he only had to loose one more force.Had I tracked another 6 I would have been able to Set For Stun Lando and caused a loss of 5 force.After that I managed to Monnok his On The Edges and he just didn´t want to play any longer and drew up saying that he can´t play all the time and won´t play in tournies any longer.I gave him the Chiraneau I promised him for playing in the tourny and he was feeling a little bit better.
<br/>
 FW + 24 
<br/>
 6 (+79)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: 2 1s on Jedi Test.
<br/>
Lows: I know that Bjoern is a better player and he just had bad luck, but winning when the opponent draws up is never great.
<br/>
<br/>
I felt pretty bad after this game and just wanted to end the tourny as fast as possible.So the next game is:
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4
<br/>
<br/>
My light vs. Julian Konrads (1696) MKOS
<br/>
He was pretty angry after losing to Holger and this game was the shortest one of the whole tourny.We both setted up pretty fast and he had 2 Skrillings, Gailid and Guri at the Chamber.After taking some drains I was set but had to win without trippled damage so I deployed the crew to Desert Heart after Frozen Assets came down on his Force Pile.
<br/>
Nabrun Leids over, battle, Swing and Blaster Profiency Guri and 10 destinies are too much.
<br/>
 FW + 32
<br/>
 8 (+111)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Winning the tourny for sure.
<br/>
Lows : Julian for losing to Holger.Shame on you!!!
<br/>
<br/>
Since this one was pretty short we watched the last game between Bjoern and Willi Laturner:
<br/>
<br/>
Willis Y-Wing Ebo vs. Bjoerns Trooper Ralltiir
<br/>
Normally this game would have been more easy for Willi who had gone 3-0 so far but after getting no guys and ships for 2 turns he was pretty much f.ucked.In a normal game Willi would have been able to drain for over 12 force on his third turn but he had bad luck so Bjoern was able to drain on ground and set up S&amp;D and flipping.
<br/>
After getting 2 systems the game was pretty much over because of Imperial Decree.In this game the Ice storms didn´t help him.Full win for Bjoern
<br/>
<br/>
So the final standings are as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
1. me 8-0(+111)
<br/>
2. Bjoern Schmale 6-2
<br/>
3. Willi Laturner 6-2
<br/>
4. Max ??? 6-2
<br/>
5. Adam Polkinghorne 4-4
<br/>
6. Julian Konrad 4-4
<br/>
<br/>
I dunno about the rest cause I din´t write it down but there were 6 other people left.
<br/>
<br/>
