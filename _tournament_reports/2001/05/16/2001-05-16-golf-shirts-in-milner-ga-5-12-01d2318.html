<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, Trevor Bradley and I had heard about these tourneys in a small town called Milner. We didn’t expect turnout to be huge, or the competition to be fierce, but we wanted to test our decks a little bit, and we were tired of playing against each other. Trevor went with the decks he had been using for a couple of weeks; QMC generals, and musicians; but I decided to change my dark deck to a huntdown deck like Hoostino’s, but kept Hidden Mains for light side. Anywho, exactly 8 people showed up, but most were younger people, and the tournament was to be 4 games. Onward.
<br/>
<br/>
Light Side - Hidden Mains
<br/>
Dark Side - Huntdown
<br/>
<br/>
Game One - LS vs Younger guys MKOS
<br/>
He starts off by putting gay Jabba, Scum, and Gailid to the chamber turn one. I got an interrupt heavy draw, so I just go get Dagobah and the Hut, plus the Home One: Docking Bay, and draw. He drains for 2, pulls Boelo and draws all but one signaling he has a barrier. I drop Oune Ta incase of None Shall Pass, plus I’m holding Desperate Reach, so I should be able to do mad damage this turn. I drop Ben Kenobi, his Saber, and Lando with Ax. He does indeed barrier, which I Reach. I then fight, swing and hit Jabba, then play Blaster Prof. to make him lost, then I exclude Boelo. I only draw a 3 and a 1 for destiny, but he still has to loose Gailid and 10 cards. His hand is only 2 cards now, so I spread the characters, and draw all but one because I have a barrier. He tries to stay in the game, but I get in a couple of drains of 3, and once I set up the Falcon at Corulag, Battle Plan keeps him from doing much. When he is almost dead, I track a couple of 6’s and edge back my lost pile, and win by 31.
<br/>
FW +31
<br/>
2(+31)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Mostly everything, mostly.
<br/>
Lows - Crushing this young mans dreams of winning.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 - DS vs Another Young guys Hidden Base X-Wings.
<br/>
I hadn’t seen this deck in forever, and I assumed he was either mains or matching pilots, so I didn’t monnok him on turn one like I should have. I just pull Carida and the Exec: Docking Bay, and draw. He pulls Corulag and puts 2 x-wings there, so I know what I have to do to win. I put Vader with Saber at the Death Star Docking Bay to flip, and draw for Twi’lek and/or Search and Destroy. I finally get it and put Veers and some other randomites at the CC: Docking Bay. He finally flips, but I use Chimaera and Thrawn to probe, and get it in 2, but he gets a couple of turns of mad drains off before the direct damage eats his deck and I win by 18.
<br/>
FW +18
<br/>
4(+49)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Search and Destroy for being so good.
<br/>
Lows - His 2 turns of flip, and the drain of 3 at Kessel.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After this game, Trevor and I are both undefeated, and when they pair, we are playing the same side, so we could possibly both go undefeated. Nice.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 - LS vs. The only other guy here over 18’s ISB.
<br/>
I hope this isn’t Big Blue, cause I hate playing Mains against that, but when he deploys the death start docking bay, Suba(I think???), and tactical supports for 3 troopers, and deploys them for free, I know I can own him with Fallen Portal. I keep a mental note to not put any ability 2 scrubs with my Jedi in fear of Stunning Leader, and proceed to play my game. I set up the super Falcon at Corulag, and put Obi and Luke at my CC: Docking Bay (NOT interior), and get Menace Fades and Battle Plan up. He eventually puts Vader and 5-6 trooper scrubs in front of my 2 guys. I have Fallen Portal and Throw Me Another Charge (first time I have ever needed this for such a situation) in hand if I want to wait for him to battle me, but I also have Sorry About the Mess and Blaster Proficiency if I want to take it to him. The Order to engage in my hand sways my decision to attacking him, and making him battle me again with whats left over or loose 3. Sooooo I clash Vader, and initiate. He plays Trooper Assault, and I Throw Me Another Charge it (HA!). I swing and hit 2 of his 5 guys, and he draws under my immunity, while I draw a 3. His power is 10, mine is 14, so he still has 2 guys left over when it’s all done. He moves the troopers, and looses 3 to order to engage. I drain him and play a Fall of the Legend, and say done. He doesn’t have anybody to back up Vader (now unclashed) so he looses 3 more to OTE and moves away. I activate to the 6, edge for 5, and drain him down to about 10. He does around 3 more damage before I kill him, and I win by 26.
<br/>
FW +26 
<br/>
6(+75)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs - Throw Me Another Charge used to cancel Trooper Assault
<br/>
Lows - None, I controlled the games pace.
<br/>
<br/>
Well Trevor and I are still undefeated, so we are hoping to take first and second.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 DS vs. same little guy from game one’s Agents
<br/>
I deploy Vader to the Death Star Docking Bay turn one, and I’m done. He drops Kabe, and pulls Tessek with You Will Take Me To Jabba now, and pulls Bo Shuda. I put Mara and Saber at the CC: Docking Bay, and draw a couple. He deploys some Chadra Fans at various places, and draws. I decide it will probably be easier to just drain him and Visage him to death, than it will be to fight, so I just draw for Vader’s Saber, and get the Chimaera and an Imperial Command in the process. On his turn, he drains for 4, and deploys the cantina, and 3 chadra fans there as well. At the end of his turn I go get Thrawn with Command, and on my turn, I drain for 3 (still don’t have Vader’s Saber) and deploy the Chimaera + Thrawn to Carida and put out Battle Order. He is only generating 11, so if all he does is pay to drain, I should win by about 18-20 or so, which will probably be enough to win the tourney. He pays for the drain of 3 at the cantina, and draws. I drain for 4 (still no GD saber) and draw a few as well (finally getting the saber).He drains me for 5 this time, leaving him 4 force to play 4 more chadra fans, and then he Nar-Shadda’s for about 12 or 13, and I didn’t have secret plans out (but I did have SSPFT, woohoo). Well now, I need to beat him off at least one of the sites, and there are 3 in the desert, 3 at Tatooine: Jabba’s Palace, and 7 (yes 7) at the Cantina. So I decide to go for the Palace. I deploy Ozzel, Veers, First Strike, and fight. He draws a 4 to add to his power, and a 4 for destiny. I play Command, and draw two tracked fives. My power 15 to his 19. I loose Ozzel, and he looses everybody. The rest of the game is me draining him for 8 (Chiraneau on the Chimeara), and him draining me for 5. I win in the end by 19.
<br/>
FW +19
<br/>
8(+94)
<br/>
<br/>
Highs - My high dif for a 4 game tourney.
<br/>
Lows - Not drawing Secret Plans before he did his huge retrieval.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well Trevor won as well, so we took first and second. We gave our prizes to the younger guys, and left for home. All in all it was fun, but I doubt we will go back because it just really wasn’t that challenging, and we just got lucky not to face each other. Hopefully I will be able to go up to Atlanta in the next couple of weeks.
