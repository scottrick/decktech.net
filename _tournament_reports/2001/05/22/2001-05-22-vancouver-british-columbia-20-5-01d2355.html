<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Pre-tourny goo: Ok, so I am up late testing my decks with my buddy Mr. No-Cheeze, so I am pretty tired.  Needless to say I got my a.ss handed back to me in all the games, so my sense of self-confidence is severely crushed, but whatever.    
<br/>
   So even though I am a two-hour drive from the tournament I still get to sleep in because it doesn’t start until 12:30.  For this tournament, because I feel like being un-original I am playing a tweaked version of Raveling SYCFA TIEs for dark and my Profit Mains for light which has gone un-defeated for the past 3 tourneys. 
<br/>
   So, when I get to Hyperlight I buy a pack of R2, get some pathetic garbage not woth talking about, so I’ll shut up.  Ok, on to the junk that people read. 
<br/>
<br/>
Game One: Vs. Ellis Kwok
<br/>
My TIE Shoot-em Up vs. Hidden Base X-wings Flip.
<br/>
He starts with DODN/WA, YISYW, and something else.  I start Secret Plans, TINT/OE, and Mob.  Points.
<br/>
   I get a great starting hand, with Sienar Fleet Systems, Sullust, 3 TIE Interceptors, Emperor’s Shield, Main Course and All Power To Weapons.
<br/>
   I grab Wakeelmui and play SFS there. I grab DS War Room and deploy it and deploy an Interceptor to the DS Docking Bay.  I draw up and get a TIE gun, Fighters Coming In and Relentless Pursuit.  So next turn I can hold a system with just one of my TIEs.  And I’m activating a ton. 
<br/>
   On his turn he deploys Mantellian Savrip, Kessel, and five X-wings to Rendezvous point and moves them to Sullust. 
<br/>
On my turn I deploy The Shield and one Interceptor with TIE laser.  I battle, shoot down one of his X-wings and play All Power To Weapons.  He doesn’t play Organised Attack, so I’m happy.  He ends up forfeiting Chewbacca of Kashyyyk from hand.  Damn! I am so stupid I forgot about Savrip! 
<br/>
   So on his turn he deploys two systems from hand and one from deck.  He then deploys Haven to Sullust.  He brings out Independence and Defiance and five X-wings.  I take a beating for about 14 force and he just forfeits some scrub from hand.  Then he moves his ships to Kessel and Kiffex.   
<br/>
   So, things are looking very bad for me, but I battle him a few times and make him lose to his own Draw Their Fire and retrieve when I deploy the TIEs.  I shoot down almost all of his X-wings and at this time I am draining him for 2 at Kashyyyk and he is draining me for 3 at Kessel and 2 at Kiffex, but I am canceling the Kessel drain with Dreaded Imperial Starfleet with my Interceptors. 
<br/>
   So we are draining for the same amount but he has more life force.  We drain each other for a few turns, not wanting to spread out for fear of getting beaten down. When I have only 3 force left in my Life Force and he has six I FINALLY realize I can make him lose 8 force by controlloing Sullust and cancelling Haven.  So I do that and win by 4 force. 
<br/>
<br/>
FW by 4
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Playing Ellis. He’s great fun to play against.
<br/>
Lows: Me being a stupid scrub who is blind and doesn’t read his cards properly.
<br/>
Ugly: See above.
<br/>
<br/>
Game Two: Vs. Ellis Kwok again.
<br/>
My Profit Mains vs. his Abyssin Court weird thing.
<br/>
<br/>
He starts All Wrapped Up, Secret Plans, and You Cannot Hide Forever.  I Start with Aim High.  That’s right.  Just one effect.
<br/>
   For his 2 aliens that he gets he chooses Mighty Jabba and Fett with gun.  I get another great draw: Ben, his sabre, his Journal (tech), Master Luke, Chewie Protector, two Tunnel Visions, and a Sense.  God draw.
<br/>
   So, I activate my 6 force and Tunnel vision for a Blaster Deflection.  There is nothing else in there I want so I save the other Tunnel Vision.  I lose a force to Court.  On his turn, he deploys Chall Bekan and Boelo to Audience Chamber.  I deploy Ben, Luke, Chewie, and battle him in the Audience Chamber.  I chop Chall, choke Jabba, and draw a 5 to his 1.  I clean out the site. 
<br/>
   Now he deploys some Abyssin scrubs to the Cantina. After I release Han I spread out and drain him to death in about 3 turns.  Nothing else of interest happens.
<br/>
<br/>
FW by 27
<br/>
4 Viectory Points +31 Differential
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: The insane starting hand I got.
<br/>
Lows: None
<br/>
Ugly: See "Highs"
<br/>
<br/>
Game Three: Vs. Kevin Wan 
<br/>
This will be a cool game, because Kevin is a great opponent and he’s hilarious. Plus, he fears me!
<br/>
OK, so it is my TIEs vs. his MWYHL training Luke to Test 6.
<br/>
<br/>
This game was pretty un-eventful, but by turn three I had tracked one of my systems and I overloaded Luke’s Lightsaber, blowing Luke to bloody little chunks and giving Yoda some stew-making material.  That slowed Kevin down a bit. On my turn before he completes Test 5 I deploy CHYBCoward and cancel his retrieval. After he stacks a 7 on Test 5 he brings a Super Falcon with Corran aboard and battles me. Hmmm... since I just lost my Flawless marksmanship of my deck to a drain, I’ll have to draw a 6, and even if I do he will still play A Few maneuvers, since he has a ton of them in his deck.  So I got that sh!t pounded out of me and that pretty much ends the game.
<br/>
I get in a few more drains and I finally lose from Test 6 eating me alive.
<br/>
<br/>
FL by 9
<br/>
4 Victory Points +22 Differential
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Blowing Luke up! "Hey Yoda; why is my lightsaber shaking like this?" "Touching my things you should not be, now give it back!"  Ok, I will admit, that made less than no sense. In fact, it made anti-sense! 
<br/>
Lows: Losing something like 25 force from one battle
<br/>
Ugly: Uh... Me? lol
<br/>
<br/>
Game Four: My Profit o’ Doom vs. Vincent Lee’s Hunt Down Dueling 7’s. This game was over on my second turn pretty much. He deploys Darth Vader with his Lightsaber and Lietenant Cabbel. I deploy Ben. Surprise surprise! He plays Circle. I play Armed and Dangerous to grab Ben’s Stick.  So we both have sabers and I’m 7 to his 6. We draw destiny. I draw 3 and 4. He draw..... 2 sites! So, Vader bought the farm and then Ben got to beat on Cabbel. He loses another 9 force. Now he deploys Back Door, Fprest Clearing, and some other drain-two site and starts draining me like mad.  I go and free Han and then I finally outdrain him, but not after taking quite a beating in force loss.  
<br/>
<br/>
FW by 9 force
<br/>
6 Victory Points +31 Differential.
<br/>
<br/>
Highs: Obi spanking Vader for being bad.
<br/>
Lows: Getting drained for so much.
<br/>
Ugly: Him blind-dueling Obi and drawing 2 zeros.
<br/>
<br/>
So Kevin Staley takes first place.  I come in fourth and I get the random draw for the foil Sense, so I’m happy. Can’t remember what anybody else came in, sorry. 
<br/>
<br/>
Props: 
<br/>
-Roxanne for being the TD and for providing us with a place to play.
<br/>
-Mr. Sagan for letting me borrow one of his Harvests and not beating me for forgetting to give it back, AGAIN.
<br/>
-Kevin for being the hilariously disturbed person he is.
<br/>
-My mom for giving me a ride to the tourney.
<br/>
-Anyone I forgot, please, I beg forgiveness.
<br/>
<br/>
Slops:
<br/>
-Kevin for not turning his hat sideways to say "Tech"
<br/>
-Me for being the stupid scrubby chump that I am.
<br/>
-Brian for having to work and not coming to the tourney. ;)
<br/>
<br/>
And now, my own section:
<br/>
<br/>
Things to think about-
<br/>
-Cheating is tech. jk
<br/>
-"Gooey" can be said in many different way meen many different things.
<br/>
-It’s impolite to grab things.
<br/>
-Any deck with Tech M’or or Rebel Tech is totally teched out.
<br/>
-Jawas are the evil.
<br/>
-There is a common thread between Obi-Wan Kenobi, Gandalf and Jesus. They all died and were re-born in an even more powerful form.
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to read this. It is my first Tournament Report, so if I have done anything wrong just let me know. Later.
