<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">I realize it’s in a little late but i just got a computer and am ready to join tech full force.  If I confuse any details or alter actual events please forgive me.  First I need to set things up a bit.  I was formerly one of the top ranked players in IA., but when the new set came out( D.S.2)I entered a bit of a slump and began losing to players( no offense here ) I used to count as easy wins.  Damned Seinar Fleet Systems, cheese, monkey, cheat, copied, well you get the point, tie decks!!!  I was stubborn and thought I could win without changing my decks much.  I was wrong.  So on to what I would play in the state tournament.  A non-objective decree big blue for the dark side,  and a new to me, TIGH scots deck for the light.  I had been able to test the decks with my friends here in Webster City( side note: I almost said on my friends and realized immediately that some of you would twist it in un-natural ways ) and found them to work well for me.  With last minute adjustments, I would be on my way.  My fellow players here, by the way, in case they are not mentioned elsewhere are Dan, Jared, and Rob.  Thank-you guys sincerely for helping me improve and improving so much yourselves.  I will get to the games now and since this is my first report ( Decktech virgin ) please be easy on me and give suggestions.  Forgive my fuzzy memory.

<br/>
Game 1: My light TIGH vs. Casey Hughes dark non-obj. ( sneaky people scare me ) imperial city start
<br/>
I start with Shocking Revelation for grimtash, Strike Planning, and Do or Do Not/ Wise Advice.  He starts mob points, Iao, and weapons sac effect.  I almost lost quickly because he was playing quarens ( or whatever their name is ) which let him drop guards wherever with force pikes for cheap nasty beatdowns.  I got the drain race edge early because he had no coruscant battle-grounds.  I got confident and spread out.  Bad move.  Those nasty red devils with plenty of pikes punched me in the gut for about ten cards on top of clearing the site, ouch.  The irony is that i had grimtash the turn before and decided not to play it; he would have lost his entire hand and probably the game early had i played it lost.  I was able to spread out just enough to stay ahead in the drain race, ( I ran like a chicken until later in the game before I battled )and it didn’t hurt either when I did hit him for about 5 cards later with grimtash.  I won by like 5 cards and went to game two under the radar.  Casey is a realy cool inventive player who builds original stuff and I hated beating him first game like that, but thats the breaks.( actualy I never hate beating anyone and would always prefer to win, but if I did hate beating certain ones Casey would be one of them ) Casey told me that states would be his last Star Wars tourney and I beg him to reconsider.  He brings something rare to the game today, imagination and style.
<br/>
Game one: full win by close to 5
<br/>
<br/>
Game two: my dark vs. Shannon’s ( forgot the last name )light mining colony baragwain retrieval with counter assault and characters that react away from battles as well as interrupts.
<br/>
I start with Hoth, Secret plans, Mob Points, and imperial decree.  The game was realy over before it began, unfortunately.  I drew Chimera, Chiraneau, Admirals Orders ( the one that subtracts 2 from power of starships that do not come to play in capitol/fighter pairs, great for swarms )and a cheap star fighter.  Oh yeah choke Vader went to cloud city lower cooridors to play as well.  One of the first things he did was to put an Arcona with vader to stop my drains and react from battles.  I realized how irritating this would get so I went for first strike with twilek and deployed it.  Now to continue his tactics would retrieve a force for me and lose one for him every time I battled ( better than a drain ).  Because I had been draining in space with a big ship and the stud chirineau, as well as a solo choke Vader on the ground surprise assault never was an issue.  He did come once to play in space but got lat. damaged and did not want to play anymore.  Shannon was cool though.  Lack of practice is his downfall.
<br/>
Game two: full win by about 25
<br/>
At this time I know I will have a difficult third game and am nervous.  Remember I have been slumping and although runner-up the year before entertained no notions of repeating.
<br/>
<br/>
Game three: my dark with same start vs. Blake’s ( a.k.a. Hoss ) TIGH scouts, strike planning, Inssurection, staging areas
<br/>
I was not going to the ground to get beaten or converted early so I set up in space and waited with Vader and Tarky for late beatdown.  It never came.  My decree shut midge’s drains down, and chiry got drain happy in space.  He did spread out, though, and made it very close with the help of search and destoys light-side counter-part.  That card, by the way, for those of you who don’t know what tit does, ( several times I have read reports and blanked on a card function, because, I don’t happen to use it, and cursed my ignorance )causes 1 force to be lost each draw phase unless opponent has a main character, destiny less than four, at a battleground site.
<br/>
Game three: full win by about 5
<br/>
<br/>
Game four: we switch sides my scouts take on his disguised tie retrieval/numbers deck with imperial occupation to start Raithal and sand troopers were the game plan
<br/>
Very tricky indeed.  I had learned earlier not to lose with a grimtash in my hand so I played it early.  One word describes what happened to my poor opponent, ooooouch.  Eleven cards went bye-bye.  Ties, and troopers, and interrupts, oh-my.  I spread out and drained.  He made a run late so I only won by a few.
<br/>
Game four: full win by about 15
<br/>
Wow four and 0
<br/>
Game 5: my dark vs. Isaac from Iowa city’s light he was playing elom rep deck obj.
<br/>
I can’t realy do the game justice with a description but the subtleties were there and it was very close.  To some it up decree saved me again.  I drained for more in space than his drains and retrieval and excellent play could keep up with.  We both worked hard for this one and I was glad to come away with it.
<br/>
Game 5: Full win by 3, maybe.
<br/>
Five and 0 and in my hands.  A win puts me in the finals a loss and it tis anybodies game with about for or five people close.  Perhaps the closest being Seth Van-winkle.
<br/>
<br/>
Game six: We switched my light vs. BHBM classic Gvs.E I had same start he had universal BHBM start
<br/>
He got Vader down to endor d.b. right away.  I walked over on turn to or three and used Luke’s text to send Vader to throne room.  He wisely did not duel because it would be my advantage and Vader was rendered useless.  His twist was tie bombers with bombing runs.  I couldn’t spread out because of the fear of being beaten up by crappy ties and watching Luke go evil so I chipped away where I could.  It was a sloppy game where I forgot to make him lose to his objective and he forgot to get a couple cards to stack.  It all evens out though and it turned out that his steady drain of two at Endor and control of one of my sites was just enough for him.
<br/>
Game 6: full loss by 1 
<br/>
I was sure that a loss would put me out to pasture but my diffential edged Seth’s and it would be Isaac and me, two more times in the final. 
<br/>
Unfortunately for him I knew that his light had zero space so I knew that that match up would be automatic for me.  You can guess the story.  I deployed only what I had to in order to get the maximum drain in space.  He spread on the ground and made it very close, to close, with retrieval, bargaining table and good play.  I barely won.
<br/>
1st final game full win by seven
<br/>
The second game wasn’t so automatic.  He lost Endor early to a drain.  Ties were lost to an early grimtash.  I was able to spread out fast and furious and the game was over quickly.  Isaac played as well as anyone could have played and I thank him for raising my level of play because of it.
<br/>
Now with the state championship I look forward to bigger fish in the sea.  Hope to see some of you players across the table some time.
