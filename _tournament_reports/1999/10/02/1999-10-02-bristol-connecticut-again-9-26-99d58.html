<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, another late TR from yours truly, but at least I'm still writing them
<br/>
; )  This is the usual location for tournaments for me, so me and two
<br/>
friends, Ben Read and Cody DiCara, made the trip down. For light I brought
<br/>
what turns out to be a Brentson Beatdown deck (I had absolutely no idea it
<br/>
was! I made it on my own!). Basically, it had very few character and their
<br/>
toys, but about 5 Tunnel Visions to fish out the right ones to go with the
<br/>
destiny adders I had. I think it ended up having 5 Tatooine sites and 5
<br/>
Cloud City sites, so it was slightly multi-planeted. For dark, I brought the
<br/>
same D* start with Mains and Vehicles that went 3-0 at Regionals. After
<br/>
getting there, doing some last minute trading, and finding out that Steve
<br/>
Brentson was in attendence (Yipee!), we were ready to start.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: LS vs Jeremy Dalliere's (sp?) Ominous Space
<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to play this game, because I believe that I've won every game
<br/>
against Jeremy that I've ever played. After drawing up for a couple of
<br/>
turns, he deployed Chief Retwin to my Mos Eisley for an uncontested drain of
<br/>
2, or so he thought. After eating the drain for a turn or two, I deployed
<br/>
Ben Kenobi and his lightsaber, Chewbacca, Farmboy, and EPP Han with a Beggar
<br/>
as well. Made him use 1 force to start the battle, he can't hide, and that's
<br/>
a 27 point beatdown. This was basically game, but he stayed alive by
<br/>
draining me at Kiffex until I beat up on some of his characters in the
<br/>
Cantina using the good ole' shuffle. Full win by 32
<br/>
2 (+32)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: DS vs Gregory Forester's Destiny Adding Madness
<br/>
<br/>
I had met up at Regionals, but it took us a while to remember each other. He
<br/>
starts with I Wonder Who They Found on the Hoth: Echo War Room, which was
<br/>
interesting to say the least. We got out to some early battles at the
<br/>
Downtown Plaza with both of us losing characters. Bad Feeling Have I was
<br/>
slowing him down, so I might not have felt the full force of his mains
<br/>
beatdown. I set up some drains on Endor while we were busy battling on Cloud
<br/>
City, so I was draining him for a decent amount. He eventually beat me off
<br/>
Cloud City, and here's when it got interesting. I blocked his drain at the
<br/>
DP with U-3PO, and with that being the only Cloud City site, he couldn't
<br/>
drain. He also couldn't remember if he had lost all of his Nabrun Leids, so
<br/>
he might be able to get over to Endor to beat me down, and he might not.
<br/>
After a while it became apparent that he didn't have another Nabrun, and he
<br/>
was stuck. As a last ditch effort, he put Wedge alone at my Defensive
<br/>
Perimeter with nobody else there. I tried once to Elis people over. Sense. A
<br/>
second Elis, and Wedge was gone. After that I somewhat quickly drained him
<br/>
out for the win. Full Win by 22.
<br/>
4 (+54)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: LS vs Steve Brentson's evil DS deck
<br/>
<br/>
I know that Steve's been trying to keep this deck somewhat quiet so I won't
<br/>
tell you a lot about it. I will say that it is an evil deck, and a light
<br/>
side player that is caught unaware will not stand a chance. I figured out
<br/>
his strategy somewhat quickly, but it didn't do me a whole lot of good. I
<br/>
had a drain going at Obi's Hut and at the Death Star, but Come Back You Big
<br/>
Coward killed those. By the time I occupied 2 Battlegrounds, I was already
<br/>
beaten off the D* by the Executor. I can say that I would have won if it
<br/>
hadn't been for CHYBC, but that's why Steve's as good a player as he is.
<br/>
Eventually he just drained me out. Full Loss by 9
<br/>
4 (+45)
<br/>
<br/>
I think I was in second at this point, but I'm not really sure. All I know
<br/>
is that I was really pissed off about the next game.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: DS vs Ben Read's Hidden Base
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I am going to make a little speech. I hate Hidden Base. I
<br/>
think that it can be even more abused than Operatives. In the hands of a
<br/>
fairly competent player, it can easily beat a good player if he isn't ready
<br/>
for it. The sad thing is, I was ready for it. I had 4 good ships in my deck
<br/>
+ Security Precautions, which I started. I fought him in space. I probed his
<br/>
hidden base. Bubo even munched his undercover Bothans. But I didn't get out
<br/>
all the sites I had until late in the game. So with that + light side
<br/>
Coruscant (another insanely overpowered card), I lost, even though I was
<br/>
prepared, and even though I did the right things. Full Loss by 12
<br/>
4 (+33)
<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I was quite unhappy after this game because Hidden Base,
<br/>
the most boring deck to play, and to play against, had just handed my
<br/>
undefeated Dark Side deck its first loss. So I took it out on some poor
<br/>
biker scouts.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5: LS vs John Mendes's Endor (non-objective) Biker Scouts
<br/>
<br/>
Opening hand I drew Obi-Wan, Luke, Anakin's Saber, Lightsaber Proficiency,
<br/>
Chewbacca, EPP Han, and a site (Insert hand here. Good Game John.) Big
<br/>
beatdown on a lone biker scout, especially with the Jedi Presence that I
<br/>
later drew. Full win by 35
<br/>
<br/>
6 (+68)
<br/>
<br/>
So at least I'm feeling a little better now, and I have a chance for a prize
<br/>
so I'm somewhat happy.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: DS vs Aaron Penna's Ewoks
<br/>
<br/>
This is a very good deck. It uses reacting Ewok Sentries, Ithorians,
<br/>
Nighttime Conditions and that droid, for some very powerful Ewoks. I learned
<br/>
of his reacts in the first battle that I started in which I got whooped. I
<br/>
bothered him on Endor while I set up my own drains on Tatooine (almost all
<br/>
of his characters could only deploy on Endor). Late in the game he got out
<br/>
Kazak, some Ewoks and Ithorians in places in which I couldn't get to him. He
<br/>
moved to stop one of my drains and then told me to go. I drained him for 5
<br/>
and he had one card left. Doh! If I didn't kill him this turn, he was going
<br/>
to really hurt me, and maybe kill me on his turn. I looked around at my
<br/>
options and saw good ole' First Strike. I initiate a battle where he blocked
<br/>
my drain. Retrieve one, lose one, game over. Full Win by 11
<br/>
8 (+79)
<br/>
<br/>
So I come in third behind Gregory Forester in second, and, of course, Steve
<br/>
Brentson in first. I get a cool, hardcover version of the Bounty Hunter
<br/>
Trilogy and a Boba Fett Sticker, so I'm all set. I had a blast, and all
<br/>
write y'all another TR next time I go. Later.
