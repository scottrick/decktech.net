<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">G'day all,
<br/>
I played in regional yesterday, here in Melbourne.  Let's start from the
<br/>
beginning:
<br/>
7:45am alarm goes off.  I wake up
<br/>
7:46am, step-mum comes into the room, and complains that someone rang at
<br/>
7:30.  She said that they said 'he'll be up soon anyway.'
<br/>
7:47am.  I wonder.  Who on earth could that be?  I've got nothing on today.
<br/>
The regional is tomorrow.
<br/>
7:48am.  Or is it?  Where's that letter with the details.
<br/>
7:49am. @#%$#%%^(A()#@%#@$(@*^%.  It's today.
<br/>
7:50am.  Beng calls.  He offers to give me a lift.  I say I'll get in ring
<br/>
in 5 minutes.
<br/>
7:51am.  'Hey dad, Could I please go out today?'  'The tourney's today, not
<br/>
tomorrow.'
<br/>
7:52am.  Dad says, 'OK, but I think you're mad.  You've got exams in 2 weeks
<br/>
time.'
<br/>
7:53am.  Ring Beng.  'Hey Beng, thankyou very much for calling - I'd be
<br/>
delighted to get a lift with you.'
<br/>
7:54am.  How many cards can I fit in these boxes?  I still haven't built a
<br/>
dark side deck.  I think I've got a decklist on the lapop.
<br/>
7:55am.  Get dressed
<br/>
7:56am.  Get 3 boxes (a shoe box, my anthology deck box, my 'rare' box.)
<br/>
Fill them with cards.
<br/>
7:57am.  Carry everything outside.
<br/>
7:58am.  Wait for Beng
<br/>
8:15am.  Beng arrives
<br/>
8:16am.  I get in car.
<br/>
8:17am.  I rustle through the 2,000 cards I have with me, and try and build
<br/>
a DS deck.
<br/>
8:18am.  Laptop does not have decklist.  This will make it interesting.
<br/>
8:19am.  Start looking through cards, and pulling them out.
<br/>
8:56am.  We pull up outside the joint.  I have gone through all the cards,
<br/>
and have the basics of a deck.
<br/>
8:57am.  Second pass over cards begins.
<br/>
9:00am.  Deck almost complete.
<br/>
9:05am.  Deck finished. Kev pulls up around this time too (the TD).
<br/>
9:06am.  Start filling in command card.
<br/>
9:07am.  Start filling in deck list.
<br/>
10:00am.  Games begin.
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone's interested in a copy of my DS deck, you can find it at
<br/>
http://swccg.ript.net or at decktech.net
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, my DS, vs someone from Brisbane or Sydney (sorry, forgot his name).
<br/>
He started Hidden Base, looked through his deck for the HB marker, and went
<br/>
off to fix his deck :)
<br/>
Meanwhile, in the game next to us, Derek has a 65 card deck.  Hmmmm.  He
<br/>
fixes it.
<br/>
Well, anyway, he gets started, and is really, really flustered by it all.
<br/>
Opening hand, he has Artoo + A Gift.  Also, some systems, and JP:AC and
<br/>
Obi's Hut.
<br/>
So, he plonks it all down, including Artoo to the AC.  Next, comes A Gift.
<br/>
I say 'uh uh.  Artoo needs to have just moved for A Gift.'  He reads the
<br/>
card and says 'oh.'  So, he redeploys Artoo the Hut, and then moves him in.
<br/>
He doesn't play 'A Gift.'  I think 'hmmmm.'
<br/>
On my next turn, Motti + Boba w/ Gun deploy to the AC, and then move over to
<br/>
the hut to get a quick drain in.
<br/>
His turn, during his deploy phase he tries to play A Gift.  This time I put
<br/>
greater emphasis on the 'just' bit.  He reads the card and says 'How do I
<br/>
deploy it then?'  He then reads it further, and 'oh, I see.  It's an
<br/>
Immediate Effect.'  Anyway, a couple of other 2/2 guys (possibly including
<br/>
Kal Falnl) come to the Hut, battles, I shoot one, draw a high destiny, and
<br/>
he draws a 0.
<br/>
Few turns later, Artoo goes back to the Hut, after Motti died, Choke Vader
<br/>
comes, gets a glowstick, and slices and dices.  Boba might have died too,
<br/>
actually, thanks to EPP Obi.  But EPP Obi is no match for Choke Vader +
<br/>
Glowstick + Tarkin + Destiny rig.  So I take control, drain for 4 a few
<br/>
times at the Hut, before Artoo finally gets back inside to the AC to become
<br/>
a Gift.  On my turn immediately after that I ask him if he wants to move
<br/>
Artoo, he does, and I move Vader + Tarkin to the AC (a drain of 3 instead).
<br/>
On his next move phase, he goes to move Artoo, I say 'no, undercover spies
<br/>
move during the opponent's turn.'  He asks why, I say 'cause it says so in
<br/>
the rules, and proceeds to read Artoo + A Gift for a few minutes.  That
<br/>
puzzled me, but I was draining for enough at the AC.
<br/>
Some time during all this the Tantive 4 deployed to the Death Star, but I
<br/>
deployed CHYBC and that stopped him from draining there.  'Da Bus' (as I
<br/>
entered it on my decklist) and Blizzard 1 were in orbit of Tatooine, and
<br/>
apart from a little resistance here or there, it was a comfortable win to me
<br/>
by 25 or so force, with an additional 12 cards in hand.  I drew far too much
<br/>
in this game, because he never drained me, and I had no way of getting rid
<br/>
of the cards in my hand.
<br/>
So, a nice start for me leaves me at 2(+25 or so)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: NO ONE beats Choke Vader, Tarkin Glowstick and stacked
<br/>
destinies...
<br/>
Lowlights: He was kinda disappointed to see all his Harvests go off the
<br/>
reserve deck to the drains, and Beru/Owen to the Choker
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, LS vs Beng
<br/>
Beng was playing an ISB Ops sort of deck.  He started Coruscant, I got all
<br/>
my sites out w/ MWYHL, and deploy T:JP.  Around this time I was beginning to
<br/>
get a little worried 'cause he was draining for 1 at Coruscant and not
<br/>
looking like he was giong to come to ground, even though he deployed the
<br/>
Hoth, Y4 and Endor Docking Bays with IAO.  He also deployed the CC:PTD, so I
<br/>
threw Obi there for a drain of 2, only to be followed by 5d6-ra-7.  I also
<br/>
chucked down Wedge + EPP Han to entice someone to the Hoth:DB (Don't Get
<br/>
Cocky, Skywalkers etc. in hand).  No luck, but some guy (Vesden?) came to
<br/>
the T:JP, so Luke, Leia and Skywalkers made a mess over there, resulting in
<br/>
Beng losing 15 or so force.  Obi Nabruned to another docking bay, while it
<br/>
was just a mopping up process.  Perhaps there was another big battle in
<br/>
there somewhere, but I ended up winning by 25 or so.
<br/>
4+49
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3, DS vs Stuart Lauder
<br/>
Stu was playing Ops.  I was playing beatdown.  Early on I had total control
<br/>
of his planet (a couple of walkers) and not even Choking Darth could do
<br/>
much.  I was in full control early on, but I think the turning point was
<br/>
when he got a couple of spies to a couple of my 2/0 locations and was
<br/>
draining there, and just running away on Bothawui.  I was _almost_ able to
<br/>
flip the objective back, knocking him down to 2 locations on Bothawui for
<br/>
one moment, but it wasn't enough.  I lost by 7 force.
<br/>
<br/>
4+42
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4, LS vs Anthony Gabel
<br/>
Anthony is currently #4 in the region, and from what I hear, a pretty decent
<br/>
player.  He's playing Raltiir Ops, I'm playing 'bash the snot out of the
<br/>
opponent.'  He started w/ BFHI, and at one stage I got to have a flick
<br/>
through his reserve deck, and saw there weren't any Ghhks in there, which
<br/>
was nice.  Anyway, he had it all set up as follows:
<br/>
<br/>
Jungle:  Lennox + Lobel
<br/>
City (?): Tempest Scout 1, Vader, Tarkin, another Lobel
<br/>
Prefect's Office: DS-61-2, Lt Renz
<br/>
<br/>
I played Surprise Assault at the Jungle to make him lose 3 or 4 force, but
<br/>
next turn, the beatdown came:
<br/>
Tat:JP had already been down, so Beggar came out, as did DTF (played Tunnel
<br/>
Vision for it)
<br/>
Then, Obi-Wan (for 9 force) came to the Prefect's Office, using up the final
<br/>
3 of his active force.
<br/>
I miscalculated here, and I should have deployed Leia instead (I had
<br/>
Skywalkers in hand)
<br/>
Then, EPP Luke and EPP Han.  Rigged battle destiny (6, 5,5,5) and Don't Get
<br/>
Cocky made my total power 35, and I excluded the DS61 guy with Clash, and
<br/>
made Renz forfeit 0, meaning a 33 force loss.
<br/>
The more observant of you would wonder - Why didn't TS1 (with Vader +
<br/>
Tarkin) react across?
<br/>
Well, basically, I asked 3 or 4 times whether Vader + Tarkin were in or out.
<br/>
Each time Anthony said 'out.'  I figured that as #4 in the region and given
<br/>
that there was a pre-regional rules briefing the night before, Anthony had
<br/>
an obligation to know the rules about reacting, and this was a regional, and
<br/>
so I didn't allow Vader + Tarkin to embark on the Scout for the react.
<br/>
He still had 4 or so force left, so when he drained on his next turn I just
<br/>
played Surprise Assault (rigged 5s) and he lost the remainder.  I felt
<br/>
rather awkward at the end, but there wasn't much I could do.
<br/>
If the worse came to the worst, I could've always simply beaten up
<br/>
Vader/Tarkin/Little guy, using Clash on Tarkin,
<br/>
<br/>
Since we were the first game to finish, we both got our decks checked, but
<br/>
there weren't any problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5, LS vs Jay Scott Elliot
<br/>
Jay...let me remember...14/15 years old, from W.A.  Apparently at this stage
<br/>
the highest placed player from 'over there.'
<br/>
He started ISB Ops, and I thought, 'here we go...'
<br/>
On his first or second or turn out comes T:JP, and in following turns out
<br/>
came the JP sites.  So did Mosep, Gailid and SE Jabba.  Those 3 were just
<br/>
asking for a Surprise Assault, so they got it, making Jay lose 8 or 9 force,
<br/>
which was nice.  Soon, an Outer Rim Scout came outside to the LMF (his
<br/>
version), so the beatdown came, saw DTF, and conquered.  Game over.
<br/>
20-something win.
<br/>
<br/>
Since my game was the first to finish again, I got my other side check,
<br/>
which kinda irritated me.  Sure, it has to be done, and I'm probably just
<br/>
being paranoid, but it felt like Kev was trying to get me disqualified.  Not
<br/>
to worry, everything was in order again.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of this game a few of us went to kick a footy around outside, but
<br/>
while we were out, the big 'debate' started up, and I was only able to catch
<br/>
the end of it.  Pity...besides which, you've heard/read most of the
<br/>
discussion about it on the listserv anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6, DS vs Tyng
<br/>
So, lucky me, get to get revenge for him beating Stuart :)
<br/>
Tyng seemed rather put off by the last game and the 'discussion' at the end,
<br/>
but we have to move on.
<br/>
He starts MWYHL, I start Death Star.
<br/>
I get a couple of 2/0 sites out + Endor, he gets Yoda's Hut + Yoda (only the
<br/>
1 dag site)
<br/>
He deploys Momaw Nadon + EPP Luke to Coruscant Imperial Squar.
<br/>
He deploys Goo Nee Tay (oh well...im activating 20 force a turn) and
<br/>
Insurrection (yes!  Luke's not moving!)
<br/>
I deploy CHYBC.  Poor Luke...  :)
<br/>
I also deploy a Death Squad Star Destroyer to Endor w/ Snuggle Bear in the
<br/>
driver's seat, and set up a nice drain of 2.
<br/>
Soon after, Tyng throws down the CC:CC with Chewie, KFC, Wedge and perhaps
<br/>
Obi.
<br/>
So, I deploy EPP Boba, Choking Darth and Glowstick and battle...Blast The
<br/>
Door, Kid!
<br/>
Return battle, and a couple of his guys die, and we fighting it out a little
<br/>
over there for the next couple of turns, before the real turning point of
<br/>
the game.
<br/>
He deploys B-Wing and Landing Claw.
<br/>
On my turn, I activate, don't drain (because I can't), and deploy J'Quille
<br/>
over to the CC:CC.  I ask Tyng if that is OK.  He says 'yep.'
<br/>
I then proceed to bash the snot out of the B-Wing (Lateral Damaged), but
<br/>
Tyng is fortunate to throw down the Spiral as a react.  Still 8 force is
<br/>
lost, and the games pretty much decided, since Tyng had deployed Battle Plan
<br/>
a few turns earlier, and J'Quile/Darth were killing his ability 2 guys like
<br/>
caustic soda (long story, but basically it was the final day for year 12
<br/>
students of school (mine included) yesterday, and some kids at a high school
<br/>
threw Caustic Soda on each other, and the ambulance and everything went, and
<br/>
it was all quite drastic).  Eventually, since he couldn't drain and I was
<br/>
draining for a fair bit, I won by 20 force.
<br/>
<br/>
So, at the end of this game, the results were:
<br/>
1) Me, 10+124
<br/>
2) Stuart Jones, 10+100 or so
<br/>
3) Tyng, 10+35
<br/>
4) Rodney Lee, 9 + 80 or so.
<br/>
<br/>
So, after deck checks, it was to be Stuart and I in the final.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1, my LS.
<br/>
I play poorly.  He plays OK.
<br/>
I'm doing Brenton's Beats, he's doing Ops w/ a few walkers and stuff.
<br/>
He throws out an op and some scrub AT-ST to the forest, and I've got Obi,
<br/>
Luke, Leia + some destiny adders in my hand, plus DTF.
<br/>
I don't want to cop the drain, so I throw Obi at 'em.
<br/>
His guys die, mine lives.   I draw one or two, and still don't have my
<br/>
Beggar.  He deploys an Op and a big and chunky walker, I deploy Luke, move
<br/>
Obi to join him (having GOTM in hand) - Big Mistake.  He runs away all game,
<br/>
and the next card I draw is my Beggar and my Han.  If only I'd just drawn, i
<br/>
could very well have won.  But hey, I didn't.
<br/>
Anyway, that's basically it for the rest of the game - He's running away
<br/>
most of it, I'm chasing, he deploys lots of stuff, I occassionally kill a
<br/>
little (He has Vader + Op + couple of Walkers, I have Luke + Han.  He rigs
<br/>
two fives, he battles, chokes Han, I hit Vader, I Force Is Strong, I draw
<br/>
like 3 5s for destiny etc.)
<br/>
In the end, after an hour, Stu and I both have 7 life force 'cause I can't
<br/>
chase him anymore, and he is draining for heaps.
<br/>
He would've won the turn after the next, but it wasn't going to matter.
<br/>
<br/>
1+0
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2, my DS.
<br/>
I play average.  He makes a few mistakes, but his deck is good enough for it
<br/>
not to matter.  He's probably looking at playing his LS deck at the Worlds,
<br/>
so I won't spoil it, but I just wasn't able to deploy enough stuff to stop
<br/>
him, even though I had lots of stuff to deploy.  I probably could have
<br/>
extended the game by a turn or two and reduced his differential by 2 or 3,
<br/>
but since it was obvious he was going to win (next turn he drains for 6 or
<br/>
something, with me having 10 or so force left to lose), I figured it'd be
<br/>
best to not make it slow and torturous.  So he ends up with 18 force left, a
<br/>
chunky trophy and a trip to the US, and he should do well.
<br/>
<br/>
My prediction for world championship winner: Stuart Jones ('cause then I
<br/>
could say that I even though missed out on the worlds again, it took the
<br/>
world champion to beat me :)
