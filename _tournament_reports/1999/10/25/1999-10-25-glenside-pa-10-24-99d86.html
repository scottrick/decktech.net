<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Well, I just won my first tournament and I'm so happy about it I wanted to write a tourney report.  Plus I'm trying to avoid writing a paper (grad school sucks, people), and this is just so much more fun.
<br/>
  The tournament was at RPG Outpost in Glenside, run by Ted P., with 15 players.  For dark, I was playing my unique blend of ISB, walkers, and sandwhirls.  (I've been playing basically the same dark deck for almost a year, and it still wins.  Nobody can figure out why, least of all me).  For light, I was playing HB/ Undercover Bothans with a touch of numbers that can, but doesn't have to, flip.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: my light vs. Gus D'Alessio's Tattooine Occupation
<br/>
    It took me a little while to get set up in space, but I had a multitude of undercover spies to hold off his drains and I was nicking him for one a turn at Endor.  I also hit him for a 12 force with two numbers.  (I only play two because of the popularity of Vesden around here).  He drops a bunch of ships at Tattooine and deploys Occupation.  Being the defensive player that I am, I'm still carrying an Endor Celebration in my deck, which I fortunately have in my hand.  He doesn't leave any force for a grabber, so I cancel T.O.  I figure he's already committed most of his ships to Tattooine, so it's probably safe to mosey on out to my Coruscant.  I move my Endor ships to Kessel and drop a bunch of X-Wings on Coruscant.  His drains are shut down, and every turn after that is 'pay one to lock s-foils.  drain 3 at Kessel.  Drain 3 at Coruscant.  Your turn.'

Game 2: my dark vs. Dave Diehl's Test 2 Mains and Toys on Cloud City
<br/>
   I despise playing Jedi test decks because the game always ends up being so slow.  This time was no exception -- we were the last game to finish this round.  My opening hand has a probe droid, 5D6, an ORS, Chall Beken, Devastator, an undercover, a desert, and a sandwhirl.  All I needed was a walker and I was gold.  Of course, it took me about five turns to get one, and Dave deployed no battleground sites and was having problems passing test #2, so nothing happened for a long time.  I couldn't find my reactor terminal and needed to keep my hand under 13, so I deployed a bunch of effects and kept drawing up.  Eventually I ran out of effects and  deployed the Devastator and an ORS to Coruscant.  He deploys civil disorder with just DOS and Yoda on the table, so I deploy Chall to the Devastator and cancel it, and finally draw a walker.  he curses himself for being dumb and drops a CC site.  My next turn, drop a dune walker with a probe droid to my desert with the sandwhirl that's been bouncing back and forth between 2 sites for awhile and drop 5d6 and an undercover probe droid to his site.  Bright Center goes down targeting Bespin (he has clouds and a gas miner).  He tries to SATM my droid, I Oh Switch Off to save it.  He drops R3PO.  I (check this out) sniper him with my undercover probe droid and a probe droid laser.  He can't drain me anywhere.  The game ended up with me having a couple of walkers and a bunch of agents draining him for one force every turn, since he had projections at the other two Tattooine sites I had down.  My deck usually drains for an average of 10-12 a turn.  Very slow.

Game 3: my dark vs. Joe Young's Cloud City Celebration
<br/>
   My dark deck had lost to a CC celebration deck at Ramapo, so I had recently put in (you guessed it) an Endor Occupation.  I get set up on Tattooine fairly quickly with a walker, some agents, and a sandwhirl and start draining for 3 a turn on about turn 4.  I drop some ships at Coruscant for another drain of one.  Joe can't drain me anywhere due to 5D6 and a bunch of undercover probe droids.  I get out Bright Center just in case, though.  He deploys Celebration and only leaves two force, so I cancel it on my turn with Occupation.  He can't really do anything, but he drops Han and Luke on Tattooine (where I have another site set up, so I'm draining for 7 now) , cancels my sandwhirl, and moves into the desert to block a drain.  I drop another sandwhirl on my turn, they go missing, and Joe draws up because there's nothing he can do.

Game 4: My light vs. Livio D'Alessio's Drazin Engine
<br/>
   I give him Wedge, drop some ships at Endor for an early drain, and desperately try to get my Noble Sac in my force pile so I can fish it out with Hiding in the Garbage.  No such luck.  Every turn I go to look for a system, and every turn it's in my reserve.  I keep forgetting to move my ships to Bothawui where they can protect my undercover spies and he starts Hutt Smooching.  He then takes Wedge out of the prison and proceeds to actually freeze him, which means Noble Sac is worthless and I lose 8 force.  My spies are out of commission so I have to flip to cancel the drains.  He never finds my base, but with special delivery he outdrains me.

Game 5: my dark vs. Andy Talaga's Revo 
<br/>
   I hate Andy 's light deck.  My dark deck usually has no problem with revo decks, but for some reason Andy's always beat me.  I started Security Precaution for the extra force, and was activating 2 force for a while.  I eventaully got out some other sites and made it up to 5.  I start dropping things as I get them (undercover probe droid with laser for 2 force, undercover ORS for 2 force) just to get agents out on the table.  5D6 goes down to Yavin as well.  I eventually save up for a dune walker and drop it into a sandwhirl.  Next turn it gets a probe droid passenger and I flip and start paying 3 to drain 2.  He isn't draining me at all because of the stuff I have on Yavin.  He gets out civil disorder and Wioslea, and my droids on Yavin start getting bought.  (I tried to sniper him, but it got sensed).  Fortunately, by this time I had been able to save up and drop Blizzard 2 with a probe droid on a generic desert with a sandwhirl deployed on Yavin, so it didn't really matter.  I ended up paying 6 to drain 4, and paying one to move the Tat walker with the sandwhirl.  I was losing two a turn to civil disorder, but was retrieving an agent every turn.

Game 6: my light vs. Andy Talaga's Multi-planet Drain Deck
<br/>
   I got paired up with Andy again.  Basically, I used a flipped hidden base, a bunch of undercover spies, and rebel fleet to cancel his multitude of drains.  My light deck isn't really supposed to flip, but I ended up doing it all three games anyway.  Weird.  I was draining him for 3 at Kessel, 3 at Coruscant, and 1 at Bothawui.  He was draining for 1 once in a while, when I didn't have an X-Wing for Rebel Fleet.  He went into space with a couple of ships to try and probe, but I beat him down before he found my base (at the one planet he didn't probe). He lost Security Precautions and his Coruscant off the top of his reserve deck.  I won the game (and the tournament) despite Ray sitting next to me chanting 'No pressure, Kim.  But you know, if you win this game you win the tournament.  But no pressure.'
