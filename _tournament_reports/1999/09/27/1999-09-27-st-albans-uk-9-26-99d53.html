 The tournament was supposed to start at 11:30. It was being held at a pub in St Albans ( north of London) called the Philanthropist. I get there and see many faces I have seen before.  Make some trades and small talk. Im anxious to get home and find out how my old buddies in Dagobah did  at the reigonal...Pete Dibaisio was runnin it and it started at 12.
<br/>
<br/>
LS DECK- A revamped version of 'Mains Deck'( in archive). Has 3 out of commisions, many shockings and other destiny 5 good used interrupts. Played against a HDADTJ deck, a ROPS deck, and a DS mains deck. It went 3-0 with a dif of +44 or so.
<br/>
<br/>
DS DECK- A DS mains deck that starts at Cantina and pulls JP. SOrt of like Claytons deck, but many mods. This was a what was I thinking? Deck. It went 1-2, with a dif of around -8. It played against a LS mains (win by 22), a HBX deck (loss by 10 or so) and another LS mains (loss by 18).
<br/>
<br/>
GAME 1- MY DS Mains VS Ian Ericsons Y4 throne room tech ( no revo)
<br/>
<br/>
 I get some early beats going on his mains...He is getting way out SACed. He cant do much. Im actavating a ton, and so is he. We keep beating down on each other, but mine are way worse. I start tracking my 2 tortures. He makes a last ditch effort and puts out Tawss Khaa into the AC, where I dont have anyone. He also deploys Coruscant with the leaders.  I have some ships and Jabba in my hand. I havent searched with the AC yet, so i do that 1st. Pull Boelo. Deploy Jabba and battle. I think I draw a torture for destiny. He loses tawss and some force. He goes, and drains. Draws some. I active,  deploy Bossk to coruscant for 6, a dradnaught for 3, Ozzel, and then 2 more dreadnaughts for 2 force. Draw a 6 and a 3 for destiny and thats the game.

Game 2- MY LS Mains VS Matt Allens HDADTJ with no duel
<br/>
<br/>
 I dont start tosche station. I decide for a signal/goo nee tay. This helped a lot. He has no problem giving me placesto drain, and i find many twix sites. He flips, and i go to vader at the back door. I put out EPP Luke, and EPP Obi. Battle. He clashes Obi. I swing, and miss. He swings and hits. He draws a 1 for destiny, and I draw one of my many 5's. Obi is left chillin on Endor. I drain and he doesnt have ATWYS, and i dont think he has it. He doesnt. It topdecks. Good. I Nar Shadda, get a spy and deploy it and Han to the Holochamber. Drain of 4 to his 0. He puts Vader and Bliz Walker with some Imps. I keep draining, and find a nabrum. Play it he plays rebels wont escape us. Well, it was for free anyways. I get out EPP Luke, Leia, Chewie, and i think thats it. Battle. Hit Vader, then clash him. Draw a 1 for destiny. I lose Chewie. I nabrum off executor and beat him down again. It was a fun game. This was the largest loss his HD deck has ever had he tells me.

Game 3- My ls VS Derek Hawkesworths's ROPS 
<br/>
<br/>
 He starts Arrest Order, me tosche station. I get out EPP Obi, move him to station. He gets out A Spaceport site and docking bay. I activate a ton. Drain, draw. Get a nabrun. He gets out a squad leader, a 2 cadets, then grups em together. I find Order to Engage which is making him lose tons! I keep battling. Flip/FLip/Flip. It flipped back 4 times. That must be a record. He has had very low activation all game, and gets some twix sites to go with mine. He searches for a card, deploys EPP Vader, alters OTE. That stops damage. I look through my hand. I have Tawss, Leia, and Ori. Also Fury. Vader becomes really mad and i start laying the beats on cadets. Vader never battles. I get Tantive to ralitir. Also a leader. Have savrip out. He cant do jack to me after Harc 'THE MAN' Seff comes out.

Game 4 My DS Pile VS Scott Lathams HBX
<br/>
<br/>
 I get going slowly. Get vader out 4 turn to Cantina. He sets up really quick. Flips. Activate 3, twilek...Ill get lateral damage. Sec Precautions had been activated! I was mad, but didnt even let it show i wasnt looking for damage. He has 2 xwings at endor. Deploy dnaight. He barriers. No sense in hand. Ok....Damage an xwing. Deploy Ozzel on the dnaught. BIHT comes out. Battle, draw a 4. He loses both and 4 more, but houjixes. Oh well...! That could have been bad igf i had a sense and he no houjix. But there are so many what ifs...We keep about even drains, and i think i can win. All wings for 12. Thats a ton! Civil Disorder, and spreads to thin for me to kepp up. Drains me out. Wish i could have better twilek luck!

Game 5- MY LS VS a guy playing Peter DiBiasios DS mains
<br/>
<br/>
 He starts Ice Plains/3rd marker. Gets wampa cave and Dstar in starting. SO hes activating 11 to my 5. Ouch! Obi  goes to shop for a cheap set of power converters. Draw. Useless red cards. Vader/Takin/Stick. Battle. I lose cards. I should have just lost obi. He starts draining me at Obis hut, and im looking to finnally find stuff. I get all my mains to Obis hut, move obi over. He walks to Tosche. I nabrum, clash vader. Kill tarkin and a ton. he obviously thought vader was back, and deployed blizzard 2. I expected more, but no that was it. I battle and beat him down for a lot again. He has had a steady drain of 3 at the 3rd marker, and has a lot of guys there. Im afraid of topdecking a nabrum. I dont. I draw 1. Its tunnel vision. I play it and take the last card in my pile, a nambrun. We fight a lot at the 3rd marker. I can out draw on my destinies, and start tracking Out of Commisions. He is losing like mad. I have Harc and he moves to my Hoth war room. NO drains for him. He see's how things are gonna be, and draws up.

<br/>
<br/>
 He starts obis hut. I pull AC and him JP. I get out Vader to cantina. He deploys EPP Luke, Han. Draw ther Fire. Battle. I topdeck a Vader to DTF. He swings and hits him. I choke han and miss. He plays Glancing Blow. he draws 2 3's. I lose vader. And 14 cards. He loses Han. ALl my Vaders are topdecked, and all but 1 of my 4 alters. I know this is game over. I keep drawing. No stuff. He keeps enforcing at the statiom. Many mains. Im scared. He drains. Topdeck Reactor Terminal. This was crucial. I Have like 40 cards in hand...im praying for a used grimtassh, but no such luck. I put up a minimal fight. My dad gets there, and i put myself out of my misery and draw up.

I leave the tournament, and i am not too upset. I either got 3rd or 4th, but i dont care. Packs were preimere and JP. Fun tournament. Pete ran it well. Nice to meet some new faces here. 
<br/>
<br/>
Final Score 8(+36). 
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions:
<br/>
<br/>
LS deck is solid, has all bases covered. Fun to play.
<br/>
DS is not solid. Sucks it big time. I think i am going to play Woj's Ominous Beats deck.</font></td>
