<br/>
Prolog
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is my first Tournament Report and my first sanctioned (Hopefully-Youll see later) tournament. If you have decided to read this, please send comments or what not and tell me what you think about how I wrote this etc Im not gonna tell you how I did, so read on. I think youll enjoy it!  Anyhow, my friend and I have been waiting two weeks to go, so we rode over together. We got there at 11:30 and found the TD and Peter Jacobson already there. Well, we opened up the store. And waited. We waited some more. Only two more people showed (Who planned it on this weekend!?!?!)Well, it wasnt sanctioned but my friend and decided this wouldnt hinder anything and we would still have a blast. We chatted with the TD a while bout lots of stuff and decided to get started. We started the actual draft around 12:30
<br/>
<br/>
The Draft 
<br/>
<br/>
I have heard the LS horror stories and prayed to God that I didnt draft LS.  I reached inpulled DS! Yes! I knew I at least had a chance. My friend also got DS so at least we wont have to play and perhaps he could do well also. I would have to say this was the best part of the tourney. It was extremely fun. If you have not done a booster draft, I encourage everyone to do so.  We each got 6 packs and got started.  First pack, Orrimarrko. Damn! That stinks. Sucks to give that up!  Hopefully I dont have to play Peter :-p  Anyhow, heres the short on what I ended up with: 3 Speeder Bikes, 2 Tempest Scouts, TS 1, Empires New Order (Killer), Perimeter Petrol (Ditto), Major Marquand among others.  I didnt get many great ability 2 Imps, as my friend drafted them all! Turns out I got the Speeder bikes and he got the Speeder Bike Troopers also. Groan.  Anyhow, I took my 54 cards and set out to make the best deck I possibly could.  On to the games.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1-Vs- Dion Erbes 
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it turns out he got a Threepio and he kicks in Sealed Play. Anyhow, he started Chirpas Hut and Dense Forest. I started Endor and pulled Forest Clearing. I used Endor because I had three Lambda Class Shuttles and youll see how this *really* helped. Anyhow, my opening hand wasnt bad. I activated deployed Back Door and a LC Shuttle to Endor, and two ability 1 Navy Troopers to Back Door. (I know, they suck) Drew the last two and his turn. This is the game breaker right here, first turn.   He deploys Wicket and two Ewok Spearman with a spear to Back Door. I interrupt Dead Ewok. Bam.  Drew a 4, Bye bye. I dunno if I wouldve been able to survive that. Whew!  He draws and I activate. Drain for 2 at Endor and 2 at Bunker. Put down Drazin and an Elite Squad Trooper to Bunker. Draw up the rest.  His Turn, activates, deploys Threepio to Back Door, and two more Ewoks. I interrupt with my second and last Dead Ewok and draw a Tempest Scout. Bye bye furry bears.  He curses and draws.  I drain for 4, deploy Marquand on TS  to Clearing and Grond with him. Draw and his go. The rest of the game consisted of me draining him out and battling his small resistance.  Full Win by 20
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Dead Ewok. Controlling Endor the whole game
<br/>
Lowlights: None really. Maybe a little bit of over deploying.
<br/>
<br/>
Score:   2(+20)
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 VS-  Peter Jacobson
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I was happy after my first tourney win, so I figured what the hell, maybe I have a chance.  I started Endor and Forest Clearing. He started Dense Forest and Back Door.  Hmm Not much interesting in this one.  I got and early LC Shuttle to Endor. He countered and with a YT-1300 some guys to get destiny. I forfeited the Shuttle and he had control of Endor.  Meanwhile, I took over the Forest Clearing, which, BTW has great gametext. The deciding battle was when he deployed two Ewoks to the back door and landed the Shuttle there.  I had been saving force and started deployed en mass. I deployed TS 1 w/ Marquand. Biker Scout w/ Speeder, two other named Scouts, one with a speeder, TS and some other imps. I also deployed Empires New Order. I battled, played Imperial Tyranny and Pitiful Little Band. Needless to say he lost everything and moreone of which was Orrimarrko off the top of his RD. Yippee.  The rest of the game was just me spreading and draining for the Full Win by 26
<br/>
<br/>
Highights:  The DS Interrupts. The LS doesnt have the opposites and they are just two powerful.  Also, the big battle.
<br/>
Lowlights:  Not one.
<br/>
<br/>
Score:   4 (+46)
<br/>
<br/>
After the second game, I find my friend is in a close second place.  We talked shortly, mostly about how powerful the DS is and that the LS really has no chance. I went to the bathroom, and got a pop. I was just happy as hell to be in first place. I just had to keep it up and I could win. Would that be the case? It doesnt appear so after this next game. Read on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 VS- Dion Erbes
<br/>
<br/>
Dang. Not again. It turns out his LS deck is fairly decent. Well, well see what happens.  Well, it turns out he got a near God draw and I got crap.  Mostly Red junk.  Well, I started the Usual and he converted my Endor. Dang. Not good at all.  I did manage to get some Tscouts out roaming and draining when possible.  His game mainly consisted of Threepio and many many Ewoks compiled at one site. This was not a pretty game at all. I beat his YT1300 off Endor with 2 LC Shuttles though. That helped. I never did see a Dead Ewok as I lost them both to drains off the RD. Well, to make a long game short, I won an ugly one by 12
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Just winning.
<br/>
Lowlights:  The game. Bad draw. Made some mistakes. Low win
<br/>
<br/>
Score:  6 (+58)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is it. That low win dropped me to second behind my friend.  I would have to win a large win to hope to win the tourney.  Went to the bathroom again, drank some more pop (Do you see a trend?) and sat down. The tourney was mine to win or lose I figured.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 VS-  ??????
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this was obviously the other guy that got LS.  I started the usual. I got off to a great start. Empires New Order, Lambda Class Shuttle, Bunker and Perimeter Patrol in opening hand.  I deployed the goods and got an uncontested drain for 2 at Endor the Whole game. PP and ENO more or less won won the game.  I just beat down whatever he deployed and didnt over deploy. I didnt need to with the great DS interrupts and the TSs.  I just spread out and drained, and won the occasional battles. This guy never had a chance.  Full Win by 25
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  The great opening Hand. The effects. The drain and power bonus at Endor.
<br/>
Lowlights:  Winning by so much so fast. I needed to though if I wanted to win.
<br/>
<br/>
Score:  8 (+83)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I barely edged out my friend for the First Place Victory! My first tourney and I started it off with a great win!  My friend wasnt mad as we were both happy just to play.  Since it wasnt sanctioned, we didnt get to crack open the prize support, although I did get some packs. I got two foils and and some junk rares. I didnt care though.  Came away with great rares, 4 foils total and above all, the Win.  
<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion
<br/>
<br/>
The DS totally rules Endor Booster Draft. The LS with the underpowered Ewoks simply stands no chance at all as you can see in these games.  Threepio is good, but not enough alone to win.  I never fought Orrimarrko but I would suspect hes probably a guy you cant take lightly. Anyhow though, Im disappointed that the Ewoks blow.  Seriously, I reiterate that they are just too underpowered. I had no problem smacking them around. Also, with the DSs ability to react to any and everything is another advantage in their awesome combat vehicles. With a pilot they have a base power of usually 6 which is hard to overcome.  Also, the DS has Killer Red cards.  ENO and PP dominate. If you can, defiantly draft Dead Ewok as that can win games.  Imperial Tyranny and Pitiful Little Band is just not fair to the LS, as they have no counterparts to it.  If anyone wins a Booster draft with a LS deck, send it along. I wouldnt mind seeing it. Overall, I had a Blast! and would love to do this again. Thanks for reading my first ever Tournament report.  If you have any questions or comments or want to say my report is long and boring or congratulate me, send it along to: 0077dk@excite.com
