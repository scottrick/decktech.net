<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">It's Thursday and I'm searching for a good tournament to play in.  Browsing through the Coruscant tournament locator I find a Shawn Valdez tournament (what tournament can be better then that?) one problem though...Mastic is 90 mins away and I have  no ride.  I check out who the TD is and it's no one other then Marco Habert (#1 in Couruscant, #3 in world).  So I figure what the heck, I'll give it a shot and E-mail Marco about the situation.  One thing led to the other and I find myself along with my bro meeting him 2 blocks from my house (now that's a nice guy)
<br/>
<br/>
After our 90 min drive we finally reach Golden Memories.  Now me and Marco start to talk about the Meta around here and I start tweaking some decks.  He tells me no one is playing or expecting the Drazin Manipulator (a nice little deck I just happened to have) and that no one is expecting LS OPS either.  Now the decks I have on me are:  The Revo/Nudji, Ocupussy, CPI and Drazin Manipulator.  I was going to play the Revo but during playtesting it lost to Courlag Ops (actually slaughtered is better) so I decided not to.  I ask Marco if he has a LS OPS and he says 'No, I have 2!'  So I go with the more original one (the other one was speeder ops).  For DS I go with the Drazin Manipulator instead of Marco's OPS since I don't like troopers and I don't like the Ocupussy.  Since this is a DeckTech TR I'll submit the decks I used later for review.
<br/>
<br/>
After all my deck tweaking and sort we get all the info for the tournament and Marco tells us that he's selling WB Premiere for $1.50 a pack (all going to the Cancer Fund of course) and that all the admission fees are going to the Fund as well.  The owner of the store then cockily tells all of us 'Remember to do your best, we have the #3 player of the world and 3 of Coruscant's Top 10'  I think to myself 'Great, I'll be in for a good tournament (since I'm not one of those 3!)   Finally onto the TR...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1:  MY DS VS Philip Pipitone's (1804) RTP
<br/>
<br/>
We reveal our starting stuff and I see RTP and he sees my CCT (RTP, heard about someone playing it well in GenCon so I didn't underestimate it) He gives me Commander Wedge (kinda funny that he starts the game with 2 characters captured)  I draw my 8, and see:  Monnok, Scanning Crew, A Dangerous Time, Voyeur, Back Door, Downtown Plaza, Alter and Fear.  I think to myself great hand but no Drazin (for a matter of fact no characters) I deploy my sites, fear him (loses from the top, DS Plans, everyone loses from the top :-), SCrew (scanning crew) him and take EPP Obi to the used pile (I see a Lift Tube, Luke's Speeder, a Nar Shadda and Spaceport Speeders)  He Nar Shaddas for a Droid Merchant...at this point I had no clue what he was doing...and I Voyeur the Nar Shadaa.  I leave enough for a monnok and draw.  He activates and draws, I quickly ADT (A Dangerous Time) him and set up his draw so that he draws up all his doubles.  He draws up and I monnok, I take out about 6 cards.  I activate my Insane amount of force and deploy Myonith Onith with the Audience Chamber game text.  From then on I just manipulated his hand and he did nothing (he couldn't) after a couple of turns of me draining with Tarkin at the Plaza with a PotF (Prescience of the Force) and Myonith at the AC with a PotF using her game text the game was over.  He did flip the objective and then did something that made me ponder...he deploys Rayc Ryjard (the effect from premiere that gives a character smuggling skill) on Leia, the he plays As Good As Gone (returns a smuggler back to the owners hand).  Now I read the objective and see that I can't flip it back.  After I win, he asks if its just a CCT manipulator and I tell him no that its the Drazin Manipulator and that I just didn't get him or Special Delivery out (I had 4 Drazin, 2 Deliveries).
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Playing the Manipulator w/o the Drazin Combo and watching someone flip RTP then use that combo!
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Playing the Manipulator w/o the Drazin Combo, just didn't get him into my hand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Result:  Full Win by 28
<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  2(+28)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2:  My LS VS Joseph Vero's (1694) ISB Ops
<br/>
<br/>
We reveal out starting stuff and he has ISB Ops and Bright Center to the Universe (doH!)  I start Local Uprising on Bothawai and Insurrection.  For the first 3 turns he just draws up and deploys sites (always left Coruscant alone)  My first turn I deploy Farm Luke and an Op to the Swamp, 2nd turn I deploy Melas and an Op to the Jungle, random 2/2 character with op to the forest and flip.  Same turn I use the lost ability of Fly Casual (I never use this card, but Marco said to use it so I left it in) and look for the Tantive IV, I deploy it to Coruscant and cancel ABCttU (A Bright Center to the Universe).  His 4th turn he deploys DLOTS to fight 2/2 with Op (looking for beatdown and I play It's A Trap to cancel it (another card Marco uses).  My turn I drain and deploy EPP beatdown on the DLOTS (now I get the point of the card!) after that battle game was over.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Flipping 2nd Turn, Using 2 cards I never used in regular play.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Joseph never really got into the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Result:  Full Win by 30
<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  4(+58)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3:  My LS VS Kenny White's (1959) Courlug Ops
<br/>
<br/>
Well we start out and he tells me his name and we start.  I have my Both Ops and he has his Courlag Ops.  His first turn he draws, my first turn I deploy Melas w/ OP to the Swamp.  His second turn he deploys an Op with a Tempest Walker (Lost in the Wilderness Tech) and draws.  My 2nd turn I drain deploy 2 ops 2 2/2 characters and flip.  He goes and deploys 2 ops with 2 tempests and flips.  I drain for 1 at each site and deploy the rest of my ops to the remaining 3 sites (I didn't use the Spaceport City).  He goes and does the same (he mimic my exact moves for the first 4 turns)  After we each had all our sites with ops we spend a few turns draining each other until he deploys a Bubo.  Now I have to take care of Bubo, I send Obi and Chewie after him and slaughter Bubo.   We continue to drain (I would of eventually won if this was kept up since I had the 4 force advantage) but he deploys Death Star and ABCttU.  I go and look at him and go 'Drain for 0' he laughs and I stare.  Thank God for Fly Casual (I use it again) and deploy Han and EPP Leia to Death Star on the Falcon (it was being protected by Devastator and a pilot and tempest for forfeit bait) I initiate battle and he loses the 2 forfeit bait's.  Now he goes and deploys Bossk In Bus and forfeit bait and tells me to go.  I transfer Chewie and Jeroen Webb up to the Falcon and go back to Death Star.  He deploys a power 2 character and I Noble Sacrifice back for 6 force.  He initiates battle (after deploying Vengeance) and I have to lose Leia and Jeroen.  I deploy some more characters to the Falcon (I should have just shuttled down the characters to Courlag and left Death Star alone).  His turn I Nar Shadda and retrieve 7 force then he deploys an Op to the Vengeance for more forfeit bait and I Noble Sac a character for 6. He initiates battle and I have to lose everything at the death star.  My turn I deploy a hit squad to Courlag (he left no force to react, that's why I never tried to invade)  I move away an Op and beatdown a Tempest and he loses 8....then time is called.  We count our force and he goes 12...13...14 and I'm counting at the same time 14...15...16!  He shutters and I sigh.
<br/>
<br/>
Result:  Timed Win by 16
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Thank God for Noble Sac's and Nar Shadaa, beating a 1900 player!
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Shouldn't have of stayed at Death Star.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  5(+74)
<br/>
<br/>
I'm relieved and I take some time to breath in everything that just happened.  Pairings are announced and I have to play Michael Patton.  I figure this is the last match so this is the other top 10 player in Coruscant....
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4:  MY DS VS Michael Patton's (1660) EBO!
<br/>
<br/>
I start CCT w/Prescence of the Force and he starts MPG...(EBO???  We start the game and I have him in complete control.  I deploy Drazin, Special Delivery, GMT, Myonith all by the 2nd turn.  I manipulate and retrieve the manipulating tools.  I drain at the AC w/PotF and Carbon Chamber w/PotF and the game is over quick.  He did get EBO out but never had one ship on the table (the only ship was a 2nd turn Red Leader in Red 1 at Coruscant that got crushed by a third turn Executor, YES a third turn Executor!)
<br/>
<br/>
Result:  Full Win by 32
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  Drazin up and running, complete control.  Mike was a real good sport, he was probably the best player there!
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  None.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  7(+106)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm now excited as hell since I think I won the tourney (I could almost feel the SV shirt :-)  Only to find out there's another game and that Mike wasn't the other player in the top 10 of Coruscant.  Onto game 5...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Game 5:  My DS VS Josh Obrien's (1966) No Shelter
<br/>
<br/>
This was a great game, he starts Obi's Hut and Tosche Station I start CCT (he thinks I'm actually gonna flip) with a Bad Feeling Have I.  The game goes on and I have manipulation going by turn 3.  He still gets out the damned Aliens and an Obi though.  They beat down on Jabba, Myonith and EPP Fett, I take out the aliens and Obi is left.  I recycle EPP Fett (gotta love the Corporal!)  I deploy Dengars Riot Gun on EPP Fett and initiate battle....then Josh tells me he has to leave.  Marco was watching the game and says ok he has to leave so he forfeits and I get a full win.
<br/>
<br/>
Result:  Full Win by 20
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  The same Fear and EPP Fett got recycled a good 4 times.
<br/>
<br/>
Lowlights:  Josh had to leave and I never got to capture Obi.
<br/>
<br/>
Overall:  9(+124)
<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm pretty sure that I won, but they tell me I have to play a winners match (to determine who gets prize)  So the top 2 would have to play but Kenny offers to omit the match and split the prize.  So I settle for $15 store credit and the Shawn shirt and Kenny gets $15 store credit.  I get an EPP Han a pack of SE and Endor, I pull nothing good but at least I have the EPP Han!
<br/>
<br/>
By the records Im the official winner since I was the only player to go undefeated.  My brother wasn't as lucky as he placed 11 of 17.  But all in all it was a good day, we raised $80 dollars for the Cancer Fund and all left home happy.
