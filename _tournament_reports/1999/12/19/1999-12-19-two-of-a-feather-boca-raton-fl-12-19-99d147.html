<td><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Prologue - I had been looking forward to this tournament for quite sometime. I'd been messing with the ECC cards a bit but kinda got bored of playing the same people over and over again. I wasn't feeling good yesterday ( Saturday ) but was decently hopped up on medicine ( I woke up in the middle of the night twice with bursts of energy ). I was driving my friends and playing group down to the tournament ( Chris Schutz , Daniel Blackford , and Lee Edwards ). Since it is/was the birthday of the gorgeous Alyssa Milano so I decided to name my decks relevant to her. 
<br/>
<br/>
Light Side - 'Who's the Boss?' - This is the series she starred on as Sam , the daughter of Tony Danza ; cool show. Hidden Base deck that used HB for Generation and bunch of characters. 
<br/>
<br/>
Dark Side - 'Prophesy' - Name of a song by Remy Zero , Lead singer is married to Alyssa Milano. Related in SWCCG terms to the Steven Lewis / Clint Hays HDADTJ Power deck that did so well at Worlds.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1 : 'Who's the Boss?' v. Andrew Echnoz's TDIGWATT/PIDAIFurther
<br/>
<br/>
	First few turns we both just draw and deploy locations. Finally on like turn 6 or so he throws down Bubbleboy at Bespin , Obsidian 7 at Cloud City , Mosep at STower ,
<br/>
Tarkin and 61-X at West Gallery and Bane Malar at Docking Baby to set up Dark Deal and flip the objective. He also has Cloud City Occupation set up. I've got like +30 force activated and think about how I wanna go about fighting this. I Tunnel Vision but find No Spies in the like 80989 cards I've got activated , so I had 2 spies in the like 6 force in Reserve. Grr. I get Draw Their Fire and go after him. I deploy Jek Porkins in Red 6 up at Bespin ( hehehe ) , I deploy Red Leader to Cloud City , Obi-Wan /Harc Seff/ Beezer to Docking Bay , and Luke and like 'Crackhead Rebel Pilot ' to the Upper Walkway or whatever and cancel Dark Deal and flip his objective back. I beat down on Bane for like 3 or so and escape only losing Beezer. Jek does the Electric slide down to Corulag. Basically I use Harc Seff to pester him and got my whole fleet to converge and take total control over Bespin and Cloud City. Win by 28. Record : 2 ( +28 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Winning and having some fun.
<br/>
Lowlights : None , really.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2 : 'Prophesy' v. Walter Cowart's version of Martin Faulk's LS HB weird deck
<br/>
<br/>
	I really can't get much going this game. He has EPP Luke , EPP Lando , Figrin D'an , and Harc Seff  running away from my forces for most of the game. I was stupid and should've split them up. I did manage to knock Tibrin out with some drains so he couldn't flip HB but I kinda needed to be able to do the damage. I got ripped up for like 20 damage by Legendary Starfighter because I couldn't battle the Falcon like all game long ( it was empty and when it wasn't he was using the Claw ). Melas later came down with Yoda's Gimer Stick and Igar had the Order to Engage but just couldn't do it. Not even IG-88 could stand up to him.  Its a squeker which I manage to lose by 5. Record : 2 ( +23 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Nothing much.
<br/>
Lowlights : Not getting CBHYBCoward which would've saved like 10-15 force.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3 : 'Prophesy' v. Greg Hodur ? / Greg Andon  ?/ I think Greg something from Oklahoma in a wheelchair visiting his family for holidays.
<br/>
<br/>
	He starts Ops so I start Battle Order. The name of this game was Visage. Visage must've hit him for oh say about 25 damage throughout the course of the game. He was using Operatives on Ralltiir with Ralltiir Freighter Captains , the random.SE.Pilots , and Y-Wings with the Koenysar Effect to retrieve Y-Wings , I thought it was pretty neat but he just can't set it up this time. I dropped the Bus and kept my ability to draw multiple destinies up throughout the game. I got Empire's New Order up and had Igar on Tempest 1 racking up kills and retrieving force. He never was able to flip his objective and Vader sat at the Farm the whole game. I could've setup ABC2theUni but I just held it and battled him down at the Ralltiir system. Win by 18. Record : 4 ( +41 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : Battling and crushing lots of things.
<br/>
Lowlights : Kinda felt bad that Visage burnt up like half of his deck.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4 - 'Who's the Boss?' v. Johnathan Kanter's TDIGWATT/PIDAIFurther...
<br/>
<br/>
	Hmm. I get another try at the new objective. He starts just like the first game by using Any Methods Necessary to get Fett , Fett in Ship , Security Tower , and Fett's Blaster. He starts  All Wrapped Up but didn't start/use Secret Plans but tossed out Bad Feeling Have I on his first turn.  First significant move I make is bring Obi down on Bane Malar and hit him for like 4 after that. Then he deploys Lyn Me , Cloud City Fett with Rifle , Bossk , and Dengar versus Obi. I saved a force ( crucial ) and tell Lyn Me to move along since it was gonna get ugly. He draws a 0 and Obi quickly rigs up some pipes and pulls out a Smoke Screen , so I lose like a force or two and he loses Bossk and Dengar cuz they have bad forfeits. So Fett runs like a school girl to the Docking Bay and Lyn Me is at the Prison. I activate and have like 15 active or so. I was a little sick but I use my Tunnel Vision to my advantage. Jereon Webb gives me the key to the Security Tower and EPP Luke and Tawss Khaa come in and gang-bang on Lyn Me for like 12 after her and I retrieve with DTFire and Tawss. Later he drops a bunch more locations and Obsidian 2 with pilot at cloud city and Lobot helps out. Red Leader clears out OS-2 in O2. Later he deploys Myo and Dr Evazan with his Gun across from EPP Luke , Tawss , and Jereon. WTF ? Okay. Well he Disarms and operates on EPP Luke , 'okay' . I deploy EPP Luke and EPP Han and battle. hit him for like 8 more after both of them are gone. Harc Seff cancels his remaining pieces and I spread in cloud city to drain the rest out. Record : 6 ( +67 ) 
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights : 'nother solid game by this wacky Lightside deck.
<br/>
Lowlights : Having 9 cards in hand when he basically committed suicide. 
<br/>
<br/>
So I Tie for 2nd and get a nice amount of packs but nothing worth writing about. I traded my 3rd Cloud City Fett for the two new ECC droids and was able to pickup some Rare Endor Biker Scouts I needed. Chris finished 2-2 but will regain his touch very quickly , Daniel finished 2-2 , and Lee Edwards went 3-1. TD Tommy Minton gave first place the choice between Austin Powers 2 video or Episode 1 Calendar and the winner Mike Belfatto chose Austin Powers 2 video. Mike was using MWYHL / Harvest and ISB Heavy Space with lots and lots of Probe Droids and Undercovers. His Harvest deck bead Daniel because he drew a 1 when his Womp Rat tried to eat Beru ! That changed the whole game. On the whole I saw a lot of the normal decks and the DS ECC Objective seems to be used much more widely then the Lightside one , with varied results.
