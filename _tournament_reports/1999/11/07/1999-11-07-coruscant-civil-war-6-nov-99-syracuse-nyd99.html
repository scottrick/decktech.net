<br/>
6 Nov 99, Syracuse NY
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's been a long while since I've written a tourney report, mainly
<br/>
because this was my first constructed tournament since August.  I'd like
<br/>
to think I'm not out of practice, though, since I play online a lot.  In
<br/>
any case, this was one of the 'big' tourneys in Coruscant, where people
<br/>
from all over the region came.  We ended up with 26 people, with 4 2000+
<br/>
people there: TJ Holman, Wojtek Jankowski, and Brian and Chris
<br/>
Terwilliger.
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a brief summary of my decks.  My Light deck is a MWYHL/MnT deck
<br/>
that trains some 4-ability alien to Test 2 (Melas, Tawss, or Orrimaarko,
<br/>
whichever I draw first).  Luke and Leia are much too important to be
<br/>
stuck on Dagobah. :-)  My deck has I believe 13 cards that are destiny 5
<br/>
and above, meaning Jedi Testing is usually not a problem, and works good
<br/>
with EPPs, naturally.  I've got a nice complement of anti-Hunt Down
<br/>
cards as well.  The deck works pretty well, but it has a history of
<br/>
problems versus Space decks and Endor Ops.  As for my Dark deck, I was
<br/>
playing a Hunt Down variant that I got from Mike Dalton who got it from
<br/>
John Arendt.  It starts IAO, pulls Docking Bays, duels, and has 3
<br/>
Visages to make sure one's always out (who uses 3 Terminateds?).  It was
<br/>
fairly untested for me, but seems to work well enough.
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, me and my friend Spencer got there, and everyone is pretty much
<br/>
set into teams, so we end up on 'Team Leftovers'. :-)  It ends up being
<br/>
me, Spencer, Bart Robinson, and Tony Vigliotti.  Anyway, Ted P. goes
<br/>
through the pairings, and after some time gets to me.  I'm playing
<br/>
Wojtek.  I actually looked forward to playing him, mighty though he may
<br/>
be, it's good to give my decks a good trial by fire once in a while. 
<br/>
Plus, I've never played him before.  So I look around for Wojtek, and
<br/>
don't see him anywhere.  After a few minutes, I find he's on the ground
<br/>
near TJ still building his deck. :-)  Anyway, by the time he gets done,
<br/>
there's like no seats left, we end up sitting next to a Magic
<br/>
tournament.  (This store's amazing, they were simultaneously running
<br/>
Star Wars, Magic, and Pokemon tournaments!)  On with the games...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 1: My Dark vs. Wojtek Jankowski's [2012] CC Celebration
<br/>
<br/>
Wojtek was playing the deck that like all the good Philly players play
<br/>
nowadays.  He started Hidden Base, I started my normal stuff.  He gets
<br/>
out Tatooine and Bespin, I get out Executor and Endor Docking Bays.  I
<br/>
deploy EPP Vader at the Endor Docking Bay and flip.  He deploys Daughter
<br/>
there.  I know he's probably going to deploy Obi or Luke there next turn
<br/>
and beat Vader into a bloody pulp next turn, so I fight Leia, chop her
<br/>
in half, and cause some Force loss, and lose Vader to attrition.  He
<br/>
deploys Jeroen and Wioslea to cancel Visage, then moves Wioslea over to
<br/>
the Meditation Chamber.  I deploy CHYBC, then deploy Zuckuss to beat on
<br/>
Wioslea, but Wioslea POLRs away.  He deploys the Tantive with some pilot
<br/>
to Bespin.  I deploy the Bus and a Dreadnaught and go fight it.  He
<br/>
loses the pilot, I lose the Dread.  He then deploys a Bacta Tank and
<br/>
some other pilot on the Tantive, and battles the Bus.  Bus is lost, his
<br/>
pilot goes to the Tank.  I deploy the Devastator with Evax and take out
<br/>
the Tantive easily.  Meanwhile, he's deployed a ton of stuff on the
<br/>
Executor, where's he's not draining.  Melas comes and and sits in front
<br/>
of Zuckuss, Zuckuss doesn't care, he deploys some guys and kill Zuckuss
<br/>
+ 3.  He has 2 Cloud City sites out, and deploys Son at one and Pucumir
<br/>
at the other.  I decline to go beat up Pucumir because POLR could make
<br/>
that bad for my health.  I finally get Vader and all his dueling
<br/>
equipment.  He has 2 battleground sites now, so he can drain at the
<br/>
Executor sites.  I deploy Vader to Son's site, but Vader's apparently a
<br/>
lot more patient than I am, and decides It Can Wait.  I have Bane or
<br/>
someone go beat up Pucumir eventually, he takes some damage from it.  He
<br/>
tries to Docking Bay Transit EPP Han from the Executor to Endor to get
<br/>
his second battleground, but then realizes that would cost 16 Force.
<br/>
:-)  So he deploys someone there, and also gets out a 3rd CC Site.  I deploy Vader, he POLRs Luke over
<br/>
to the third CC site.  I get out Vader's Stick, he kills Bane somehow (I
<br/>
forget), Vader starts walking over to Luke.  All the while, I'm still
<br/>
draining for 2 at Bespin.  I swallow another turn of drains because I
<br/>
didn't get rid of Luke and I have no one to drop on the guy at Endor. 
<br/>
He, surprisingly enough, moves Luke right in front of Vader.  I deploy
<br/>
Tarkin, but he also decides that It Can Wait.  At this point, I know it
<br/>
has to be a set up.  But I have confidence in my destiny, as I have at
<br/>
least 12 cards that are 6+, and lots more if you count 5's.  And if I
<br/>
don't deal with Luke, I'm facing more drains on the Executor.  I Epic
<br/>
Obsession, he draws 5,5, which I was somewhat expecting.  I draw a
<br/>
3,2,1.  Argh!  I probably should have looked for a Docking Bay with IAO
<br/>
to make sure the chances of that happening were relatively low.  Anyway, I
<br/>
lose Vader and 9, he drains for lots on the Executor, I keep draining
<br/>
for 2 at Bespin, he ends up winning by 4.  After the game he points out
<br/>
that he forgot to pay for Battle Order one turn, might've cost me the
<br/>
game, maybe not.  My thoughts are Vader losing the duel completely cost
<br/>
me the game. :-)  FL-4, 0(-4)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: I almost beat Wojtek!
<br/>
Lowlights: I could've beat Wojtek and I didn't.  Blah.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 2: My Light vs. Wojtek Jankowski's [2012] Ominous Rumors
<br/>
<br/>
Well, apparently I didn't have enough fun the first time, because now I
<br/>
get to play Wojtek again!  I was somewhat disappointed at this, as after
<br/>
one loses against a good person, one generally wants to beat on some
<br/>
not-so-good person to get one's ego back up.  Anyway, as I mentioned
<br/>
earlier, my Light deck has problems against Space and Endor Ops decks,
<br/>
and Ominous Rumors is both, so this game is somewhat ugly for me.  I get
<br/>
both my tests done relatively early, which hinders his effectiveness
<br/>
quite a bit.  And he deploys Broken Concentration the next turn and
<br/>
curses himself. :-)  Anyway, I start out with a Jeroen Webb and a
<br/>
Revolution in my hand, two great ways to invade the Bunker. 
<br/>
Unfortunately, I can't seem to draw my EPPs early enough, and Ephant Mon
<br/>
comes down before I can make a mess of things.  I get the Redemption in
<br/>
my hand and a Bacta Tank out, so I decide to try to contest him in
<br/>
space.  He deploys a bunch of crap on the ground and flips Endor Ops.  I
<br/>
deploy my Redemption at Endor, with Chewie, Han, and Jeroen.  I battle,
<br/>
forgetting that the flipped Endor Ops affects everywhere, so I only get
<br/>
one destiny.  He loses something, I lose Jeroen.  Anyway, some stuff I
<br/>
don't remember happens, Chewie ends up in the Bacta Tank, the Redemption
<br/>
is Lateral Damaged, and I deploy Gold Leader with Harc Seff and beat up
<br/>
some Dreadnaught at Nal Hutta.  He chases the Redemption, leaving but a
<br/>
single Dreadnaught at Endor.  I take a chance and send the Redemption
<br/>
back to Endor instead of going to Nal Hutta to get rid of Lateral (Gold
<br/>
Leader can't get to Endor).  Anyway, he deploys more stuff and beats up
<br/>
the Redemption, and eventually drains me out.  FL-21, 0(-25)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Umm...
<br/>
Lowlights: This is definitely *not* how I wanted to start my day.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 3: My Dark vs. Spencer Hamblen's [1555] Droids/Odds/AFA/SAssaults
<br/>
<br/>
Well, this is another game I'd rather not have happened, as Spencer and
<br/>
I already playtested the matchup last night.  Anyway, I know exactly
<br/>
what's in his deck, and he knows exactly what's in mine, but it turns
<br/>
out that's a lot better for me than him.  I get Vader out at the Cloud
<br/>
City docking bay, flip Hunt Down, and start draining.  He gets 8D8
<br/>
down.  At this point, he's playing ICBW many, many times so I draw and
<br/>
get my Hell To Pay.  I deploy Snugglebear and DS-61-2 at the Endor
<br/>
Docking Bay, giving me a total of 6 for Odds.  I deploy Search And
<br/>
Destroy, which basically works like another Visage against people who
<br/>
don't occupy battleground sites.  He gets out Battle Plan and Wars Not
<br/>
Make One Great, and inserts AFA and Odds, even though he's losing at
<br/>
Odds at the moment.  He cancels Visage with Transmission Terminated.  I
<br/>
use Masterful Move to grab another one and deploy it.  I activate a lot
<br/>
hoping his Odds come up but they don't.  I Grab his ICBW, he deploys
<br/>
more droids so he's actually winning at Odds.  Anyway, things go on, he
<br/>
Blue Milks me a lot so I have to activate, I make him lose Force for
<br/>
Visage and S+D.  Odds pops once, I Torture it.  AFA pops a few times, I
<br/>
lose my Force.  And he, of course, deploys more.  At one point, I have
<br/>
19 cards in my hand (I also know he's not playing Grim), he plays Recoil
<br/>
In Fear, shuffles my I draw a new hand out of the about 40 Force I have
<br/>
left, and nothing pops. :-)  He cancels Visage again, I deploy it
<br/>
again.  In the end, I'm dealing 4 damage to him every turn even if I
<br/>
don't drain, he loses vital cards for his We're Doomed combo, and I end
<br/>
up winning by 36.  FW+36, 2(+11)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Losing my 3rd game in a row would have been excruciatingly
<br/>
bad.
<br/>
Lowlights: I had to play Spencer, when we came together and we knew each
<br/>
other's decks.
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Light vs. Greg Hodur's [1619] ISB Operations
<br/>
<br/>
I've actually played my MWYHL Mains deck vs. Greg Hodur's ISB deck
<br/>
before at the last tourney I was at, and I ended up losing by 1.  I'd
<br/>
consider my deck to be better now than it was then, so I think I have a
<br/>
good chance at this.  He drops some Endor sites, I'm drawing some
<br/>
looking for a suitable apprentice.  He Monnok Losts me, I lose a couple
<br/>
EPP Lukes, and a couple Shocks (nowhere to Shock yet), I'd prefer not to
<br/>
see the Lukes, but stuff happens.  I get Orrimaarko I think through the
<br/>
tests, and he deploys a bunch of stuff at Kiffex.  I deploy a Bacta
<br/>
Tank, then Redemption with Han, Leia, and Chewie at Kiffex and battle. 
<br/>
My destiny is 1,1,1, ugh, worst possible destiny draws.  Leia goes to
<br/>
the Bacta Tank, but Redemption think its buff and stays at Kiffex.  His
<br/>
turn, he deploys Lateral Damage on Dagobah, I inform him that you can't
<br/>
deploy Utinni Effects on Dagobah so he deploys it on Coruscant instead. 
<br/>
He drops at bunch of stuff at Kiffex, battles me, and I lose everything
<br/>
+11.  I deploy Obi and Tawss Khaa at one of the Endor sites, he deploys
<br/>
U-3P0 there.  He deploys Endor, I deploy the Tantive there with a pilot,
<br/>
he deploys the Avenger there with a pilot, I prove more mighty because
<br/>
of my high destiny and my Bacta.  Anyway, I got Leia back, deployed her
<br/>
at the other Endor site, and moved Tawss over.  He deploys 5D6-RA-7 so I
<br/>
can only drain for one there.  Meanwhile, he's deployed the Defense
<br/>
Perimeter and dropped some guys there.  I'm draining for a very little
<br/>
bit, he's draining at Kiffex and the Defense Perimeter, I lose by 26. 
<br/>
FL-26, 2(-15)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Again, I'm drawing a blank...
<br/>
Lowlights: I crashed, and I crashed hard.  At this point, I was
<br/>
beginning to doubt my chances at going 3-3... :-(
<br/>
<br/>
Game 4: My Light vs. Chris Ruddy's [1521] CC Sabacc/Dark Deal/Occupation
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know or know of Chris before, so I wasn't quite sure what to
<br/>
expect.  He starts Cloud City and Combat Readinesses for some exterior
<br/>
CC site, I start Battle Plan thinking he's going for big drains.  I get
<br/>
my tests off fairly fast, and he deploys 2 more exterior CC sites and
<br/>
some guys to one of them with POTF.  I deploy EPP Luke, EPP Leia, and
<br/>
Harc Seff to that site, and beat his guys up, losing Harc.  He gets a
<br/>
couple Obsidian Squad TIEs to Cloud City.  I'm fairly happy draining for
<br/>
3 at the CC site.  He deploys EPP Vader there, misses Leia, Luke hits
<br/>
him, and I lose Leia to attrition.  I deploy Obi's Hut with Ben there,
<br/>
Nabrun Ben in to Luke's site, then deploy his Lightsaber.  He deploys
<br/>
Bespin, and some stuff at the Downtown Plaza, two sites away.  I deploy
<br/>
Han and Chewie there and beat up all his stuff, and Chewie goes to the
<br/>
Bacta Tank.  I move everyone over to the central site.  He deploys more
<br/>
guys at the site with the POTF.  I deploy Chewie at the Downtown Plaza,
<br/>
and deploy a Swoop (Swoops on Cloud City, gotta love exterior sites).
<br/>
:-)  Han joins Chewie, and Ben with Saber and EPP Luke hop on the Swoop
<br/>
and go over to the site with POTF.  His guys run away, the Swoop follows
<br/>
them.  I don't bother SATMing any of his guys, cause he has 3 guys with
<br/>
3 ability each, so I can't get rid of his destiny draw.  I battle, he
<br/>
loses a lot, Ben revives Luke.  At Bespin, I deploy the Tantive and the
<br/>
Spiral, he responds with some Dreads and pilots.  I use Yoda to avoid
<br/>
having to lose either, and put some fodder aboard.  I'm killing Dreads
<br/>
to attrition, but he deploys the Executor.  It turns out I still have
<br/>
enough power (including destiny) to withstand, so that's pretty much
<br/>
stalemated.  I drain him out at his sites and win by 20.  FW+20, 4(+5)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: I beat up lots of stuff. :-)
<br/>
Lowlights: There was no CC Occupation, Dark Deal, or CC Sabacc played,
<br/>
even though that seemed to be the theme of his deck...
<br/>
<br/>
Game 6: My Dark vs. Jamie Beck's [1491] Tatooine (?) Deck
<br/>
<br/>
Jamie was another unknown to me, and he was 3-2 so far for the day, so I
<br/>
was somewhat cautious.  He started Jabba's Palace and Careful
<br/>
Planning'ed for for the Audience Chamber.  He then proceeded to deploy
<br/>
lots and lots of Tatooine sites, I had no clue what he was going to do
<br/>
with that many Tatooine sites.  Anyway, I drop Vader and Tarkin at
<br/>
Jabba's Palace, and flip, noting he has no Force saved for Clashing and
<br/>
beating down Tarkin.  He does nothing but draw, I Monnok Used him.  I
<br/>
deploy Tempest 1 for Tarkin to hide on.  Again, he does nothing but
<br/>
draw, so I Monnok Used him again.  I get out Vader's Lightsaber, he
<br/>
Terminates my Visage, but I have another in my hand.  He drops EPP Obi,
<br/>
Chewbacca, and Farmboy down at the Audience Chamber.  I drain him for 3
<br/>
at Jabba's Palace, he drops Imperial Atrocity on me, I don't care.  I'm
<br/>
still somewhat cautious, so I throw my Visage and 2 5-destiny things to
<br/>
the Reactor Terminal.  I activate all but the 3 cards I Terminaled.  I
<br/>
deploy EPP Fett to give Tarkin some company, and Vader marches into the
<br/>
Audience Chamber.  Epic Circle on Obi, I play Focused Attack, and draw
<br/>
5,7,5.  He draws something less than that and loses Obi and 9.  During
<br/>
his activate phase, I Epic Obsession Farmboy too, draw my 5 and 7 again,
<br/>
Farmboy crosses and he loses 4.  He's left with Chewie there with no
<br/>
place to run, either face Father and Son in the AC or move outside and
<br/>
get beat upon by EPP Fett and Tarkin on Tempest 1.  He opts to stick
<br/>
around, I put my entire hand into the Terminal.  I battle Chewie, chop
<br/>
him with the Saber, and he loses like all but 1 Force, which he draws up
<br/>
on his turn, and I win by 39 (!).  FW+39, 6(+44)
<br/>
<br/>
Highlights: Dueling, dueling, dueling... :-)
<br/>
Lowlights: I still don't know what the point of his deck is...
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I finished out 10th, the highest amongst the 3-3 players, which
<br/>
wasn't too bad.  Chris Terwilliger got first, edging out Jon Schultz on
<br/>
differential.  As for teams, my team (which Bart later renamed 'Team
<br/>
Spanky-Monkey' or something :-)) finished in 4th out of the 6 teams. 
<br/>
Team Twigg, consisting of 3 Terwilligers and a Talbot, was the best
<br/>
team, and Team Britney, consisting of Syracuse's finest, placed second. 
<br/>
Anyway, Ted had awesome prize support, at least 4 packs for every player
<br/>
(and admission was only $5), I pulled a WB Han, which is nice I
<br/>
suppose.  Now I've got to figure out if my decks are worthy for D-con or
<br/>
not.  Dark did pretty good, winning 2 games with huge differential, and
<br/>
losing once against Woj by 4.  Light, on other other hand, did rather
<br/>
stinkily, mainly because there was too much space.  Anyway, I'm sure
<br/>
you're tired of hearing my rambling now, so until next time...
