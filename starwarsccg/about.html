                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Customizable Card Game is unlike any game you've ever experienced before! In a normal card game, both players play with the same deck of cards. In the Star Wars Customizable Card Game (Star Wars CCG) players have a universe of over 1000 cards to choose from and each player builds their own play deck from a selection of these cards. </font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cards are sold in decks and booster packs and new expansions are released frequently. You can 'customize' your deck by adding or removing cards between games to 'tweak' it into the ultimate winning machine! </font></p>

You would select your 16 pieces in secret, and so would your opponent. Sitting opposite him, surveying the board, you would make your attacks based on the pieces you selected, and form your defenses based on the pieces your opponent selected. Of course, you'd have to change your strategy and pieces from time to time, otherwise your opponent would always know what's coming and he could prepare for it by selecting different pieces! It would never get boring, that's for sure! </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The cards themselves are spectacular. The images have been pulled straight from the Star Wars film trilogy and have been retouched and refined by our art department, and printed on the highest-quality cardstock available. Also, most cards have 'lore' explaining the character or situation. Even characters only glimpsed for a few seconds have lore officially approved by Lucasfilm Ltd. </font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>How do you play?</b> <br>
            In Star Wars CCG, you can take on the role of either the Rebellion or the Empire, and try to deplete your opponent's 'Life Force' by battling him on the ground and in space. Stormtroopers, X-Wings, aliens, droids, and the Death Star itself are under your control as you learn and master the Force and free the Galaxy from Imperial Tyranny -- or as you try to put an end to this 'insignificant rebellion!' </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            You'll never run out of new ideas or new ways to play. The possibilities and strategies for Star Wars CCG are infinite! <br>

That's why it is so helpful to have a "step by step" insight on gameplay. </font> </p>

          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>This sounds complex... </b><br>
            To be honest - it is! This isn't 'Go Fish,' and it takes some time to learn thoroughly. But once you do, the rewards are great! After all, you don't play 'Go Fish' anymore, do you? You will be playing with all your favorite characters and places from the greatest science-fiction films ever made, putting them in impossible situations (and getting them out of them) time after time. 
            </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            The games really do play like a movie! </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            You can make the game as difficult as you want. Can't understand a rule? Play a different strategy! Find the Interrupt cards confusing? Play without them for a few games! It's your game, and you can play it any way you want to. </font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cool! I want some!</b> <br>
            You can buy Star Wars Customizable Card Game at hobby, gaming, card stores, and bookstores around the country. The cards sell in 60-card 'starter' decks and 15-card 'expansion packs.' </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
            Decipher will produce new 'expansion sets' for the game every few months. Star Wars CCG Premiere Edition was launched in December of 1995 and the first expansion, entitled A New Hope, was released in July of 1996. Hoth was released in November of 1996. Be on the lookout for these and upcoming expansions, or contact us for more information!
