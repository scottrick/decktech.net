Expect new play experiences whether you mix with cards of earlier sets or construct 
Endor-only decks. The standalone set's cards are designed for battle, focusing 
on the struggle in and around the Imperial control bunker on the forest moon itself. 
In fact, almost all Endor sites are battlegrounds. </p>
<p>The killer speed and maneuverability of AT-STs and speeder bikes is translated 
into gameplay. Endor's designers have designed ways to help the low-ability unique 
Imperials and Rebels. Scouts win big. Older scouts get a lot of help from Endor. 
And yes, there are Ewoks. </p>
