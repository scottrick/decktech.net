<em>"Imagine playing a game of chess where each player could select from 1000 pieces, each of which moved differently. You would select your 16 pieces in secret, and so would your opponent. Sitting opposite him, surveying the board, you would make your attacks based on the pieces you selected, and form your defenses based on the pieces your opponent selected."</em> <strong>- Decipher</strong>
